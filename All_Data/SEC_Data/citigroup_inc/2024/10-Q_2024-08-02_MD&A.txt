AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Second Quarter of 2024—Results Demonstrated Improved 
Business Performance and Citi’s Continued Focus on 
Executing Its Strategy
As described further throughout this Executive Summary, 
during the second quarter of 2024:

•

•

•

•

•

Citi’s revenues increased 4% versus the prior-year period 
on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts 
of $33 million, revenues increased 3%, driven by growth 
across all reportable operating segments, including an 
approximate $400 million episodic gain related to the 
Visa B exchange completed in the current quarter. A 
significant portion of this gain was reflected in Markets, 
with the remainder in All Other (managed basis). The 
revenue growth across the reportable operating segments 
was partially offset by a decline in All Other (managed 
basis).
Citi’s expenses decreased 2% versus the prior-year 
period. Excluding divestiture-related impacts in both the 
current quarter and the prior-year period, expenses also 
decreased 2%. The decrease was driven by savings 
associated with Citi’s organizational simplification, 
stranded cost reductions and lower repositioning costs, 
partially offset by continued investment in Citi’s 
transformation and the accrual for the civil money 
penalties imposed by the Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System (FRB) and the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) (Civil Money 
Penalties). (See “Citi’s Multiyear Transformation” 
below.)
Citi’s cost of credit was approximately $2.5 billion versus 
$1.8 billion in the prior-year period. The increase was 
primarily driven by higher cards net credit losses in 
Branded Cards and Retail Services in U.S. Personal 
Banking (USPB), partially offset by allowance for credit 
losses (ACL) releases in all businesses except USPB and 
All Other. The higher cards net credit losses primarily 
reflected the maturation of multiple cards loan vintages 
originated in recent years, including those with delayed 
losses due to unprecedented levels of government 
stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase 
was due to macroeconomic pressures related to the 
continued higher inflationary and interest rate 
environment impacting both cards portfolios, with lower 
FICO band customers primarily driving the increase.
Citi returned $1.0 billion to common shareholders in the 
form of dividends.
Citigroup’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio 
under the Basel III Standardized Approach increased to 
13.6% as of June 30, 2024, compared to 13.4% as of June 
30, 2023 (see “Capital Resources” below). This compares 
to Citigroup’s required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 
12.3% under the Basel III Standardized Approach. On 
October 1, 2024, Citigroup’s required regulatory CET1 
Capital ratio is expected to decrease to 12.1% from 12.3% 

•

•

under the Standardized Approach, reflecting the decrease 
in the indicative Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) requirement 
to 4.1% from 4.3% (see “Capital Resources—Stress 
Capital Buffer” below).
As previously disclosed, on July 10, 2024, the FRB 
entered into a Civil Money Penalty Consent Order with 
Citigroup in the amount of approximately $61 million, 
and the OCC entered into a Civil Money Penalty Consent 
Order with Citibank, N.A. (Citibank), a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Citigroup, in the amount of $75 million 
(collectively, the 2024 Consent Orders). The OCC and 
Citibank also entered into an Amendment (the 
Amendment) to the October 7, 2020 OCC Consent Order. 
The Amendment requires Citibank to submit a Resource 
Review Plan to the OCC within 30 days and establishes 
certain provisions governing payment of intercompany 
dividends from Citibank ultimately to Citigroup. Copies 
of the 2024 Consent Orders and the Amendment were 
included as exhibits to Citi’s Current Report on Form 8-K 
filed with the SEC on July 10, 2024 (the July 10, 2024 
Form 8-K). For additional information regarding the 2024 
Consent Orders and the Amendment, see the July 10, 
2024 Form 8-K and “Citi’s Multiyear Transformation” 
below.
In July 2024, Citi completed the sale and migration of its 
China consumer portfolios, finalizing Citi’s previously 
announced exit of its consumer banking business in 
China. Citi also continued to make progress with the 
wind-downs of the Korea consumer banking business and 
the Russia consumer, local commercial and institutional 
businesses, as well as the separation of Citi’s consumer 
banking and small business and middle-market banking 
operations in Mexico in preparation for a planned initial 
public offering.

Second Quarter of 2024 Results Summary

Citigroup
Citigroup reported net income of $3.2 billion, or $1.52 per 
share, compared to net income of $2.9 billion, or $1.33 per 
share in the prior-year period. Net income increased 10% 
versus the prior-year period, as the higher revenues and the 
lower expenses more than offset the higher cost of credit. 
Citigroup’s effective tax rate in the current quarter was 
approximately 24%, compared to 27% in the prior-year period, 
reflecting the impact of the geographic mix of earnings and the 
effects of state tax law changes in the current quarter. Average 
diluted shares outstanding decreased 1%. 

Citigroup revenues of $20.1 billion increased 4% versus 

the prior-year period, on a reported basis. Excluding the 
divestiture-related impacts in both periods, revenues of $20.1 
billion increased 3%, driven by growth across all reportable 
operating segments, including the approximate $400 million 
episodic gain related to the Visa B exchange completed in the 
current quarter. The revenue growth across the reportable 
operating segments was partially offset by a decline in All 

4                                                                                                                                                                                                       

Other (managed basis). (For additional information on the 
divestiture-related impacts, see “All Other—Divestiture-
Related Impacts (Reconciling Items)” below.) (As used 
throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi’s results of operations and 
financial condition excluding divestiture-related impacts are 
non-GAAP financial measures.) 

Services revenues were driven by higher revenues in 

Securities Services as well as the impact of continued 
underlying momentum in Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS), 
partially offset by lower revenue from the net investment in 
Argentina. Markets revenues were driven by strength in 
Equity Markets, which included the episodic gain related to 
the Visa B exchange completed in the current quarter, while 
Banking revenues largely reflected growth in Investment 
Banking. USPB revenues benefited from loan growth in cards, 
as well as lower partner payments, and Wealth revenues were 
primarily driven by higher investment fee revenue.

Citigroup’s end-of-period loans were $688 billion, up 4% 
versus the prior-year period, largely reflecting loan growth in 
cards in USPB and higher loans in Markets and Services. 

Citigroup’s end-of-period deposits were approximately 
$1.3 trillion, down 3% versus the prior-year period, largely 
due to a decline in TTS in Services, primarily reflecting 
quantitative tightening. For additional information about Citi’s 
deposits by business, including drivers and deposit trends, see 
each applicable business’s results of operations and “Liquidity 
Risk—Deposits” below.

Expenses
Citigroup’s operating expenses of $13.4 billion decreased 2% 
from the prior-year period. Expenses in the second quarter of 
2024 included divestiture-related impacts of $85 million 
(compared to $79 million in the prior-year period). Excluding 
divestiture-related impacts in both periods and an incremental 
FDIC special assessment of $34 million, expenses also 
decreased 2%, driven by savings associated with Citi’s 
organizational simplification, stranded cost reductions and 
lower repositioning costs, partially offset by continued 
investment in the transformation and the $136 million of Civil 
Money Penalties. (As used throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi’s 
results of operations and financial condition excluding 
divestiture-related impacts and the incremental FDIC special 
assessment are non-GAAP financial measures.)

Cost of Credit
Citi’s total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and 
claims was a cost of $2.5 billion, compared to a cost of $1.8 
billion in the prior-year period. The increase was primarily 
driven by higher net credit losses in Branded Cards and Retail 
Services in USPB, partially offset by ACL releases in all 
businesses except USPB and All Other. The higher cards net 
credit losses primarily reflected maturation of multiple cards 
loan vintages originated in recent years, including those with 
delayed losses due to unprecedented levels of government 
stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was 
due to macroeconomic pressures related to the continued 
higher inflationary and interest rate environment impacting 
both cards portfolios, with lower FICO band customers 
primarily driving the increase.

For additional information on Citi’s ACL, see 

“Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—
Citi’s Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)” below. 

Net credit losses of $2.3 billion increased 52% from the 
prior-year period. Consumer net credit losses of $2.2 billion 
increased 52%, largely reflecting the rise in cards net credit 
loss rates. Corporate net credit losses increased to $108 
million from $75 million.

For additional information on Citi’s consumer and 

corporate credit costs, see each respective business’s results of 
operations and “Credit Risk” below.

Capital
Citigroup’s CET1 Capital ratio was 13.6% as of June 30, 
2024, compared to 13.4% as of June 30, 2023, based on the 
Basel III Standardized Approach for determining risk-
weighted assets (RWA). The increase was primarily driven by 
the net income, a decrease in RWA, interest rate impacts on 
Citigroup’s investment portfolio and impacts from the sales of 
certain Asia consumer banking (Asia Consumer) businesses, 
partially offset by the payment of common and preferred 
dividends, and share repurchases, as well as higher disallowed 
deferred tax assets.

In the second quarter of 2024, Citi paid $1.0 billion of 

common dividends (see “Unregistered Sales of Equity 
Securities, Repurchases of Equity Securities and Dividends” 
below). As previously announced, Citi currently expects to 
repurchase approximately $1.0 billion of common shares 
during the third quarter of 2024. In future periods, Citi will 
continue to assess common share repurchases on a quarter-by-
quarter basis given uncertainty regarding regulatory capital 
requirements. For additional information on capital-related 
risks, trends and uncertainties, see “Capital Resources—
Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments” below and 
“Risk Factors—Strategic Risks,” “—Operational Risks” and 
“—Compliance Risks” in Citi’s 2023 Form 10-K.

Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio as of June 30, 
2024 was 5.9%, compared to 6.0% as of June 30, 2023. The 
decrease was driven by a decrease in Tier 1 Capital and an 
increase in Total Leverage Exposure. For additional 
information on Citi’s capital ratios and related components, 
see “Capital Resources” below.

Services
Services net income of $1.5 billion increased 21% from the 
prior-year period, driven by lower cost of credit and higher 
revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. Services 
expenses of $2.7 billion increased 9%, largely driven by an 
Argentina-related transaction tax expense, a legal settlement 
expense and continued investments in product innovation and 
technology. Cost of credit was a benefit of $27 million, 
compared to a cost of $223 million in the prior-year period. 
The current-quarter ACL release was primarily due to an 
improved macroeconomic outlook.

Services revenues of $4.7 billion increased 3%, primarily 
reflecting higher revenues in Securities Services, as well as the 
impact of continued underlying momentum in TTS. The 
increase in revenues was partially offset by lower net interest 
income from the net investment in Argentina. Net interest 
income decreased 1%, largely driven by lower revenue from 

5                                                                                                                                                                                                       

the net investment in Argentina, partially offset by the benefit 
of higher U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates. Non-interest 
revenue increased 11%, on continued strength across 
underlying fee drivers, as well as a smaller impact from 
currency devaluation in Argentina.

TTS revenues of $3.4 billion were largely unchanged 

versus the prior-year period. TTS non-interest revenue 
increased 14%, primarily driven by continued growth in 
underlying drivers, including increases in cross-border 
transaction value, U.S. dollar clearing volumes and 
commercial card spend volume. The increase in non-interest 
revenue was offset by a 3% decline in net interest income, 
driven by lower revenue from the net investment in Argentina, 
partially offset by the benefit of higher U.S. and non-U.S. 
interest rates relative to the prior-year period.

Securities Services revenues of $1.2 billion increased 
10%, largely driven by a 14% increase in net interest income, 
primarily driven by higher deposit spreads, and a 7% increase 
in non-interest revenue. The increase in non-interest revenue 
was primarily driven by fee growth due to higher assets under 
custody and administration (AUC/AUA) balances, which 
benefited from new client onboarding, deepening relationships 
with existing clients and higher market valuations.

For additional information about Citi’s exposure in 

Argentina, see “Managing Global Risk—Other Risk—Country 
Risk—Argentina” below. For additional information on the 
results of operations of Services in the second quarter of 2024, 
see “Services” below.

Markets
Markets net income of $1.4 billion increased 29% from the 
prior-year period, driven by higher revenues and lower 
expenses. Markets expenses of $3.3 billion decreased 1%, 
driven by productivity savings, partially offset by higher 
volume-related expenses. Cost of credit was a benefit of $11 
million versus a benefit of $17 million in the prior-year period. 
The current-quarter ACL release was primarily driven by 
changes in portfolio composition combined with an improved 
macroeconomic outlook, which was partially offset by higher 
net credit losses.

Markets revenues of $5.1 billion increased 6%, driven by 

growth in Equity Markets, up 37%, partially offset by a 3% 
decline in Fixed Income Markets. The decline in Fixed Income 
Markets was largely driven by rates and currencies, down 
11%, on lower volatility and tighter spreads, partially offset by 
strength in spread products and other fixed income, primarily 
driven by continued loan growth and higher securitization and 
underwriting fees. Equity Markets benefited from growth 
across equity derivatives, which included the episodic gain 
related to the Visa B exchange completed in the current 
quarter. Momentum continued in prime balances.

For additional information on the results of operations of 
Markets in the second quarter of 2024, see “Markets” below.

Banking
Banking net income was $406 million, compared to net 
income of $50 million in the prior-year period, driven by 
higher revenues and lower expenses, partially offset by a 
lower benefit from cost of credit. Banking expenses of $1.1 
billion decreased 10%, primarily driven by benefits from 
repositioning actions and other actions to lower the expense 
base. Cost of credit was a benefit of $32 million, versus a 
benefit of $148 million in the prior-year period. The net ACL 
release in the current quarter was primarily driven by an 
improved macroeconomic outlook.

Banking revenues of $1.6 billion increased 38%, driven 
by growth in Investment Banking and Corporate Lending, as 
well as a gain on loan hedges ($9 million gain versus $66 
million loss in the prior-year period). Investment Banking 
revenues increased 60%, driven by the Debt Capital Markets 
(DCM) and Equity Capital Markets (ECM) businesses as well 
as Advisory, each reflecting an increased wallet and wallet 
share gains. Corporate Lending revenues increased 20%, 
including the impact of the gain (loss) on loan hedges. 
Excluding the gain (loss) on loan hedges, Corporate Lending 
revenues increased 7%, largely driven by higher revenue 
share. (As used throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi’s results of 
operations and financial condition excluding the impact of the 
gains (losses) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial 
measures.) 

For additional information on the results of operations of 
Banking in the second quarter of 2024, see “Banking” below.

U.S. Personal Banking
USPB net income of $121 million decreased 74% from the 
prior-year period, driven by higher cost of credit, partially 
offset by higher revenues and lower expenses. USPB expenses 
of $2.4 billion decreased 2%, reflecting lower technology and 
compensation costs, partially offset by higher volume-related 
expenses. Cost of credit increased to $2.3 billion, compared to 
$1.5 billion in the prior-year period, driven by higher net 
credit losses and a higher net ACL build for loans. Net credit 
losses increased 59%, primarily reflecting the maturation of 
multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years, 
including those with delayed losses due to unprecedented 
levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In 
addition, the increase was due to macroeconomic pressures 
related to the continued higher inflationary and interest rate 
environment impacting both cards portfolios, with lower FICO 
band customers primarily driving the increase. The ACL build 
of $382 million reflected cards loan growth.

USPB revenues of $4.9 billion increased 6%, driven by a 

5% increase in net interest income due to loan growth in cards, 
and higher non-interest revenue due to lower partner 
payments. Branded Cards revenues of $2.5 billion increased 
8%, primarily driven by interest-earning balance growth of 
9%, as payment rates continued to moderate, and card spend 
volume growth. Retail Services revenues of $1.7 billion 
increased 6%, primarily driven by the lower partner payments 
due to higher net credit losses, as well as higher net interest 
income on higher interest-earning loan balances. Retail 
Banking revenues of $636 million increased 3%, driven by 
higher deposit spreads, as well as mortgage and installment 

6                                                                                                                                                                                                       

Macroeconomic and Other Risks and Uncertainties
Various geopolitical, macroeconomic and regulatory 
challenges and uncertainties continue to impact economic 
conditions in the U.S. and globally, including, among others, 
central bank interest rates policies, continued elevated 
inflation, and economic and geopolitical challenges related to 
the Russia–Ukraine war, conflicts in the Middle East, and 
China. These and other factors have negatively impacted 
global economic growth rates and consumer sentiment and 
could result in a recession in various regions and countries 
globally. In addition, these and other factors, including 
upcoming elections in the U.S., could adversely affect Citi’s 
customers, clients, businesses, funding costs, cost of credit and 
overall results of operations and financial condition during the 
remainder of 2024. 

For a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and risks 

that will or could impact Citi’s businesses, results of 
operations, capital and other financial condition during the 
remainder of 2024, see “Second Quarter of 2024 Results 
Summary” above and each respective business’s results of 
operations, “Managing Global Risk,” including “Managing 
Global Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—Russia” and “—
Argentina,” and “Forward-Looking Statements” below and 
“Risk Factors” in Citi’s 2023 Form 10-K. 

loan growth, partially offset by the impact of the transfers of 
certain relationships and the associated deposits to Wealth.

For additional information on the results of operations of 

USPB in the second quarter of 2024, see “U.S. Personal 
Banking” below.

Wealth
Wealth net income was $210 million, versus $84 million in the 
prior-year period, reflecting higher revenues, lower expenses 
and lower cost of credit. Wealth expenses decreased 4% to 
$1.5 billion, primarily driven by benefits from prior 
repositioning and restructuring actions. Cost of credit was a 
benefit of $9 million, compared to a cost of $53 million in the 
prior-year period, as an ACL release reflecting an improved 
macroeconomic outlook was partially offset by higher net 
credit losses.

Wealth revenues of $1.8 billion increased 2%, driven by a 
13% increase in non-interest revenue, primarily due to higher 
investment fee revenues, partially offset by a 4% decrease in 
net interest income, largely due to higher mortgage funding 
costs.

For additional information on the results of operations of 

Wealth in the second quarter of 2024, see “Wealth” below.

All Other (Managed Basis)
All Other (managed basis) net loss was $402 million, 
compared to net income of $78 million in the prior-year 
period, driven by lower revenues, higher cost of credit and 
higher income tax expense, partially offset by lower expenses. 
All Other (managed basis) expenses of $2.1 billion decreased 
7%, primarily driven by lower expenses from the closed exits 
and wind-downs, partially offset by the Civil Money Penalties 
imposed by the FRB and the OCC. Cost of credit of $243 
million increased 22%, largely driven by an ACL build for 
other assets and higher net credit losses in the current quarter, 
compared to a release for other assets in the prior-year period. 
The increase in cost of credit was partially offset by the 
absence of an ACL build for loans in the prior-year period.

All Other (managed basis) revenues decreased 22% from 
the prior-year period, primarily driven by the closed exits and 
wind-downs and higher funding costs, partially offset by 
growth in Mexico as well as the benefit from the Visa B 
exchange. 

Legacy Franchises (managed basis) revenues were $1.7 
billion, a decline of 10% from the prior-year period, due to 
lower revenues in Asia Consumer (managed basis), reflecting 
the closed exits and wind-downs, and Legacy Holdings 
Assets, driven by higher funding costs. The decrease was 
partially offset by higher revenues across cards, SBMM and 
retail banking in Mexico Consumer/SBMM (managed basis).
Corporate/Other revenues decreased to $253 million, 
compared to $609 million in the prior-year period, driven by 
higher funding costs, partially offset by the benefit from the 
Visa B exchange.

For additional information on the results of operations of 
All Other (managed basis) in the second quarter of 2024, see 
“All Other—Divestiture-Related Impacts (Reconciling Items)” 
and “All Other (Managed Basis)” below.

CITI’S MULTIYEAR TRANSFORMATION

Overview 
As previously announced, Citi’s transformation, including the 
remediation of its consent orders with the FRB and OCC, is a 
multiyear endeavor that is not linear. Citi is modernizing and 
simplifying the Company in order to lead in a dynamic, 
competitive and digital world. Citi’s transformation is 
addressing decades of underinvestment in its infrastructure, 
going beyond remedying regulatory concerns to intentionally 
transform how the organization operates, and making 
investments that not only support current needs, but also 
benefit the Company over the long term. 

Transformation efforts of this scale involve significant 

complexities and uncertainties, including ongoing regulatory 
challenges and risks. As discussed in the “Executive 
Summary” above, on July 10, 2024, the FRB entered into a 
Civil Money Penalty Consent Order with Citigroup, and the 
OCC entered into a Civil Money Penalty Consent Order with 
Citibank (collectively, the 2024 Consent Orders). In addition, 
the OCC and Citibank entered into an Amendment (the 
Amendment) to the October 7, 2020 Consent Order. For 
additional information about the 2024 Consent Orders and the 
Amendment, see Citi’s July 10, 2024 Form 8-K and 
“Transformation Focus Areas and Status” and “FRB and OCC 
Consent Orders Compliance” below.

Citi’s transformation initiatives will take several years to 
complete, and, as previously disclosed, Citi may continue to 
experience significant challenges in satisfying the regulators’ 
expectations in both sufficiency and timing. The regulators 
may also identify additional risk and control issues that could 
result in further regulatory actions. For additional information 
about these regulatory risks, see “Risk Factors—Compliance 
Risks” in Citi’s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Notwithstanding the 2024 Consent Orders and the 
Amendment, the transformation’s target outcomes remain 
focused on changing Citi’s business and operating models 
such that they simultaneously (i) strengthen controls, enhance 
data quality, reduce risk and improve Citi’s regulatory 
compliance and its culture, and (ii) enhance Citi’s value to 
customers, clients and shareholders. 

Transformation Focus Areas and Status
Over the last several years, Citi has made key investments to 
modernize the Company’s infrastructure, simplify and 
automate manual processes, enhance data quality and 
governance, strengthen controls and reduce risk. In 2023, Citi 
incurred transformation-related expenses of $2.9 billion 
(compared to $2.8 billion in 2022), including significant 
investments in technology, additional hiring in data and risk 
and controls and contracting third-party consultants. Citi’s 
transformation initiatives will continue to entail significant 
investments during the remainder of 2024 and beyond.

Citi completed significant planning and foundational 
work for the transformation in 2021 and 2022. In 2023, Citi 
progressed its transformation efforts into implementation 
mode. Citi’s transformation initiatives in the near term (the 
remainder of 2024 through 2025) will continue to focus on (i) 
accelerating progress on automating regulatory processes and 

in remediating data, particularly related to regulatory 
reporting, and (ii) further strengthening stress testing and 
resolution and recovery capabilities.

Progress
Examples of Citi’s transformation progress to date include the 
following: 

Improved Risk Management
•

Built greater efficiency and scale in the risk management 
of Citi’s Global Spread Products business, with 99% of 
risk computations now occurring on cloud-based 
infrastructure 
Implemented automated controls representing more than 
80% of transaction volumes across the Markets business 
to avoid manual trade errors

Simplification

Notwithstanding Citi’s investments and remediation 
efforts, as set forth in the FRB’s 2024 Consent Order, the FRB 
found that, based on examinations conducted by the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York, Citigroup had ongoing 
deficiencies related to its data quality management program 
and inadequate measures for managing and controlling its data 
quality risks. In addition, as set forth in the OCC’s 2024 
Consent Order and the Amendment, the OCC deemed that 
Citibank had failed to make sufficient and sustainable progress 
toward achieving compliance with the OCC’s 2020 Consent 
Order. 

Organizational Simplification
During the first quarter of 2024, Citi completed its 
organizational simplification announced in September 2023. 
The result is a simpler management structure that aligns to and 
facilitates Citi’s strategy, while improving accountability and 
decision making. As of the fourth quarter of 2023, Citi’s new 
operating model included the elimination of the Institutional 
Clients Group, Personal Banking and Wealth Management 
and Legacy Franchises operating segments and resulted in the 
five current reportable operating segments—Services, 
Markets, Banking, U.S. Personal Banking and Wealth—and a 
new financial reporting structure. Activities not assigned to the 
reportable operating segments are included in All Other, 
including Legacy Franchises and Corporate/Other. Citi also

consolidated its regional structure from four to two regions, 
consisting of North America and International. Citi’s 
organizational simplification efforts will also assist in 
advancing the execution of the transformation. 

FRB and OCC Consent Orders Compliance
On July 10, 2024, the FRB entered into a Civil Money Penalty 
Consent Order with Citigroup in the amount of approximately 
$61 million, and the OCC entered into a Civil Money Penalty 
Consent Order with Citibank, a wholly owned subsidiary of 
Citigroup, in the amount of $75 million. The OCC and 
Citibank also entered into an Amendment to the October 7, 
2020 OCC Consent Order. The Amendment requires Citibank 
to formalize a process to determine whether sufficient 
resources are being appropriately allocated toward achieving 
timely and sustainable compliance with the OCC’s 2020 
Consent Order, including any requirements on which Citibank 
is not making sufficient and sustainable progress (such 
process, the Resource Review Plan). Citibank must submit a 
Resource Review Plan to the OCC within 30 days. While the 
Resource Review Plan is being finalized, Citibank will need to 
ensure that the OCC has no objection to payment of 
intercompany dividends from Citibank ultimately to Citigroup 
above the amounts necessary for Citigroup debt service, 
preferred dividends and other non-discretionary obligations. 
Copies of the 2024 Consent Orders and the Amendment were 
included as exhibits to Citi’s July 10, 2024 Form 8-K. For 
additional information regarding the 2024 Consent Orders and 
the Amendment, see the July 10, 2024 Form 8-K.

As discussed above, Citi’s transformation efforts include 

effective implementation of the October 7, 2020 FRB and 
OCC Consent Orders issued to Citigroup and Citibank, 
respectively. The 2020 Consent Orders require Citigroup and 
Citibank to implement extensive targeted action plans and 
submit quarterly progress reports on a timely and sufficient 
basis, detailing the results and status of improvements relating 
principally to various aspects of (i) enterprise-wide risk 
management, (ii) compliance risk management, (iii) data 
quality management and governance, and (iv) internal 
controls. Citi continues to work constructively with the FRB 
and OCC and provide additional information regarding its 
plans and progress to both regulators on an ongoing basis. Citi 
will continue to reflect their feedback in its project plans and 
execution efforts. For additional information about the 
requirements under the 2020 Consent Orders, see Citi’s 
Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 9, 
2020. 

Governance 
Citi has built an organization and infrastructure to manage, 
guide and support its transformation, which spans all 
businesses and functions to ensure consistency. Additionally, 
the Citigroup and Citibank Boards of Directors each formed a 
Transformation Oversight Committee, an ad hoc committee of 
each Board, to provide oversight of Citi’s efforts to improve 
its risk and control environment and management’s 
remediation efforts under the consent orders. 

While every member of Citi’s executive management 

team, or EMT, is involved in the transformation and plays a 

key, direct role in its implementation, Citi’s CEO has taken a 
leading role in managing the effort. As part of this effort, 
Citi’s CEO has assembled a team consisting of long-tenured 
colleagues and new hires from across various disciplines and 
areas of expertise and experience, along with representatives 
from each of Citi’s businesses and functions, to lead the 
various transformation programs. Citi is focusing the 
Company’s most senior talent on this effort and has a detailed, 
integrated approach to execute on the transformation. Citi’s 
Transformation Steering Committee, chaired by Citi’s CEO, 
sets the overall direction for the transformation and 
communicates progress to the Citigroup Board of Directors, as 
well as seeks input and feedback from the Board. 

In 2023, Citi appointed a new Chief Operating Officer, 
who reports to the CEO and is responsible for running Citi’s 
overall transformation efforts, as well as leading Citi’s efforts 
to improve operating efficiency and returns along with Citi’s 
enterprise-wide effort to strengthen its risk and controls and 
data quality, and modernize infrastructure, while simplifying 
the Company.

Transformation Bonus Program
In 2021, the Compensation, Performance Management and 
Culture Committee (the Compensation Committee) of 
Citigroup’s Board of Directors approved a long-term 
performance-based bonus program to incentivize effective 
execution in connection with the transformation and 
remediation of the consent orders and to drive change in Citi’s 
risk and control environment and culture (the Transformation 
Bonus Program, or the Program). There are currently 200 
senior employees who were deemed critical to the execution 
of the transformation and are therefore eligible for the 
Program.

Performance is measured, and the bonus, if any, payable 

pursuant to the Transformation Bonus Program is paid in three 
tranches, each representing a separate performance period. 
Well-defined goals and related metrics are established for each 
of the three tranches, which may reflect qualitative 
considerations, including regulatory actions. At the end of 
each year, the Compensation Committee determines the 
appropriate level of payout given the accomplishments for the 
performance period relative to the specific goals and related 
metrics. The maximum portion of the bonus payable for each 
tranche is 25% for the first tranche, 25% for the second 
tranche and 50% for the third tranche. 

Following the completion of the first performance 
measurement period under the Transformation Bonus 
Program, the Compensation Committee determined that the 
Performance Achievement Percentage for the period ending 
December 31, 2022 was 94%, reflecting the Compensation 
Committee’s assessment of performance relative to the 
predetermined targets set for that tranche under the Program. 
The targets established for the first performance period 
included Citi’s submission to the FRB and OCC of plans to 
remediate the issues addressed by the 2020 Consent Orders, 
and objectively measurable targets to assess performance on 
transformation milestones. The Compensation Committee 
recognized that management performed above 90% 
achievement relative to targets on each metric category during 

9                                                                                                                                                                                                       

the first performance period, with the exception of one (the 
percentage of milestones that were at risk for not being 
completed on time) for which Citi fell three percentage points 
short of target. 

Following the completion of the second performance 

measurement period under the Program, the Compensation 
Committee determined that the Performance Achievement 
Percentage for the period ending December 31, 2023 was 
80%. The criteria for the second performance measurement 
period were composed of two quantitative metrics: timely 
execution of the commitments scheduled to be completed, and 
execution quality, which is the percentage of those 
commitments deemed complete by Citi’s Internal Audit 
function. The third criterion for the second performance 
measurement period was a qualitative consideration of Citi’s 
cultural change, measured by its broad-based 2023 Voice of 
the Employee survey designed to measure cultural alignment 
with Citi’s Leadership Principles. 

The Compensation Committee has determined that the 

metric categories for the third tranche of the Program, 
covering the calendar year 2024 performance period, will be 
the same as the metric categories for the second tranche. The 
Compensation Committee has set specific objective targets 
with respect to performance metrics within those categories.

Program, see Citi’s 2024 Proxy Statement for Citigroup’s 
Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

SERVICES

Services includes Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS) and Securities Services. TTS provides an integrated suite of tailored cash 
management, trade and working capital solutions to multinational corporations, financial institutions and public sector organizations. 
Securities Services provides cross-border support for clients, including on-the-ground local market expertise, post-trade technologies, 
customized data solutions and a wide range of securities services solutions that can be tailored to meet clients’ needs.

Services revenue is generated primarily from spreads and fees associated with these activities. Services earns spread revenue 
through generating deposits, as well as interest on loans. Revenue generated from these activities is primarily recorded in Net interest 
income. Fee income is earned for assisting clients with transactional services and clearing. Revenue generated from these activities is 
recorded in Commissions and fees. Revenue is also generated from assets under custody and administration and is recognized when 
the associated service is satisfied, which normally occurs at the point in time the service is requested by the client and provided by 
Citi. Revenue generated from these activities is primarily recorded in Administration and other fiduciary fees. For additional 
information on these various types of revenues, see Note 5. Services revenues also include revenues earned by Citi that are subject to a 
revenue sharing arrangement with Banking—Corporate Lending for Investment Banking, Markets and Services products sold to 
Corporate Lending clients.

At June 30, 2024, Services had $569 billion in assets and $783 billion in deposits. Securities Services managed $24.2 trillion in 
assets under custody and administration, of which Citi provided both custody and administrative services to certain clients related to 
$2.0 trillion of such assets.

2Q24 vs. 2Q23
Net income of $1.5 billion increased 21%, driven by higher 
revenues and lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher 
expenses.

Revenues increased 3%, primarily reflecting higher 
revenues in Securities Services, as well as the impact of 
continued underlying momentum in TTS. The increase in 
revenues was partially offset by lower net interest income 
from the net investment in Argentina.

TTS revenues were largely unchanged, as a 14% increase 

in non-interest revenue was offset by a 3% decrease in net 
interest income. The increase in non-interest revenue was 
primarily driven by continued strength in underlying fee 
drivers, including an increase in cross-border transaction value 
of 6%, an increase in U.S. dollar clearing volume of 7% and 
an increase in commercial card spend volume of 4%. The 
increase in non-interest revenue was also driven by a smaller 
impact from currency devaluation in Argentina. The decrease 
in net interest income was driven by lower revenues from the 
net investment in Argentina, partially offset by the benefit of 
higher U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates relative to the prior-
year period. For additional information about Citi’s exposure 
in Argentina, see “Managing Global Risk—Other Risk—
Country Risk—Argentina” below.

Securities Services revenues increased 10%, largely 
driven by 14% growth in net interest income, primarily driven 

by higher deposit spreads, and 7% growth in non-interest 
revenue. The increase in non-interest revenue was primarily 
driven by fee growth due to 9% growth in AUC/AUA 
balances, benefiting from new client onboarding, deepening 
relationships with existing clients and higher market 
valuations.

Expenses were up 9%, largely driven by an Argentina-
related transaction tax expense, a legal settlement expense and 
continued investments in product innovation and technology. 
Provisions were a benefit of $27 million, compared to 
$223 million in the prior-year period. The current-quarter 
ACL release was largely due to an improved macroeconomic 
outlook. See “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant 
Estimates” below.

For additional information on Services’ corporate credit 

portfolio, see “Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk—
Corporate Credit” below.

For additional information on trends in Services’ deposits 
and loans, see “Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk—Loans” 
and “Managing Global Risk—Liquidity Risk—Deposits” 
below.

For additional information about trends, uncertainties and 

risks related to Services’ future results, see “Executive 
Summary” above and “Managing Global Risk—Other Risks
—Country Risk—Argentina” and “—Russia” below, and 
“Risk Factors” in Citi’s 2023 Form 10-K.

2Q24 YTD vs. 2Q23 YTD
Net income of $3.0 billion increased 18%, primarily driven by 
higher revenues and lower cost of credit, partially offset by 
higher expenses.

Revenues increased 6%, driven by higher revenues in both 

TTS and Securities Services, reflecting higher non-interest 
revenue and higher net interest income.

TTS revenues increased 3%, driven by a 12% increase in 

non-interest revenue, as net interest income was largely 
unchanged. The increase in non-interest revenue reflected 
continued growth in underlying fee drivers, including higher 
cross-border transaction value (up 7%), U.S. dollar clearing 
volume (up 5%) and commercial card spend volume (up 5%).
Securities Services revenues increased 14%, as net 

interest income grew 15% and non-interest revenue grew 14%. 
The increase in net interest income was driven by spread 
improvement from higher interest rates across currencies and 
deposit mix. The increase in non-interest revenue was driven 
by the same factors described above, as well as continued 
elevated levels of corporate activity in Issuer Services.

Expenses were up 10%, primarily driven by an Argentina-

related transaction tax expense, a legal settlement expense, 
continued investment in technology and other risk and controls 
and business-led investments.

Provisions were $37 million, compared to $209 million in 
the prior-year period, driven by the ACL release in the second 
quarter of 2024, primarily due to the improved 
macroeconomic outlook. 

18                                                                                                                                                                                                       

MARKETS

Markets provides corporate, institutional and public sector clients around the world with a full range of sales and trading services 
across equities, foreign exchange, rates, spread products and commodities. The range of services includes market-making across asset 
classes, risk management solutions, financing, prime brokerage, research, securities clearing and settlement.

As a market maker, Markets facilitates transactions, including holding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the 
differential between the price at which it buys and sells the products. These price differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on 
the inventory are recorded in Principal transactions. Other primarily includes realized gains and losses on available-for-sale (AFS) 
debt securities, gains and losses on equity securities not held in trading accounts and other non-recurring gains and losses. Interest 
income earned on assets held, less interest paid on long- and short-term debt, secured funding transactions and customer deposits, is 
recorded as Net interest income.

The amount and types of Markets revenues are impacted by a variety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity; changes in 

market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as well as their 
implied volatilities; investor confidence; and other macroeconomic conditions. Markets revenues include revenues earned by Citi that 
are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement with Banking—Corporate Lending for Investment Banking, Markets and Services 
products sold to Corporate Lending clients. 

Assuming all other market conditions do not change, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in 
increases in revenues. However, changes in market conditions can significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads and the 
fair value of product inventory. Management of the Markets businesses involves daily monitoring and evaluation of the above factors.
Markets’ international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 95 

countries and jurisdictions.

Investment banking fees are primarily composed of underwriting, advisory, loan syndication structuring and other related financing activity. 
Includes revenues earned by Citi that are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement with Banking—Corporate Lending for Investment Banking, Markets and 
Services products sold to Corporate Lending clients.

(3)  Citi assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items. For example, securities that generate Net 
interest income may be risk managed by derivatives that are recorded in Principal transactions revenue within Non-interest revenue. For a description of the 
composition of these revenue line items, see Notes 4, 5 and 6.

(4)  Management uses this information in reviewing the segment’s results and believes it is useful to investors concerning underlying segment performance and trends.
(5)  Excludes loans that are carried at fair value for all periods.

2Q24 vs. 2Q23
Net income of $1.4 billion increased 29%, driven by higher 
revenues and lower expenses.

Revenues increased 6%, driven by higher Equity Markets 

revenues, partially offset by lower Fixed Income Markets 
revenues.

Fixed Income Markets revenues decreased 3%, reflecting 

a decline in rates and currencies revenues, partially offset by 
higher revenues in spread products and other fixed income. 
Rates and currencies revenues decreased 11%, largely 
reflecting lower volatility as well as tighter spreads in 
currencies. Spread products and other fixed income revenues 
increased 20%, driven by spread products, primarily due to 
continued loan growth in asset-backed lending and higher 
securitization and underwriting fees. This increase was 
partially offset by a decline in commodities revenues. 

Equity Markets revenues increased 37%, driven by equity 

derivatives revenues, which included the impact from an 
episodic gain related to the Visa B exchange completed in the 
current quarter, as well as due to increased client financing 
activity. Equity Markets also continued to experience an 
increase in prime balances. 

Expenses decreased 1%, largely driven by productivity 
savings, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses. 
Provisions were a benefit of $11 million, compared to a 

benefit of $17 million in the prior-year period, driven by a net 
ACL release of $77 million, compared to a release of $19 
million in the prior-year period. The net ACL release in the 
current quarter was primarily driven by changes in portfolio 
composition combined with an improved macroeconomic 
outlook. For additional information on Citi’s ACL, see 
“Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” 
below.

portfolio, see “Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk—

2Q24 YTD vs. 2Q23 YTD
Net income of $2.9 billion decreased 4%, driven by higher 
expenses, lower revenues and higher cost of credit.

Revenues declined 1%, primarily driven by lower Fixed 
Income Markets revenues, partially offset by higher Equity 
Markets revenues.

Fixed Income Markets revenues decreased 7%, reflecting 

a decline in rates and currencies revenues, partially offset by 
higher revenues in spread products and other fixed income. 
Rates and currencies revenues decreased 17%, largely 
reflecting lower volatility and strong prior-year performance. 
Spread products and other fixed income revenues increased 
25%, largely driven by increased client activity, particularly in 
asset-backed lending and mortgages. The increase was 
partially offset by a decline in commodities revenues.

Equity Markets revenues increased 21%, driven by 
growth in cash trading, due to higher volumes and increased 
trading activity, as well as higher equity derivative revenues, 
which included the impact from the episodic gain related to 
the Visa B exchange. Equity Markets also continued to 
experience an increase in prime balances.

Expenses increased 3%, primarily driven by the absence 
of a legal reserve release in the prior-year period and higher 
volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity 
savings. 

Provisions were $188 million, compared to $67 million in 

the prior-year period, primarily driven by higher net credit 
losses.

Investment banking fees are primarily composed of underwriting, advisory, loan syndication structuring and other related financing activity.
Includes revenues earned by Citi that are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement with Investment Banking, Markets and Services products sold to Corporate 
Lending clients.

(3)  Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. Gain (loss) on 

loan hedges includes the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives, partially offset by the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. Hedges 
on accrual loans reflect the mark-to-market on credit derivatives used to economically hedge the corporate loan accrual portfolio. The fixed premium costs of 
these hedges are netted against the corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. Citigroup’s results of operations excluding the impact of gain 
(loss) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures. 

(4)  Management uses this information in reviewing the segment’s results and believes it is useful to investors concerning underlying segment performance and trends.
(5)  Excludes loans that are carried at fair value for all periods. 
NM  Not meaningful

The discussion of the results of operations for Banking below excludes (where noted) the impact of any gain (loss) on hedges of 
accrual loans, which are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table 
above.

2Q24 vs. 2Q23
Net income was $406 million, compared to net income of $50 
million in the prior-year period, driven by higher revenues and 
lower expenses, partially offset by a lower benefit from cost of 
credit. 

Revenues increased 38% (including gain (loss) on loan 

hedges), primarily reflecting higher Investment Banking 
revenues, driven by continued recovery of the global 
investment banking wallet and wallet share gains, as well as 
higher revenues in Corporate Lending and gains on loan 
hedges ($9 million gain versus $66 million loss in the prior-
year period). Excluding the impact of gain (loss) on loan 
hedges, Banking revenues increased 30%.

Investment Banking revenues increased 60%, driven by 

the DCM and ECM businesses as well as Advisory, reflecting 
the increased wallet and wallet share gains. DCM 
underwriting fees increased 90%, which continued to benefit 
from strong issuance activity, primarily in investment grade. 
ECM underwriting fees increased 10%, primarily driven by an 
increase in IPO activity and continued convertible issuance. 
Advisory fees increased 72%, driven by higher revenues from 
the relatively low announced mergers and acquisitions activity 
in 2023 coming to fruition as those transactions close.

Corporate Lending revenues increased 20%, including the 
impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges. Excluding the impact of 
gain (loss) on loan hedges, Corporate Lending revenues 
increased 7%, largely driven by higher revenue share.

Expenses decreased 10%, primarily driven by benefits 

from repositioning actions and other actions to lower the 
expense base.

Provisions reflected a benefit of $32 million, compared to 

a benefit of $148 million in the prior-year period. Net credit 
losses decreased to $40 million, compared to $57 million in 
the prior-year period. The net ACL release was $72 million, 
compared to a net release of $205 million in the prior-year 
period. The net ACL release in the current quarter was 
primarily driven by an improved macroeconomic outlook. For 
additional information on Citi’s ACL, see “Significant 
Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” below.

portfolio, see “Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk—

2Q24 YTD vs. 2Q23 YTD
Net income was $930 million, compared to net income of $105 
million in the prior-year period, driven by higher revenues and 
lower expenses, partially offset by a lower benefit from cost of 
credit. 

Revenues increased 42% (including losses on loan 

hedges), primarily reflecting higher Investment Banking 
revenues, driven by the same factors described above, as well 
as higher revenues in Corporate Lending and lower losses on 
loan hedges ($95 million loss versus $265 million loss in the 
prior-year period). Excluding the impact of losses on loan 
hedges, Banking revenues increased 32%.

Investment Banking revenues increased 44%, driven by 
the DCM and ECM businesses, as improved market sentiment 
led to an increase in issuance activity. DCM underwriting fees 
increased 73%, driven by the same factors described above. 
ECM underwriting fees increased 29%, driven by the same 
factors described above. Advisory fees increased 15%, driven 
by the same factors described above.

Corporate Lending revenues increased 40%, including the 

impact of losses on loan hedges. Excluding the impact of 
losses on loan hedges, Corporate Lending revenues increased 
20%, largely driven by higher revenue share.

Expenses decreased 7%, primarily driven by benefits from 

repositioning actions and other actions to lower the expense 
base.

Provisions reflected a benefit of $161 million, compared 

to $271 million in the prior-year period. Net credit losses 
increased to $106 million, compared to $69 million in the 
prior-year period. The net ACL release was $267 million, 
compared to $340 million in the prior-year period. The net 
ACL release in the current period was primarily driven by an 
improved macroeconomic outlook and changes in portfolio 
composition.

2Q24 vs. 2Q23 
Net income was $121 million, compared to $461 million in the 
prior-year period, driven by higher cost of credit, partially 
offset by higher revenues and lower expenses.

For additional information on USPB’s Branded Cards, 

Retail Services and Retail Banking loan portfolios, see 
“Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk—Consumer Credit” 
below.

Revenues increased 6%, due to higher net interest income 

For additional information about trends, uncertainties and 

risks related to USPB’s future results, see “Executive 
Summary” above and “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” in 
Citi’s 2023 Form 10-K.

2Q24 YTD vs. 2Q23 YTD
Year-to-date, USPB experienced similar trends to those 
described above. Net income was $468 million, compared to 
$863 million in the prior-year period, reflecting higher cost of 
credit, partially offset by higher revenues and lower expenses.
Revenues increased 8%, driven by the same factors 

described above. 

Cards revenues increased 9%. Branded Cards revenues 
increased 7%, driven by the same factors described above. 
Retail Services revenues increased 12%, driven by the 

same factors described above. 

Retail Banking revenues increased 2%, driven by the 

same factors described above. 

Expenses decreased 1%, driven by lower technology and 

compensation costs, partially offset by higher repositioning 
costs and volume-related expenses.

Provisions were $4.5 billion, compared to $3.2 billion in 

the prior-year period, largely driven by higher net credit 
losses, partially offset by a lower ACL build for loans. Net 
credit losses increased 66%, driven by the same factors 
described above. Branded Cards net credit losses of $2 billion 
increased 77% and Retail Services net credit losses of $1.6 
billion were up 57%.

The net ACL build was $0.7 billion, compared to $0.9 

billion in the prior-year period. The net ACL build in the 
current period primarily reflected the impact of 
macroeconomic pressures related to the higher inflationary 
and interest rate environment.

(up 5%), largely driven by loan growth in cards, as well as 
higher non-interest revenue (up 30%). The increase in non-
interest revenue was largely driven by lower partner payments 
in Retail Services, due to higher net credit losses.

Cards revenues increased 7%. Branded Cards revenues 
increased 8%, primarily driven by interest-earning balance 
growth (up 9%), as payment rates continued to moderate, and 
card spend volumes growth. Branded Cards average loans 
increased 10%, reflecting the higher card spend volumes and 
the lower card payment rates. Branded Cards card spend 
volume increased 3%, driven by more affluent customers. 

Retail Services revenues increased 6%, primarily driven 

by higher non-interest revenue due to the lower partner 
payments, driven by the higher net credit losses (see 
“Provisions” below and Note 5), as well as higher net interest 
income on higher interest-earning balances (up 8%). Retail 
Services average loans increased 4%, largely reflecting lower 
card payment rates, and card spend volumes decreased 4%, 
primarily due to continued lower in-store foot traffic.

Retail Banking revenues increased 3%, primarily driven 

by higher deposit spreads, as well as mortgage and installment 
loan growth, partially offset by the impact of the transfers of 
certain relationships and the associated deposit balances to 
Wealth. Average mortgage loans increased 14%, primarily 
driven by lower refinancings due to high interest rates and 
mortgage originations exceeding prepayments. Average 
deposits decreased 18%, largely reflecting the transfers of 
certain relationships and the associated deposits to Wealth 
($27 billion over the last 12 months). 

Expenses decreased 2%, driven by lower technology and 
compensation costs, partially offset by higher volume-related 
expenses.

Provisions were $2.3 billion, compared to $1.5 billion in 
the prior-year period, driven by higher net credit losses and a 
higher net ACL build for loans. Net credit losses increased 
59%, primarily reflecting the maturation of multiple cards loan 
vintages originated in recent years, including those with 
delayed losses due to unprecedented levels of government 
stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was 
due to macroeconomic pressures related to the continued 
higher inflationary and interest rate environment impacting 
both cards portfolios, with lower FICO band customers 
driving the increase. Branded Cards net credit losses were up 
69% to $1 billion and Retail Services net credit losses of $0.8 
billion were up 50%.

The net ACL build was $0.4 billion, compared to $0.3 

billion in the prior-year period. The net ACL build in the 
current quarter primarily reflected cards loan growth. For 
additional information on Citi’s ACL, see “Significant 
Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” below.

Includes assets under management, and trust and custody assets. 

2Q24 vs. 2Q23 
Net income was $210 million, compared to $84 million in the 
prior-year period, reflecting higher revenues, lower expenses 
and lower cost of credit.

Revenues increased 2%, driven by an increase in non-

interest revenue (up 13%), primarily reflecting higher 
investment fee revenues, driven by net new client investment 
asset flows and the benefit of higher market valuations, 
partially offset by a decrease in net interest income (down 
4%), largely driven by higher mortgage funding costs. 

Average loans were largely unchanged. Average deposits 

increased 2%, mainly due to the transfers of certain 
relationships and the associated deposits from USPB ($27 
billion over the last 12 months), partially offset by lower 
deposits in Private Bank and Wealth at Work and the 
continued transfers to higher-yielding investments on Citi’s 
platform.

Client balances increased 9%, primarily driven by the 
higher client investment assets as well as the higher deposits. 
Private Bank revenues increased 1%, driven by improved 

deposit spreads and the higher investment fee revenues, 
partially offset by the higher mortgage funding costs. 

Wealth at Work revenues decreased 13%, driven by lower 

deposit spreads and the higher mortgage funding costs, 
partially offset by the higher investment fee revenues. 

Citigold revenues increased 6%, driven by the higher 

investment fee revenues. 

Expenses decreased 4%, primarily driven by benefits from 

prior repositioning and restructuring actions.

Provisions were a benefit of $9 million, compared to a 
cost of $53 million in the prior-year period, as an ACL release 
more than offset higher net credit losses. 

The net ACL release was $43 million, compared to a 
build of $31 million in the prior-year period, reflecting an 
improvement in macroeconomic outlook. For additional 
information on Citi’s ACL, see “Significant Accounting 
Policies and Significant Estimates” below.

For additional information on Wealth’s loan portfolios, 
see “Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk—Consumer Credit” 
below.

For additional information about trends, uncertainties and 

risks related to Wealth’s future results, see “Executive 
Summary” above and “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” in 
Citi’s 2023 Form 10-K.

2Q24 YTD vs. 2Q23 YTD
Net income was $385 million, compared to $266 million in the 
prior-year period, primarily reflecting lower cost of credit.
Revenues decreased 1%, largely driven by lower net 
interest income (down 8%), mainly due to lower deposit 
spreads and higher mortgage funding costs, partially offset by 
an increase in non-interest revenue (up 12%), largely 
reflecting higher investment fee revenues.

Private Bank revenues increased 1% while Wealth at 
Work revenues decreased 10%, driven by the same factors 
described above. 

Citigold revenues increased 1%, driven by the higher 
investment fee revenues and higher deposit volumes, partially 
offset by lower deposit spreads.

Expenses were largely unchanged, as technology 
investments focused on risk and controls and platform 
enhancements were offset by benefits from repositioning and 
restructuring actions. 

Provisions were a benefit of $179 million, compared to a 

benefit of $5 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by 
a higher net ACL release. The higher net ACL release was 
primarily driven by a change in ACL associated with the 
margin lending portfolio.

ALL OTHER—Divestiture-Related Impacts (Reconciling Items)

All Other includes activities not assigned to the reportable operating segments (Services, Markets, Banking, USPB and Wealth), 
including Legacy Franchises and Corporate/Other. For additional information about Legacy Franchises and Corporate/Other, see “All 
Other (Managed Basis)” below.

All Other (managed basis) results exclude divestiture-related impacts (see the “Reconciling Items” column in the table below) 
related to (i) Citi’s divestitures of its Asia consumer banking businesses and (ii) the planned IPO of Mexico consumer banking and 
small business and middle-market banking, within Legacy Franchises. Legacy Franchises (managed basis) results also exclude these 
divestiture-related impacts. Certain of the results of operations of All Other (managed basis) and Legacy Franchises (managed basis) 
are non-GAAP financial measures (see “Overview—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” above).

The table below presents a reconciliation from All Other (U.S. GAAP) to All Other (managed basis). All Other (U.S. GAAP), less 

Reconciling Items, equals All Other (managed basis). The Reconciling Items are fully reflected on each respective line item in Citi’s 
Consolidated Statement of Income.

ALL OTHER—Managed Basis

At June 30, 2024, All Other (managed basis) had $197 billion in assets, primarily related to Mexico Consumer/SBMM and Asia 
Consumer reported within Legacy Franchises (managed basis), as well as Corporate Treasury investment securities and Citi’s deferred 
tax assets (DTAs) reported within Corporate/Other.

Legacy Franchises (Managed Basis)
Legacy Franchises (managed basis) includes (i) Mexico Consumer Banking (Mexico Consumer) and Mexico Small Business and 
Middle-Market Banking (Mexico SBMM), collectively Mexico Consumer/SBMM, (ii) Asia Consumer Banking (Asia Consumer), 
representing the consumer banking operations of the remaining three exit countries (Korea, Poland and Russia), and (iii) Legacy 
Holdings Assets, primarily legacy consumer mortgage loans in North America that Citi continues to wind down, including the U.K. 
retail banking business. 

Mexico Consumer/SBMM operates in Mexico through Citibanamex and provides traditional retail banking and branded card 
products to consumers and small business customers and traditional middle-market banking products and services to commercial 
customers. As previously disclosed, Citi intends to pursue an IPO of its consumer, small business and middle-market banking 
operations in Mexico. Citi will retain its Services, Markets, Banking and Wealth businesses in Mexico. Citi currently expects that the 
separation of the businesses will be completed in the second half of 2024 and that the IPO will take place in 2025.

Legacy Franchises (managed basis) also included the following five Asia Consumer businesses prior to their sales: India and 
Vietnam, until their closings in March 2023; Taiwan, until its closing in August 2023; Indonesia until its closing in November 2023; 
and China until July 2024 when Citi completed the sale and migration of its China consumer portfolios, finalizing the exit of its 
consumer banking business in the country. 

Citi has continued to make progress on its wind-downs in Korea and Russia. In addition, Citi has restarted the sales process of its 
consumer banking business in Poland. See Note 2 for additional information on Legacy Franchises’ consumer banking business sales 
and wind-downs. For additional information about Citi’s continued efforts to reduce its operations and exposures in Russia, see 
“Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—Russia” below and “Risk Factors” in Citi’s 2023 Form 10-K.

At June 30, 2024, on a combined basis, Legacy Franchises (managed basis) had 1,327 retail branches, $18 billion in retail banking 

loans and $48 billion in deposits. In addition, Legacy Franchises (managed basis) had $8 billion in outstanding credit card balances, 
while Mexico SBMM had $7 billion in outstanding corporate loans. 

Corporate/Other
Corporate/Other includes certain unallocated costs of global staff functions (including finance, risk, human resources, legal and 
compliance-related costs), other corporate expenses and unallocated global operations and technology expenses and income taxes, as 
well as results of Corporate Treasury investment activities and discontinued operations.

Note: Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior periods’ financial statements to conform to the current period’s presentation effective as of the second 

quarter of 2024, for all periods presented. During the second quarter of 2024, Citi made certain reclassifications to align with Citi’s transformation and strategy. In 
connection therewith, Citi transferred the retail banking business in the U.K., which is being wound down, from Wealth to Legacy Franchises (managed basis) 
within All Other (managed basis).

(1)  The key indicators for Asia Consumer reflect the reclassification of loans and deposits to Other assets and Other liabilities under HFS accounting on Citi’s 

Consolidated Balance Sheet.

2Q24 vs. 2Q23 
Net loss was $402 million, compared to net income of $78 
million in the prior-year period, driven by lower revenues and 
higher cost of credit and higher income tax expense, partially 
offset by lower expenses.

All Other (managed basis) revenues decreased 22%, 
driven by lower revenues in Corporate/Other and lower 
revenues in Legacy Franchises (managed basis).

2Q24 YTD vs. 2Q23 YTD
Net loss was $879 million, compared to net income of $260 
million in the prior-year period, driven by lower revenues, 
higher expenses and higher income tax expense, partially 
offset by lower cost of credit.

All Other (managed basis) revenues decreased 16%, 
driven by lower revenues in Corporate/Other and lower 
revenues in Legacy Franchises (managed basis).

Legacy Franchises (managed basis) revenues decreased 

Legacy Franchises (managed basis) revenues decreased 

5%, mainly due to lower revenues in Asia Consumer 
(managed basis) and Legacy Holdings Assets, partially offset 
by higher revenues in Mexico Consumer/SBMM (managed 
basis). 

Mexico Consumer/SBMM (managed basis) revenues 
increased 19%, primarily due to higher loan balances in retail 
banking, cards and SBMM, higher deposits in SBMM and 
Mexican peso appreciation. 

Asia Consumer (managed basis) revenues decreased 52%, 

primarily driven by the closed exits and wind-downs. 

Legacy Holdings Assets revenues decreased to $(129) 
million, compared to $74 million in the prior-year period, 
primarily due to higher funding costs related to the transfer of 
the retail banking business in the U.K.

Corporate/Other revenues decreased to $810 million, 
compared to $1.4 billion in the prior-year period, largely 
driven by higher funding costs.

Expenses increased 5%, primarily driven by the 

incremental FDIC special assessment, restructuring charges 
(see Note 9) and the Civil Money Penalties, partially offset by 
the closed exits and wind-downs.

Provisions were $429 million, compared to $645 million 
in the prior-year period, largely driven by a net ACL release 
for loans compared to a build in other assets in the prior-year 
period. The decrease was partially offset by a 17% increase in 
net credit losses, primarily due to higher lending volumes in 
Mexico Consumer. 

10%, mainly due to lower revenues in Asia Consumer 
(managed basis) and Legacy Holdings Assets, partially offset 
by higher revenues in Mexico Consumer/SBMM (managed 
basis).

Mexico Consumer/SBMM (managed basis) revenues 

increased 16%, mainly due to higher loan balances in retail 
banking, cards and SBMM and higher deposits in SBMM. 
Asia Consumer (managed basis) revenues decreased 54%, 
primarily driven by the closed exits and wind-downs. 

Legacy Holdings Assets revenues decreased to $(133) 
million, compared to $38 million in the prior-year period, 
primarily due to higher funding costs related to the transfer of 
the retail banking business in the U.K., which is being wound 
down, from Wealth to Legacy Holdings Assets (see Note 3). 
Corporate/Other revenues decreased to $253 million, 
compared to $609 million in the prior-year period, driven by 
higher funding costs, partially offset by an episodic benefit 
from the Visa B exchange.

Expenses decreased 7%, primarily driven by lower 
expenses from the closed exits and wind-downs, partially 
offset by the Civil Money Penalties. 

Provisions were $243 million, compared to $200 million 

in the prior-year period, largely driven by an ACL build for 
other assets and higher net credit losses in the current quarter, 
compared to a release for other assets in the prior-year period. 
The increase in provisions was partially offset by a modest net 
ACL release for loans compared to a build in the prior-year 
period. Net credit losses increased 8%, primarily driven by 
higher lending volumes in Mexico Consumer.
