MANAGING GLOBAL RISK

As of the first quarter of 2024, average loans for: 

•

USPB increased 11% year-over-year, driven by growth in 
Branded Cards, Retail Banking and Retail Services. 

• Wealth were largely unchanged. 
•

Services increased 4% year-over-year, primarily driven by 
strong demand for working capital loans in TTS in North 
America and internationally. 

• Markets increased 8% year-over-year, reflecting increased 

•

client demand in asset-backed lending. 
Banking decreased 6% year-over-year, primarily driven 
by regulatory capital optimization efforts. 

For Citi, effective risk management is of primary importance 
to its overall operations. Accordingly, Citi’s risk management 
process has been designed to monitor, evaluate and manage 
the principal risks it assumes in conducting its activities. 
Specifically, the activities that Citi engages in, and the risks 
those activities generate, must be consistent with Citi’s 
Mission and Value Proposition and the key Leadership 
Principles that support it, as well as Citi’s risk appetite. For 
more information on managing global risk at Citi, see 
“Managing Global Risk” in Citi’s 2023 Form 10-K.

End-of-period loans increased 3% year-over-year, largely 

reflecting growth in cards in USPB and Markets. End-of-
period loans decreased 2% sequentially, primarily driven by 
seasonality in USPB.

On an average basis, loans increased 4% year-over-year 
and 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was largely 
due to growth in USPB, Services and Markets, partially offset 
by a decline in Banking.

Portfolio Mix—Geography and Counterparty
Citi’s corporate credit portfolio is diverse across geography 
and counterparty. The following table presents the percentage 
of this portfolio by region based on Citi’s internal 
management geography:

The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings 
across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison 
of credit exposure across all lines of business, geographies and 
products. Counterparty risk ratings reflect an estimated 
probability of default for a counterparty, and internal risk 
ratings are derived by leveraging validated statistical models 
and scorecards in combination with consideration of factors 
specific to the obligor or market, such as management 
experience, competitive position, regulatory environment and 
commodity prices. Facility risk ratings are assigned that reflect 
the probability of default of the obligor and factors that affect 
the loss given default of the facility, such as support or 
collateral. Internal ratings that generally correspond to BBB 
and above are considered investment grade, while those below 
are considered non-investment grade.

The following table presents the corporate credit portfolio 

by facility risk rating as a percentage of the total corporate 
credit portfolio:

Note: Total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending 
commitments. 

In addition to the obligor and facility risk ratings assigned 

to all exposures, Citi may classify exposures in the corporate 
credit portfolio. These classifications are consistent with Citi’s 
interpretation of the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of 
criticized exposures, which may categorize exposures as 
special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss.

Risk ratings and classifications are reviewed regularly and 
adjusted as appropriate. The credit review process incorporates 
quantitative and qualitative factors, including financial and 
non-financial disclosures or metrics, idiosyncratic events or 
changes to the competitive, regulatory or macroeconomic 
environment. 

Citi believes the corporate credit portfolio to be 

appropriately rated and classified as of March 31, 2024. Citi 
has taken action to adjust internal ratings and classifications of 
exposures as both the macroeconomic environment and 
obligor-specific factors have changed, particularly where 
additional stress has been observed. 

41                                                                                                                                                                                                       

     
 
 
 
 
As obligor risk ratings are downgraded, the probability of 

default increases. Downgrades of obligor risk ratings tend to 
result in a higher provision for credit losses. In addition, 
appetite per obligor is reduced consistent with the ratings, and 
downgrades may result in the purchase of additional credit 
derivatives or other risk/structural mitigants to hedge the 
incremental credit risk, or may result in Citi seeking to reduce 
exposure to an obligor or an industry sector. Citi will continue 
to review exposures to ensure that the appropriate probability 
of default is incorporated into all risk assessments.

See Note 14 for additional information on Citi’s corporate 

credit portfolio.

global auto manufacturers, bank subsidiaries and independent auto finance companies, of approximately $16.1 billion ($7.9 billion in funded, with 100% rated 
investment grade) as of March 31, 2024.
In addition to this exposure, Citi has energy-related exposure within the public sector (e.g., energy-related state-owned entities) and the transportation and 
industrials sector (e.g., off-shore drilling entities) included in the table above. As of March 31, 2024, Citi’s total exposure to these energy-related entities was 
approximately $5.0 billion, of which approximately $2.5 billion consisted of direct outstanding funded loans.

Exposure to Commercial Real Estate
As of March 31, 2024, Citi’s total credit exposure to 
commercial real estate (CRE) was $64 billion (compared to 
$66 billion at December 31, 2023), including $8 billion of 
exposure related to office buildings. This total CRE exposure 
consisted of approximately $53 billion related to corporate 
clients, included in the real estate category in the table above, 
and approximately $11 billion related to Wealth clients that is 
not in the table above as they are not considered corporate 
exposures. 

In addition, as of March 31, 2024, approximately 78% of 

Citi’s total CRE exposure was rated investment grade and 
more than 77% was to borrowers in the U.S.

As of March 31, 2024, the ACLL attributed to the total 

funded CRE exposure (including Wealth) was approximately 
1.76%, and there were $678 million of non-accrual CRE loans.

Credit Risk Mitigation
As part of its overall risk management activities, Citigroup 
uses credit derivatives, both partial and full term, and other 
risk mitigants to economically hedge portions of the credit risk 
in its corporate credit portfolio, in addition to outright asset 
sales. In advance of the expiration of partial-term economic 
hedges, Citi will determine, among other factors, the economic 
feasibility of hedging the remaining life of the instrument. The 
results of the mark-to-market and any realized gains or losses 
on credit derivatives are reflected primarily in Principal 
transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

At March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and March 31, 
2023, Banking had economic hedges on the corporate credit 
portfolio of $38.4 billion, $35.9 billion and $39.8 billion, 
respectively. Citi’s expected credit loss model used in the 
calculation of its ACL does not include the favorable impact 
of credit derivatives and other mitigants that are marked-to-
market. In addition, the reported amounts of direct 
outstandings and unfunded lending commitments in the tables 
above do not reflect the impact of these hedging transactions. 
The credit protection was economically hedging underlying 
Banking corporate credit portfolio exposures with the 
following risk rating distribution:

Consumer Credit Trends

U.S. Personal Banking

Branded Cards

As indicated above, USPB provides card products through 
Branded Cards and Retail Services, and mortgages and home 
equity, small business and personal consumer loans through 
Citi’s Retail Banking network. Retail Banking is concentrated 
in six major U.S. metropolitan areas. USPB also provides 
mortgages through correspondent channels. 

As of March 31, 2024, approximately 78% of USPB EOP 

loans consisted of Branded Cards and Retail Services card 
loans, which generally drives the overall credit performance of 
USPB, as U.S. cards net credit losses represented 
approximately 96% of total USPB net credit losses for the first 
quarter of 2024. As of March 31, 2024, Branded Cards 
represented 68% of total U.S. cards EOP loans and Retail 
Services represented 32% of U.S. cards EOP loans.

As presented in the chart above, the first quarter of 2024 
net credit loss rate and 90+ days past due delinquency rate in 
USPB increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, 
primarily reflecting the continued maturation of cards loan 
vintages originated during the pandemic, with delayed losses 
due to unprecedented levels of government stimulus as well as 
the macroeconomic pressures related to the higher inflationary 
and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios. 

USPB’s Branded Cards portfolio includes proprietary and 

co-branded cards. 

As presented in the chart above, the first quarter of 2024 
net credit loss rate and 90+ days past due delinquency rate in 
Branded Cards increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-
year, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of cards 
loan vintages originated during the pandemic, with delayed 
losses due to unprecedented levels of government stimulus as 
well as the impact of macroeconomic pressures related to the 
higher inflationary and interest rate environment impacting 
both cards portfolios. 

Retail Services

USPB’s Retail Services partners directly with more than 
20 retailers and dealers to offer private label and co-branded 
cards. Retail Services’ target market focuses on select industry 
segments such as home improvement, specialty retail, 
consumer electronics and fuel. Retail Services continually 
evaluates opportunities to add partners within target industries 
that have strong loyalty, lending or payment programs and 
growth potential.

As presented in the chart above, the first quarter of 2024 
net credit loss rate and 90+ days past due delinquency rate in 
Retail Services increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-
year, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of cards 
loan vintages originated during the pandemic, with delayed 
losses due to unprecedented levels of government stimulus as 
well as the impact of macroeconomic pressures related to the

For additional information on cost of credit, loan 

delinquency and other information for Citi’s cards portfolios, 
see each respective business’s results of operations above and 
Note 14.

Retail Banking

USPB’s Retail Banking portfolio consists primarily of 

consumer mortgages (including home equity) and unsecured 
lending products, such as small business loans and personal 
loans. The portfolio is generally delinquency managed, where 
Citi evaluates credit risk based on FICO scores, delinquencies 
and the value of underlying collateral. The consumer 
mortgages in this portfolio have historically been extended to 
high credit quality customers, generally with loan-to-value 
ratios that are less than or equal to 80% on first and second 
mortgages. For additional information, see “Loan-to-Value 
(LTV) Ratios” in Note 14.

As presented in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 
Retail Banking for the first quarter of 2024 increased quarter-
over-quarter, driven by consumer overdraft loans, and was 
broadly stable year-over-year. 

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily driven by 
lower delinquencies in U.S. mortgages. 

Wealth

As indicated above, Wealth provides consumer 

mortgages, margin lending, cards and other lending products 
to customer segments that range from affluent to ultra-high net 
worth through the Private Bank, Wealth at Work and Citigold. 
These customer segments represent a target market that is 
characterized by historically low default rates and 
delinquencies and includes loans that are delinquency 
managed or classifiably managed. The delinquency-managed 
portfolio consists primarily of mortgages, margin lending and 
cards. 

As of March 31, 2024, approximately $44 billion, or 30%, 

of the portfolios were classifiably managed and primarily 
consisted of margin lending, commercial real estate, 
subscription credit finance and other lending programs. These 
classifiably managed loans are primarily evaluated for credit 
risk based on their internal risk rating, of which 81% is rated 
investment grade. While the delinquency rate in the chart 
above is calculated only for the delinquency-managed 
portfolio, the net credit loss rate is calculated using net credit 
losses for both the delinquency and classifiably managed 
portfolios.

As presented in the chart above, the first quarter of 2024 
net credit loss rate and 90+ days past due delinquency rate in 
Wealth was broadly stable quarter-over-quarter and year-over-
year. The low net credit loss and 90+ days past due 
delinquency rates continued to reflect the strong credit profiles 
of the portfolio. 

Mexico Consumer

Mexico Consumer operates in Mexico through 

Citibanamex and provides credit cards, consumer mortgages 
and small business and personal loans. Mexico Consumer 
serves a more mass-market segment in Mexico and focuses on 
developing multiproduct relationships with customers.

As presented in the chart above, the first quarter of 2024 

net credit loss rate in Mexico Consumer increased quarter-
over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily driven by the 
ongoing normalization of loss rates from post-pandemic lows.
The 90+ days past due delinquency rate was broadly 
stable quarter-over-quarter and increased year-over-year, 
primarily driven by the ongoing normalization from post-
pandemic lows. 

For additional details on cost of credit, loan delinquency 
and other information for Citi’s consumer loan portfolios, see 
each respective business’s results of operations above and 
Note 14.

The FICO distribution of both card portfolios declined

reflecting continued maturation of cards loan vintages 
originated during the pandemic, as well as macroeconomic 
pressures related to the higher inflationary and interest rate 
environment impacting both cards portfolios. The FICO 
distribution continued to reflect strong underlying credit 
quality of the portfolios. See Note 14 for additional

(1) End-of-period (EOP) loans include interest and fees on credit cards.
(2) The ratios of 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due are calculated based on EOP loans, net of unearned income.
(3) The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios for Retail Banking exclude loans guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies since the 

potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) 
were $64 million ($0.5 billion), $63 million ($0.5 billion) and $80 million ($0.6 billion) at March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. 
The amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans) were 
$66 million, $73 million and $57 million at March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. The EOP loans in the table include the 
guaranteed loans.

(4) The 90+ days past due balances for Branded Cards and Retail Services are generally still accruing interest. Citi’s policy is generally to accrue interest on credit 

card loans until 180 days past due, unless notification of bankruptcy filing has been received earlier.

(5) Excludes EOP classifiably managed Private Bank loans. These loans are not included in the delinquency numerator, denominator and ratios. 
(6) These loans are evaluated for non-accrual status and write-off primarily based on their internal risk classification and not solely on their delinquency status and 
therefore, delinquency metrics are excluded from this table. As of March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, 81%, 85% and 93% of Wealth 
classifiably managed loans were rated investment grade. For additional information on the credit quality of the Wealth portfolio, including classifiably managed 
portfolios, see “Consumer Credit Trends” above.

(7) Asia Consumer includes delinquencies and loans in Poland and Russia for all periods presented.
(8) Citi has entered into agreements to sell certain Asia Consumer banking businesses. Accordingly, the loans of these businesses have been reclassified as HFS in 
Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and, hence, the loans and related delinquencies and ratios are not included in this table. The most recent 
reclassifications commenced as follows: Taiwan and Indonesia in 1Q22; Taiwan closed in 3Q23 and Indonesia closed in 4Q23. In addition, a portfolio was 
reclassified to HFS in the first quarter of 2023 and subsequently sold in the second quarter of 2023. See Note 2.

(9) The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are primarily related to U.S. mortgages guaranteed by U.S. 
government-sponsored agencies since the potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the U.S. agencies. The amounts excluded for 90+ days past due and

(1) North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Mexico is included in offices outside North America. The classification of corporate loans between 

offices in North America and outside North America is based on the domicile of the booking unit. The difference between the domicile of the booking unit and the 
domicile of the managing unit is not material.

(2) Loans secured primarily by real estate.
(3) Consumer loans are net of unearned income of $828 million, $802 million, $789 million, $769 million and $748 million at March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, 
September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. Unearned income on consumer loans primarily represents loan origination fees, net of 
certain direct origination costs, that are deferred and recognized as Interest income over the lives of the related loans.

(4) Corporate loans include Mexico SBMM loans and are net of unearned income of ($968) million, ($917) million, ($806) million, ($795) million and ($801) million 
at March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. Unearned income on corporate loans primarily 
represents loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, that are deferred and recognized as Interest income over the lives of the related loans. 

(5) Because loans carried at fair value do not have an ACLL, they are excluded from the ACLL ratio calculation.

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets 
For additional information on Citi’s non-accrual loans and 
assets, see “Non-Accrual Loans and Assets” in Citi’s 2023 
Form 10-K.

Non-Accrual Loans
The table below summarizes Citigroup’s non-accrual loans as 
of the periods indicated. Non-accrual loans may still be current 
on interest payments. In situations where Citi reasonably 
expects that only a portion of the principal owed will 
ultimately be collected, all payments received are reflected as 
a reduction of principal and not as interest income. For all 
other non-accrual loans, cash interest receipts are generally 
recorded as revenue.

(1) Corporate loans are placed on non-accrual status based on a review by Citigroup’s risk officers. Corporate non-accrual loans may still be current on interest 

payments. With limited exceptions, the following practices are applied for consumer loans: consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are placed on 
non-accrual status at 90 days past due and are charged off at 120 days past due; residential mortgage loans are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and 
written down to net realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent with industry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest on credit card loans until such 
loans are charged off, which typically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency. As such, the non-accrual loan disclosures do not include credit card loans. The 
balances above represent non-accrual loans within Corporate loans and Consumer loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

(2) Approximately 61%, 50%, 62%, 51% and 61% of Citi’s corporate non-accrual loans remain current on interest and principal payments at March 31, 2024, 

December 31, 2023, September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively.
(3) The March 31, 2024 total corporate non-accrual loans represented 0.51% of total corporate loans.
(4) The increase at September 30, 2023 was primarily related to two commercial real estate loans. 
(5)  Asia Consumer includes balances in Poland and Russia for all periods presented.

Note: The amounts in the table above are presented on an average basis. For securities, the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be realized and, 
therefore, exclude any securities that are encumbered and incorporate any haircuts applicable under the U.S. LCR rule. The table above incorporates various restrictions 
that could limit the transferability of liquidity between legal entities, including Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.
(1)  Foreign government debt includes securities issued or guaranteed by foreign sovereigns, agencies and multilateral development banks. Foreign government debt 

securities are held largely to support local liquidity requirements and Citi’s local franchises and principally include government bonds from Japan, Korea, Mexico, 
Hong Kong and India. 

The table above includes average amounts of HQLA held 
at Citigroup’s operating entities that are eligible for inclusion 
in the calculation of Citigroup’s consolidated Liquidity 
Coverage ratio (LCR), pursuant to the U.S. LCR rules. These 
amounts include the HQLA needed to meet the minimum 
requirements at these entities as well as any amounts in excess 
of these minimums that are available to be transferred to other 
entities within Citigroup. Citigroup’s average HQLA 
decreased quarter-over-quarter as of the first quarter of 2024, 
primarily driven by a reduction in short-term borrowings. 
As of March 31, 2024, Citigroup had approximately 
$965 billion of available liquidity resources to support client 
and business needs, including end-of-period HQLA ($555 
billion); additional unencumbered HQLA, including excess 
liquidity held at bank entities that is non-transferable to other 
entities within Citigroup ($226 billion); and unused borrowing 
capacity from available assets not already accounted for within 
Citi’s HQLA to support additional advances from the Federal 
Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and the Federal Reserve Bank 
discount window ($184 billion).

Short-Term Liquidity Measurement: Liquidity Coverage 
Ratio (LCR)
In addition to internal 30-day liquidity stress testing performed 
for Citi’s major entities, operating subsidiaries and countries, 
Citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the LCR. The 
table below details the components of Citi’s LCR calculation 
and HQLA in excess of net outflows for the periods indicated:

Note: The amounts are presented on an average basis.

As of March 31, 2024, Citigroup’s average LCR 
increased from the quarter ended December 31, 2023. The 
increase was primarily driven by the decrease in net outflows, 
partially offset by the reduction in average HQLA. 

In addition, considering Citi’s total available liquidity 

resources at quarter end of $965 billion, Citi maintained 
approximately $492 billion of excess liquidity resources above 
the stressed average net outflow of approximately $473 
billion, presented in the LCR table above.

Long-Term Liquidity Measurement: Net Stable Funding 
Ratio (NSFR)
As previously disclosed, the U.S. banking agencies adopted a 
rule to assess the availability of a bank’s stable funding against 
a required level. 

In general, a bank’s available stable funding includes 
portions of equity, deposits and long-term debt, while its 
required stable funding will be based on the liquidity 
characteristics of its assets, derivatives and commitments. 
Standardized weightings are required to be applied to the 
various asset and liability classes. The ratio of available stable 
funding to required stable funding is required to be greater 
than 100%.

For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, Citigroup’s 
consolidated NSFR was compliant with the rule. Refer to 
Citi’s U.S. NSFR Disclosure report covering December 31, 
2023 and September 30, 2023 on Citi’s Investor Relations 
website for additional information.

Select Balance Sheet Items

Sheet on an average and end-of-period basis.

Cash and Investments
The table below details average and end-of-period Cash and 
due from banks, Deposits with banks (collectively cash) and 
Investment securities. Citi’s investment portfolio consists 
largely of highly liquid U.S. Treasury, U.S. agency and other 
sovereign bonds, with an aggregate duration of less than three 
years. At March 31, 2024, Citi’s EOP cash and Investment 
securities comprised approximately 32% of Citigroup’s total

End-of-period deposits decreased 2% year-over-year, 

largely due to a reduction in Services reflecting quantitative 
tightening. End-of-period deposits were largely unchanged 
sequentially. 

On an average basis, deposits declined 3% year-over-year 

and increased 1% sequentially. In the first quarter of 2024, 
average deposits for:

•

•

Services decreased 3% year-over-year, as TTS and 
Securities Services decreased 3% and 1%, respectively. 
These declines primarily reflected the impact of 
quantitative tightening, partially offset by higher deposits 
from new client acquisitions and deepening of 
relationships with existing clients. 
USPB decreased 10% year-over-year, driven by the 
transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to 
Wealth. 

• Wealth decreased 1% year-over-year, primarily reflecting 
lower deposits in the Private Bank and Wealth at Work 
and the continued shift of deposits to higher-yielding 
investments on Citi’s platform, largely offset by the 
transfer of relationships and the associated deposits from 
USPB.

Citi’s total long-term debt outstanding increased 2% year-
over-year, largely driven by issuance of subordinated debt in 
the non-bank entities, as well as increased senior benchmark 
debt and FHLB borrowings at the bank. The increase was 
partially offset by a decline in senior benchmark debt at the 
non-bank entities. Sequentially, long-term debt outstanding 
was largely unchanged. 

As part of its liability management, Citi has considered, 

and may continue to consider, opportunities to redeem or 
repurchase its long-term debt pursuant to open market 
purchases, tender offers or other means. Such redemptions and 
repurchases help reduce Citi’s overall funding costs. During 
the first quarter of 2024, Citi redeemed or repurchased an 
aggregate of approximately $9.4 billion of its outstanding 
long-term debt.

Short-Term Borrowings
Citi’s short-term borrowings of $32 billion as of March 31, 
2024 decreased 21% year-over-year and 15% sequentially, 
both reflecting lower commercial paper issuances at the 
broker-dealer subsidiaries (see Note 18 for further information 
on Citigroup’s and its affiliates’ outstanding short-term 
borrowings).

Secured Funding Transactions and Short-Term 
Borrowings
Citi supplements its primary sources of funding with short-
term financings that generally include (i) secured funding 
transactions consisting of securities loaned or sold under 
agreements to repurchase, i.e., repos, and (ii) to a lesser extent, 
short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper and 
borrowings from the FHLB and other market participants. 

Secured Funding Transactions
Secured funding is primarily accessed through Citi’s broker-
dealer subsidiaries, with a smaller portion executed through 
Citi’s bank entities to efficiently fund both (i) secured lending 
activity and (ii) a portion of the securities inventory held in the 
context of market making and customer activities. Secured 
funding transactions are predominantly collateralized by 
government debt securities. Generally, changes in the level of 
Citi’s secured funding are primarily due to fluctuations in 
secured lending activity in the matched book (as described 
below) and changes in securities inventory. In order to 
maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market 
conditions, Citi manages risks related to its secured funding by 
establishing secured funding limits and conducting daily stress 
tests that account for risks related to capacity, tenor, haircut, 
collateral type, counterparty and client actions. 

Secured funding of $299 billion as of March 31, 2024 
increased 16% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, largely 
driven by additional financing to support increases in trading-
related assets within Citi’s broker-dealer subsidiaries. As of 
the quarter ended March 31, 2024, on an average basis, 
secured funding was $311 billion. The portion of secured 
funding in the broker-dealer subsidiaries that funds secured 
lending is commonly referred to as “matched book” activity 
and is primarily secured by high-quality liquid securities such 
as U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities and foreign 
government debt securities. Other “matched book” activity is 
secured by less liquid securities, including equity securities, 
corporate bonds and asset-backed securities, the tenor of 
which is generally equal to or longer than the tenor of the 
corresponding assets. As indicated above, the remaining

Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades
Ratings downgrades by Fitch, Moody’s or S&P could 
negatively impact Citigroup’s and/or Citibank’s funding and 
liquidity due to reduced funding capacity, including derivative 
triggers, which could take the form of cash obligations and 
collateral requirements.

For additional information on the impact of credit rating 

changes on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see “Risk 
Factors—Liquidity Risks” and “Credit Ratings” in Citi’s 2023 
Form 10-K.

Citigroup Inc. and Citibank—Potential Derivative Triggers
As of March 31, 2024, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-
notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of 
Citigroup Inc. across all three major rating agencies could 
impact Citigroup’s funding and liquidity due to derivative 
triggers by approximately $0.2 billion (unchanged from 
December 31, 2023). Other funding sources, such as secured 
financing transactions and other margin requirements, for 
which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely 
affected.

As of March 31, 2024, Citi estimates that a hypothetical 
one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of 
Citibank across all three major rating agencies could impact 
Citibank’s funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by 
approximately $0.3 billion (unchanged from December 31, 
2023). Other funding sources, such as secured funding 
transactions and other margin requirements, for which there 
are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely impacted.

In total, as of March 31, 2024, Citi estimates that a one-

notch downgrade of Citigroup Inc. and Citibank across all 
three major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate 
cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately 
$0.6 billion, compared to $0.5 billion as of December 31, 
2023. As detailed under “High-Quality Liquid Assets 
(HQLA)” above, Citigroup has various liquidity resources 
available to its bank and non-bank entities in part as a 
contingency for the potential events described above.

Citibank—Additional Potential Impacts
In addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a 
potential downgrade of Citibank’s senior debt/long-term rating 
across any of the three major rating agencies could also have 
an adverse impact on the commercial paper/short-term rating 
of Citibank. Citibank has provided liquidity commitments to 
consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits, 
primarily in the form of asset purchase agreements. As of 
March 31, 2024, Citibank had liquidity commitments of 
approximately $11.1 billion to consolidated asset-backed 
commercial paper conduits (compared to $11.0 billion at 
December 31, 2023) (see Note 21).

In addition to the above-referenced liquidity resources of 

certain Citibank entities, Citibank could reduce the funding 
and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades 
described above through mitigating actions, including 
repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial 
paper conduits. In the event of the potential downgrades 
described above, Citi believes that certain corporate customers 
could re-evaluate their deposit relationships with Citibank. 
This re-evaluation could result in clients adjusting their 
discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository 
institution, which could potentially reduce certain deposit 
levels at Citibank. However, Citi could choose to adjust 
pricing, offer alternative deposit products to its existing 
customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers, in 
addition to the mitigating actions referenced above.

63                                                                                                                                                                                                       

 
In addition, Citi uses multiple metrics to measure its 
Banking Book interest rate risk. Interest Rate Exposure (IRE) 
is a key metric that analyzes the impact of a range of scenarios 
on Citi’s Banking Book net interest income and certain other 
interest rate-sensitive income versus a base case. IRE does not 
represent a forecast of Citi’s net interest income.

The scenarios, methodologies and assumptions used in 

this analysis are periodically evaluated and enhanced in 
response to changes in the market environment, changes in 
Citi’s balance sheet composition, enhancements in Citi’s 
modeling and other factors.

Under the enhanced methodology, Citi utilizes the most 
recent quarter-end balance sheet, assuming no changes to its 
composition and size over the forecasted horizon (holding the 
balance sheet static). The forecasts incorporate expectations 
and assumptions of deposit pricing, loan spreads and mortgage 
prepayment behavior implied by the interest rate curves in 
each scenario. The base case scenario reflects the market-
implied forward interest rates, and sensitivity scenarios 
assume instantaneous shocks to the base case. The forecasts do 
not assume Citi takes any risk-mitigating actions in response 
to changes in the interest rate environment. Certain interest 
rates are subject to flooring assumptions in downward rate 
scenarios. Deposit pricing sensitivities (i.e., deposit betas) are 
informed by historical and expected behavior. Actual deposit 
pricing could differ from the assumptions used in these 
forecasts.

Citi’s IRE analysis primarily reflects the impacts from the 

following Banking Book assets and liabilities: loans, client 
deposits, Citi’s deposits with other banks, investment 
securities, long-term debt, any related interest rate hedges and 
the funds transfer pricing of positions in total trading and 
credit portfolio value at risk (VAR). It excludes impacts from 
any positions that are included in total trading and credit 
portfolio VAR.

In addition to IRE, Citi analyzes economic value 
sensitivity (EVS) as a longer-term interest rate risk metric. 
EVS is a net present value (NPV)–based measure of the 
lifetime cash flows of Citi’s Banking Book. It estimates the 
interest rate sensitivity of the Banking Book’s economic value 
from longer-term assets being potentially funded with shorter-
term liabilities, or vice versa. Citi manages EVS within risk 
limits approved by Citigroup’s Board of Directors that are 
aligned with Citi’s risk appetite.

MARKET RISK

Market risk arises from both Citi’s trading and non-trading 
portfolios. For additional information on market risk and 
market risk management at Citi, see “Market Risk—
Overview” and “Risk Factors” in Citi’s 2023 Form 10-K.

MARKET RISK OF NON-TRADING PORTFOLIOS
Market risk from non-trading portfolios stems predominantly 
from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and 
foreign exchange rates on Citi’s net interest income and on 
Citi’s Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) 
from its investment securities portfolios. Market risk from 
non-trading portfolios also includes the potential impact of 
changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital invested in 
foreign currencies.

Banking Book Interest Rate Risk 
For interest rate risk purposes, Citi’s non-trading portfolios are 
referred to as the Banking Book. Management of interest rate 
risk in the Banking Book is governed by Citi’s Non-Trading 
Market Risk Policy. Management’s Asset & Liability 
Committee (ALCO) establishes Citi’s risk appetite and related 
limits for interest rate risk in the Banking Book, which are 
subject to approval by Citigroup’s Board of Directors. 
Corporate Treasury is responsible for the day-to-day 
management of Citi’s Banking Book interest rate risk as well 
as periodically reviewing it with the ALCO. Citi’s Banking 
Book interest rate risk management is also subject to 
independent oversight from the second line of defense team 
reporting to the Chief Risk Officer.

Changes in interest rates impact Citi’s net income, AOCI 

and CET1. These changes primarily affect Citi’s Banking 
Book through net interest income, due to a variety of risk 
factors, including:

•

•
•

•

Differences in timing and amounts of the maturity or 
repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet 
instruments;
Changes in the level and/or shape of interest rate curves;
Client behavior in response to changes in interest rates 
(e.g., mortgage prepayments, deposit betas); and
Changes in the maturity of instruments resulting from 
changes in the interest rate environment.

As part of their ongoing activities, Citi’s businesses 
generate interest rate-sensitive positions from their client-
facing products, such as loans and deposits. The component of 
this interest rate risk that can be hedged is transferred via 
Citi’s funds transfer pricing process to Corporate Treasury. 
Corporate Treasury uses various tools to manage the total 
interest rate risk position within the established risk appetite 
and target Citi’s desired risk profile, including its investment 
securities portfolio, company-issued debt and interest rate 
derivatives. 

64                                                                                                                                                                                                       

Interest Rate Risk of Investment Portfolios—Impact on 
AOCI
Citi measures the potential impacts of changes in interest rates 
on the value of its AOCI, which can in turn impact Citi’s 
common equity and tangible common equity. This will impact 
Citi’s CET1 and other regulatory capital ratios. Citi seeks to 
manage its exposure to changes in the market level of interest 
rates, while limiting the potential impact on its AOCI and 
regulatory capital position.

AOCI at risk is managed as part of the Company-wide 
interest rate risk position. AOCI at risk considers potential 

changes in AOCI (and the corresponding impact on the CET1 
Capital ratio) relative to Citi’s capital generation capacity. 

Citi uses 100 basis point (bps) shocks in each scenario to 

reflect its net interest income sensitivity to unanticipated 
changes in market interest rates, as potential monetary policy 
decisions and changes in economic conditions may be 
reflected in current market-implied forward rates. The 
following table presents the 12-month estimated impact to 
Citi’s net interest income, AOCI and the CET1 Capital ratio, 
each assuming an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 bps 
increase in interest rates:

The All other currencies of $1,398 million as of 

March 31, 2024 in the table above includes the impact from 
the following top five non-U.S. dollar currencies, which 
represents approximately 50% of the total non-U.S. dollar 
currency impact: approximately $0.2 billion each from the 
British pound sterling and Japanese yen, and approximately 
$0.1 billion each from the Indian rupee, Singapore dollar and 
South Korean won. These impacts per currency are generally 
in the same direction (estimated positive impact in the +100 
bps shock scenario) and not offsetting.

Citi’s balance sheet is asset sensitive (assets reprice faster 

than liabilities), resulting in higher net interest income in 
increasing interest rate scenarios. The estimated impact to 
Citi’s net interest income in a 100 bps upward rate shock 
scenario as of March 31, 2024 was largely unchanged quarter-
over-quarter and decreased year-over-year, primarily 
reflecting the net impact of lower expected gains due to U.S. 
dollar interest rate moves that have already been realized and 
changes in Citi’s balance sheet. At progressively higher 
interest rate levels, the marginal net interest income benefit is 
lower, as Citi assumes it will pass on a larger share of rate 
changes to depositors (i.e., higher betas), further reducing 
Citi’s IRE sensitivity. Currency-specific interest rate changes 
and balance sheet factors may drive quarter-to-quarter 
volatility in Citi’s estimated IRE.

In a 100 bps upward rate shock scenario, Citi expects that 

the approximate $1.2 billion initial negative impact to AOCI 
could potentially be offset in shareholders’ equity through the 
expected recovery of the impact on AOCI through accretion of 
Citi’s investment portfolio and expected net interest income 
benefit over a period of approximately six months.

Scenario Analysis
The following table presents the estimated impact to Citi’s net 
interest income, AOCI and CET1 Capital ratio (on a fully 
implemented basis) under six different scenarios of changes in 
interest rates for the U.S. dollar and all other currencies in 
which Citi has invested capital as of March 31, 2024. The 100 
bps downward rate scenarios are impacted by the low level of 
interest rates in several countries and the assumption that 
market interest rates, as well as rates paid to depositors and 
charged to borrowers, do not fall below zero (i.e., the “flooring 
assumption”). The interest rate scenarios are also impacted by 
convexity related to mortgage products and deposit pricing.

Note: Each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur instantaneously. Changes in interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and the 10-year rate are 
interpolated. The interest rate exposure in the table above assumes no change in deposit size or mix from the baseline forecast included in the different interest scenarios 
presented. As a result, in higher interest rate scenarios, customer activity resulting in a shift from non-interest-bearing and low interest rate deposit products to higher-
yielding deposits would reduce the expected benefit to net interest income. Conversely, in lower interest rate scenarios, customer activity resulting in a shift from 
higher-yielding deposits to non-interest-bearing and low interest rate deposit products would reduce the expected decrease to net interest income.
(1) Scenario 1 includes the impact from the following top five non-U.S. dollar currencies, which represents approximately 50% of the total non-U.S. dollar currency 
impact: approximately $0.2 billion each from the British pound sterling and Japanese yen, and approximately $0.1 billion each from the Indian rupee, Singapore 
dollar and South Korean won. These impacts per currency are generally in the same direction (estimated positive impact in the +100 bps shock scenario) and not 
offsetting.
Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.

(2)

As presented in the table above, the estimated impact to 

Citi’s net interest income is larger under Scenario 2 than 
Scenario 3, as Citi’s Banking Book has relatively higher 
interest rate exposure to the short end of the yield curve. For 
U.S. dollars, exposure to downward rate shocks is larger in 
magnitude than to upward rate shocks. This is because of the 
lower benefit to net interest income from Citi’s deposit base at 
higher rate levels, as well as the prepayment effects on 
mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. For other 
non-U.S. dollar currencies, exposure to downward rate shocks 
is smaller in magnitude as a result of Citi’s flooring 
assumption, given low rate levels for certain non-U.S. dollar 
currencies.

The magnitude of the impact to AOCI is greater under 

Scenario 2 compared to Scenario 3. This is because the 
combination of changes to Citi’s investment portfolio, 
partially offset by changes related to Citi’s pension liabilities, 
results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at 
shorter- and intermediate-term maturities.

66                                                                                                                                                                                                       

 
 
 
 
Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates—Impacts on AOCI 
and Capital
As of March 31, 2024, Citi estimates that an unanticipated 
parallel instantaneous 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar 
against all of the other currencies in which Citi has invested 
capital could reduce Citi’s tangible common equity (TCE) by 
approximately $1.7 billion, or 1.0%, as a result of changes to 
Citi’s CTA in AOCI, net of hedges. This impact would be 
primarily due to changes in the value of the Mexican peso, 
Euro, Singapore dollar and Indian rupee.

This impact is also before any mitigating actions Citi may 

take, including ongoing management of its foreign currency 
translation exposure. Specifically, as currency movements 
change the value of Citi’s net investments in foreign currency-
denominated capital, these movements also change the value 
of Citi’s risk-weighted assets denominated in those currencies.

Change in FX spot rate(1)
Change in TCE due to FX translation, net of hedges

As a percentage of TCE

Estimated impact to CET1 Capital ratio (on a fully implemented basis) 
due to changes in FX translation, net of hedges (bps)

This, coupled with Citi’s foreign currency hedging strategies, 
such as foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency 
forwards and other currency hedging instruments, lessens the 
impact of foreign currency movements on Citi’s CET1 Capital 
ratio. Changes in these hedging strategies, as well as hedging 
costs, divestitures and tax impacts, can further affect the actual 
impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital 
compared to an unanticipated parallel shock, as described 
above.

The effect of Citi’s ongoing management strategies with 

respect to quarterly changes in foreign exchange rates, and the 
quarterly impact of these changes on Citi’s TCE and CET1 
Capital ratio, are presented in the table below. See Note 19 for 
additional information on the changes in AOCI.

Interest income and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments primarily related to the tax-exempt bond portfolio and certain tax-advantaged 
loan programs of $23 million, $21 million and $44 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. 
Interest expense associated with certain hybrid financial instruments, which are classified as Long-term debt and accounted for at fair value, is reported together 
with any changes in fair value as part of Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income and is therefore not reflected in Interest expense in the 
table above.

(3) The average rate on interest income and net interest margin reflects the taxable equivalent gross-up adjustment. See footnote 1 above.

Interest income and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments discussed in the table above.

Citi’s net interest income in the first quarter of 2024 was $13.5 
billion, on both a reported and taxable equivalent basis, an 
increase of $0.1 billion versus the prior-year period, primarily 
driven by Markets. The increase in Markets net interest 
income was primarily driven by Fixed Income markets. Non-
Markets net interest income was largely unchanged, as the 
impact from higher interest rates and the growth in U.S. cards 
interest-earning balances in USPB were offset by higher 
funding costs in the mortgage-backed securities portfolio in 
Corporate Treasury within All Other.

Citi’s net interest margin was 2.42% on a taxable 

equivalent basis in the first quarter of 2024, a decrease of four 
basis points from the prior quarter, largely driven by Fixed 
Income markets.

MARKET RISK OF TRADING PORTFOLIOS

Value at Risk (VAR)
Citi believes its VAR model is conservatively calibrated to incorporate fat-tail scaling and the greater of short-term (approximately the 
most recent month) and long-term (18 months for commodities and three years for others) market volatility. As of March 31, 2024, 
Citi estimates that the conservative features of the VAR calibration contribute an approximate 30% add-on to what would be a VAR 
estimated under the assumption of stable and perfectly, normally distributed markets. As of December 31, 2023, the add-on was 30%.
As presented in the table below, Citi’s average trading VAR for the first quarter of 2024 increased 10% from the fourth quarter of 

2023, primarily due to inventory changes in the Markets businesses and updates to reflect changes in volatilities.

(1)  Covariance adjustment (also known as diversification benefit) equals the difference between the total VAR and the sum of the VARs tied to each risk type. The 
benefit reflects the fact that the risks within individual and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VAR on a given day will be 
lower than the sum of the VARs relating to each risk type. The determination of the primary drivers of changes to the covariance adjustment is made by an 
examination of the impact of both model parameter and position changes.

(2)  The total trading VAR includes mark-to-market and certain fair value option trading positions with the exception of hedges of the loan portfolio, fair value option 

loans and all CVA exposures. Available-for-sale and accrual exposures are not included.

(3)  The specific risk-only component represents the level of equity and fixed income issuer-specific risk embedded in VAR. 
(4)  The credit portfolio is composed of mark-to-market positions associated with non-trading business units, with the CVA relating to derivative counterparties, all 
associated CVA hedges and market sensitivity FVA hedges. FVA and DVA are not included. The credit portfolio also includes hedges of the loan portfolio, fair 
value option loans and hedges of the leveraged finance pipeline within capital markets origination.

Regulatory VAR Back-Testing
In accordance with Basel III, Citi is required to perform back-
testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR 
model. Regulatory VAR back-testing is the process in which 
the daily one-day VAR, at a 99% confidence interval, is 
compared to the buy-and-hold profit and loss (i.e., the profit 
and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of 
the day and re-priced the following day). Buy-and-hold profit 
and loss represents the daily mark-to-market profit and loss 
attributable to price movements in covered positions from the 
close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and 
loss excludes realized trading revenue, net interest, fees and 
commissions, intra-day trading profit and loss and changes in 
reserves.

Based on a 99% confidence level, Citi would expect two 

to three days in any one year where buy-and-hold losses 
exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the conservative 
calibration of Citi’s VAR model (as a result of taking the 
greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-tail scaling 
of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer exceptions under 
normal and stable market conditions. Periods of unstable 
market conditions could increase the number of back-testing 
exceptions.

As of March 31, 2024, there were two back-testing 
exceptions observed for Citi’s Regulatory VAR in the last 12 
months.

Country Risk

Top 25 Country Exposures
The following table presents Citi’s top 25 exposures by 
country (excluding the U.S.) as of March 31, 2024. (Including 
the U.S., Citi’s top 25 exposures by country would represent 
approximately 99% of Citi’s exposure to all countries as of 
March 31, 2024.)

For purposes of the table, loan amounts are reflected in 
the country where the loan is booked, which is generally based 
on the domicile of the borrower. For example, a loan to a 
Chinese subsidiary of a Switzerland-based corporation will 
generally be categorized as a loan in China. In addition, Citi 
has developed regional booking centers in certain countries, 

most significantly in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland, 
in order to more efficiently serve its corporate customers. As 
an example, with respect to the U.K., only 40% of corporate 
loans presented in the table below are to U.K. domiciled 
entities (45% for unfunded commitments), with the balance of 
the loans predominately to European domiciled counterparties. 
Approximately 90% of the total U.K. funded loans and 87% of 
the total U.K. unfunded commitments were investment grade 
as of March 31, 2024. 

Trading account assets and investment securities are 
generally categorized based on the domicile of the issuer of 
the security of the underlying reference entity. For additional 
information on the assets included in the table, see the

Russia 

Overview
In Russia, Citi’s remaining operations are conducted through 
Services, Markets, Banking and All Other—Legacy 
Franchises. Citi continues to monitor the war in Ukraine, 
related sanctions and economic conditions and continues to 
mitigate its Russia exposures and risks as appropriate.

As part of previously disclosed plans, Citi ended nearly 
all of the institutional banking services it offered in Russia, 
with the remaining services only those necessary to fulfill its 
remaining legal and regulatory obligations. In addition, Citi 
significantly reduced its All Other—Legacy Franchises 
consumer loan portfolio in Russia (reported as part of Asia 
Consumer), largely due to loan portfolio sales and its entry 
into a credit card referral agreement with a Russian bank. 

Citi has ceased soliciting any new business or new clients in 
Russia. Citi will continue to manage its existing legal and 
regulatory commitments and obligations, as well as continue 
to support its employees, during this period. For additional 
information, see “Citi’s Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations” 
below.

For additional information about Citi’s risks related to its 
Russia exposures, see “Risk Factors—Market-Related Risks,” 
“—Operational Risks” and “—Other Risks” in Citi’s 2023 
Form 10-K.

Investment securities include debt securities AFS, recorded at fair market value, primarily local government debt securities. 

(1) 
(2)  Unfunded exposure consists of unfunded corporate lending commitments, letters of credit and other contingencies. 
(3)  Cash on deposit and placements are primarily with the Central Bank of Russia and foreign financial institutions.
(4)  Represents dividends received by Citi in its role as custodian for investor clients in Russia, which Citi is required by local regulation to hold at the Deposit 

Insurance Agency (DIA). Citi is unable to remit these funds to clients due to restrictions imposed by the Russian government. In accordance with a Central Bank 
of Russia regulatory requirement, all balances in the National Settlements Depository were transferred to the DIA in the second quarter of 2023.

(5)  The majority of AO Citibank’s third-party exposures was funded with the dividends under footnote 4 and domestic deposit liabilities from both corporate and 

personal banking clients.

(6)  Citigroup’s CTA loss included in its AOCI related to its indirect subsidiary, AO Citibank, is excluded from the above table, because the CTA loss is not held in 

AO Citibank and would be recognized in Citigroup’s earnings only upon either the substantial liquidation or a loss of control of AO Citibank. Citi has separately 
described these risks in “Deconsolidation Risk” below.

76                                                                                                                                                                                                       

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During the first quarter of 2024, Citi’s Russia-related 
exposures increased by $0.4 billion, as presented in the table 
above. The increase in exposure was driven by inflows from 
dividends received from Russian corporations on behalf of 
Citi’s clients. Approximately 73% of Citi’s $7.0 billion of 
total Russia exposure are corporate dividends that Citi cannot 
remit to its clients due to restrictions imposed by the Russian 
government, of which $4.6 billion is held with the Deposit 
Insurance Agency as of March 31, 2024.

Citi’s net investment in Russia was approximately $0.2 
billion as of March 31, 2024 (unchanged from December 31, 
2023). 

Citi hedges its ruble/USD spot FX exposure in AOCI 
through the purchase of FX derivatives. The ongoing mark-to-
market of the hedging derivatives is also reported in AOCI. 
When the ruble depreciates against the USD, the USD 
equivalent value of Citigroup’s investment in AO Citibank 
also declines. This change in value is offset by the change in 
value of the hedging instrument (FX derivative). Going 
forward, Citi may record devaluations on its net ruble-
denominated assets in earnings, without the benefit from a 
change in the fair value of derivative positions used to 
economically hedge the exposures. 

Earnings and Other Impacts on Citi’s Businesses
Services, Markets, Banking, USPB and All Other results have 
been impacted by various macroeconomic factors and 
volatilities, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its 
direct and indirect impact on the European and global 
economies. For a broader discussion of these factors and 
volatilities on Citi’s businesses, see “Executive Summary” and 
each business’s results of operations above. 

As of March 31, 2024, Citigroup’s ACL included a $0.1 

billion remaining credit reserve for Citi’s direct Russian 
counterparties (largely unchanged from December 31, 2023). 
This balance does not include the additional reserves for 
transfer risk for exposures in Russia.

Citi’s Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations
In August 2022, Citi disclosed its decision to wind down its 
Russia consumer, local commercial and institutional banking 
businesses, including actively pursuing portfolio sales. In 
connection with this wind-down, Citi has incurred 
approximately $65 million to-date in charges, largely from 
restructuring, vendor termination fees and other related 
charges. Citi expects to incur an additional approximate 
$54 million in estimated charges (approximately $1 million in 
Banking and $53 million in All Other, excluding the impact 
from any portfolio sales). This estimate was revised down 
during the first quarter of 2024 from $58 million at December 
31, 2023. For additional information about Citi’s continued 
efforts to reduce its operations and exposure in Russia, see 
Note 2 and “Risk Factors” and “Managing Global Risk—
Other Risks—Country Risk—Russia” in Citi’s 2023 Form 10-
K.

Deconsolidation Risk
Citi’s remaining operations in Russia subject it to various 
risks, including, among others, foreign currency volatility, 
including appreciation or devaluation; restrictions arising from 
retaliatory Russian laws and regulations on the conduct of its 
business; sanctions or asset freezes; or other deconsolidation 
events (see “Risk Factors—Other Risks” in Citi’s 2023 Form 
10-K). Examples of triggers that may result in deconsolidation 
of AO Citibank include voluntary or forced sale of ownership 
or loss of control due to actions of relevant governmental 
authorities, including expropriation (i.e., the entity becomes 
subject to the complete control of a government, court, 
administrator, trustee or regulator); revocation of banking 
license; and loss of ability to elect a board of directors or 
appoint members of senior management. As of March 31, 
2024, Citi continued to consolidate AO Citibank because none 
of the deconsolidation factors were triggered.

In the event Citi deems there is a loss of control, for 
example, through expropriation of AO Citibank, Citi’s foreign 
entity in Russia, Citi would be required to (i) write off the net 
investment of approximately $0.2 billion (unchanged from 
December 31, 2023), (ii) recognize a CTA loss of 
approximately $1.6 billion (unchanged from December 31, 
2023) through earnings and (iii) recognize a loss of $0.6 
billion (unchanged from December 31, 2023) on intercompany 
liabilities owed by AO Citibank to other Citi entities outside 
Russia. In the sole event of a substantial liquidation, as 
opposed to a loss of control, Citi would be required to 
recognize the CTA loss of approximately $1.6 billion through 
earnings and would evaluate its remaining net investment as 
circumstances evolve.

Citi as Paying Agent for Russia-related Clients
Citi serves or served as paying agent on bonds issued by 
various entities in Russia, including Russian corporate clients. 
Citi’s role as paying agent is administrative. In this role, Citi 
acts as an agent of its client, the bond issuer, receiving interest 
and principal payments from the bond issuer and then making 
payments to international central securities depositories (e.g., 
Depository Trust Company, Euroclear, Clearstream). The 
international central securities depositories (ICSDs) make 
payments to those participants or account holders (e.g., broker/
dealers) that have clients who are investors in the applicable 
bonds (i.e., bondholders). As a paying agent, Citi generally 
does not have information about the identity of the 
bondholders. Citi may be exposed to risks due to its 
responsibilities for receiving and processing payments on 
behalf of its clients as a result of sanctions or other 
governmental requirements and prohibitions. To mitigate 
operational and sanctions risks, Citi has established policies, 
procedures and controls for client relationships and payment 
processing to help ensure compliance with U.S., U.K., EU and 
other jurisdictions’ sanctions laws.

These processes may require Citi to delay or withhold the 

processing of payments as a result of sanctions on the bond 
issuer. Citi is also prevented from making payments to 
accounts on behalf of bondholders should the ICSDs disclose 
to Citi the presence of sanctioned bondholders. In both 
instances, Citi is generally required to segregate, restrict or

Board’s Role in Overseeing Related Risks
The Citi Board of Directors (Board) and the Board’s Risk 
Management Committee (RMC) and its other Committees 
have received and continue to receive regular reports from 
senior management regarding the war in Ukraine and its 
impact on Citi’s operations in Russia, Ukraine and elsewhere, 
as well as the war’s broader geopolitical, macroeconomic and 
reputational impacts. The reports to the Board and its 
Committees from senior management who represent the 
impacted businesses and the international cluster, Independent 
Risk Management, Finance, Independent Compliance Risk 
Management, including those individuals responsible for 
sanctions compliance, and Human Resources, have included 
detailed information regarding financial impacts, impacts on 
capital, cybersecurity, strategic considerations, sanctions 
compliance, employee assistance and reputational risks, 
enabling the Board and its Committees to properly exercise 
their oversight responsibilities. In addition, senior 
management has also provided updates to Citi’s Executive 
Management Team and the Board, outside of formal meetings, 
regarding Citi’s Russia-related risks, including with respect to 
cybersecurity matters.

Ukraine
Citi has continued to operate in Ukraine throughout the war 
through its Services, Markets and Banking businesses, serving 
the local subsidiaries of multinationals, along with local 
financial institutions and the public sector. Citi employs 
approximately 220 people in Ukraine and their safety is Citi’s 
top priority. All of Citi’s domestic operations in Ukraine are 
conducted through a subsidiary of Citibank, which uses the 
Ukrainian hryvnia as its functional currency. As of March 31, 
2024, Citi had $1.4 billion of direct exposures related to 
Ukraine (compared to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2023).

block the funds until applicable sanctions are lifted or the 
payment is otherwise authorized under applicable law.

Reputational Risks
Citi has continued its efforts to enhance and protect its 
reputation with its colleagues, clients, customers, investors, 
regulators and the public. Citi’s response to the war in 
Ukraine, including any action or inaction, may have a negative 
impact on Citi’s reputation with some or all of these parties.
For example, Citi is exposed to reputational risk as a 
result of its remaining presence in Russia and association with 
Russian individuals or entities, whether subject to sanctions or 
not, including Citi’s inability to support its global clients in 
Russia, which could adversely affect its broader client 
relationships and businesses; current involvement in 
transactions or supporting activities involving Russian assets 
or interests; failure to correctly interpret and apply laws and 
regulations, including those related to sanctions; perceived 
misalignment of Citi’s actions to its stated strategy in Russia; 
and the reputational impact from Citi’s activity and 
engagement with Ukraine or with non-Russian clients exiting 
their Russia businesses.

While Citi announced its intention to wind down its 
businesses in Russia, Citi will continue to manage those 
operations during the wind-down process and will be required 
to maintain certain limited operations to fulfill its remaining 
legal and regulatory obligations. Also, sanctions and sanctions 
compliance are highly complex and may change over time and 
result in increased operational risk. Failure to fully comply 
with relevant sanctions or the application of sanctions where 
they should not be applied may negatively impact Citi’s 
reputation. In addition, Citi currently performs services for, 
conducts business with or deals in non-sanctioned Russian-
owned businesses and Russian assets. This has attracted, and 
will likely continue to attract, negative attention, despite the 
previously disclosed plan to wind down nearly all its activities 
in the country, cessation of new business and client 
originations, and reduction of other exposures.

Citi’s continued presence or divestiture of businesses in 

Russia could also increase its susceptibility to cyberattacks 
that could negatively impact its relationships with clients and 
customers, harm its reputation, increase its compliance costs 
and adversely affect its business operations and results of 
operations. For additional information on operational and 
cyber risks, see “Risk Factors—Operational Risks” in Citi’s 
2023 Form 10-K.

Argentina
Citi operates in Argentina through its Services, Markets and 
Banking businesses. As of March 31, 2024, Citi’s net 
investment in its Argentine operations was approximately $1.6 
billion (compared to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2023). Citi 
uses the U.S. dollar (USD) as the functional currency for its 
operations in countries such as Argentina that are deemed 
highly inflationary in accordance with GAAP. Citi therefore 
records the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on its net 
Argentine peso (ARS)–denominated assets directly in 
earnings. Citi uses Argentina’s official market exchange rate 
to remeasure its net ARS-denominated assets into USD. As of 
March 31, 2024, the official ARS exchange rate was 858.00, 
which devalued by 6% against the USD during the first quarter 
of 2024.

The increase in Citi’s net investment in Argentina during 

the quarter was primarily due to earnings associated with 
increased client activity, Citi’s normal onshore operations and 
interest income earned on the net investment, of which a 
significant portion is invested at high local overnight rates in 
Argentina. All of these effects significantly exceeded 
translation losses (net of hedges) of $55 million recognized 
during the quarter.

The Central Bank of Argentina maintains certain capital 

and currency controls that generally restrict Citi’s ability to 
access USD in Argentina and remit earnings from its 
Argentine operations. To the extent that such controls remain 
in place, Citi’s net investment in Argentina will, as a result, 
continue to be exposed to additional foreign currency 
translation losses if it is denominated in ARS and is unable to 
be remitted or exchanged. Furthermore, the capital and 
currency controls have resulted in indirect foreign exchange 
mechanisms that some Argentine entities may use to obtain 
USD, generally at rates that are significantly higher than 
Argentina’s official exchange rate. Citibank Argentina is 
generally precluded from accessing these alternative 
mechanisms, and under U.S. GAAP, these exchange 
mechanisms cannot be used to re-measure Citi’s net monetary 
assets into USD. If Argentina’s official exchange rate further 
converges with the approximate rate implied by the indirect 
foreign exchange mechanisms, Citi could incur additional 
translation losses on its net investment in Argentina. 
Accordingly, Citi seeks to reduce its overall ARS exposure in 
Argentina while complying with local capital and currency 
exposure limitations.

Of the $1.6 billion net investment in Argentina as of 
March 31, 2024, Citi’s net ARS exposure was approximately 
$0.9 billion. The net ARS exposure was reduced as of the end 
of the quarter as a result of Citi holding approximately $100 
million of USD-denominated loans as well as approximately 
$600 million of certain local government bonds that are 
indexed to the higher of the USD exchange rate or the local 
inflation index. If Citi had not invested in such instruments to 
reduce its ARS exposure, Citi would have recognized 
additional translation losses during the first quarter of 2024. 
Given current economic conditions and the local capital, 
currency and regulatory limitations, Citi cannot guarantee the 
availability or effectiveness of such mechanisms to reduce its 
ARS exposure in the future.

In addition to reducing the ARS exposure, Citi also seeks 
to economically hedge the exposure to the extent possible and 
prudent using non-deliverable forward (NDF) derivative 
instruments that are primarily executed outside of Argentina. 
As of March 31, 2024, Citi was unable to hedge a substantial 
portion of the remaining ARS exposure, given that the
offshore NDF market remained illiquid. Accordingly, and to 
the extent that Citi does not execute additional NDF contracts 
for this unhedged exposure in the future, Citi would record 
devaluations on its net ARS-denominated assets in earnings, 
without any benefit from a change in the fair value of 
derivative positions used to economically hedge the exposure. 
Citi cannot predict the availability of hedging instruments in 
the future nor can it predict changes in foreign exchange rates 
and the resulting impact on earnings.

Citi continually evaluates its economic exposure to its 
Argentine counterparties and reserves for changes in credit 
risk and records mark-to-market adjustments for relevant 
market risks associated with its Argentine assets. Citi believes 
it has established an appropriate ACL on its Argentine loans, 
and appropriate fair value adjustments on Argentine assets and 
liabilities measured at fair value, for credit and sovereign risks 
under U.S. GAAP as of March 31, 2024. For additional 
information on Citi’s emerging markets risks, including those 
related to its Argentine exposures, see “Risk Factors—
Strategic Risks” in Citi’s 2023 Form 10-K.
