AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Third Quarter of 2024—Continued Progress on Strategy 
Execution and Other Priorities 
As described further throughout this Executive Summary, 
during the third quarter of 2024:

•

•

•

•

•

•

Citi’s revenues increased 1% versus the prior-year period 
on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, 
which included an approximate $400 million gain from 
the sale of the Taiwan consumer banking business in the 
prior-year period, revenues increased 3%, driven by 
growth across all reportable operating segments, partially 
offset by a decline in revenues in All Other (managed 
basis).
Citi’s expenses decreased 2% versus the prior-year 
period. Excluding divestiture-related impacts in both the 
current quarter and the prior-year period and a $56 million 
FDIC special assessment benefit in the current quarter, 
expenses decreased 1%. The decrease was primarily 
driven by savings associated with Citi’s organizational 
simplification and stranded cost reductions, partially 
offset by volume-related expenses and continued 
investments in Citi’s transformation and other risk and 
control initiatives. (See “Expenses” below.)
Citi’s cost of credit was approximately $2.7 billion versus 
$1.8 billion in the prior-year period. The increase was 
largely driven by higher cards net credit losses in Branded 
Cards and Retail Services in U.S. Personal Banking 
(USPB) and a higher allowance for credit losses (ACL) 
build. The higher cards net credit losses primarily 
reflected the continued maturation of multiple cards loan 
vintages originated in recent years, impacted by 
unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the 
pandemic. In addition, the higher ACL build was 
primarily driven by changes in portfolio composition in 
the corporate portfolio and an increase in transfer risk 
reserves associated with unremittable corporate dividends.
Citi returned $2.1 billion to common shareholders in the 
form of common dividends and share repurchases.
Citigroup’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio 
under the Basel III Standardized Approach increased to 
13.7% as of September 30, 2024, compared to 13.6% as 
of September 30, 2023 (see “Capital Resources” below). 
This compares to Citigroup’s required regulatory CET1 
Capital ratio of 12.3% as of September 30, 2024 and 
12.0% as of September 30, 2023 under the Basel III 
Standardized Approach. Effective October 1, 2024, 
Citigroup’s required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio 
decreased to 12.1% from 12.3% under the Standardized 
Approach, reflecting the decrease in the Stress Capital 
Buffer (SCB) requirement to 4.1% from 4.3% (see 
“Capital Resources—Stress Capital Buffer” below). 
Citi also continued to make progress with the separation 
of its consumer banking and small business and middle-
market banking operations in Mexico in preparation for a 
planned initial public offering and wind-downs of the 

Korea and China consumer banking businesses and the 
Russia consumer, local commercial and institutional 
businesses. 

Third Quarter of 2024 Results Summary

Citigroup
Citigroup reported net income of $3.2 billion, or $1.51 per 
share, compared to net income of $3.5 billion, or $1.63 per 
share in the prior-year period. Net income decreased 9% 
versus the prior-year period, driven by the higher cost of 
credit, partially offset by the higher revenue and the lower 
expenses. Citigroup’s effective tax rate in the current quarter 
was approximately 25%, relatively unchanged from the prior-
year period. Average diluted shares outstanding decreased 1%. 
Citigroup revenues of $20.3 billion increased 1% versus 

the prior-year period, on a reported basis. Excluding the 
divestiture-related impacts in both periods, revenues of $20.3 
billion increased 3%, driven by growth across all reportable 
operating segments, partially offset by a decline in All Other 
(managed basis). (For additional information on the 
divestiture-related impacts, see “All Other—Divestiture-
Related Impacts (Reconciling Items)” below.) (As used 
throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi’s results of operations and 
financial condition excluding divestiture-related impacts are 
non-GAAP financial measures.) 

Services revenues were primarily driven by higher non-

interest revenues in Securities Services and Treasury and 
Trade Solutions (TTS). Markets revenues were largely driven 
by strength in Equity Markets, while Banking revenues largely 
reflected growth in Investment Banking. USPB revenues 
benefited from loan growth in cards, as well as lower partner 
payments, and Wealth revenues were primarily driven by 
higher investment fee revenue.

Citigroup’s end-of-period loans were $689 billion, up 3% 
versus the prior-year period, largely reflecting loan growth in 
cards in USPB and higher loans in Markets and Services. 

Citigroup’s end-of-period deposits were approximately 
$1.3 trillion, up 3% versus the prior-year period, largely due to 
an increase in Services, driven by the continued deepening of 
client relationships and operating deposit growth in both TTS 
and Securities Services. For additional information about 
Citi’s deposits by business, including drivers and deposit 
trends, see each applicable business’s results of operations and 
“Liquidity Risk—Deposits” below.

Expenses
Citigroup’s operating expenses of $13.3 billion decreased 2% 
from the prior-year period. Expenses in the third quarter of 
2024 included divestiture-related impacts of $67 million 
(compared to $114 million in the prior-year period). Excluding 
divestiture-related impacts in both periods and a $56 million 
FDIC special assessment benefit in the current quarter, 
expenses decreased 1%, driven by savings associated with 
Citi’s organizational simplification and stranded cost 
reductions, partially offset by volume-related expenses and

continued investments in the transformation and other risk and 
control initiatives. Citi’s transformation initiatives will 
continue to entail significant investments during the remainder 
of 2024 and beyond. For more information about Citi’s 
transformation, see “Citi’s Multiyear Transformation” below. 
(As used throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi’s results of 
operations and financial condition excluding divestiture-
related impacts and the incremental FDIC special assessment 
benefit are non-GAAP financial measures.)

Cost of Credit
Citi’s total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and 
claims was a cost of $2.7 billion, compared to $1.8 billion in 
the prior-year period. The increase was primarily driven by 
higher net credit losses in Branded Cards and Retail Services 
in USPB and a higher ACL build. The higher cards net credit 
losses primarily reflected continued maturation of multiple 
cards loan vintages originated in recent years, impacted by 
unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the 
pandemic. In addition, the increase was due to macroeconomic 
pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate 
environment impacting both cards portfolios, with lower FICO 
band customers primarily driving the increase. The increase in 
the net ACL build was due to changes in portfolio composition 
in the corporate portfolio, an increase in transfer risk reserves 
associated with unremittable corporate dividends and loan 
growth in the consumer portfolio.

For additional information on Citi’s ACL, see 

“Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—
Citi’s Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)” below. 

Net credit losses of $2.2 billion increased 33% from the 
prior-year period. Consumer net credit losses of $2.1 billion 
increased 33%, largely reflecting the higher cards net credit 
losses. Corporate net credit losses increased to $74 million 
from $58 million. Citi continues to expect elevated consumer 
net credit losses in the fourth quarter of 2024. 

For additional information on Citi’s consumer and 

corporate credit costs, see each respective business’s results of 
operations and “Credit Risk” below.

Capital
Citigroup’s CET1 Capital ratio was 13.7% as of September 
30, 2024, compared to 13.6% as of September 30, 2023, based 
on the Basel III Standardized Approach for determining risk-
weighted assets (RWA). The increase was primarily driven by 
the net income and unrealized gains on available-for-sale 
securities recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive 
income (AOCI), partially offset by the payment of common 
and preferred dividends, common share repurchases and an 
increase in RWA.

In the third quarter of 2024, Citi paid approximately $1.1 
billion of common dividends and repurchased approximately 
$1.0 billion of common shares (see “Unregistered Sales of 
Equity Securities, Repurchases of Equity Securities and 
Dividends” below). Citi will continue to determine the level of 
common share repurchases on a quarter-by-quarter basis given 
the uncertainty regarding future regulatory capital 
requirements. For additional information on capital-related 
risks, trends and uncertainties, see “Capital Resources—
Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments” below and 

“Risk Factors—Strategic Risks,” “—Operational Risks” and 
“—Compliance Risks” in Citi’s 2023 Form 10-K.

Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio as of 
September 30, 2024 was 5.8%, compared to 6.0% as of 
September 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by an increase 
in Total Leverage Exposure and a decrease in Tier 1 Capital. 
For additional information on Citi’s capital ratios and related 
components, see “Capital Resources” below.

Services
Services net income of $1.7 billion increased 23% from the 
prior-year period, driven by higher revenues, partially offset 
by higher expenses and higher cost of credit. Services 
expenses of $2.6 billion increased 3%, primarily driven by 
continued investments in technology, other risk and controls, 
and product innovation. Cost of credit was $127 million, 
compared to $95 million in the prior-year period. The current-
quarter ACL build was primarily due to an increase in transfer 
risk associated with unremittable corporate dividends outside 
of the U.S. being held on behalf of clients, driven by safety 
and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law.

Services revenues of $5.0 billion increased 8%, primarily 

reflecting continued momentum across Securities 
Services and TTS. Non-interest revenue increased 33%, driven 
by a smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina, 
as well as continued strength across underlying fee drivers. 
Excluding the impact of the Argentine peso devaluation 
(approximately $42 million in the current quarter and 
approximately $273 million in the prior-year period), non-
interest revenue increased 11%. Net interest income was 
largely unchanged, as the benefit of higher deposit volumes 
was offset by a decline in interest rates in Argentina. (As used 
throughout this Form 10-Q, Services non-interest revenue 
excluding the impact of the Argentine peso devaluation is a 
non-GAAP financial measure.)

TTS revenues of $3.6 billion increased 4% from the prior-

year period. TTS non-interest revenue increased 41%, 
primarily driven by the smaller impact from currency 
devaluation in Argentina, an increase in cross-border 
transaction value of 8%, an increase in U.S. dollar clearing 
volume of 7% and an increase in commercial card spend 
volume of 8%. The increase in non-interest revenue was 
partially offset by a 5% decline in net interest income, driven 
by the decline in interest rates in Argentina, partially offset by 
higher deposit volumes.

Securities Services revenues of $1.4 billion increased 
24%, largely driven by a 23% increase in net interest income, 
primarily driven by higher deposit spreads and volumes, and a 
24% increase in non-interest revenue. The increase in non-
interest revenue was primarily driven by higher fees due to a 
22% increase in AUC/AUA balances, benefiting from new 
client onboarding, deepening relationships with existing 
clients and higher market valuations.

For additional information about Citi’s exposure in 

Argentina, see “Managing Global Risk—Other Risk—Country 
Risk—Argentina” below. For additional information on the 
results of operations of Services in the third quarter of 2024, 
see “Services” below.

Markets
Markets net income of $1.1 billion increased 2% from the 
prior-year period, driven by higher revenues and lower cost of 
credit, partially offset by higher expenses. Markets expenses 
of $3.3 billion increased 1%, primarily due to higher volume-
related expenses. Cost of credit was $141 million versus $162 
million in the prior-year period. The current-quarter net ACL 
build was primarily driven by changes in portfolio 
composition in spread products.

Markets revenues of $4.8 billion increased 1%, driven by 

growth in Equity Markets, up 32%, partially offset by a 6% 
decline in Fixed Income Markets. Equity Markets benefited 
from growth in prime services and higher volatility in equity 
derivatives, as well as higher cash equity volumes. The decline 
in Fixed Income Markets largely reflected a decline in rates 
and currencies revenues, partially offset by higher revenues in 
spread products and other fixed income. Rates and currencies 
revenues decreased 10%, reflecting a strong prior-year 
performance. Spread products and other fixed income 
revenues increased 5%, driven by growth in asset-backed 
financing, securitization activity and underwriting fees, 
partially offset by lower commodities revenue on lower gas 
volatility. 

For additional information on the results of operations of 

Markets in the third quarter of 2024, see “Markets” below.

Banking
Banking net income was $238 million, compared to net 
income of $156 million in the prior-year period, driven by 
higher revenues and lower expenses, partially offset by higher 
cost of credit. Banking expenses of $1.1 billion decreased 9%, 
primarily driven by benefits from prior repositioning actions. 
Cost of credit was $177 million, versus a benefit of $56 
million in the prior-year period, driven by a net ACL build due 
to changes in portfolio composition.

Banking revenues of $1.6 billion increased 16%, primarily 
driven by growth in Investment Banking. Investment Banking 
revenues increased 31%, reflecting strength in Debt Capital 
Markets (DCM), which benefited from strong issuance activity 
in the quarter, an increase in Advisory due to strong 
announced deal volume from earlier this year coming to 
fruition as those deals close and an increase in Equity Capital 
Markets (ECM) reflecting stronger follow-on activity, 
partially offset by less initial public offering (IPO) activity 
amid market volatility mid quarter. Corporate Lending 
revenues were largely unchanged, including the impact of the 
gain (loss) on loan hedges. Excluding the gain (loss) on loan 
hedges, Corporate Lending revenues increased 5%, largely 
driven by a smaller impact from currency devaluation in 
Argentina. (As used throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi’s results 
of operations and financial condition excluding the impact of 
the gains (losses) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial 
measures.) 

For additional information on the results of operations of 

Banking in the third quarter of 2024, see “Banking” below.

U.S. Personal Banking
USPB net income of $522 million decreased 31% from the 
prior-year period, driven by higher cost of credit, partially 
offset by higher revenues and lower expenses. USPB expenses 
of $2.5 billion decreased 1%, driven by continued productivity 
savings, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses. 
Cost of credit increased to $1.9 billion, compared to $1.5 
billion in the prior-year period, driven by higher net credit 
losses, partially offset by a lower net ACL build. Net credit 
losses increased 39%, primarily reflecting the continued 
maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent 
years, impacted by unprecedented levels of government 
stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was 
due to macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated 
inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both 
cards portfolios, with lower FICO band customers primarily 
driving the increase. The ACL build of $45 million was 
primarily driven by loan growth.

USPB revenues of $5.0 billion increased 3%, driven by an 

increase in net interest income due to loan growth in cards, 
and higher non-interest revenue due to lower partner 
payments. Branded Cards revenues of $2.7 billion increased 
8%, driven by interest-earning balance growth of 8%, as 
payment rates continued to moderate, and card spend volume 
growth of 3%. Retail Services revenues of $1.7 billion 
decreased 1%, primarily driven by a slowing growth rate in 
interest-earning balances and higher reversals of interest from 
net credit losses. Retail Banking revenues of $599 million 
decreased 8%, primarily driven by the impact of the transfers 
of certain relationships and the associated deposits to Wealth.
For additional information on the results of operations of 

USPB in the third quarter of 2024, see “U.S. Personal 
Banking” below.

Wealth
Wealth net income was $283 million, versus $132 million in 
the prior-year period, reflecting higher revenues and lower 
expenses, partially offset by higher cost of credit. Wealth 
expenses decreased 4% to $1.6 billion, primarily driven by 
benefits from prior repositioning and restructuring actions. 
Cost of credit was $33 million, compared to a benefit of $2 
million in the prior-year period, largely due to an ACL build 
for loans, compared to a release in the prior-year period.

Wealth revenues of $2.0 billion increased 9%, driven by a 

15% increase in non-interest revenue, reflecting higher 
investment fee revenues on momentum in client investment 
assets, as well as a 6% increase in net interest income due to 
higher deposit volumes and spreads. Private Bank revenues of 
$614 million were largely unchanged from the prior-year 
period. Wealth at Work revenues of $244 million increased 
4%, driven by improved deposit spreads and higher 
investment fee revenues, partially offset by higher mortgage 
funding costs. Citigold revenues of $1.1 billion increased 
17%, driven by higher investment fee revenues and higher 
deposit volumes. 

For additional information on the results of operations of 

Wealth in the third quarter of 2024, see “Wealth” below.

All Other (Managed Basis)
All Other (managed basis) net loss was $483 million, 
compared to a net loss of $101 million in the prior-year period, 
driven by lower revenues and higher cost of credit, partially 
offset by lower expenses. All Other (managed basis) expenses 
of $2.1 billion decreased 5%, primarily driven by lower 
expenses from the closed exits and wind-downs, partially 
offset by a legal reserve. Cost of credit of $289 million 
increased 45%, largely reflecting a net ACL build driven by 
Mexico Consumer, compared to an ACL release in the prior-
year period.

All Other (managed basis) revenues decreased 18% from 

the prior-year period, primarily driven by lower revenues in 
Corporate/Other and Legacy Franchises (managed basis). 
Legacy Franchises (managed basis) revenues were $1.7 
billion, a decline of 6% from the prior-year period, largely 
driven by lower revenues in Asia Consumer (managed basis) 
due to the closed exits and wind-downs. Corporate/Other 
revenues decreased to $86 million, from $397 million in the 
prior-year period, largely driven by margin compression on 
mortgage securities in the investment portfolio that have 
extended.

For additional information on the results of operations of 

All Other (managed basis) in the third quarter of 2024, see “All 
Other—Divestiture-Related Impacts (Reconciling Items)” and 
“All Other (Managed Basis)” below. 

Macroeconomic and Other Risks and Uncertainties 
Various geopolitical, macroeconomic and regulatory 
challenges and uncertainties continue to pose risks to 
economic conditions in the U.S. and globally, including, 
among others, potential policy and other changes resulting 
from the incoming U.S. administration and Congress, central 
bank interest rate policies, unemployment levels, economic 
growth rates, conflicts in the Middle East, economic 
conditions and tensions involving China and the Russia–
Ukraine war. These and other factors could negatively impact 
global economic growth rates, result in disruptions and 
volatility in financial markets and cause a recession in various 
regions and countries globally. These and other factors could 
also adversely affect Citi’s customers, clients, businesses, 
funding costs, cost of credit and overall results of operations 
and financial condition during the remainder of 2024. For a 
further discussion of trends, uncertainties and risks that will or 
could impact Citi’s businesses, results of operations, capital 
and other financial conditions during the remainder of 2024, 
see “Third Quarter of 2024 Results Summary” above and each 
respective business’s results of operations, “Managing Global 
Risk,” including “Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—
Country Risk—Russia” and “—Argentina,” and “Forward-
Looking Statements” below and “Risk Factors” in Citi’s 2023 
Form 10-K. 

CITI’S MULTIYEAR TRANSFORMATION

As previously disclosed, Citi’s transformation, including the 
remediation of its 2020 consent orders with the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) and Office of 
the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the amendment to 
the 2020 OCC consent order, is a multiyear endeavor that is 
not linear. Citi is modernizing and simplifying the Company in 
order to lead in a dynamic, competitive and digital world. 
Citi’s transformation is addressing decades of underinvestment 
in its infrastructure, going beyond remedying regulatory 
concerns to intentionally transform how the organization 
operates, and making investments that not only support current 
needs, but also benefit the Company over the long term. For 
additional information on Citi’s transformation, including 
focus areas and status, consent order compliance, governance 
and transformation bonus program, see “Citi’s Multiyear 
Transformation” in Citi’s Second Quarter of 2024 Form 10-Q.
Transformation efforts of this scale involve significant 

complexities and uncertainties, including ongoing regulatory 
challenges and risks. Citi’s transformation initiatives will take 
several years to complete, and, as previously disclosed, Citi 
may continue to experience significant challenges in satisfying 
the regulators’ expectations in both sufficiency and timing. 
For additional information about regulatory risks related to 
Citi’s transformation initiatives, see “Risk Factors—
Compliance Risks” in Citi’s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-
K.

The transformation’s target outcomes remain focused on 
changing Citi’s business and operating models such that they 
simultaneously (i) strengthen controls, enhance data quality, 
reduce risk and improve Citi’s regulatory compliance and its 
culture, and (ii) enhance Citi’s value to customers, clients and 
shareholders. Examples of Citi’s transformation progress 
through the third quarter of 2024 include:

•

•

•

•

•

•

Closed the 2013 consent order with the FRB related to 
anti-money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act deficiencies 
Retired approximately 450 legacy applications through 
third-quarter 2024 year-to-date, and over 1,250 since 
2022, as Citi continued to modernize its technology 
infrastructure
Launched a strategic operations capacity planning tool, 
which is assisting Citi to streamline and replace various 
systems and forecast resources needed for expected 
processing volumes
Continued implementation of a strategic loan servicing 
platform, with live transactions on the platform increasing 
to approximately $25 billion in notional value
Reduced data center consumption through migration of 
workload to a private cloud and streamlined and reduced 
the time involved in the cloud onboarding process from 
over seven weeks to two weeks 
Upgraded 100% of Citi’s over 2,300 ATMs in North 
America, Singapore, Hong Kong and the UAE to next-
generation software for better customer security and 
monitoring

(1)  The return on average common stockholders’ equity is calculated using net income less preferred stock dividends divided by average common stockholders’ 

equity. The return on average total Citigroup stockholders’ equity is calculated using net income divided by average Citigroup stockholders’ equity.

(2)  RoTCE and TBVPS are non-GAAP financial measures. For information on RoTCE and TBVPS, see “Capital Resources—Tangible Common Equity, Book Value 

Per Share, Tangible Book Value Per Share and Return on Equity” below.

(3)  Citi’s binding CET1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach, whereas Citi’s binding Total Capital ratio was 
derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework for both periods presented. As of September 30, 2024, the Total Capital ratio under the Basel III 
Advanced Approaches framework became the most binding ratio. In prior quarters, the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio under the Basel III Standardized 
Approach was the most binding ratio. 

(4)  Dividends declared per common share as a percentage of net income per diluted share. 
(5)  Total common dividends declared plus common share repurchases as a percentage of net income available to common shareholders (Net income less preferred 

dividends). See “Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity,” Note 10 and “Equity Security Repurchases” below for the component details.

SERVICES

Services includes Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS) and Securities Services. TTS provides an integrated suite of tailored cash 
management, trade and working capital solutions to multinational corporations, financial institutions and public sector organizations. 
Securities Services provides cross-border support for clients, including on-the-ground local market expertise, post-trade technologies, 
customized data solutions and a wide range of securities services solutions that can be tailored to meet clients’ needs.

Services revenue is generated primarily from spreads and fees associated with these activities. Services earns spread revenue 
through generating deposits, as well as interest on loans. Revenue generated from these activities is primarily recorded in Net interest 
income. Fee income is earned for assisting clients with transactional services and clearing. Revenue generated from these activities is 
recorded in Commissions and fees. Revenue is also generated from assets under custody and administration and is recognized when 
the associated service is satisfied, which normally occurs at the point in time the service is requested by the client and provided by 
Citi. Revenue generated from these activities is primarily recorded in Administration and other fiduciary fees. For additional 
information on these various types of revenues, see Note 5. Services revenues also include revenues earned by Citi that are subject to a 
revenue sharing arrangement with Banking—Corporate Lending for Investment Banking, Markets and Services products sold to 
Corporate Lending clients.

At September 30, 2024, Services had $608 billion in assets and $826 billion in deposits. Securities Services managed $26.3 
trillion in assets under custody and administration, of which Citi provided both custody and administrative services to certain clients 
related to $2.1 trillion of such assets.

3Q24 vs. 3Q23
Net income of $1.7 billion increased 23%, driven by higher 
revenues, partially offset by higher expenses and higher cost 
of credit.

Revenues increased 8%, primarily reflecting higher 
revenues in Securities Services and TTS. The increase in 
revenues was driven by higher non-interest revenue (up 33%), 
largely due to a smaller impact of the Argentine peso 
devaluation. Excluding the impact of the Argentine peso 
devaluation (approximately $42 million in the current quarter 
and approximately $273 million in the prior-year period), non-
interest revenue increased 11%, driven by continued strength 
across underlying fee drivers in TTS and Securities Services. 
Net interest income was largely unchanged, as the benefit of 
higher deposit volumes was offset by a decline in interest rates 
in Argentina. Average deposits increased 4%, driven by 
growth in both Securities Services and TTS, as Citi continued 
to increase operating deposits in both businesses.

TTS revenues increased 4%, as a 41% increase in non-
interest revenues was partially offset by a 5% decrease in net 
interest income. The increase in non-interest revenue was 
driven by the smaller impact from currency devaluation in 
Argentina, as well as growth in underlying fee drivers, 
including cross-border transaction value (up 8%), U.S. dollar 
clearing volume (up 7%) and commercial card spend volume 
(up 8%). The decrease in net interest income was driven by the 

decline in interest rates in Argentina, partially offset by higher 
deposit volumes. Average deposits increased 2%, driven by 
growth in both North America and International. For 
additional information about Citi’s exposure in Argentina, see 
“Managing Global Risk—Other Risk—Country Risk—
Argentina” below.

Securities Services revenues increased 24%, largely 

driven by a 23% increase in net interest income, primarily 
driven by higher deposit spreads and volumes, and a 24% 
increase in non-interest revenue. Average deposits increased 
13%, driven by growth in both North America and 
International. The growth in non-interest revenue was 
primarily driven by the increase in volume-related fees due to 
a 22% increase in AUC/AUA balances, benefiting from new 
client onboarding, deepening relationships with existing 
clients and higher market valuations, as well as continued 
elevated levels of corporate activity in Issuer Services.

Expenses increased 3%, primarily driven by continued 
investments in technology, other risk and controls and product 
innovation. 

Provisions were $127 million, compared to $95 million in 

the prior-year period. The current-quarter net ACL build of 
$113 million, compared to $68 million in the prior-year 
period, was largely due to an increase in transfer risk 
associated with unremittable corporate dividends outside the 
U.S. being held on behalf of clients, driven by safety and

3Q24 YTD vs. 3Q23 YTD
Net income of $4.6 billion increased 20%, primarily driven by 
higher revenues and lower cost of credit, partially offset by 
higher expenses.

Revenues increased 7%, driven by higher revenues in both 

Securities Services and TTS, reflecting higher non-interest 
revenue and higher net interest income.

TTS revenues increased 3%, driven by a 21% increase in 
non-interest revenue, partially offset by a 1% decrease in net 
interest income, largely driven by the same factors described 
above. The increase in non-interest revenue was driven by the 
smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina, as 
well as continued growth in underlying fee drivers, including 
higher cross-border transaction value (up 8%), U.S. dollar 
clearing volume (up 6%) and commercial card spend volume 
(up 6%).

Securities Services revenues increased 17%, driven by 
18% growth in net interest income and 17% growth in non-
interest revenue. The increase in net interest income was 
driven by spread improvement from higher interest rates 
across currencies and deposit mix. The increase in non-interest 
revenue was driven by the same factors described above.

Expenses were up 7%, primarily driven by continued 
investments in technology, other risk and controls and product 
innovation, as well as an Argentina-related transaction tax 
expense and a legal settlement expense in the second quarter 
of 2024.

Provisions were $164 million, compared to $304 million 

in the prior-year period. Net credit losses decreased to $20 
million, compared to $46 million in the prior-year period. The 
net ACL build was $144 million, compared to $258 million in 
the prior-year period. The net ACL build in the current period 
was primarily driven by an increase in transfer risk associated 
with unremittable corporate dividends outside the U.S. being 
held on behalf of clients, driven by safety and soundness 
considerations under U.S. banking law, partially offset by an 
improved macroeconomic outlook.

MARKETS

Markets provides corporate, institutional and public sector clients around the world with a full range of sales and trading services 
across equities, foreign exchange, rates, spread products and commodities. The range of services includes market-making across asset 
classes, risk management solutions, financing, prime brokerage, research, securities clearing and settlement.

As a market maker, Markets facilitates transactions, including holding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the 
differential between the price at which it buys and sells the products. These price differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on 
the inventory are recorded in Principal transactions. Other primarily includes realized gains and losses on available-for-sale (AFS) 
debt securities, gains and losses on equity securities not held in trading accounts and other non-recurring gains and losses. Interest 
income earned on assets held, less interest paid on long- and short-term debt, secured funding transactions and customer deposits, is 
recorded as Net interest income.

The amount and types of Markets revenues are impacted by a variety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity; changes in 

market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as well as their 
implied volatilities; investor confidence; and other macroeconomic conditions. Markets revenues include revenues earned by Citi that 
are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement with Banking—Corporate Lending for Investment Banking, Markets and Services 
products sold to Corporate Lending clients. 

Assuming all other market conditions do not change, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in 
increases in revenues. However, changes in market conditions can significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads and the 
fair value of product inventory. Management of the Markets businesses involves daily monitoring and evaluation of the above factors.
Markets’ international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 95 

countries and jurisdictions.

3Q24 vs. 3Q23
Net income of $1.1 billion increased 2%, driven by higher 
revenues and lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher 
expenses.

Revenues increased 1%, driven by higher Equity Markets 

revenues, partially offset by lower Fixed Income Markets 
revenues.

Fixed Income Markets revenues decreased 6%, reflecting 

a decline in rates and currencies revenues, partially offset by 
higher revenues in spread products and other fixed income. 
Rates and currencies revenues decreased 10% on strong prior-
year performance, partially offset by growth in FX on higher 
corporate client activity. Spread products and other fixed 
income revenues increased 5%, driven by growth in asset-
backed financing, securitization activity and underwriting fees. 
This revenue growth was partially offset by a decline in 
commodities revenues on lower overall volatility. 

Equity Markets revenues increased 32%, driven by 

growth in prime services, higher volatility in equity 
derivatives and higher cash equity volumes. Equity Markets 
continued to grow prime balances. 

Expenses increased 1%, driven by higher volume-related 

expenses, partially offset by efficiency savings. 

Provisions were $141 million, compared to $162 million 

in the prior-year period, driven by a lower net ACL build of 
$117 million, compared to $166 million in the prior-year 
period, partially offset by higher net credit losses. The net 
ACL build in the current quarter was primarily driven by

Net income of $3.9 billion decreased 2%, driven by higher 
expenses and higher cost of credit.

Revenues were largely unchanged, as lower Fixed Income 

Markets revenues were offset by higher Equity Markets 
revenues.

Fixed Income Markets revenues decreased 7%, reflecting 

a decline in rates and currencies revenues, partially offset by 
higher revenues in spread products and other fixed income. 
Rates and currencies revenues decreased 15%, largely 
reflecting lower volatility and a strong prior-year performance. 
Spread products and other fixed income revenues increased 
18%, largely driven by increased client activity, driven by the 
same factors described above. These increases were partially 
offset by a decline in commodities revenues on lower overall 
volatility.

Equity Markets revenues increased 24%, driven by 

continued growth in equity derivative revenues on higher 
volatility, which also includes the impact from an episodic 
gain related to the Visa B exchange. The increase was also 
driven by growth in prime services and cash trading due to 
higher volumes and trading activity. Equity Markets also 
continued to experience an increase in prime balances.
Expenses increased 2%, primarily driven by legal 
settlement reserves and higher volume-related expenses, 
partially offset by productivity savings. 

Provisions were $329 million, compared to $229 million 
in the prior-year period, primarily driven by higher net credit 
losses, partially offset by a lower net ACL build.

Investment banking fees are primarily composed of underwriting, advisory, loan syndication structuring and other related financing activity.
Includes revenues earned by Citi that are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement with Banking—Corporate Lending for Investment Banking, Markets and 
Services products sold to Corporate Lending clients.

(3)  Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. Gain (loss) on 

loan hedges includes the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives, partially offset by the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. Hedges 
on accrual loans reflect the mark-to-market on credit derivatives used to economically hedge the corporate loan accrual portfolio. The fixed premium costs of 
these hedges are netted against the corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. Citigroup’s results of operations excluding the impact of gain 
(loss) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures. 

(4)  Management uses this information in reviewing the segment’s results and believes it is useful to investors concerning underlying segment performance and trends.
(5)  Excludes loans that are carried at fair value for all periods. 
NM  Not meaningful

The discussion of the results of operations for Banking below excludes (where noted) the impact of any gain (loss) on hedges of 
accrual loans, which are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table 
above.

3Q24 vs. 3Q23
Net income was $238 million, compared to net income of $156 
million in the prior-year period, driven by higher revenues and 
lower expenses, partially offset by an increase in cost of credit. 

Revenues increased 16% (including losses on loan 

hedges), reflecting higher Investment Banking revenues, 
largely driven by continued strong issuance activity in Debt 
Capital Markets (DCM) and strong deal volume in Advisory. 
The losses on loan hedges increased to $79 million, compared 
to $47 million in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact 
of losses on loan hedges, Banking revenues increased 18%.

Investment Banking revenues increased 31%, reflecting 
overall higher banking fees revenue. DCM underwriting fees 
increased 75%, benefiting from strong issuance activity in the 
quarter, primarily in investment-grade activity, as clients 
pulled forward activity ahead of the U.S. election. Citi expects 
normalization and ordinary seasonality in investment-grade 
activity in the fourth quarter of 2024. Advisory fees increased 
32%, due to strong announced deal volume from earlier this 
year coming to fruition as those transactions close. ECM 
underwriting fees increased 5%, due to stronger follow-on 
activity, partially offset by less IPO activity amid market 
volatility mid quarter. 

Corporate Lending revenues were largely unchanged, 
including the impact of losses on loan hedges. Excluding the 
impact of losses on loan hedges, Corporate Lending revenues 
increased 5%, primarily driven by a smaller impact from 
currency devaluation in Argentina.

Expenses decreased 9%, primarily driven by benefits of 

prior repositioning actions and other actions to lower the 
expense base.

Provisions were $177 million, compared to a benefit of 
$56 million in the prior-year period, driven by a net ACL build 
of $141 million, compared to a net release of $85 million in 
the prior-year period. The ACL build in the current quarter 
was primarily driven by changes in portfolio composition. For 
additional information on Citi’s ACL, see “Significant 
Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” below.

portfolio, see “Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk—

3Q24 YTD vs. 3Q23 YTD
Net income was $1.2 billion, compared to net income of $261 
million in the prior-year period, driven by higher revenues and 
lower expenses, partially offset by an increase in cost of credit. 

Revenues increased 33% (including loss on loan hedges), 

primarily reflecting higher Investment Banking revenues 
driven by the same factors described above, higher revenues in 
Corporate Lending and lower losses on loan hedges ($174 
million versus $312 million in the prior-year period). 
Excluding the impact of losses on loan hedges, Banking 
revenues increased 27%.

Investment Banking revenues increased 39%, primarily 
driven by the DCM business, as improved market sentiment 
led to an increase in issuance activity. DCM underwriting fees 
increased 74%, driven by the same factors described above. 
Fees from ECM underwriting and Advisory each increased 
22%, driven by favorable market conditions and the same 
factors described above.

Corporate Lending revenues increased 25%, including the 

impact of losses on loan hedges. Excluding the impact of 
losses on loan hedges, Corporate Lending revenues increased 
15%, largely driven by higher revenue share.

Expenses decreased 8%, primarily driven by benefits of 

prior repositioning actions and other actions to lower the 
expense base.

Provisions were $16 million, compared to a benefit of 

$327 million in the prior-year period. Net credit losses 
increased to $142 million, compared to $98 million in the 
prior-year period. The net ACL release was $126 million, 
compared to $425 million in the prior-year period. The net 
ACL release in the current period was primarily driven by an 
improved macroeconomic outlook.

3Q24 YTD vs. 3Q23 YTD
Year-to-date, USPB experienced similar trends to those 
described above. Net income was $1.0 billion, compared to 
$1.6 billion in the prior-year period, reflecting higher cost of 
credit, partially offset by higher revenues and lower expenses.
Revenues increased 6%, reflecting the same factors 

described above. 

Cards revenues increased 7%. Branded Cards revenues 
increased 7%, reflecting the same factors described above. 

Retail Services revenues increased 8%, driven by higher 

non-interest revenue due to lower partner payments, driven by 
higher net credit losses, as well as higher net interest income 
on higher interest-earning balances. 

Retail Banking revenues decreased 1%, driven by the 

impact of the transfers of certain relationships and the 
associated deposit balances to Wealth, partially offset by 
higher deposit spreads, as well as mortgage and installment 
loan growth. 

Expenses decreased 1%, driven by continued productivity 
savings and lower technology costs, partially offset by higher 
volume-related expenses.

Provisions were $6.4 billion, compared to $4.6 billion in 

the prior-year period, largely driven by higher net credit 
losses, partially offset by a lower ACL build for loans. Net 
credit losses of $5.7 billion increased 56%, driven by the same 
factors described above. Branded Cards net credit losses of $3 
billion increased 63% and Retail Services net credit losses of 
$2.4 billion were up 50%.

The net ACL build was $0.8 billion, compared to $1.0 

billion in the prior-year period. The net ACL build in the 
current period primarily reflected the impact of 
macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary 
and interest rate environment.

3Q24 vs. 3Q23 
Net income was $522 million, compared to $756 million in the 
prior-year period, driven by higher cost of credit, partially 
offset by higher revenues and lower expenses.

Revenues increased 3%, due to higher net interest income 

(up 2%), driven by loan growth in cards, as well as higher 
non-interest revenue (up 4%). The increase in non-interest 
revenue was largely driven by lower partner payments in 
Retail Services, due to higher net credit losses.

Cards revenues increased 4%. Branded Cards revenues 
increased 8%, driven by interest-earning balance growth (up 
8%), as payment rates continued to moderate, and card spend 
volume growth. Branded Cards average loans increased 8%, 
also reflecting the lower card payment rates and higher card 
spend volume. Branded Cards card spend volume increased 
3%, driven by higher FICO band customers. 

Retail Services revenues decreased 1%, primarily driven 

by a slowing growth rate in interest-earnings balances and 
higher reversals of interest from net credit losses. The decrease 
in revenues was partially offset by higher non-interest revenue 
due to the lower partner payments, driven by the higher net 
credit losses (see “Provisions” below and Note 5). Retail 
Services average loans increased 2%, largely reflecting lower 
card payment rates, partially offset by lower card spend 
volume. Card spend volume decreased 7%, primarily due to 
continued lower in-store foot traffic.

Retail Banking revenues decreased 8%, primarily driven 
by the impact of the transfers of certain relationships and the 
associated deposit balances to Wealth. Average deposits 
decreased 23%, largely reflecting the transfers of certain 
relationships and the associated deposits to Wealth ($26 billion 
at the time of transfer over the last 12 months). 

Expenses decreased 1%, driven by continued productivity 

savings, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses.

Provisions were $1.9 billion, compared to $1.5 billion in 

the prior-year period, driven by higher net credit losses, 
partially offset by a lower net ACL build for loans. Net credit 
losses of $1.9 billion increased 39%, primarily reflecting the 
continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages 
originated in recent years, impacted by unprecedented levels 
of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the 
increase was driven by macroeconomic pressures related to the 
elevated inflationary and interest rate environment impacting 
both cards portfolios, with lower FICO band customers 
primarily driving the increase. Branded Cards net credit losses 
of $1.0 billion increased 41%, and Retail Services net credit 
losses of $0.8 billion increased 38%.

The net ACL build was $45 million, compared to $116 

million in the prior-year period. The net ACL build in the 
current quarter primarily reflected loan growth. For additional 
information on Citi’s ACL, see “Significant Accounting 
Policies and Significant Estimates” below.

Includes assets under management, and trust and custody assets. 

3Q24 vs. 3Q23 
Net income was $283 million, compared to $132 million in the 
prior-year period, driven by higher revenues and lower 
expenses, partially offset by higher cost of credit.

Revenues increased 9%, driven by higher non-interest 
revenue (up 15%), reflecting higher investment fee revenues 
on momentum in client investment assets, as well as an 
increase in net interest income (up 6%), driven by higher 
deposit volumes and spreads. 

Client balances increased 14%, primarily driven by higher 

client investment assets (up 24%), reflecting higher market 
valuations and strong net new assets generation. 

Average deposits increased 4%, reflecting the transfers of 

relationships and the associated deposits from USPB ($26 
billion at the time of transfer over the last 12 months), partially 
offset by a shift in deposits to higher-yielding investments on 
Citi’s platform. Average loans decreased 1%, as Wealth 
continued to optimize capital usage. 

Private Bank revenues were largely unchanged, as the 
higher investment fee revenues and improved deposit spreads 
were offset by higher mortgage funding costs. 

Wealth at Work revenues increased 4%, driven by 
improved deposit spreads and the higher investment fee 
revenues, partially offset by higher mortgage funding costs. 
Citigold revenues increased 17%, driven by the higher 

investment fee revenues and higher deposit volumes. 

Expenses decreased 4%, primarily driven by the benefits 

of prior repositioning and restructuring actions.

Provisions were a cost of $33 million, compared to a 
benefit of $2 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by 
a net ACL build for loans, compared to a release in the prior-
year period. For additional information on Citi’s ACL, see 
“Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” 
below.

For additional information on Wealth’s loan portfolios, 
see “Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk—Consumer Credit” 
below.

For additional information about trends, uncertainties and 

risks related to Wealth’s future results, see “Executive 
Summary” above and “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” in 
Citi’s 2023 Form 10-K.

3Q24 YTD vs. 3Q23 YTD
Net income was $668 million, compared to $398 million in the 
prior-year period, reflecting higher revenues, lower expenses 
and lower cost of credit.

Revenues increased 3%, largely driven by an increase in 
non-interest revenue (up 13%), reflecting higher investment 
fee revenues, partially offset by lower net interest income 
(down 3%), mainly due to lower deposit spreads and higher 
mortgage funding costs. 

Private Bank revenues were largely unchanged. Wealth at 

Work revenues decreased 5%, driven by higher mortgage 
funding costs and lower deposit spreads, partially offset by 
higher investment fee revenues. Citigold revenues increased 
6%, driven by higher investment fee revenues and higher 
deposit volumes.

Expenses decreased 2%, mainly driven by benefits from 
prior repositioning and restructuring actions, partially offset by 
higher volume-related expenses and technology investments 
focused on risk and controls and platform enhancements. 

Provisions were a benefit of $146 million, compared to a 

benefit of $7 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by 
a higher net ACL release. The higher net ACL release was 
primarily driven by a change in the ACL associated with the 
margin lending portfolio.

ALL OTHER—Divestiture-Related Impacts (Reconciling Items)

All Other includes activities not assigned to the reportable operating segments (Services, Markets, Banking, USPB and Wealth), 
including Legacy Franchises and Corporate/Other. For additional information about Legacy Franchises and Corporate/Other, see “All 
Other (Managed Basis)” below.

All Other (managed basis) results exclude divestiture-related impacts (see the “Reconciling Items” column in the table below) 
related to (i) Citi’s divestitures of its Asia consumer banking businesses and (ii) the planned IPO of Mexico consumer banking and 
small business and middle-market banking, within Legacy Franchises. Legacy Franchises (managed basis) results also exclude these 
divestiture-related impacts. Certain of the results of operations of All Other (managed basis) and Legacy Franchises (managed basis) 
are non-GAAP financial measures (see “Overview—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” above).

The table below presents a reconciliation from All Other (U.S. GAAP) to All Other (managed basis). All Other (U.S. GAAP), less 

Reconciling Items, equals All Other (managed basis). The Reconciling Items are fully reflected on each respective line item in Citi’s 
Consolidated Statement of Income.

ALL OTHER—Managed Basis

At September 30, 2024, All Other (managed basis) had $195 billion in assets, primarily related to Mexico Consumer/SBMM and Asia 
Consumer reported within Legacy Franchises (managed basis), as well as Corporate Treasury investment securities and Citi’s deferred 
tax assets (DTAs) reported within Corporate/Other.

Legacy Franchises (Managed Basis)
Legacy Franchises (managed basis) includes (i) Mexico Consumer Banking (Mexico Consumer) and Mexico Small Business and 
Middle-Market Banking (Mexico SBMM), collectively Mexico Consumer/SBMM, (ii) Asia Consumer Banking (Asia Consumer), 
representing the consumer banking operations of the remaining three exit countries (Korea, Poland and Russia), as well as residual 
China portfolios being wound down, and (iii) Legacy Holdings Assets, primarily legacy consumer mortgage loans in North America, 
as well as the U.K. retail banking business, both of which Citi continues to wind down.

Mexico Consumer/SBMM operates in Mexico through Citibanamex and provides traditional retail banking and branded card 
products to consumers and small business customers and traditional middle-market banking products and services to commercial 
customers. As previously disclosed, Citi intends to pursue an IPO of Mexico Consumer/SBMM operations in Mexico. Citi will retain 
its Services, Markets, Banking and Wealth businesses in Mexico. Citi currently expects that the separation of the businesses will be 
completed in the fourth quarter of 2024 and that Mexico Consumer/SBMM will be ready for an IPO by the end of 2025, subject to 
market conditions and regulatory approvals.

Legacy Franchises (managed basis) also included the following five Asia Consumer businesses prior to their sales: India and 
Vietnam, until their closings in March 2023; Taiwan, until its closing in August 2023; Indonesia until its closing in November 2023; 
and China until the completion of the sales of substantially all portfolios in July 2024. 

Citi has continued to make progress on its wind-downs in Korea and Russia. In addition, Citi has restarted the sales process of its 
consumer banking business in Poland. See Note 2 for additional information on Legacy Franchises’ consumer banking business sales 
and wind-downs. For additional information about Citi’s continued efforts to reduce its operations and exposures in Russia, see 
“Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—Russia” below and “Risk Factors” in Citi’s 2023 Form 10-K.

At September 30, 2024, on a combined basis, Legacy Franchises (managed basis) had 1,320 retail branches, $17 billion in retail 

banking loans and $43 billion in deposits. In addition, Legacy Franchises (managed basis) had $8 billion in outstanding credit card 
balances, while Mexico SBMM had $6 billion in outstanding corporate loans. 

Corporate/Other
Corporate/Other includes certain unallocated costs of global staff functions (including finance, risk, human resources, legal and 
compliance-related costs), other corporate expenses and unallocated global operations and technology expenses and income taxes, as 
well as results of Corporate Treasury investment activities and discontinued operations.

Note: Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior periods’ financial statements to conform to the current period’s presentation effective as of the second 

quarter of 2024, for all periods presented. During the second quarter of 2024, Citi made certain reclassifications to align with Citi’s transformation and strategy. In 
connection therewith, Citi transferred the retail banking business in the U.K., which is being wound down, from Wealth to Legacy Franchises (managed basis) 
within All Other (managed basis).

(1)  The key indicators for Asia Consumer reflect the reclassification of loans and deposits to Other assets and Other liabilities under HFS accounting on Citi’s 

Consolidated Balance Sheet.

3Q24 vs. 3Q23 
Net loss was $483 million, compared to a net loss of $101 
million in the prior-year period, driven by lower revenues and 
higher cost of credit, partially offset by lower expenses.

All Other (managed basis) revenues decreased 18%, 
driven by lower revenues in Corporate/Other and Legacy 
Franchises (managed basis).

Legacy Franchises (managed basis) revenues decreased 

6%, mainly due to lower revenues in Asia Consumer 
(managed basis).

Mexico Consumer/SBMM (managed basis) revenues 
were largely unchanged, as higher revenues driven mainly by 
higher loan volumes and higher fee revenues were offset by 
the depreciation of the Mexican peso. Asia Consumer 
(managed basis) revenues decreased 33%, primarily driven by 
the closed exits and wind-downs. 

3Q24 YTD vs. 3Q23 YTD
Net loss was $1.4 billion, compared to net income of $159 
million in the prior-year period, driven by lower revenues, 
higher expenses and lower income tax benefits, partially offset 
by lower cost of credit.

All Other (managed basis) revenues decreased 16%, 
driven by lower revenues in Corporate/Other and Legacy 
Franchises (managed basis).

Legacy Franchises (managed basis) revenues decreased 

5%, mainly due to lower revenues in Asia Consumer 
(managed basis) and Legacy Holdings Assets, partially offset 
by higher revenues in Mexico Consumer/SBMM (managed 
basis). 

Mexico Consumer/SBMM (managed basis) revenues 
increased 12%, primarily due to higher loan balances in retail 
banking, cards and SBMM and higher deposits in SBMM.

Corporate/Other revenues decreased to $86 million, 

Asia Consumer (managed basis) revenues decreased 47%, 

compared to $397 million in the prior-year period, largely 
driven by margin compression on mortgage securities in the 
investment portfolio that have extended.

Expenses decreased 5%, primarily driven by lower 
expenses from the closed exits and wind-downs, partially 
offset by a legal reserve. 

Provisions were $289 million, compared to $199 million 

in the prior-year period, largely reflecting a net ACL build 
driven by Mexico Consumer, compared to an ACL release in 
the prior-year period. Net credit losses of $208 million 
decreased 12%, primarily driven by the impact from the wind-
downs.

For additional information on Citi’s ACL, see 

“Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” 
below.

For additional information about trends, uncertainties and 
risks related to All Other’s (managed basis) future results, see 
“Executive Summary” above and “Managing Global Risk—
Other Risks—Country Risk—Russia” below, and “Risk 
Factors” in Citi’s 2023 Form 10-K.

primarily driven by the closed exits and wind-downs. 

Legacy Holdings Assets revenues decreased to $(109) 
million, compared to $99 million in the prior-year period, 
primarily due to higher funding costs related to the transfer of 
the retail banking business in the U.K.

Corporate/Other revenues decreased to $896 million, 
compared to $1.8 billion in the prior-year period, largely 
driven by higher funding costs.

Expenses increased 2%, primarily driven by restructuring 

charges (see Note 9), the net incremental FDIC special 
assessment and an aggregate of $136 million of civil money 
penalties imposed by the FRB and OCC in the second quarter 
of 2024, partially offset by the closed exits and wind-downs.

Provisions were $718 million, compared to $844 million 

in the prior-year period, largely driven by a lower net ACL 
build, partially offset by a 6% increase in net credit losses, 
primarily due to higher lending volumes in Mexico Consumer.
