MANAGING GLOBAL RISK

As of the third quarter of 2024, average loans for: 

•

USPB increased 7% year-over-year, driven by growth in 
Branded Cards, Retail Banking and Retail Services. 

• Wealth remained largely unchanged. 
•

Services increased 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by 
strong demand in TTS for export and agency finance, as 
well as working capital loans. 

• Markets increased 10% year-over-year, largely driven by 

asset-backed lending in spread products, as well as margin 
loans in Equities.
Banking decreased 1% year-over-year, primarily driven 
by regulatory capital optimization efforts. 

•

For Citi, effective risk management is of primary importance 
to its overall operations. Accordingly, Citi’s risk management 
process has been designed to monitor, evaluate and manage 
the principal risks it assumes in conducting its activities. 
Specifically, the activities that Citi engages in, and the risks 
those activities generate, must be consistent with Citi’s 
Mission and Value Proposition and the key Leadership 
Principles that support it, as well as Citi’s risk appetite. For 
more information on managing global risk at Citi, see 
“Managing Global Risk” in Citi’s 2023 Form 10-K.

End-of-period loans increased 3% year-over-year, largely 

reflecting growth in Branded Cards and Retail Banking in 
USPB and Markets, and were relatively unchanged 
sequentially.

On an average basis, loans increased 4% year-over-year 
and 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was largely 
due to growth in USPB, Markets and Services.

The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings 
across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison 
of credit exposure across all lines of business, geographies and 
products. Counterparty risk ratings reflect an estimated 
probability of default for a counterparty, and internal risk 
ratings are derived by leveraging validated statistical models 
and scorecards in combination with consideration of factors 
specific to the obligor or market, such as management 
experience, competitive position, regulatory environment and 
commodity prices. Facility risk ratings are assigned that reflect 
the probability of default of the obligor and factors that affect 
the loss given default of the facility, such as support or 
collateral. Internal ratings that generally correspond to BBB

Note: Total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending 
commitments. 

In addition to the obligor and facility risk ratings assigned 

to all exposures, Citi may classify exposures in the corporate 
credit portfolio. These classifications are consistent with Citi’s 
interpretation of the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of 
criticized exposures, which may categorize exposures as 
special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss.

Risk ratings and classifications are reviewed regularly and 
adjusted as appropriate. The credit review process incorporates 
quantitative and qualitative factors, including financial and 
non-financial disclosures or metrics, idiosyncratic events or 
changes to the competitive, regulatory or macroeconomic 
environment. 

Citi believes the corporate credit portfolio to be 

appropriately rated and classified as of September 30, 2024. 
Citi has applied management judgment to adjust internal 
ratings and classifications of exposures as both the 
macroeconomic environment and obligor-specific factors have 
changed, particularly where additional stress has been 
observed. 

45                                                                                                                                                                                                       

     
 
 
 
 
As obligor risk ratings are downgraded, the probability of 

default increases. Downgrades of obligor risk ratings tend to 
result in a higher provision for credit losses. In addition, 
appetite per obligor is reduced consistent with the ratings, and 
downgrades may result in the purchase of additional credit 
derivatives or other risk/structural mitigants to hedge the 
incremental credit risk, or may result in Citi seeking to reduce 
exposure to an obligor or an industry sector. Citi will continue 
to review exposures to ensure that the appropriate probability 
of default is incorporated into all risk assessments.

See Note 14 for additional information on Citi’s corporate 

credit portfolio.

with 100% rated investment grade) as of September 30, 2024.
In addition to this exposure, Citi has energy-related exposure within the public sector (e.g., energy-related state-owned entities) and the transportation and 
industrials sector (e.g., off-shore drilling entities) included in the table above. As of September 30, 2024, Citi’s total exposure to these energy-related entities was 
approximately $4.8 billion, of which approximately $2.3 billion consisted of direct outstanding funded loans.
Includes $0.9 billion and $0.1 billion of funded and unfunded exposure at September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily related to commercial credit card

Exposure to Commercial Real Estate
As of September 30, 2024, Citi’s total credit exposure to 
commercial real estate (CRE) was $64 billion (largely 
unchanged from June 30, 2024), including $6 billion of 
exposure related to office buildings. This total CRE exposure 
consisted of approximately $54 billion related to corporate 
clients, included in the real estate category in the table above, 
and approximately $10 billion related to Wealth clients that is 
not in the table above as they are not considered corporate 
exposures. 

In addition, as of September 30, 2024, approximately 79% 

of Citi’s total CRE exposure was rated investment grade and 
more than 76% was to borrowers in the U.S.

As of September 30, 2024, the ACLL attributed to the 

total funded CRE exposure (including Wealth) was 
approximately 1.62%, and there were $391 million of non-
accrual CRE loans.

Credit Risk Mitigation
As part of its overall risk management activities, Citigroup 
uses credit derivatives, both partial and full term, and other 
risk mitigants to economically hedge portions of the credit risk 
in its corporate credit portfolio, in addition to outright asset 
sales. In advance of the expiration of partial-term economic 
hedges, Citi will determine, among other factors, the economic 
feasibility of hedging the remaining life of the instrument. The 
results of the mark-to-market and any realized gains or losses 
on credit derivatives are reflected primarily in Principal 
transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

At September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and December 31, 

2023, Banking had economic hedges on the corporate credit 
portfolio of $39.7 billion, $39.7 billion and $35.9 billion, 
respectively. Citi’s expected credit loss model used in the 
calculation of its ACL does not include the favorable impact 
of credit derivatives and other mitigants that are marked-to-
market. In addition, the reported amounts of direct 
outstandings and unfunded lending commitments in the tables 
above do not reflect the impact of these hedging transactions. 
The credit protection was economically hedging underlying

U.S. Personal Banking

Branded Cards

USPB’s Branded Cards portfolio includes proprietary and 

co-branded cards.

As presented in the chart above, the third quarter of 2024 

net credit loss rate in Branded Cards decreased quarter-over-
quarter, primarily driven by seasonality, and increased year-
over-year, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of 
multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years, 
impacted by unprecedented levels of government stimulus 
during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was driven by 
macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary 
and interest rate environment, with lower FICO band 
customers primarily driving the increase.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate was broadly 
stable quarter-over-quarter, and increased year-over-year, 
primarily reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards 
loan vintages originated in recent years, impacted by 
unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the 
pandemic. In addition, the increase was driven by 
macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary 
and interest rate environment, with lower FICO band 
customers primarily driving the increase.

Retail Services

As indicated above, USPB provides credit card products 
through Branded Cards and Retail Services, and mortgages 
and home equity, small business and personal consumer loans 
through Citi’s Retail Banking network. Retail Banking is 
concentrated in six major U.S. metropolitan areas. USPB also 
provides mortgages through correspondent channels.

As of September 30, 2024, approximately 77% of USPB 

EOP loans consisted of Branded Cards and Retail Services 
credit card loans, which generally drives the overall credit 
performance of USPB, as U.S. cards net credit losses 
represented approximately 96% of total USPB net credit losses 
for the third quarter of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, 
Branded Cards represented 68% of total U.S. cards EOP loans 
and Retail Services represented 32% of U.S. cards EOP loans.
As presented in the chart above, the third quarter of 2024 

net credit loss rate in USPB decreased quarter-over-quarter, 
primarily driven by seasonality, and increased year-over-year, 
primarily reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards 
loan vintages originated in recent years, impacted by 
unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the 
pandemic. In addition, the increase was driven by 
macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary 
and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios, 
with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the 
increase.

USPB’s Retail Services partners directly with more than 
20 retailers and dealers to offer private label and co-branded 
cards. Retail Services’ target market focuses on select industry 
segments such as home improvement, specialty retail, 
consumer electronics and fuel. Retail Services continually 
evaluates opportunities to add partners within target industries 

51                                                                                                                                                                                                       

Wealth

As indicated above, Wealth provides consumer 
mortgages, margin lending, credit cards and other lending 
products to customer segments that range from affluent to 
ultra-high net worth through the Private Bank, Wealth at Work 
and Citigold businesses. These customer segments represent a 
target market that is characterized by historically low default 
rates and delinquencies and includes loans that are 
delinquency managed or classifiably managed. The 
delinquency-managed portfolio consists primarily of 
mortgages, margin lending and credit cards.

As of September 30, 2024, approximately $44 billion, or 

29%, of the portfolios were classifiably managed and 
primarily consisted of mortgage loans, margin loans, personal 
and small business loans and other lending programs. These 
classifiably managed loans are primarily evaluated for credit 
risk based on their internal risk rating, of which 72% were 
rated investment grade. While the 90+ days past due 
delinquency rates shown in the chart above were calculated 
only for the delinquency-managed portfolio, the net credit loss 
rates shown were calculated using net credit losses for both the 
delinquency and classifiably managed portfolios.

As presented in the chart above, the third quarter of 2024 
net credit loss rate and 90+ days past due delinquency rate in 
Wealth were broadly stable quarter-over-quarter and year-
over-year. The low net credit loss and 90+ days past due 
delinquency rates continued to reflect the strong credit profiles 
of the portfolios.

that have strong loyalty, lending or payment programs and 
growth potential.

As presented in the chart above, the third quarter of 2024 

net credit loss rate in Retail Services decreased quarter-over-
quarter, primarily driven by seasonality, and increased year-
over-year, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of 
multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years, 
impacted by unprecedented levels of government stimulus 
during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was driven by 
macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary 
and interest rate environment, with lower FICO band 
customers primarily driving the increase. 

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-

during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was driven by 
macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary

customers primarily driving the increase.

For additional information on cost of credit, loan 

delinquency and other information for Citi’s cards portfolios, 
see each respective business’s results of operations above and 
Note 14.

Retail Banking

USPB’s Retail Banking portfolio consists primarily of 

consumer mortgages (including home equity) and unsecured 
lending products, such as small business loans and personal 
loans. The portfolio is generally delinquency managed, where 
Citi evaluates credit risk based on FICO scores, delinquencies 
and the value of underlying collateral. The consumer 
mortgages in this portfolio have historically been extended to 
high credit quality customers, generally with loan-to-value 
ratios that are less than or equal to 80% on first and second 
mortgages. For additional information, see “Loan-to-Value 
(LTV) Ratios” in Note 14.

As presented in the chart above, the third quarter of 2024 

net credit loss rate in Retail Banking was unchanged quarter-
over-quarter, and increased year-over-year, primarily driven 
by the growth and seasoning of personal loans. The 90+ days 
past due delinquency rate was largely unchanged quarter-over-
quarter, and decreased year-over-year, primarily driven by 
lower delinquencies in U.S. mortgages.

Mexico Consumer

Mexico Consumer operates in Mexico through 

Citibanamex and provides credit cards, consumer mortgages 
and small business and personal loans. Mexico Consumer 
serves a mass-market segment in Mexico and focuses on 
developing multiproduct relationships with customers. As 
presented in the chart above, the third quarter of 2024 net 
credit loss rate in Mexico Consumer increased quarter-over-
quarter, primarily driven by seasonality, and increased year-
over-year, primarily driven by the ongoing normalization of 
loss rates from post-pandemic lows.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-

over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily driven by the 
ongoing normalization from post-pandemic lows.

and other information for Citi’s consumer loan portfolios, see

recent years, impacted by unprecedented levels of government 
stimulus during the pandemic, as well as macroeconomic 
pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate 
environment impacting both cards portfolios. The FICO 
distribution continued to reflect strong underlying credit 
quality of the portfolios. See Note 14 for additional 
information on FICO scores.

(1) End-of-period (EOP) loans include interest and fees on credit cards.
(2) The ratios of 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due are calculated based on EOP loans, net of unearned income.
(3) The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios for Retail Banking exclude loans guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies since the 

potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) 
were $60 million ($0.5 billion), $63 million ($0.5 billion) and $61 million ($0.5 billion) at September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, 
respectively. The amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP 
loans) were $69 million, $75 million and $70 million at September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The EOP loans in the table 
include the guaranteed loans.

(4) The 90+ days past due balances for Branded Cards and Retail Services are generally still accruing interest. Citi’s policy is generally to accrue interest on credit 

card loans until 180 days past due, unless notification of bankruptcy filing has been received earlier.

(5) Excludes EOP classifiably managed Private Bank loans. These loans are not included in the delinquency numerator, denominator and ratios. 
(6) These loans are evaluated for non-accrual status and write-off primarily based on their internal risk classification and not solely on their delinquency status, and, 

therefore, delinquency metrics are excluded from this table. As of September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, 72%, 75% and 95% of Wealth 
classifiably managed loans were rated investment grade. For additional information on the credit quality of the Wealth portfolio, including classifiably managed 
portfolios, see “Consumer Credit Trends” above.

(7) Asia Consumer includes delinquencies and loans in Poland and Russia for all periods presented.
(8) Citi has entered into agreements to sell certain Asia Consumer banking businesses. Accordingly, the loans of these businesses have been reclassified as HFS in 
Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and, hence, the loans and related delinquencies and ratios are not included in this table. The most recent 
reclassifications commenced as follows: Taiwan and Indonesia in the first quarter of 2022; Taiwan closed in the third quarter of 2023 and Indonesia closed in the 
fourth quarter of 2023. See Note 2.

(9) The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are primarily related to U.S. mortgages guaranteed by U.S. 
government-sponsored agencies since the potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the U.S. agencies. The amounts excluded for 90+ days past due and

2023, respectively. The amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due 
EOP loans) were $35 million, $42 million and $36 million at September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The EOP loans in the table

(1) North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Mexico is included in offices outside North America. The classification of corporate loans between 

offices in North America and outside North America is based on the domicile of the booking unit. The difference between the domicile of the booking unit and the 
domicile of the managing unit is not material.

March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Unearned income on consumer loans primarily represents loan origination fees, net of 
certain direct origination costs, that are deferred and recognized as Interest income over the lives of the related loans.

(4) Corporate loans include Mexico SBMM loans and are net of unearned income of ($912) million, ($917) million, ($968) million, ($917) million and ($806) million 
at September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Unearned income on corporate loans primarily 
represents loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, that are deferred and recognized as Interest income over the lives of the related loans. 

(5) Because loans carried at fair value do not have an ACLL, they are excluded from the ACLL ratio calculation.

For additional information on Citi’s non-accrual loans and 
assets, see “Non-Accrual Loans and Assets” in Citi’s 2023 
Form 10-K.

Non-Accrual Loans
The table below summarizes Citigroup’s non-accrual loans 
(NAL) as of the periods indicated. Non-accrual loans may still 
be current on interest payments. In situations where Citi 
reasonably expects that only a portion of the principal owed 
will ultimately be collected, all payments received are 
reflected as a reduction of principal and not as interest income. 
For all other non-accrual loans, cash interest receipts are 
generally recorded as revenue.

(1) Corporate loans are placed on non-accrual status based on a review by Citigroup’s risk officers. Corporate non-accrual loans may still be current on interest 

payments. With limited exceptions, the following practices are applied for consumer loans: consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are placed on 
non-accrual status at 90 days past due and are charged off at 120 days past due; residential mortgage loans are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and 
written down to net realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent with industry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest on credit card loans until such 
loans are charged off, which typically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency. As such, the non-accrual loan disclosures do not include credit card loans. The 
balances above represent non-accrual loans within Corporate loans and Consumer loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

(2) Approximately 64%, 68%, 61%, 50% and 62% of Citi’s corporate non-accrual loans remain current on interest and principal payments at September 30, 2024, 

June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively.

(3) The September 30, 2024 total corporate non-accrual loans represented 0.31% of total corporate loans.
(4) The increase at September 30, 2023 was primarily related to two commercial real estate loans. The decrease at June 30, 2024 was primarily related to commercial 

real estate loans.

(5)  Asia Consumer includes balances in Poland and Russia for all periods presented.

Similar requirements applicable to country legal entities, 

material legal entities (as defined in the public section of Citi’s 
2023 resolution plan) or other legal entities are specified in the 
Liquidity Risk Management Procedures (Procedures). The 
Procedures provide for liquidity risk management, risk 
identification, risk appetite, risk limits and triggers, and 
monitoring including escalation, stress testing, risk reporting, 
training and review, oversight and approval of key liquidity 
risk proposals, and analytical tools applicable to the entities 
within the Procedures’ scope. In addition, the Procedures 
provide for data governance, roles and responsibilities, and 
reference to frameworks within Citi’s liquidity management. 
Liquidity risk in foreign jurisdictions and legal entities is 

managed as part of Citi’s legal entity liquidity management 
framework (similar to Citigroup and Citibank), in which legal 
entities, including those in foreign jurisdictions, are subject to 
regulatory and internal liquidity stress tests on a standalone 
basis, managed against legal entity limits set in accordance 
with Citi’s risk appetite and governed by local governance 
forums. Citi also has other local governance forums for 
managing its balance sheet and liquidity at various 
organizational levels, including material legal entities.

Citi’s Chief Risk Officer and Chief Financial Officer co-
chair Citigroup’s ALCO, which includes Citi’s Treasurer and 
other senior executives. The ALCO sets the strategy of the 
liquidity portfolio and monitors portfolio performance (see 
“Risk Governance—Board and Executive Management 
Committees” in Citi’s 2023 Form 10-K). Significant changes 
to portfolio asset allocations require approval by the ALCO.

LIQUIDITY RISK

For additional information on funding and liquidity at Citi, 
including objectives and stress testing, see “Liquidity Risk” 
and “Risk Factors—Liquidity Risks” in Citi’s 2023 Form 10-
K.

Overview
Citi’s liquidity is managed centrally by Corporate Treasury 
through the Liquidity Risk Management Policy (Policy), 
which sets forth the minimum requirements for identifying, 
measuring, monitoring, controlling and reporting liquidity 
risk, consistent with Citi’s risk appetite in conjunction with 
local treasurers and with oversight provided by Independent 
Risk Management and the Citigroup Asset and Liability 
Committee (ALCO). The Policy establishes the framework for 
sound management of Citi’s liquidity risk, to facilitate 
transparency and comparability of liquidity risk-taking 
activities, and supports Citi’s maintenance of adequate 
liquidity, including a cushion of unencumbered, high-quality 
liquid assets, to withstand a range of stress events including 
those involving the loss or impairment of both unsecured and 
secured funding sources.

Citi’s enterprise-wide liquidity management framework 

establishes a risk appetite that is expressed as a set of 
quantitative minimum levels for Citigroup and Citibank, 
consolidated to maintain liquidity levels above limits for the 
U.S. Liquidity Coverage ratio (LCR), U.S. Net Stable Funding 
ratio (NSFR) and Internal Liquidity Stress Tests (ILST). 
Liquidity concentration risk, which is defined as liquidity risk 
due to funding concentration to a specific counterparty, 
industry, product type or maturity, among other categories, is 
an integral part of Citi’s liquidity management framework and 
is managed in accordance with established risk appetite limits. 
For example, product or industry concentration limits consider 
specific attributes of a product (e.g., wholesale deposits, 
secured versus unsecured, etc.).

Note: The amounts in the table above are presented on an average basis. For securities, the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be realized and, 
therefore, exclude any securities that are encumbered and incorporate any haircuts applicable under the U.S. LCR rule. The table above incorporates various restrictions 
that could limit the transferability of liquidity between legal entities, including Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. Changes in HQLA line categories from the 
prior-year period were primarily driven by the re-allocation of nontransferable HQLA, which did not change total average HQLA, and thus did not impact Citi’s LCR 
ratio.
(1)  Foreign government debt includes securities issued or guaranteed by foreign sovereigns, agencies and multilateral development banks. Foreign government debt 

securities are held largely to support local liquidity requirements and Citi’s local franchises and principally include government bonds from Japan, Korea, Mexico, 
India and Hong Kong.

The table above includes average amounts of HQLA held 
at Citigroup’s operating entities that are eligible for inclusion 
in the calculation of Citigroup’s consolidated LCR, pursuant 
to the U.S. LCR rules. These amounts include the HQLA 
needed to meet the minimum requirements at these entities as 
well as any amounts in excess of these minimums that are 
available to be transferred to other entities within Citigroup. 
Citigroup’s average HQLA increased quarter-over-quarter as 
of the third quarter of 2024, primarily driven by an increase in 
non-U.S. sovereign debt. 

As of September 30, 2024, Citigroup had approximately 
$959 billion of available liquidity resources to support client 
and business needs, including end-of-period HQLA ($561 
billion); additional unencumbered HQLA, including excess 
liquidity held at bank entities that is non-transferable to other 
entities within Citigroup ($252 billion); and unused borrowing 
capacity from available assets not already accounted for within 
Citi’s HQLA to support additional advances from the Federal 
Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and the Federal Reserve Bank 
discount window ($146 billion).

Short-Term Liquidity Measurement: Liquidity Coverage 
Ratio (LCR)
In addition to internal 30-day liquidity stress testing performed 
for Citi’s major entities, operating subsidiaries and countries, 
Citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the LCR. The 
table below details the components of Citi’s LCR calculation 
and HQLA in excess of net outflows for the periods indicated:

As of September 30, 2024, Citigroup’s average LCR was 

unchanged from the quarter ended June 30, 2024, as Citi’s 
average HQLA and net outflows increased proportionately.
In addition, considering Citi’s total available liquidity 

resources at quarter end of $959 billion, Citi maintained 
approximately $489 billion of excess liquidity resources above 
the stressed average net outflow of approximately $470 
billion, presented in the LCR table above.

Long-Term Liquidity Measurement: Net Stable Funding 
Ratio (NSFR)
The NSFR is required by a rule promulgated by the U.S. 
banking agencies and measures the availability of a bank’s 
stable funding against the required stable funding in 
accordance with the calculation as defined by the rule. 

In general, a bank’s available stable funding includes 
portions of equity, deposits and long-term debt, while its 
required stable funding will be based on the liquidity 
characteristics of its assets, derivatives and commitments. 
Standardized weightings are required to be applied to the 
various asset and liability classes. The ratio of available stable 
funding to required stable funding must be greater than 100%.
For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Citigroup’s 

consolidated NSFR was compliant with the rule. (For 
additional information, see the Consolidated Citigroup NSFR 
Disclosure for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2024 and 
June 30, 2024, on Citi’s Investor Relations website. The 
Consolidated Citigroup NSFR Disclosure on Citi’s Investor 
Relations website is not incorporated by reference into, and 
does not form any part of, this Form 10-Q).

(1)  During the third quarter of 2024, approximately $9 billion of 

institutional deposits were moved from Markets to All Other—
Corporate/Other. Prior periods were not reclassified. For additional 
information about the reallocated deposits, see Note 3.

Citi’s deposit base is spread across a diversified set of 

countries, industries, clients and currencies and is subject to 
Citi’s Liquidity Risk Management Policy and Procedures. 
End-of-period deposits increased 3% year-over-year, 
primarily driven by growth in Services, reflecting operating 
deposit growth. End-of-period deposits increased 2% 
sequentially, primarily driven by growth in TTS and Securities 
Services. 

On an average basis, deposits were largely unchanged 
both year-over-year and sequentially. In the third quarter of 
2024, average deposits for:

•

•

Services increased 4% year-over-year, as TTS increased 
2% and Securities Services increased 13%. The net 
increase was primarily attributable to growth in Services 
operating deposits. 
USPB decreased 23% year-over-year, as the transfer of 
certain relationships and the associated deposits to Wealth 
more than offset underlying deposit growth.

792  $ 

787  $

• Wealth increased 4% year-over-year, largely reflecting the 

794  $ 

754  $ 

763 

transfer of certain relationships and the associated 
deposits from USPB, partially offset by the shift in 
deposits to higher-yielding investments on Citi’s platform.
All Other decreased 18% year-over-year, primarily 
reflecting the continued wind-down of deposits in Legacy 
Franchises.

•

The majority of Citi’s $1.3 trillion of end-of-period 
deposits are institutional (approximately $840 billion) and 
span 90 countries. A large majority of these institutional 
deposits are within TTS, and of these, approximately 80% are 
from clients that use all three TTS integrated services: 
payments and collections, liquidity management and working 
capital solutions. In addition, nearly 80% of TTS deposits are 
from clients that have a longer than 15-year relationship with 
Citi.

Citi also has a strong consumer and wealth deposit base, 
with $401 billion of USPB and Wealth deposits as of the end 
of the current quarter, which are diversified across the Private 
Bank, Citigold and Wealth at Work within Wealth, as well as 
USPB, and across regions and products. As of the end of the 
current quarter, approximately 66% of U.S. Citigold clients 
have been with Citi for more than 10 years and approximately 
39% of Private Bank ultra-high net worth clients have been 
with Citi for more than 10 years. In addition, USPB’s deposits 
are spread across six key metropolitan areas in the U.S.

Note: Amounts represent the current value of long-term debt on Citi’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet that, for certain debt instruments, includes 
consideration of fair value, hedging impacts and unamortized discounts and 
premiums.
(1) Non-bank includes long-term debt issued to third parties by the parent 

holding company (Citigroup) and Citi’s non-bank subsidiaries (including 
broker-dealer subsidiaries) that are consolidated into Citigroup. As of 
September 30, 2024, non-bank included $91.9 billion of long-term debt 
issued by Citi’s broker-dealer and other subsidiaries that are 
consolidated into Citigroup. Certain Citigroup consolidated hedging 
activities are also included in this line.

(2) Local country and other includes debt issued by Citi’s affiliates in 
support of their local operations. Within non-bank, certain secured 
financing is also included.

(3) Predominantly credit card securitizations, primarily backed by Branded 

Cards receivables.

Citi’s total long-term debt outstanding increased 8% year-
over-year, driven by higher debt across almost all categories. 
Sequentially, long-term debt outstanding increased 7%, largely 
related to senior benchmark debt at the bank and non-bank 
entities and customer-related debt issuances at the non-bank 
entities. 

As part of its liability management, Citi has considered, 

and may continue to consider, opportunities to redeem or 
repurchase its long-term debt pursuant to open market 
purchases, tender offers or other means. Such redemptions and 
repurchases help reduce Citi’s overall funding costs. During 
the third quarter of 2024, Citi redeemed or repurchased an 
aggregate of $9.9 billion of its outstanding long-term debt.

Short-Term Borrowings
Citi’s short-term borrowings of $41 billion as of 
September 30, 2024 decreased 4% year-over-year, as 
issuances of long-term debt replaced the need for short-term 
borrowings. Sequentially, short-term borrowings increased 
7%, compared to June 30, 2024, driven by additional funding 
to support client activities (see Note 18 for further information 
on Citigroup’s and its affiliates’ outstanding short-term 
borrowings).

Secured Funding Transactions and Short-Term 
Borrowings
Citi supplements its primary sources of funding with short-
term financings that generally include (i) secured funding 
transactions consisting of securities loaned or sold under 
agreements to repurchase, i.e., repos, and (ii) to a lesser extent, 
short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper 
issuances and borrowings from the FHLB and other market 
participants. 

Secured Funding Transactions
Secured funding is primarily accessed through Citi’s broker-
dealer subsidiaries, with a smaller portion executed through 
Citi’s bank entities to efficiently fund both (i) secured lending 
activity and (ii) a portion of the securities inventory held in the 
context of market making and customer activities. Secured 
funding transactions are predominantly collateralized by 
government debt securities. Generally, changes in the level of 
Citi’s secured funding are primarily due to fluctuations in 
secured lending activity in the matched book (as described 
below) and changes in securities inventory. In order to 
maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market 
conditions, Citi manages risks related to its secured funding by 
establishing secured funding limits and conducting daily stress 
tests that account for risks related to capacity, tenor, haircut, 
collateral type, counterparty and client actions. 

Secured funding of $278 billion as of September 30, 2024 
increased 8% year-over-year and decreased 9% from the prior 
quarter, largely driven by additional financing to support 
increases in trading-related assets within Citi’s broker-dealer 
subsidiaries. As of the quarter ended September 30, 2024, on 
an average basis, secured funding was $338 billion. The 
portion of secured funding in the broker-dealer subsidiaries 
that funds secured lending is commonly referred to as 
“matched book” activity and is primarily secured by high-
quality liquid securities such as U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. 
agency securities and foreign government debt securities. 
Other “matched book” activity is secured by less liquid 
securities, including equity securities, corporate bonds and 
asset-backed securities, the tenor of which is generally equal 
to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding assets. As 
indicated above, the remaining portion of secured funding is 
used to fund securities inventory held in the context of market 
making and customer activities.

68                                                                                                                                                                                                       

Credit Ratings
The table below presents the ratings for Citigroup and 
Citibank as of September 30, 2024. While not included in the 
table below, the long-term and short-term ratings of Citigroup 
Global Markets Holdings Inc. (CGMHI) were A+/F1 at Fitch 
Ratings, A2/P-1 at Moody’s Ratings and A/A-1 at S&P Global 
Ratings as of September 30, 2024.

Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades
Ratings downgrades by Fitch, Moody’s or S&P could 
negatively impact Citigroup’s and/or Citibank’s funding and 
liquidity due to reduced funding capacity, including derivative 
triggers, which could take the form of cash obligations and 
collateral requirements.

For additional information on the impact of credit rating 

changes on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see “Risk 
Factors—Liquidity Risks” and “Credit Ratings” in Citi’s 2023 
Form 10-K.

Citigroup Inc. and Citibank—Potential Derivative Triggers
As of September 30, 2024, Citi estimates that a hypothetical 
one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of 
Citigroup Inc. across all three major rating agencies could 
impact Citigroup’s funding and liquidity due to derivative 
triggers by approximately $0.1 billion (unchanged from 
June 30, 2024). Other funding sources, such as secured 
financing transactions and other margin requirements, for 
which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely 
affected.

As of September 30, 2024, Citi estimates that a 
hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-
term rating of Citibank across all three major rating agencies 
could impact Citibank’s funding and liquidity due to 
derivative triggers by approximately $0.1 billion (unchanged 
from June 30, 2024). Other funding sources, such as secured 
funding transactions and other margin requirements, for which 
there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely 
impacted.

In total, as of September 30, 2024, Citi estimates that a 
one-notch downgrade of Citigroup Inc. and Citibank across all 
three major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate 
cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately 
$0.2 billion (unchanged from June 30, 2024). As detailed 
under “High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA)” above, Citigroup 
has various liquidity resources available to its bank and non-
bank entities in part as a contingency for the potential events 
described above.

Citibank—Additional Potential Impacts
In addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a 
potential downgrade of Citibank’s senior debt/long-term rating 
across any of the three major rating agencies could also have 
an adverse impact on the commercial paper/short-term rating 
of Citibank. Citibank has provided liquidity commitments to 
consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits, 
primarily in the form of asset purchase agreements. As of 
September 30, 2024, Citibank had liquidity commitments of 
approximately $11.1 billion to consolidated asset-backed 
commercial paper conduits (compared to $10.8 billion at 
June 30, 2024) (see Note 21).

In addition to the above-referenced liquidity resources of 

certain Citibank entities, Citibank could reduce the funding 
and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades 
described above through mitigating actions, including 
repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial 
paper conduits. In the event of the potential downgrades 
described above, Citi believes that certain corporate customers 
could re-evaluate their deposit relationships with Citibank. 
This re-evaluation could result in clients adjusting their 
discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository 
institution, which could potentially reduce certain deposit 
levels at Citibank. However, Citi could choose to adjust 
pricing, offer alternative deposit products to its existing 
customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers, in 
addition to the mitigating actions referenced above.

69                                                                                                                                                                                                       

 
In addition, Citi uses multiple metrics to measure its 
Banking Book interest rate risk. Interest Rate Exposure (IRE) 
is a key metric that analyzes the impact of a range of scenarios 
on Citi’s Banking Book net interest income and certain other 
interest rate-sensitive income versus a base case. IRE does not 
represent a forecast of Citi’s net interest income.

The scenarios, methodologies and assumptions used in 

this analysis are periodically evaluated and enhanced in 
response to changes in the market environment, changes in 
Citi’s balance sheet composition, enhancements in Citi’s 
modeling and other factors.

Citi utilizes the most recent quarter-end balance sheet, 

assuming no changes to its composition and size over the 
forecasted horizon (holding the balance sheet static). The 
forecasts incorporate expectations and assumptions of deposit 
pricing, loan spreads and mortgage prepayment behavior 
implied by the interest rate curves in each scenario. The base 
case scenario reflects the market-implied forward interest 
rates, and sensitivity scenarios assume instantaneous shocks to 
the base case. The forecasts do not assume Citi takes any risk-
mitigating actions in response to changes in the interest rate 
environment. Certain interest rates are subject to flooring 
assumptions in downward rate scenarios. Deposit pricing 
sensitivities (i.e., deposit betas) are informed by historical and 
expected behavior. Actual deposit pricing could differ from 
the assumptions used in these forecasts.

Citi’s IRE analysis primarily reflects the impacts from the 

following Banking Book assets and liabilities: loans, client 
deposits, Citi’s deposits with other banks, investment 
securities, long-term debt, any related interest rate hedges and 
the funds transfer pricing of positions in total trading and 
credit portfolio value at risk (VAR). It excludes impacts from 
any positions that are included in total trading and credit 
portfolio VAR.

In addition to IRE, Citi analyzes economic value 
sensitivity (EVS) as a longer-term interest rate risk metric. 
EVS is a net present value (NPV)–based measure of the 
lifetime cash flows of Citi’s Banking Book. It estimates the 
interest rate sensitivity of the Banking Book’s economic value 
from longer-term assets being potentially funded with shorter-
term liabilities, or vice versa. Citi manages EVS within risk 
limits approved by Citigroup’s Board of Directors that are 
aligned with Citi’s risk appetite.

MARKET RISK

Market risk arises from both Citi’s trading and non-trading 
portfolios. For additional information on market risk and 
market risk management at Citi, see “Market Risk—
Overview” and “Risk Factors” in Citi’s 2023 Form 10-K.

MARKET RISK OF NON-TRADING PORTFOLIOS
Market risk from non-trading portfolios stems predominantly 
from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and 
foreign exchange rates on Citi’s net interest income and on 
Citi’s Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) 
from its investment securities portfolios. Market risk from 
non-trading portfolios also includes the potential impact of 
changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital invested in 
foreign currencies.

Banking Book Interest Rate Risk 
For interest rate risk purposes, Citi’s non-trading portfolios are 
referred to as the Banking Book. Management of interest rate 
risk in the Banking Book is governed by Citi’s Non-Trading 
Market Risk Policy. Management’s Asset and Liability 
Committee (ALCO) establishes Citi’s risk appetite and related 
limits for interest rate risk in the Banking Book, which are 
subject to approval by Citigroup’s Board of Directors. 
Corporate Treasury is responsible for the day-to-day 
management of Citi’s Banking Book interest rate risk as well 
as periodically reviewing it with the ALCO. Citi’s Banking 
Book interest rate risk management is also subject to 
independent oversight from the second line of defense team 
reporting to the Chief Risk Officer.

Changes in interest rates impact Citi’s net income, AOCI 

and CET1. These changes primarily affect Citi’s Banking 
Book through net interest income, due to a variety of risk 
factors, including:

•

•
•

•

Differences in timing and amounts of the maturity or 
repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet 
instruments;
Changes in the level and/or shape of interest rate curves;
Client behavior in response to changes in interest rates 
(e.g., mortgage prepayments, deposit betas); and
Changes in the maturity of instruments resulting from 
changes in the interest rate environment.

As part of their ongoing activities, Citi’s businesses 
generate interest rate-sensitive positions from their client-
facing products, such as loans and deposits. The component of 
this interest rate risk that can be hedged is transferred via 
Citi’s funds transfer pricing process to Corporate Treasury. 
Corporate Treasury uses various tools to manage the total 
interest rate risk position within the established risk appetite 
and target Citi’s desired risk profile, including its investment 
securities portfolio, company-issued debt and interest rate 
derivatives. 

70                                                                                                                                                                                                       

Interest Rate Risk of Investment Portfolios—Impact on 
AOCI
Citi measures the potential impacts of changes in interest rates 
on the value of its AOCI, which can in turn impact Citi’s 
common equity and tangible common equity. This will impact 
Citi’s CET1 and other regulatory capital ratios. Citi seeks to 
manage its exposure to changes in the market level of interest 
rates, while limiting the potential impact on its AOCI and 
regulatory capital position.

AOCI at risk is managed as part of the Company-wide 
interest rate risk position. AOCI at risk considers potential 

changes in AOCI (and the corresponding impact on the CET1 
Capital ratio) relative to Citi’s capital generation capacity. 

Citi uses 100 basis point (bps) shocks in each scenario to 

reflect its net interest income sensitivity to unanticipated 
changes in market interest rates, as potential monetary policy 
decisions and changes in economic conditions may be 
reflected in current market-implied forward rates. The 
following table presents the 12-month estimated impact to 
Citi’s net interest income, AOCI and the CET1 Capital ratio, 
each assuming an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 bps 
increase in interest rates:

Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.

The All other currencies of $1.4 billion as of 

September 30, 2024 in the table above includes the impact 
from the following top five non-U.S. dollar currencies by 
absolute size: approximately $(0.3) billion from the euro, $0.4 
billion from the British pound sterling, and approximately $0.1 
billion each from the Japanese yen, Indian rupee and Swiss 
franc. The remaining impact is spread across more than 30 
additional currencies.

Citi’s balance sheet is asset sensitive (assets reprice faster 

than liabilities), resulting in higher net interest income in 
increasing interest rate scenarios. The estimated impact to 
Citi's net interest income in a 100 bps upward rate shock 
scenario as of September 30, 2024 remained relatively stable 
year-over-year. At progressively higher interest rate levels, the 
marginal net interest income benefit is lower, as Citi assumes 
it will pass on a larger share of rate changes to depositors (i.e., 
higher betas), further reducing Citi’s IRE sensitivity. 
Currency-specific interest rate changes and balance sheet 
factors may drive quarter-to-quarter volatility in Citi’s 
estimated IRE.

In a 100 bps upward rate shock scenario, Citi expects that 

the approximate $1.2 billion initial negative impact to AOCI 
could potentially be offset in shareholders’ equity through the 
expected recovery of the impact on AOCI through accretion of 
Citi’s investment portfolio and expected net interest income 
benefit over a period of approximately seven months.

Scenario Analysis
The following table presents the estimated impact to Citi’s net 
interest income and AOCI under six different scenarios of 
changes in interest rates for the U.S. dollar and all other 
currencies in which Citi has invested capital as of 
September 30, 2024. The 100 bps downward rate scenarios 
potentially may be impacted by the low level of interest rates 
in several countries and the assumption that market interest 
rates, as well as rates paid to depositors and charged to 
borrowers, do not fall below zero (i.e., the “flooring 
assumption”). The interest rate scenarios are also impacted by 
convexity related to mortgage products and deposit pricing.

interpolated. The interest rate exposure in the table above assumes no change in deposit size or mix from the baseline forecast included in the different interest rate 
scenarios presented. As a result, in higher interest rate scenarios, customer activity resulting in a shift from non-interest-bearing and low interest rate deposit products to 
higher-yielding deposits would reduce the expected benefit to net interest income. Conversely, in lower interest rate scenarios, customer activity resulting in a shift from 
higher-yielding deposits to non-interest-bearing and low interest rate deposit products would reduce the expected decrease to net interest income.
(1) The Scenario 1 impact of $1,388 million consists of the following top five non-U.S. dollar currencies as of September 30, 2024 by absolute size: approximately 

$(0.3) billion from the euro, $0.4 billion from the British pound sterling, and approximately $0.1 billion each from the Japanese yen, Indian rupee and Swiss franc. 
The remaining balance is spread across more than 30 additional currencies.
Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.

(2)

As presented in the table above, the estimated impact to 

Citi’s net interest income is larger under Scenario 2 than 
Scenario 3, as Citi’s Banking Book has relatively higher 
interest rate exposure to the short end of the yield curve. For 
U.S. dollars, exposure to downward rate shocks is smaller in 
magnitude than to upward rate shocks. This is because of the 
lower benefit to net interest income from Citi’s deposit base at 
higher rate levels, as well as the prepayment effects on 
mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. 

The magnitude of the impact to AOCI is greater under 
Scenario 2 compared to Scenario 3. This is because Citi’s 
investment portfolio and pension liabilities are more sensitive 
to rates at shorter- and intermediate-term maturities.

Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates—Impacts on AOCI 
and Capital
As of September 30, 2024, Citi estimates that an unanticipated 
parallel instantaneous 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar 
against all of the other currencies in which Citi has invested 
capital could reduce Citi’s tangible common equity (TCE) by 
approximately $1.6 billion, or 1.0%, as a result of changes to 
Citi’s CTA in AOCI, net of hedges. This impact would be 
primarily due to changes in the value of the euro, Mexican 
peso and Indian rupee.

This impact is also before any mitigating actions Citi may 

take, including ongoing management of its foreign currency 
translation exposure. Specifically, as currency movements 
change the value of Citi’s net investments in foreign currency-
denominated capital, these movements also change the value 
of Citi’s RWA denominated in those same currencies. This, 

In millions of dollars, except as otherwise noted
Change in FX spot rate(1)
Change in TCE due to FX translation, net of hedges

As a percentage of TCE

coupled with Citi’s foreign currency hedging strategies, such 
as foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency forwards and 
other currency hedging instruments, lessens the impact of 
foreign currency movements on Citi’s CET1 Capital ratio. 
Changes in these hedging strategies, as well as hedging costs, 
divestitures and tax impacts, can further affect the actual 
impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital 
compared to an unanticipated parallel shock, as described 
above.

The effect of Citi’s ongoing management strategies with 

respect to quarterly changes in foreign exchange rates, and the 
quarterly impact of these changes on Citi’s TCE and CET1 
Capital ratio, are presented in the table below. See Note 19 for 
additional information on the changes in AOCI.

Interest income and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent gross-up adjustments (TEGU) primarily related to the tax-exempt bond portfolio and 
certain tax-advantaged loan programs of $24 million, $22 million and $23 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and 
September 30, 2023, respectively. 
Interest expense associated with certain hybrid financial instruments, which are classified as Long-term debt and accounted for at fair value, is reported together 
with any changes in fair value as part of Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income and is therefore not reflected in Interest expense in the 
table above.

(3) The average rate on interest income and net interest margin reflects TEGU. See footnote 1 above.
(4) Citi’s NIM is calculated by dividing net interest income (including TEGU) by average interest-earning assets.

Citi’s net interest income in the third quarter of 2024 was 
$13.4 billion, on both a reported and taxable equivalent basis, 
a decrease of 3% or $0.5 billion from the prior-year period, 
primarily driven by a 17% decline in Markets net interest 
income and a 1% decline in non-Markets net interest income. 
The decline in Markets net interest income was primarily 
driven by higher funding costs related to trading inventory in 
Fixed Income Markets.

The decline in non-Markets net interest income was 

largely due to lower revenue from Citi’s net investment in 
Argentina and margin compression on mortgage securities in 
the investment portfolio that have been extended within 
Corporate Treasury in All Other. The decline in non-Markets 
net interest income was partially offset by loan growth in cards 
and maturing assets in Citi’s securities portfolio being 
reinvested at higher yields. 

Citi’s net interest margin was 2.33% on a taxable 
equivalent basis in the current quarter, a decrease of eight 
basis points from the prior quarter. The decline in net interest 
margin was largely driven by a decline in Markets due to 
dividend seasonality in the prior quarter, partially offset by 
loan growth in cards and maturing loans and investments 
being refinanced and reinvested at higher yields.

MARKET RISK OF TRADING PORTFOLIOS

Value at Risk (VAR)
Citi believes its VAR model is conservatively calibrated to incorporate fat-tail scaling and the greater of short-term (approximately the 
most recent month) and long-term (18 months for commodities and three years for others) market volatility. As of September 30, 
2024, Citi estimates that the conservative features of the VAR calibration contribute an approximate 22% add-on to what would be a 
VAR estimated under the assumption of stable and perfectly, normally distributed markets. As of June 30, 2024, the add-on was 23%.

As presented in the table below, Citi’s average trading VAR for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 5% from the second quarter of 

2024, primarily due to inventory changes in the Markets businesses.

(1)  Covariance adjustment (also known as diversification benefit) equals the difference between the total VAR and the sum of the VARs tied to each risk type. The 
benefit reflects the fact that the risks within individual and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VAR on a given day will be 
lower than the sum of the VARs relating to each risk type. The determination of the primary drivers of changes to the covariance adjustment is made by an 
examination of the impact of both model parameter and position changes.

(2)  The total trading VAR includes mark-to-market and certain fair value option trading positions with the exception of hedges of the loan portfolio, fair value option 

loans and all CVA exposures. Available-for-sale and accrual exposures are not included.

(3)  The specific risk-only component represents the level of equity and fixed income issuer-specific risk embedded in VAR. 
(4)  The credit portfolio is composed of mark-to-market positions associated with non-trading business units, with the CVA relating to derivative counterparties, all 
associated CVA hedges and market sensitivity FVA hedges. FVA and DVA are not included. The credit portfolio also includes hedges of the loan portfolio, fair 
value option loans and hedges of the leveraged finance pipeline within capital markets origination.

Regulatory VAR Back-Testing
In accordance with Basel III, Citi is required to perform back-
testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR 
model. Regulatory VAR back-testing is the process in which 
the daily one-day VAR, at a 99% confidence interval, is 
compared to the buy-and-hold profit and loss (i.e., the profit 
and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of 
the day and re-priced the following day). Buy-and-hold profit 
and loss represents the daily mark-to-market profit and loss 
attributable to price movements in covered positions from the 
close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and 
loss excludes realized trading revenue, net interest, fees and 
commissions, intra-day trading profit and loss and changes in 
reserves.

Based on a 99% confidence level, Citi would expect two 

to three days in any one year where buy-and-hold losses 
exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the conservative 
calibration of Citi’s VAR model (as a result of taking the 
greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-tail scaling 
of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer exceptions under 
normal and stable market conditions. Periods of unstable 
market conditions could increase the number of back-testing 
exceptions.

As of September 30, 2024, there was one back-testing

Country Risk

Top 25 Country Exposures
The following table presents Citi’s top 25 exposures by 
country (excluding the U.S.) as of September 30, 2024. 
(Including the U.S., Citi’s top 25 exposures by country would 
represent approximately 98% of Citi’s exposure to all 
countries as of September 30, 2024.)

For purposes of the table, loan amounts are reflected in 
the country where the loan is booked, which is generally based 
on the domicile of the borrower. For example, a loan to a 
Chinese subsidiary of a Switzerland-based corporation will 
generally be categorized as a loan in China. In addition, Citi 
has developed regional booking centers in certain countries, 
most significantly in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland, 

in order to more efficiently serve its corporate customers. As 
an example, in the case of the U.K., only 41% of corporate 
loans presented in the table below are to U.K. domiciled 
counterparties (45% for unfunded commitments), while the 
majority of the remaining loans are to counterparties 
domiciled in other European countries. Approximately 91% of 
the total U.K. funded loans and 87% of the total U.K. 
unfunded commitments were investment grade as of 
September 30, 2024. 

Trading account assets and investment securities are 
generally categorized based on the domicile of the issuer of 
the security of the underlying reference entity. For additional 
information on the assets included in the table, see the 
footnotes to the table below.

Note 2.

Russia 

Overview
In Russia, Citi’s remaining operations are conducted through 
Services, Markets, Banking and All Other—Legacy 
Franchises. Citi continues to monitor the war in Ukraine, 
related sanctions and economic conditions and continues to 
mitigate its Russia exposures and risks as appropriate.

Citi previously ended nearly all of the institutional 

banking services it offered in Russia and ceased soliciting any 
new business or new clients in the country, with the remaining 
services only those necessary to fulfill its remaining legal and 
regulatory obligations, as well as support its employees. In 
addition, Citi significantly reduced its All Other—Legacy 
Franchises consumer loan portfolio in Russia (reported as part 
of Asia Consumer), largely due to loan portfolio sales and its 
entry into a credit card referral agreement with a Russian 
bank. For additional information, see “Citi’s Wind-Down of 
Its Russia Operations” below.

For additional information about Citi’s risks related to its 
Russia exposures, see “Risk Factors—Market-Related Risks,” 
“—Operational Risks” and “—Other Risks” in Citi’s 2023 
Form 10-K.

Investment securities include debt securities AFS, recorded at fair market value, primarily local government debt securities. 

(1) 
(2)  Unfunded exposure consists of unfunded corporate lending commitments, letters of credit and other contingencies. 
(3)  Cash on deposit and placements are primarily with the Central Bank of Russia. The increase at September 30, 2024 was due to Citi’s inability to enter into reverse 

repos, thus the cash inflows from dividends received from Russian corporations on behalf of Citi’s clients were placed with the Central Bank of Russia.
(4)  Represents dividends received by Citi in its role as custodian for investor clients in Russia, which Citi is required by local regulation to hold at the Deposit 

Insurance Agency (DIA). Citi is unable to remit these funds to clients due to restrictions imposed by the Russian government. In accordance with a Central Bank 
of Russia regulatory requirement, all balances in the National Settlements Depository were transferred to the DIA in the second quarter of 2023.

(5)  The majority of AO Citibank’s third-party exposures were funded with the dividends described in footnote 4 and domestic deposit liabilities from both corporate 

and personal banking clients.

(6)  Citigroup’s CTA loss included in its AOCI related to its indirect subsidiary, AO Citibank, is excluded from the above table, because the CTA loss is not held in 

AO Citibank and would be recognized in Citigroup’s earnings only upon either the substantial liquidation or a loss of control of AO Citibank. Citi has separately 
described these risks in “Deconsolidation Risk” below.

83                                                                                                                                                                                                       

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During the third quarter of 2024, Citi’s Russia-related 

exposures increased by $0.9 billion, to $9.1 billion as 
presented in the table above. The increase in exposures was 
primarily driven by inflows from dividends received from 
Russian corporations on behalf of Citi’s clients, partially offset 
by depreciation of the Russian ruble. Approximately 82% of 
Citi’s $9.1 billion of total Russia-related exposures are 
corporate dividends that Citi cannot remit to its clients due to 
restrictions imposed by the Russian government, of which 
$5.8 billion is held with the Deposit Insurance Agency.

Citi’s net investment in Russia was approximately $0.2 

billion as of September 30, 2024 (up from $0.1 billion at 
June 30, 2024). This increase in the net investment was due to 
an increase in interest income and custody revenue during the 
quarter, partially offset by the impact from a net ACL build on 
other assets, driven by increases in transfer risk for safety and 
soundness considerations under U.S. banking law. For more 
information on transfer risk reserves, see “Significant 
Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—Citi’s 
Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)” below.

Citi hedges its Russian ruble/U.S. dollar spot FX exposure 
in AOCI through the purchase of FX derivatives. The ongoing 
mark-to-market of the hedging derivatives is also reported in 
AOCI. When the Russian ruble depreciates against the U.S. 
dollar, the U.S. dollar equivalent value of Citigroup’s 
investment in AO Citibank also declines. This change in value 
is offset by the change in value of the hedging instrument (FX 
derivative). Going forward, Citi may record devaluations on 
its net ruble-denominated assets in earnings, without the 
benefit from a change in the fair value of derivative positions 
used to economically hedge the exposures. 

Earnings and Other Impacts on Citi’s Businesses
Services, Markets, Banking and All Other—Legacy Franchises 
results have been impacted by various macroeconomic factors 
and volatilities, including the war in Ukraine and its direct and 
indirect impacts on the European and global economies. For a 
broader discussion of these factors and volatilities on Citi’s 
businesses, see “Executive Summary” and each applicable 
business’s results of operations above. 

As of September 30, 2024, Citigroup’s ACL included a 
$0.1 billion remaining credit reserve for Citi’s direct Russian 
counterparties (largely unchanged from June 30, 2024). This 
balance does not include the additional reserves for transfer 
risk associated with exposures in Russia.

Citi’s Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations
In August 2022, Citi disclosed its decision to wind down its 
Russia consumer, local commercial and institutional banking 
businesses, including actively pursuing portfolio sales. In 
connection with this wind-down, Citi has incurred 
approximately $71 million to date in charges, largely from 
restructuring, vendor termination fees and other related 
charges. Citi expects to incur an additional approximate 
$42 million in estimated charges (approximately $1 million in 
Banking and $41 million in All Other, excluding the impact 
from any portfolio sales). For additional information about 
Citi’s continued efforts to reduce its operations and exposure 
in Russia, see Note 2 and “Risk Factors” and “Managing 

Global Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—Russia” in Citi’s 
2023 Form 10-K.

Deconsolidation Risk
Citi’s remaining operations in Russia subject it to various 
risks, including, among others, foreign currency volatility, 
including appreciation or devaluation; restrictions arising from 
retaliatory Russian laws and regulations on the conduct of its 
business; sanctions or asset freezes; or other deconsolidation 
events (see “Risk Factors—Other Risks” in Citi’s 2023 Form 
10-K). Examples of triggers that may result in deconsolidation 
of AO Citibank include voluntary or forced sale of ownership 
or loss of control due to actions of relevant governmental 
authorities, including expropriation (i.e., the entity becomes 
subject to the complete control of a government, court, 
administrator, trustee or regulator); revocation of banking 
license; and loss of ability to elect a board of directors or 
appoint members of senior management. As of September 30, 
2024, Citi continued to consolidate AO Citibank because none 
of the deconsolidation factors were triggered.

In the event Citi deems there is a loss of control, for 
example, through expropriation of AO Citibank, Citi’s foreign 
entity in Russia, Citi would be required to (i) write off the net 
investment of approximately $0.2 billion (up from $0.1 billion 
at June 30, 2024), (ii) recognize a CTA loss of approximately 
$1.6 billion (unchanged from June 30, 2024) through earnings 
and (iii) recognize a loss of $0.7 billion (unchanged from 
June 30, 2024) on net intercompany liabilities owed by AO 
Citibank to other Citi entities outside Russia. In the sole event 
of a substantial liquidation, as opposed to a loss of control, 
Citi would be required to recognize the CTA loss of 
approximately $1.6 billion through earnings and would 
evaluate its remaining net investment as circumstances evolve. 
The $1.6 billion CTA write-off through earnings under either 
event is expected to be largely equity neutral, since the 
reversal of the CTA loss out of AOCI would improve Citi’s 
total AOCI. 

Citi as Paying Agent for Russia-related Clients
Citi serves or served as paying agent on bonds issued by 
various entities in Russia, including Russian corporate clients. 
Citi’s role as paying agent is administrative. In this role, Citi 
acts as an agent of its client, the bond issuer, receiving interest 
and principal payments from the bond issuer and then making 
payments to international central securities depositories (e.g., 
Depository Trust Company, Euroclear, Clearstream). The 
international central securities depositories (ICSDs) make 
payments to those participants or account holders (e.g., broker/
dealers) that have clients who are investors in the applicable 
bonds (i.e., bondholders). As a paying agent, Citi generally 
does not have information about the identity of the 
bondholders. Citi may be exposed to risks due to its 
responsibilities for receiving and processing payments on 
behalf of its clients as a result of sanctions or other 
governmental requirements and prohibitions. To mitigate 
operational and sanctions risks, Citi has established policies, 
procedures and controls for client relationships and payment 
processing to help ensure compliance with U.S., U.K., EU and 
other jurisdictions’ sanctions laws.

Board of Directors’ Role in Overseeing Related Risks
The Citigroup Board of Directors (Board) and the Board’s 
Risk Management Committee (RMC) and its other 
Committees receive regular reports from senior management 
regarding global geopolitical, macroeconomic and reputational 
impacts to Citi (including the war in Ukraine and its impact on 
Citi’s operations in Russia and Ukraine). The reports to the 
Board and its Committees from senior management who 
represent the impacted businesses and the international cluster, 
Independent Risk Management, Finance, Independent 
Compliance Risk Management, including those individuals 
responsible for sanctions compliance, and Human Resources, 
have included detailed information regarding financial 
impacts, impacts on capital, cybersecurity, strategic 
considerations, sanctions compliance, employee assistance and 
reputational risks, enabling the Board and its Committees to 
properly exercise their oversight responsibilities. In addition, 
senior management has provided updates to Citi’s Executive 
Management Team and the Board, outside of formal meetings, 
regarding cybersecurity matters (including Russia-specific 
risks).

Ukraine
Citi has continued to operate in Ukraine throughout the war 
through its Services, Markets and Banking businesses, serving 
the local subsidiaries of multinationals, along with local 
financial institutions and the public sector. Citi employs 
approximately 215 people in Ukraine and their safety is Citi’s 
top priority. All of Citi’s domestic operations in Ukraine are 
conducted through a subsidiary of Citibank, which uses the 
Ukrainian hryvnia as its functional currency. As of 
September 30, 2024, Citi had $1.5 billion of direct exposures 
related to Ukraine (unchanged from June 30, 2024).

These processes may require Citi to delay or withhold the 

processing of payments as a result of sanctions on the bond 
issuer. Citi is also prevented from making payments to 
accounts on behalf of bondholders should the ICSDs disclose 
to Citi the presence of sanctioned bondholders. In both 
instances, Citi is generally required to segregate, restrict or 
block the funds until applicable sanctions are lifted or the 
payments are otherwise authorized under applicable law.

Reputational Risks
Citi has continued its efforts to enhance and protect its 
reputation with its colleagues, clients, customers, investors, 
regulators and the public. Citi’s response to the war in 
Ukraine, including any action or inaction, may have a negative 
impact on Citi’s reputation with some or all of these parties.
For example, Citi is exposed to reputational risk as a 
result of its remaining presence in Russia and association with 
Russian individuals or entities, whether subject to sanctions or 
not, including Citi’s inability to support its global clients in 
Russia, which could adversely affect its broader client 
relationships and businesses; current involvement in 
transactions or supporting activities involving Russian assets 
or interests; failure to correctly interpret and apply laws and 
regulations, including those related to sanctions; perceived 
misalignment of Citi’s actions to its stated strategy in Russia; 
and the reputational impact from Citi’s activity and 
engagement with Ukraine or with non-Russian clients exiting 
their Russia businesses.

While Citi announced its intention to wind down its 
businesses in Russia, Citi will continue to manage those 
operations during the wind-down process and will be required 
to maintain certain limited operations to fulfill its remaining 
legal and regulatory obligations. Also, sanctions and sanctions 
compliance are highly complex and may change over time and 
result in increased operational risk. Failure to fully comply 
with relevant sanctions or the application of sanctions where 
they should not be applied may negatively impact Citi’s 
reputation. In addition, Citi currently performs services for, 
conducts business with or deals in non-sanctioned Russian-
owned businesses and Russian assets. This has attracted, and 
will likely continue to attract, negative attention, despite the 
previously disclosed plan to wind down nearly all its activities 
in the country, cessation of new business and client 
originations, and reduction of other exposures.

Citi’s continued presence or divestiture of businesses in 

Russia could also increase its susceptibility to cyberattacks 
that could negatively impact its relationships with clients and 
customers, harm its reputation, increase its compliance costs 
and adversely affect its business operations and results of 
operations. For additional information on operational and 
cyber risks, see “Risk Factors—Operational Risks” in Citi’s 
2023 Form 10-K.
