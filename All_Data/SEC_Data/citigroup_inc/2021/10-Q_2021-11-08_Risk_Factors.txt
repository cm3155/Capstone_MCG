MANAGING GLOBAL RISK

For Citi, effective risk management is of primary importance 
to its overall operations. Accordingly, Citi’s risk management 
process has been designed to monitor, evaluate and manage 
the principal risks it assumes in conducting its activities. 
Specifically, the activities that Citi engages in, and the risks 
those activities generate, must be consistent with Citi’s 
mission, strategy, value proposition, key guiding principles 
and risk appetite.

Overall Consumer Credit Trends

Global Consumer Banking

As shown in the chart above, GCB’s net credit loss rate 
decreased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year for the third 
quarter of 2021, primarily reflecting the continued impact of 
government stimulus, unemployment benefits and consumer 
relief programs in North America GCB, and a decline 
following the peak charge-offs in Asia GCB and Latin 
America GCB in recent quarters. 

GCB’s 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily due to the 
continued impacts of government stimulus, unemployment 
benefits and consumer relief programs in North America GCB, 
as well as lower delinquencies in Asia GCB and Latin America 
GCB, following the charge-off of peak delinquencies in recent 
quarters.

For additional information on consumer credit trends, see 

“Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk—Overall Consumer 
Credit Trends” in Citi’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

North America GCB

North America GCB provides mortgage, home equity, 
small business and personal loans through Citi’s retail banking 
network and card products through Citi-branded cards and Citi 
retail services businesses. The retail bank is concentrated in 
six major metropolitan cities in the U.S. (for additional 
information on the U.S. retail bank, see “North America GCB” 
above).

As of September 30, 2021, approximately 72% of North 
America GCB consumer loans consisted of Citi-branded and 
Citi retail services cards, which generally drives the overall 
credit performance of North America GCB (for additional 
information on North America GCB’s cards portfolios, 
including delinquency and net credit loss rates, see “Credit 
Card Trends” below).

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate and 
90+ days past due delinquency rate in North America GCB for 
the third quarter of 2021 decreased quarter-over-quarter and 
year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued impact of 
high payment rates in cards, driven by government stimulus. 
Year-over-year, the payment rates were also impacted by 
unemployment benefits and consumer relief programs.

Latin America GCB

Latin America GCB operates in Mexico through 
Citibanamex, one of Mexico’s largest banks, and provides 
credit cards, consumer mortgages and small business and 
personal loans. Latin America GCB serves a more mass-
market segment in Mexico and focuses on developing 
multiproduct relationships with customers.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 
Latin America GCB for the third quarter of 2021 decreased 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. The impact of 
charge-offs of delinquent loans in prior quarters resulted in 
lower delinquencies that led to lower net credit losses in the 
current quarter. 

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. The impact of 
charge-offs of delinquent loans in prior quarters resulted in a 
lower 90+ day delinquency rate in the current quarter.

Asia(1) GCB

Credit Card Trends

Global Cards

(1) Asia includes GCB activities in certain EMEA countries for all periods 

presented.

Asia GCB operates in 17 countries and jurisdictions in 

Asia and EMEA and provides credit cards, consumer 
mortgages and small business and personal loans.

As shown in the chart above, the third quarter of 2021 net 

credit loss rate in Asia GCB decreased quarter-over-quarter, 
driven by the charge-off of peak delinquencies in recent 
quarters. Year-over-year, the net credit loss rate decreased, as 
elevated losses during the prior year return to pre-pandemic 
levels, and due to a shift in product mix toward secured 
product. 

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased 
quarter-over-quarter, driven by the charge-off of peak 
delinquencies in recent quarters. Year-over-year, the 90+ days 
past due delinquency rate decreased, as elevated delinquencies 
during the prior year return to pre-pandemic levels.

The performance of Asia GCB’s portfolios continues to 
reflect the strong credit profiles in the region’s target customer 
segments. Regulatory changes in many markets in Asia over 
the past few years have also resulted in improved credit 
quality.

For additional information on cost of credit, loan 
delinquency and other information for Citi’s consumer loan 
portfolios, see each respective business’s results of operations 
above and Notes 13 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.

North America Citi-Branded Cards

North America GCB’s Citi-branded cards portfolio issues 

proprietary and co-branded cards. 

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 
North America Citi-branded cards for the third quarter of 2021 
decreased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily 
reflecting the continued impact of high payment rates, driven 
by government stimulus. Year-over-year, the payment rates 
were also impacted by unemployment benefits and consumer 
relief programs.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily reflecting 
the continued impact of high payment rates, driven by 
government stimulus. Year-over-year, the payment rates were 
also impacted by unemployment benefits and consumer relief 
programs.

39

 
North America Citi Retail Services

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. The impact of 
charge-offs of delinquent loans in prior quarters resulted in a 
lower 90+ day delinquency rate.

Asia Citi-Branded Cards(1)

Citi retail services partners directly with more than 20 

retailers and dealers to offer private label and co-branded 
cards. Citi retail services’ target market focuses on select 
industry segments such as home improvement, specialty retail, 
consumer electronics and fuel.

Citi retail services continually evaluates opportunities to 
add partners within target industries that have strong loyalty, 
lending or payment programs and growth potential.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in Citi 

retail services for the third quarter of 2021 decreased quarter-
over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily reflecting the 
continued impact of high payment rates, driven by government 
stimulus. Year-over-year, the payment rates were also 
impacted by unemployment benefits and consumer relief 
programs.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily reflecting 
the continued impact of high payment rates, driven by 
government stimulus. Year-over-year, the payment rates were 
also impacted by unemployment benefits and consumer relief 
programs.

Latin America Citi-Branded Cards

(1) Asia includes loans and leases in certain EMEA countries for all periods 

presented.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 
Asia Citi-branded cards for the third quarter of 2021 decreased 
quarter-over-quarter, driven by the charge-off of peak 
delinquencies related to customers exiting the pandemic-
related consumer relief programs in recent quarters, and 
decreased year-over-year as elevated losses during the prior 
year return to pre-pandemic levels.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased 
quarter-over-quarter, driven by the charge-off of peak 
delinquencies in recent quarters, and decreased year-over-year, 
as elevated delinquencies during the prior year return to pre-
pandemic levels.

For additional information on cost of credit, delinquency 

and other information for Citi’s cards portfolios, see each 
respective business’s results of operations above and Note 13 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Latin America GCB issues proprietary and co-branded 

cards. 

As shown in the chart above, the third quarter of 2021 net 
credit loss rate in Latin America Citi-branded cards decreased 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. The impact of 
charge-offs of delinquent loans in prior quarters resulted in 
lower delinquencies that led to lower net credit losses in the 
current quarter.

The FICO distribution of both cards portfolios remained 

largely stable compared to the prior quarter and improved 
compared to the prior year, demonstrating strong underlying 
credit quality and a benefit from the impacts of government 
stimulus, unemployment benefits and customer relief 
programs, as well as lower credit utilization. For additional 
information on FICO scores, see Note 13 to the Consolidated

(1) Loans modified under Citi’s consumer relief programs continue to be reported in the same delinquency bucket they were in at the time of modification (which 

have various durations, and certain of which may be renewed by the customer). Consumer relief programs in Asia and Mexico largely expired during the fourth 
quarter of 2020. 

(2) End-of-period (EOP) loans include interest and fees on credit cards.
(3) The ratios of 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due are calculated based on EOP loans, net of unearned income.
(4) The 90+ days past due balances for North America—Citi-branded and North America—Citi retail services are generally still accruing interest. Citigroup’s policy 

is generally to accrue interest on credit card loans until 180 days past due, unless notification of bankruptcy filing has been received earlier.

(5) The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios for North America GCB exclude loans that are primarily related to U.S. mortgages guaranteed 
by U.S. government-sponsored agencies since the potential loss predominantly resides with the U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The amounts excluded for 
loans 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) were $146 million ($0.6 billion), $150 million ($0.7 billion) and $148 million ($0.6 billion) as of September 30, 2021, 
June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively. The amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due and (EOP loans) were $78 million ($0.6 billion), $80 
million ($0.7 billion) and $88 million ($0.6 billion) as of September 30, 2021, June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively. 

(6) Asia includes delinquencies and loans in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.
(7) During the third quarter of 2021, Citi’s Australia consumer banking business was classified as held-for-sale (HFS) pursuant to Citi’s agreement to sell the 
business. Accordingly, the Australian consumer loans are recorded in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and hence the loans and related 
delinquencies and ratios are not included in this table. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

(8) The loans 90+ days past due and related ratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are primarily related to U.S. mortgages guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored 
agencies since the potential loss predominantly resides with the U.S. agencies. The amounts excluded for 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) for each period were 
$138 million ($0.4 billion), $125 million ($0.3 billion) and $172 million ($0.5 billion) as of September 30, 2021, June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, 
respectively. The amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due and (EOP loans) for each period were $42 million ($0.4 billion), $48 million ($0.3 billion) and 
$66 million ($0.5 billion) as of September 30, 2021, June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively.

Portfolio Mix—Geography and Counterparty
Citi’s corporate credit portfolio is diverse across geography 
and counterparty. The following table shows the percentage of 
this portfolio by region (excluding the delinquency-managed 
private bank portfolio) based on Citi’s internal management

The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings 
across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison 
of credit exposure across all lines of business, geographic 
regions and products. Counterparty risk ratings reflect an 
estimated probability of default for a counterparty and are 
derived by leveraging validated statistical models, scorecard 
models and external agency ratings (under defined 
circumstances), in combination with consideration of factors 
specific to the obligor or market, such as management 
experience, competitive position, regulatory environment and 
commodity prices. Facility risk ratings are assigned that reflect 
the probability of default of the obligor and factors that affect 
the loss given default of the facility, such as support or 
collateral. Internal obligor ratings that generally correspond to 
BBB and above are considered investment grade, while those 
below are considered non-investment grade.

The following table presents the corporate credit portfolio 

(excluding the delinquency-managed private bank portfolio) 
by facility risk rating as a percentage of the total corporate 
credit portfolio:

Note: Total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending 
commitments. 

In addition to the obligor and facility risk ratings assigned 

to all exposures, Citi may classify exposures in the corporate 
credit portfolio. These classifications are consistent with Citi’s 
interpretation of the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of 
criticized exposures, which may categorize exposures as 
special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss.

Risk ratings and classifications are reviewed regularly, 

and adjusted as appropriate. The credit review process 
incorporates quantitative and qualitative factors, including 
financial and non-financial disclosures or metrics, 
idiosyncratic events or changes to the competitive, regulatory 
or macroeconomic environment. This includes but is not 
limited to exposures in those sectors significantly impacted by 
the pandemic (including consumer retail, commercial real 
estate and transportation). 

Citigroup believes the corporate credit portfolio to be 
appropriately rated and classified as of September 30, 2021. 
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Citigroup has 
taken action to adjust internal ratings and classifications of 
exposures as both the macroeconomic environment and 
obligor-specific factors have changed, particularly where 
additional stress has been seen. 

As obligor risk ratings are downgraded, the probability of 

default increases. Downgrades of obligor risk ratings tend to 

 
 
 
 
 
result in a higher provision for credit losses. In addition, 
downgrades may result in the purchase of additional credit 
derivatives or other risk mitigants to hedge the incremental 
credit risk, or may result in Citi’s seeking to reduce exposure 
to an obligor or an industry sector. Citi will continue to review 
exposures to ensure that the appropriate probability of default 
is incorporated into all risk assessments.

For additional information on Citi’s corporate credit 

portfolio, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.

loans) relates to exposure secured by mortgages on 
underlying properties or in well-rated securitization 
exposures.
$16 billion ($5 billion of direct outstanding funded loans) 
relates to unsecured loans to large REITs, with nearly 
74% of the exposure rated investment grade.
$11 billion ($11 billion of direct outstanding funded 
loans) relates to CRE exposure in the private bank of 
which 100% is secured by mortgages. In addition, 47% of

Credit Risk Mitigation
As part of its overall risk management activities, Citigroup 
uses credit derivatives and other risk mitigants to hedge 
portions of the credit risk in its corporate credit portfolio, in 
addition to outright asset sales. Citi may enter into partial-term 
hedges as well as full-term hedges. In advance of the 
expiration of partial-term hedges, Citi will determine, among 
other factors, the economic feasibility of hedging the 
remaining life of the instrument. The results of the mark-to-
market and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives 
are reflected primarily in Principal transactions in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income.

At September 30, 2021, June 30, 2021 and December 31, 
2020, ICG (excluding the delinquency-managed private bank 
portfolio) had economic hedges on the corporate credit 
portfolio of $38.1 billion, $37.2 billion and $38.8 billion, 
respectively. Citigroup’s expected credit loss model used in 
the calculation of its ACL does not include the favorable 
impact of credit derivatives and other mitigants that are 
marked to market. In addition, the reported amounts of direct 
outstandings and unfunded lending commitments in the tables 
above do not reflect the impact of these hedging transactions. 
The credit protection was economically hedging underlying 
ICG (excluding the delinquency-managed private bank 
portfolio) corporate credit portfolio exposures with the 
following risk rating distribution:

(1) North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Mexico is included in offices outside North America. The classification of corporate loans between 

offices in North America and outside North America is based on the domicile of the booking unit. The difference between the domicile of the booking unit and the 
domicile of the managing unit is not material. 

(2) Loans secured primarily by real estate.
(3) Consumer loans are net of unearned income of $650 million, $676 million, $700 million, $749 million and $739 million at September 30, 2021, June 30, 2021, 
March 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2020, respectively. Unearned income on consumer loans primarily represents unamortized origination 
fees and costs, premiums and discounts. 

(4) Corporate loans include private bank loans and are net of unearned income of $(831) million, $(841) million, $(844) million, $(844) million and $(857) million at 

September 30, 2021, June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2020, respectively. Unearned income on corporate loans primarily 
represents interest received in advance, but not yet earned, on loans originated on a discounted basis.

(5) Because loans carried at fair value do not have an ACLL, they are excluded from the ACLL ratio calculation.

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets and Renegotiated Loans
For additional information on Citi’s non-accrual loans and 
assets and renegotiated loans, see “Non-Accrual Loans and 
Assets and Renegotiated Loans” in Citi’s 2020 Annual Report 
on Form 10-K.

Non-Accrual Loans
The table below summarizes Citigroup’s non-accrual loans as 
of the periods indicated. Non-accrual loans may still be current 
on interest payments. In situations where Citi reasonably 
expects that only a portion of the principal owed will 
ultimately be collected, all payments received are reflected as 
a reduction of principal and not as interest income. For all 
other non-accrual loans, cash interest receipts are generally 
recorded as revenue.

respectively, of commercial loans risk rated “Substandard Non-
Performing” or worse (asset category defined by banking regulators) in 
offices outside the U.S. These modifications were not considered TDRs 
because the modifications did not involve a concession or because the 
modifications qualified for exemptions from TDR accounting provided 
by the CARES Act or the interagency guidance.

Note: The amounts set forth in the table above are presented on an average basis. For securities, the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be 
realized and, therefore, exclude any securities that are encumbered and incorporate any haircuts applicable under the U.S. LCR rule. The table above incorporates 
various restrictions that could limit the transferability of liquidity between legal entities, including Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.
(1)  Foreign government debt includes securities issued or guaranteed by foreign sovereigns, agencies and multilateral development banks. Foreign government debt 
securities are held largely to support local liquidity requirements and Citi’s local franchises and principally include government bonds from Japan, Mexico, Hong 
Kong, South Korea and India. 

The table above includes average amounts of HQLA held 
at Citigroup’s operating entities that are eligible for inclusion 
in the calculation of Citigroup’s consolidated Liquidity 
Coverage ratio (LCR), pursuant to the U.S. LCR rules. These 
amounts include the HQLA needed to meet the minimum 
requirements at these entities and any amounts in excess of 
these minimums that are assumed to be transferable to other 
entities within Citigroup. Citigroup’s HQLA increased 
quarter-over-quarter, primarily reflecting growth in deposits. 
As of September 30, 2021, Citigroup had approximately 
$994 billion of available liquidity resources to support client 
and business needs, including end-of-period HQLA assets; 
additional unencumbered securities, including excess liquidity 
held at bank entities that is non-transferable to other entities 
within Citigroup; and available assets not already accounted 
for within Citi’s HQLA to support Federal Home Loan Bank 
(FHLB) and Federal Reserve Bank discount window 
borrowing capacity.

Short-Term Liquidity Measurement: Liquidity Coverage 
Ratio (LCR)
In addition to internal 30-day liquidity stress testing performed 
for Citi’s major entities, operating subsidiaries and countries, 
Citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the LCR. The 
table below details the components of Citi’s LCR calculation 
and HQLA in excess of net outflows for the periods indicated:

As of September 30, 2021, Citigroup’s average LCR 
increased from the quarter ended June 30, 2021. The increase 
was primarily driven by lower funding needs in broker-dealer 
subsidiaries along with debt issuance in the latter part of the 
prior quarter.

year and 2% sequentially. Excluding the impact of FX 
translation, average deposits grew 5% from the prior-year 
period and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase 
reflected continued client engagement as well as the elevated 
level of liquidity in the financial system. On this basis, average 
deposits in GCB increased 9%, with strong growth in North 
America. 

Excluding the impact of FX translation, average deposits 

in ICG grew 4% year-over-year, with strong growth in the

Long-Term Liquidity Measurement: Net Stable Funding 
Ratio (NSFR)
As previously disclosed, in October 2020, the U.S. banking 
agencies adopted a final rule to assess the availability of a 
bank’s stable funding against a required level. 

The final rule became effective beginning July 1, 2021, 
while public disclosure requirements to report the ratio will 
occur on a semiannual basis beginning June 30, 2023. Citi was 
in compliance with the final rule as of the third quarter of 
2021.

End-of-period loans were largely unchanged year-over-

On an average basis, loans declined 1% year-over-year 

and were largely unchanged sequentially. Excluding the 
impact of FX translation, average loans declined 2% year-
over-year and were largely unchanged sequentially. On this 
basis, average GCB loans declined 4% year-over-year, 
primarily reflecting the reclassification of loans to held-for-
sale as a result of Citi’s agreement to sell its consumer 
banking business in Australia.

Excluding the impact of FX translation, average ICG 

loans were largely unchanged year-over-year. Loans in 
corporate lending declined 23% on an average basis, reflecting 
net repayments as Citi continued to assist its clients in 
accessing the capital markets, as well as lower demand. 
Private bank loans increased 14%, largely driven by increased 
secured lending to high-net-worth clients. Markets and 
securities services loans increased 35%, reflecting an increase 
in securitization financing. TTS loans increased 9%, reflecting 
an increase in trade flows and originations. 

Average Corporate/Other loans continued to decline 

(down 42%), driven by the wind-down of legacy assets.

Long-Term Debt 
The weighted-average maturity of unsecured long-term debt 
issued by Citigroup and its affiliates (including Citibank) with 
a remaining life greater than one year was approximately 
8.6 years as of September 30, 2021, compared to 8.6 years as 
of the prior year and 8.8 years as of the prior quarter. The 
weighted-average maturity is calculated based on the 
contractual maturity of each security. For securities that are 
redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the holder, the 
weighted-average maturity is calculated based on the earliest 
date an option becomes exercisable.

Citi’s long-term debt outstanding at the Citigroup parent 

company includes benchmark senior and subordinated debt 
and what Citi refers to as customer-related debt, consisting of 
structured notes, such as equity- and credit-linked notes, as 
well as non-structured notes. Citi’s issuance of customer-
related debt is generally driven by customer demand and 
complements benchmark debt issuance as a source of funding 
for Citi’s non-bank entities. Citi’s long-term debt at the bank 
includes bank notes, FHLB advances and securitizations.

Note: Amounts represent the current value of long-term debt on Citi’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet that, for certain debt instruments, includes 
consideration of fair value, hedging impacts and unamortized discounts and 
premiums.
(1) Non-bank includes long-term debt issued to third parties by the parent 

holding company (Citigroup) and Citi’s non-bank subsidiaries (including 
broker-dealer subsidiaries) that are consolidated into Citigroup. As of 
September 30, 2021, non-bank included $63.5 billion of long-term debt 
issued by Citi’s broker-dealer and other subsidiaries, as well as certain 
Citigroup consolidated hedging activities.

(2) Local country and other includes debt issued by Citi’s affiliates in 
support of their local operations. Within non-bank, certain secured 
financing is also included.

(3) Predominantly credit card securitizations, primarily backed by Citi-

branded credit card receivables.

Citi’s total long-term debt outstanding decreased year-

over-year, primarily driven by declines in unsecured 
benchmark senior debt, FHLB borrowings and securitizations 
at the bank, partially offset by the issuance of customer-related 
debt at the non-bank entities. Sequentially, long-term debt 
outstanding decreased, driven primarily by decreases in FHLB 
borrowings at the bank and unsecured benchmark senior debt 
at the non-bank entities.

As part of its liability management, Citi has considered, 

and may continue to consider, opportunities to redeem or 
repurchase its long-term debt pursuant to open market 
purchases, tender offers or other means. Such redemptions and 
repurchases help reduce Citi’s overall funding costs. During 
the third quarter of 2021, Citi redeemed or repurchased an 
aggregate of approximately $5.9 billion of its outstanding 
long-term debt.

Citi manages the risks in its secured funding by 

conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in 
capacity, tenor, haircut, collateral profile and client actions. In 
addition, Citi maintains counterparty diversification by 
establishing concentration triggers and assessing counterparty 
reliability and stability under stress. Citi generally sources 
secured funding from more than 150 counterparties.

Short-Term Borrowings
Citi’s short-term borrowings of $30 billion decreased 21% 
year-over-year, reflecting a decline in FHLB advances, and 
6% sequentially, driven by a decline in FHLB advances and 
unsecured commercial paper, partially offset by increases in 
asset-backed commercial paper and structured notes (see Note 
16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further 
information on Citigroup’s and its affiliates’ outstanding 
short-term borrowings).

Secured Funding Transactions and Short-Term 
Borrowings
Citi supplements its primary sources of funding with short-
term financings that generally include (i) secured funding 
transactions consisting of securities loaned or sold under 
agreements to repurchase, i.e., repos, and (ii) to a lesser extent, 
short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper and 
borrowings from the FHLB and other market participants. 

Secured Funding Transactions
Secured funding is primarily accessed through Citi’s broker-
dealer subsidiaries to fund efficiently both (i) secured lending 
activity and (ii) a portion of the securities inventory held in the 
context of market making and customer activities. Citi also 
executes a smaller portion of its secured funding transactions 
through its bank entities, which are typically collateralized by 
government debt securities. Generally, daily changes in the 
level of Citi’s secured funding are primarily due to 
fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book 
(as described below) and securities inventory. 

Secured funding of $209 billion as of September 30, 2021 

increased 1% from the prior-year period and decreased 6% 
sequentially. Excluding the impact of FX translation, secured 
funding was largely unchanged from the prior-year period and 
decreased 4% sequentially, driven by normal business activity. 
The average balance for secured funding was approximately 
$229 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2021.

The portion of secured funding in the broker-dealer 
subsidiaries that funds secured lending is commonly referred 
to as “matched book” activity. The majority of this activity is 
secured by high-quality liquid securities such as U.S. Treasury 
securities, U.S. agency securities and foreign government debt 
securities. Other secured funding is secured by less liquid 
securities, including equity securities, corporate bonds and 
asset-backed securities, the tenor of which is generally equal 
to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding matched book 
assets.

The remainder of the secured funding activity in the 
broker-dealer subsidiaries serves to fund securities inventory 
held in the context of market making and customer activities. 
To maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market 
conditions, including under periods of stress, Citi manages 
these activities by taking into consideration the quality of the 
underlying collateral and establishing minimum required 
funding tenors. The weighted average maturity of Citi’s 
secured funding of less liquid securities inventory was greater 
than 110 days as of September 30, 2021.

Credit Ratings
While not included in the table below, the long-term and 
short-term ratings of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. 
(CGMHI) were BBB+/A-2 at Standard & Poor’s and A+/F1 at 
Fitch as of September 30, 2021.

Fitch Ratings (Fitch)

Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s)

Standard & Poor’s (S&P)

Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades
Ratings downgrades by Moody’s, Fitch or S&P could 
negatively impact Citigroup’s and/or Citibank’s funding and 
liquidity due to reduced funding capacity, including derivative 
triggers, which could take the form of cash obligations and 
collateral requirements.

The following information is provided for the purpose of 

analyzing the potential funding and liquidity impact to 
Citigroup and Citibank of a hypothetical simultaneous 
ratings downgrade across all three major rating agencies. This 
analysis is subject to certain estimates, estimation 
methodologies, judgments and uncertainties. Uncertainties 
include potential ratings limitations that certain entities may 
have with respect to permissible counterparties, as well as 
general subjective counterparty behavior. For example, certain 
corporate customers and markets counterparties could re-
evaluate their business relationships with Citi and limit 
transactions in certain contracts or market instruments with 
Citi. Changes in counterparty behavior could impact Citi’s 
funding and liquidity, as well as the results of operations of 
certain of its businesses. The actual impact to Citigroup or 
Citibank is unpredictable and may differ materially from the 
potential funding and liquidity impacts described below. For 
additional information on the impact of credit rating changes 
on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see “Risk Factors—
Liquidity Risks” in Citi’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Citigroup Inc. and Citibank—Potential Derivative Triggers
As of September 30, 2021, Citi estimates that a hypothetical 
one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of 
Citigroup Inc. across all three major rating agencies could 
impact Citigroup’s funding and liquidity due to derivative 
triggers by approximately $1.1 billion, compared to $1.0 
billion as of June 30, 2021. Other funding sources, such as 
secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, 
for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be 
adversely affected.

As of September 30, 2021, Citi estimates that a 
hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-
term rating of Citibank across all three major rating agencies 
could impact Citibank’s funding and liquidity due to 
derivative triggers by approximately $0.5 billion, unchanged 
from June 30, 2021. Other funding sources, such as secured 
funding transactions and other margin requirements, for which 
there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely 
impacted.

In total, as of September 30, 2021, Citi estimates that a 

one-notch downgrade of Citigroup and Citibank across all 
three major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate 
cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately 
$1.6 billion, compared to $1.4 billion as of June 30, 2021 (see 
also Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). As 
detailed under “High-Quality Liquid Assets” above, Citigroup 
has various liquidity resources available to its bank and non-
bank entities in part as a contingency for the potential events 
described above.

In addition, a broad range of mitigating actions are 
currently included in Citigroup’s and Citibank’s contingency 
funding plans. For Citigroup, these mitigating factors include, 
but are not limited to, accessing surplus funding capacity from 
existing clients, tailoring levels of secured lending and 
adjusting the size of select trading books and collateralized 
borrowings at certain Citibank subsidiaries. Mitigating actions 
available to Citibank include, but are not limited to, selling or 
financing highly liquid government securities, tailoring levels 
of secured lending, adjusting the size of select trading assets, 
reducing loan originations and renewals, raising additional 
deposits or borrowing from the FHLB or central banks. Citi 
believes these mitigating actions could substantially reduce the 
funding and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades 
described above.

62

 
Citibank—Additional Potential Impacts
In addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a 
potential downgrade of Citibank’s senior debt/long-term rating 
across any of the three major rating agencies could also have 
an adverse impact on the commercial paper/short-term rating 
of Citibank. As of September 30, 2021, Citibank had liquidity 
commitments of approximately $10.0 billion to consolidated 
asset-backed commercial paper conduits, compared to $9.0 
billion as of June 30, 2021 (for additional information, see 
Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

In addition to the above-referenced liquidity resources of 

certain Citibank entities, Citibank could reduce the funding 
and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades 
described above through mitigating actions, including 
repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial 
paper conduits. In the event of the potential downgrades 
described above, Citi believes that certain corporate customers 
could re-evaluate their deposit relationships with Citibank. 
This re-evaluation could result in clients’ adjusting their 
discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository 
institution, which could potentially reduce certain deposit 
levels at Citibank. However, Citi could choose to adjust 
pricing, offer alternative deposit products to its existing 
customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers, in 
addition to the mitigating actions referenced above.

MARKET RISK

Market risk emanates from both Citi’s trading and non-trading 
portfolios. For additional information on market risk and 
market risk management at Citi, see “Market Risk” and “Risk 
Factors” in Citi’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Market Risk of Non-Trading Portfolios
The following table sets forth the estimated impact to Citi’s net interest revenue, AOCI and the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio

(1) Certain trading-oriented businesses within Citi have accrual-accounted positions that are excluded from the estimated impact to net interest revenue in the table, 
since these exposures are managed economically in combination with mark-to-market positions. The U.S. dollar interest rate exposure associated with these 
businesses was $(70) million for a 100 bps instantaneous increase in interest rates as of September 30, 2021.
Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.

(2)

The sequential decline in the estimated impact to Citi’s 
net interest revenue was driven by a decline in non-U.S. dollar 
exposure due to an increase in non-U.S. interest rates.

The modest sequential decline in the estimated impact to 

AOCI primarily reflected a continuation of the positioning 
strategy of Citi Treasury’s investment securities and related 
interest rate derivatives portfolio.

In the event of a parallel instantaneous 100 bps increase in 

interest rates, as of September 30, 2021, Citi expects that the 
$4.9 billion negative impact to AOCI would be offset in 
stockholders’ equity through the expected recovery of the 
impact on AOCI through accretion of Citi’s investment 
portfolio over approximately 37 months.

The following table sets forth the estimated impact to 
Citi’s net interest revenue, AOCI and the Common Equity 
Tier 1 Capital ratio (on a fully implemented basis) under five 
different changes in interest rate scenarios for the U.S. dollar 
and Citi’s other currencies. The 100 bps downward rate 
scenarios are impacted by the low level of interest rates in 
several countries and the assumption that market interest rates, 
as well as rates paid to depositors and charged to borrowers, 
do not fall below zero (i.e., the “flooring assumption”). The 
rate scenarios are also impacted by convexity related to 
mortgage products.

64

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As shown in the table above, the magnitude of the impact 

to Citi’s net interest revenue and AOCI is greater under 
Scenario 2 as compared to Scenario 3. This is because the 
combination of changes to Citi’s investment portfolio, 
partially offset by changes related to Citi’s pension liabilities, 
results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at 
shorter- and intermediate-term maturities.

Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates—Impacts on AOCI 
and Capital
As of September 30, 2021, Citi estimates that an unanticipated 
parallel instantaneous 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar 
against all of the other currencies in which Citi has invested 
capital could reduce Citi’s tangible common equity (TCE) by 
approximately $1.5 billion, or 0.9%, as a result of changes to 
Citi’s foreign currency translation adjustment in AOCI, net of 
hedges. This impact would be primarily due to changes in the 
value of the Mexican peso, Euro and Indian rupee.

This impact is also before any mitigating actions Citi may 

take, including ongoing management of its foreign currency 
translation exposure. Specifically, as currency movements 
change the value of Citi’s net investments in foreign currency-
denominated capital, these movements also change the value 
of Citi’s risk-weighted assets denominated in those currencies. 
This, coupled with Citi’s foreign currency hedging strategies, 
such as foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency 
forwards and other currency hedging instruments, lessens the 
impact of foreign currency movements on Citi’s Common 
Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio. Changes in these hedging 
strategies, as well as hedging costs, divestitures and tax 
impacts, can further affect the actual impact of changes in 
foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital as compared to an 
unanticipated parallel shock, as described above.

The effect of Citi’s ongoing management strategies with 

respect to changes in foreign exchange rates, and the impact of 
these changes on Citi’s TCE and Common Equity Tier 1 
Capital ratio, are shown in the table below. For additional 
information on the changes in AOCI, see Note 17 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Interest revenue and Net interest revenue include the taxable equivalent adjustments primarily related to the tax-exempt bond portfolio and certain tax-advantaged 
loan programs (based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%) of $46 million, $51 million and $59 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, 
June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively. 
Interest expense associated with certain hybrid financial instruments, which are classified as Long-term debt and accounted for at fair value, is reported together 
with any changes in fair value as part of Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income and is therefore not reflected in Interest expense in the 
table above.

(3) The average rate on interest revenue and net interest margin reflects the taxable equivalent gross-up adjustment. See footnote 1 above.

Interest revenue and Net interest revenue include the taxable equivalent adjustments discussed in the table above.

Citi’s net interest revenue (NIR) in the third quarter of 

2021 decreased 1% to $10.4 billion versus the prior-year 
period. As set forth in the table above, Citi’s NIR on a taxable 
equivalent basis also decreased 1% year-over-year, or 
approximately $100 million, driven by modest declines in both 
non-ICG Markets NIR and ICG Markets (fixed income 
markets and equity markets) NIR. The decrease in non-ICG 
Markets NIR reflected lower loan balances and the impact of 
lower deposit spreads. The decrease in ICG Markets NIR 
largely reflected a change in the mix of trading positions in 
support of client activity.

Citi’s NIM was 1.93% on a taxable equivalent basis in the 

third quarter of 2021, an increase of 1 basis point from the 
prior quarter, primarily reflecting higher cards NIR in North 
America GCB due to higher fees and higher loans, partially 
offset by growth in the balance sheet due to higher deposits 
and a decrease in ICG Markets NIR.

Market Risk of Trading Portfolios

Value at Risk (VAR)
Citi believes its VAR model is conservatively calibrated to incorporate fat-tail scaling and the greater of short-term (approximately the 
most recent month) and long-term (three years) market volatility. As of September 30, 2021, Citi estimates that the conservative 
features of the VAR calibration contribute an approximate 31% add-on to what would be a VAR estimated under the assumption of 
stable and perfectly, normally distributed markets. As of June 30, 2021, the add-on was 35%.

As set forth in the table below, Citi’s average trading VAR decreased quarter-over-quarter, mainly due to a reduction in interest 
rate short hedges as well as a general reduction in interest rate risk, both in ICG Markets businesses. Citi’s average trading and credit 
portfolio VAR increased quarter-over-quarter, largely driven by increased credit hedging activity.

(1)  Covariance adjustment (also known as diversification benefit) equals the difference between the total VAR and the sum of the VARs tied to each risk type. The 
benefit reflects the fact that the risks within individual and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VAR on a given day will be 
lower than the sum of the VARs relating to each risk type. The determination of the primary drivers of changes to the covariance adjustment is made by an 
examination of the impact of both model parameter and position changes.

(2)  The total trading VAR includes mark-to-market and certain fair value option trading positions in ICG, with the exception of hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value 

option loans and all CVA exposures. Available-for-sale and accrual exposures are not included.

(3)  The specific risk-only component represents the level of equity and fixed income issuer-specific risk embedded in VAR. 
(4)  The credit portfolio is composed of mark-to-market positions associated with non-trading business units including Citi Treasury, the CVA relating to derivative 
counterparties and all associated CVA hedges. FVA and DVA are not included. The credit portfolio also includes hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value option 
loans and hedges to the leveraged finance pipeline within capital markets origination in ICG.

Regulatory VAR Back-testing
In accordance with Basel III, Citi is required to perform back-
testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR 
model. Regulatory VAR back-testing is the process in which 
the daily one-day VAR, at a 99% confidence interval, is 
compared to the buy-and-hold profit and loss (i.e., the profit 
and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of 
the day and re-priced the following day). Buy-and-hold profit 
and loss represents the daily mark-to-market profit and loss 
attributable to price movements in covered positions from the 
close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and 
loss excludes realized trading revenue, net interest, fees and 
commissions, intra-day trading profit and loss and changes in 
reserves.

Based on a 99% confidence level, Citi would expect two 

to three days in any one year where buy-and-hold losses 
exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the conservative 
calibration of Citi’s VAR model (as a result of taking the 
greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-tail scaling 
of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer exceptions under 
normal and stable market conditions. Periods of unstable 
market conditions could increase the number of back-testing 
exceptions.

As of September 30, 2021, there were no back-testing 
exceptions observed for Citi’s Regulatory VAR for the prior 
12 months.

STRATEGIC RISK
For additional information regarding strategic risk, including 
Citi’s management of strategic risk, see “Managing Global 
Risk—Strategic Risk” in Citi’s First Quarter of 2021 Form 10-
Q and Citi’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Country Risk

Top 25 Country Exposures
The following table presents Citi’s top 25 exposures by 
country (excluding the U.S.) as of September 30, 2021. 
(Including the U.S, the total exposure as of September 30, 
2021 to the top 25 countries would represent approximately 
96% of Citi’s exposure to all countries.)

For purposes of the table, loan amounts are reflected in 
the country where the loan is booked, which is generally based 
on the domicile of the borrower. For example, a loan to a 

Chinese subsidiary of a Switzerland-based corporation will 
generally be categorized as a loan in China. In addition, Citi 
has developed regional booking centers in certain countries, 
most significantly in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland, 
in order to more efficiently serve its corporate customers. As 
an example, with respect to the U.K., only 32% of corporate 
loans presented in the table below are to U.K. domiciled 
entities (32% for unfunded commitments), with the balance of 
the loans predominately to European domiciled counterparties. 
Approximately 84% of the total U.K. funded loans and 84% of 
the total U.K. unfunded commitments were investment grade 
as of September 30, 2021. 

Trading account assets and investment securities are 
generally categorized based on the domicile of the issuer of 
the security of the underlying reference entity. For additional 
information on the assets included in the table, see the 
footnotes to the table below.
