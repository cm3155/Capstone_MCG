Strategic Refresh—Market Exits and Planned 
Revision to Reporting Structure
As part of its strategic refresh, Citi is making management reporting changes 
to align with its vision and strategy, including to assist Citi in decisions about 
resources and capital allocation and to assess business performance. In the 
first quarter of 2022, Citi will revise its financial reporting structure to align 
with these management reporting changes to enable investors and others to 
better understand the performance of Citi’s businesses (see the table below for 
additional information on the revised financial reporting structure):

•  First, Citi is creating a Personal Banking and Wealth Management 
segment. It will consist of two distinct reporting units: U.S. Personal
Banking businesses and a Global Wealth Management business, which 
will include the private bank.

• Second, with respect to Institutional Clients Group (ICG), Citi will begin 
reporting under three reporting units: Services, Banking and Markets. 
Services will include treasury and trade solutions and securities services, 
reflecting the importance of these businesses to Citi’s future.

• Finally, Citi is creating Legacy Franchises, a segment that will consist of 
all the businesses Citi intends to exit (see below), including its remaining 
Legacy Holdings assets.

In conjunction with the strategic refresh, in 2021 Citi announced that it 
will focus its consumer banking franchises in Asia and EMEA on four wealth 
centers: Singapore, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and London. 
As a result, Citi is pursuing exits of its consumer franchises in the remaining 
13 markets across these two regions.

In 2021 and early 2022, Citi announced sale agreements for or exit of 
a majority of the 13 markets (for additional information, see “Executive 
Summary” and “Asia GCB” below). ICG will continue to serve clients, 
including its commercial banking clients, in all of these markets.

In addition, in January 2022, Citi announced that it intends to exit 
the consumer, small business and middle-market banking operations 
of Citibanamex. The businesses in the intended exit include the Mexico 
consumer and small business banking operations, reported as part of Citi’s 
GCB segment, as well as the Mexico middle-market banking business, 
reported in Citi’s ICG segment. These operations represent the entirety 
of the Latin America GCB unit. Citi will continue to operate a locally 
licensed banking business in Mexico through its global ICG (for additional 
information, see “Executive Summary” and “Latin America GCB” below).
For additional information regarding the exit markets, see Note 2 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. For information regarding risks related to 
the exit markets, see “Risk Factors” below.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
As described further throughout this Executive Summary, Citi demonstrated 
continued progress across the franchise during 2021:

•  Citi’s earnings increased significantly versus the prior year, largely 

reflecting an allowance for credit loss (ACL) release of approximately 
$8.8 billion as a result of continued improvement in both the 
macroeconomic environment and portfolio credit quality.

•  Citi’s revenues declined 5% from the prior year. Excluding a pretax loss of 
approximately $0.7 billion (approximately $0.6 billion after-tax) related to 
Citi’s agreement to sell its Australia consumer banking business in Asia Global 
Consumer Banking (GCB) (see “Citigroup” below), Citi’s revenues declined 
4%, as strength in investment banking, equity markets, the private bank and 
securities services in Institutional Clients Group (ICG) was more than offset 
by normalization in market activity in fixed income markets within ICG, as 
well as the impact of lower deposit spreads and card loans across GCB.
•  Citi’s expenses included pretax costs of approximately $1.2 billion 

($1.1 billion after-tax) primarily related to charges incurred from the 
voluntary early retirement program (VERP) in connection with the 
wind-down of the Korea consumer banking business (for additional 
information, see “Asia GCB” below).

•  Citi continued to invest in its transformation, including 

infrastructure supporting its risk and control environment, and make 
business-led investments.

•  Citi had broad-based deposit growth across ICG and GCB (up 3% and 5%, 
respectively), reflecting continued engagement across both corporate and 
consumer clients.

•  Citi returned approximately $11.8 billion of capital to its common 

shareholders in the form of $4.2 billion in dividends and $7.6 billion in 
common share repurchases, totaling approximately 105 million common 
shares, while maintaining robust regulatory capital ratios.

•  In addition to the sale announcements related to Asia GCB, Citi also 

announced it intends to exit the consumer, small business and middle-
market banking operations of Citibanamex in Mexico. Citi’s planned 
divestitures of its consumer businesses across Mexico, Asia and EMEA 
are aligned with the repositioning of its consumer operations to focus on 
global wealth centers, as well as payments and lending and a targeted 
retail presence in the U.S. (For additional information on the exit markets 
and Citi’s revised reporting structure effective for the first quarter of 2022, 
see “Strategic Refresh—Market Exits and Revised Reporting Strategy” 
above and “Latin America GCB” and “Asia GCB” below.)

Although economic growth and employment rates have continued 
to recover from pandemic-related lows, particularly in the U.S., various 
macroeconomic and other challenges and uncertainties related to, among 

other things, the duration and severity of the pandemic-related public health 
crisis, disruptions of global supply chains, inflationary pressures, increasing 
interest rates and geopolitical tensions involving Eastern Europe, will 
continue to create uncertainty around Citi’s businesses and results.

For a discussion of trends, uncertainties and risks that will or could 

impact Citi’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition during 
2022, see “2021 Results Summary,” “Risk Factors,” each respective business’s 
results of operations and “Managing Global Risk” below.

2021 Results Summary

Citigroup
Citigroup reported net income of $22.0 billion, or $10.14 per share, 
compared to net income of $11.0 billion, or $4.72 per share, in the prior year. 
The increase in net income was driven by lower cost of credit, partially offset 
by higher expenses and lower revenues. Citigroup’s effective tax rate was 
20%, up modestly from 19% in the prior year. Earnings per share increased 
significantly, primarily driven by net income.

Citigroup revenues of $71.9 billion decreased 5% from the prior year. Excluding 

the Australia loss on sale, Citigroup revenues decreased 4%, primarily driven 
by lower revenues in both ICG and GCB, partially offset by higher revenues in 
Corporate/Other.

As discussed above, Citi’s 2021 results include the impacts of divestitures 
of Citi’s consumer banking businesses in Asia. Reported revenues include the 
Australia loss on sale (approximately $0.7 billion pretax, $0.6 billion after-
tax), primarily reflecting the impact of a currency translation adjustment 
(CTA) loss (net of hedges) already reflected in the Accumulated other 
comprehensive income (AOCI) component of equity. Upon closing, the CTA 
balance will be removed from the AOCI component of equity, resulting in a 
neutral impact to Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital.

Reported expenses include the impact of the Korea VERP of approximately 
$1.1 billion (approximately $0.8 billion after-tax) and contract modification 
costs related to the Asia divestitures of approximately $119 million 
(approximately $98 million after-tax). (As used throughout this Form 10-K, 
Citi’s results of operations and financial condition excluding the impact 
of the Australia loss on sale, Korea VERP and other Asia divestiture-related 
costs are non-GAAP financial measures. Citi believes the presentation of its 
results of operations and financial condition excluding the divestiture-related 
impacts described above provides a meaningful depiction of the underlying 
fundamentals of its broader results and Asia GCB businesses’ results for 
investors, industry analysts and others.)

Citigroup’s end-of-period loans decreased 1% from the prior year to 
$668 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation into 
U.S. dollars for reporting purposes (FX translation), Citigroup’s end-of-
period loans were largely unchanged, as growth in ICG was offset by lower 
loans in GCB and Corporate/Other. Citigroup’s end-of-period deposits 

7

increased 3% to $1.3 trillion. Excluding the impact of FX translation, 
Citigroup’s end-of-period deposits increased 4%, reflecting growth in both 
GCB and ICG. (As used throughout this Form 10-K, Citi’s results of operations 
excluding the impact of FX translation are non-GAAP financial measures. 
Citi believes the presentation of its results of operations and financial 
condition excluding the impact of FX translation provides a meaningful 
depiction of the underlying fundamentals of its businesses for investors, 
industry analysts and others.)

Expenses
Citigroup operating expenses of $48.2 billion increased 9% versus the 
prior year. Excluding the impact of the Asia divestitures, expenses of 
$47.0 billion increased 6%, primarily reflecting investments in Citi’s 
transformation, including infrastructure supporting its risk and control 
environment, business-led investments and revenue- and transaction-related 
expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Citi expects expenses 
in 2022 to continue to be impacted by its transformation-related and 
business-led investments.

Cost of Credit
Citi’s total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims were a 
benefit of $3.8 billion, compared to a cost of $17.5 billion in the prior year 
primarily related to the pandemic. The decreased cost of credit was driven by 
a net ACL reserve release of $8.8 billion (versus a build of $9.8 billion in the 
prior year) as well as lower net credit losses. Citi’s net ACL release primarily 
reflected improvement in Citi’s macroeconomic outlook and portfolio credit 
quality. Citi could experience higher credit costs in 2022, as the level of ACL 
releases from 2021 are unlikely to continue, and Citi expects to build ACL 
reserves for new lending volumes.

For further information on the drivers of Citi’s ACL, see “Significant 
Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—Citi’s Allowance for Credit 
Losses (ACL)” below.

Net credit losses of $4.9 billion declined 36% from the prior year. 

Consumer net credit losses of $4.5 billion decreased 32%, primarily reflecting 
lower loan volumes and improved delinquencies in the North America 
cards portfolios. Corporate net credit losses of $395 million decreased 60%, 
primarily reflecting improvements in portfolio credit quality.

For additional information on Citi’s consumer and corporate credit 
costs and ACL, see each respective business’s results of operations and 
“Credit Risk” below.

Capital
Citigroup’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio was 12.2% as of December 31, 
2021, based on the Basel III Standardized Approach framework for determining 
risk-weighted assets, compared to 11.5% as of December 31, 2020, based on 
the Basel III Advanced Approaches for determining risk-weighted assets. The 
increase in the ratio primarily reflected actions to reduce risk-weighted assets 
(RWA) and a temporary pause in common share repurchases in the fourth 
quarter of 2021, in preparation for the implementation of the Standardized 
Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR) on January 1, 2022. Citi 
resumed common share repurchases in January 2022.

Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio was 5.7% as of December 31, 
2021, compared to 7.0% as of December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily 
driven by the expiration of temporary relief granted by the Federal Reserve 
Board (FRB) as of the end of the first quarter of 2021. For additional 
information on SA-CCR and Citi’s capital ratios, see “Capital Resources” below.

Institutional Clients Group
ICG net income of $15.7 billion increased 36%, reflecting lower cost of 
credit, partially offset by higher expenses and lower revenues. ICG operating 
expenses increased 8% to $26.5 billion, reflecting continued investments 
in Citi’s transformation, business-led investments and revenue- and 
transaction-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings.

ICG revenues of $43.9 billion decreased 3%, as a 7% increase in Banking 
revenues was more than offset by an 11% decline in Markets and securities 
services revenues. The increase in Banking revenues included the impact of 
$144 million of losses on loan hedges related to corporate lending and the 
private bank, compared to losses of $51 million in the prior year.

Banking revenues of $23.3 billion (excluding the impact of losses on 
loan hedges) increased 7%, as higher revenues in investment banking and 
the private bank were partially offset by lower revenues in treasury and trade 
solutions and corporate lending. Investment banking revenues of $7.5 billion 
increased 30%, reflecting growth across products, particularly in advisory and 
equity underwriting. Advisory revenues increased 78% to $1.8 billion, equity 
underwriting revenues increased 53% to $2.4 billion and debt underwriting 
revenues increased 3% to $3.3 billion.

Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $9.4 billion declined 4%, as 
higher fee revenues, including a recovery in commercial card revenues, as 
well as growth in trade were more than offset by the impact of lower deposit 
spreads. Private bank revenues increased 5%. Excluding the impact of gains 
on loan hedges, private bank revenues of $4.0 billion increased 6%, driven 
by higher loan volumes and spreads, as well as higher managed investments 
and deposits, partially offset by lower deposit spreads. Corporate lending 
revenues decreased 3%. Excluding the impact of losses on loan hedges, 
corporate lending revenues of $2.3 billion decreased 1%, as lower cost of 
funds was more than offset by lower loan volumes.

Markets and securities services revenues of $20.8 billion decreased 11%. 

Fixed income markets revenues of $13.7 billion decreased 22%, reflecting 
a normalization in market activity across rates and spread products. 
Equity markets revenues of $4.5 billion increased 25%, driven by growth 
across all products, reflecting solid client activity and favorable market 
conditions. Securities services revenues of $2.7 billion increased 6%, as 
strong fee revenues, driven by higher settlement volumes and higher assets 
under custody, were partially offset by lower deposit spreads. For additional 
information on the results of operations of ICG in 2021, see “Institutional 
Clients Group” below.

8

Global Consumer Banking
GCB net income was $6.1 billion, compared to net income of $667 million in 
the prior year, reflecting lower cost of credit, partially offset by lower revenues 
and higher expenses. GCB operating expenses of $20.0 billion increased 12%. 
Excluding the impact of FX translation and the Asia divestitures, expenses 
increased 5%, reflecting continued investments in Citi’s transformation, as 
well as business-led investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset 
by productivity savings.

GCB revenues of $27.3 billion decreased 10% from the prior year. 
Excluding the impact of FX translation and the Australia loss on sale, 
revenues decreased 9%, as continued solid deposit growth and growth 
in assets under management were more than offset by lower card loans 
and lower deposit spreads. For additional information on GCB’s results of 
operations, including the impact of FX translation, see “Global Consumer 
Banking” below.

North America GCB revenues of $17.5 billion decreased 9%, with lower 
revenues across branded cards, retail services and retail banking. Branded 
cards revenues of $8.2 billion decreased 7%, reflecting continued higher 
payment rates. Retail services revenues of $5.1 billion decreased 15%, 
reflecting continued higher payment rates and lower average loans as well as 
higher partner payments. Retail banking revenues of $4.2 billion decreased 
7%, as the benefit of stronger deposit volumes was more than offset by lower 
deposit spreads and lower mortgage revenues.

North America GCB average deposits of $206 billion increased 17% 
year-over-year and average retail banking loans of $50 billion decreased 4% 
year-over-year, while assets under management of $87 billion increased 8%. 
Average branded cards loans of $81 billion decreased 4% and average retail 
services loans decreased 7%, reflecting higher payment rates. Branded cards 
spend volume of $411 billion increased 21% and retail services spend volume 
of $92 billion increased 18%, reflecting a recovery in sales activity from the 
pandemic-driven low levels in the prior year. For additional information 
on the results of operations of North America GCB in 2021, see “Global 
Consumer Banking—North America GCB” below.

International GCB revenues (consisting of Latin America GCB and 

Asia GCB (which includes the results of operations in certain EMEA countries)) 
of $9.8 billion declined 11% versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of 
FX translation and the Australia loss on sale, international GCB revenues 
declined 7%. Excluding the impact of FX translation, Latin America GCB 
revenues decreased 9%, driven by lower average loans and lower deposit spreads. 
Excluding the impact of FX translation and the Australia loss on sale, Asia 
GCB revenues decreased 6%, reflecting lower spreads, partially offset by higher 
investment revenues. For additional information on the results of operations 
of Latin America GCB and Asia GCB in 2021, including the impacts of FX 
translation, see “Global Consumer Banking—Latin America GCB” and 
“Global Consumer Banking—Asia GCB” below. For additional information 
on Citi’s consumer banking business in Australia, see “Global Consumer 
Banking—Asia GCB” below.

Year-over-year, excluding the impact of FX translation, international GCB 
average deposits of $146 billion increased 5%, average retail banking loans 
of $72 billion decreased 3% and assets under management of $145 billion 
increased 5%. On this basis, international GCB average card loans of 
$20 billion decreased 13%, while credit card spend volumes of $100 billion 
increased 9%, reflecting a continued recovery in credit card spend activity 
from the pandemic-related low levels in the prior year.

Corporate/Other
Corporate/Other net income was $215 million, compared to a net loss of 
$1.1 billion in the prior year, reflecting higher revenues, lower expenses, 
lower cost of credit, and the release of a foreign tax credit (FTC) valuation 
allowance. Operating expenses of $1.6 billion decreased 14%, reflecting the 
absence of the prior year’s civil money penalty and the wind-down of legacy 
assets, partially offset by increases related to Citi’s transformation.

Corporate/Other revenues of $667 million compared to $71 million in 
the prior year, primarily driven by higher net revenue from the investment 
portfolio. For additional information on the results of operations of 
Corporate/Other in 2021, see “Corporate/Other” below.

CITI’S CONSENT ORDER COMPLIANCE
Citi has embarked on a multiyear transformation, with the target outcome to 
change Citi’s business and operating models such that they simultaneously 
strengthen risk and controls and improve Citi’s value to customers, clients 
and shareholders.

This includes efforts to effectively implement the October 2020 FRB and 

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) consent orders issued to 
Citigroup and Citibank, respectively. In the second quarter of 2021, Citi 
made an initial submission to the OCC, and submitted its plans to address 
the consent orders to both regulators during the third quarter of 2021. 
Citi continues to work constructively with the regulators, and will continue to 
reflect their feedback in its project plans and execution efforts.

As discussed above, Citi’s efforts include continued investments in its 
transformation, including the remediation of its consent orders. Citi’s CEO 
has made the strengthening of Citi’s risk and control environment a strategic 
priority and has established a Chief Administrative Officer organization to 
centralize program management. In addition, the Citigroup and Citibank 
Boards of Directors each formed a Transformation Oversight Committee, 
an ad hoc committee of each Board, to provide oversight of management’s 
remediation efforts under the consent orders.

For additional information about the consent orders, see “Risk Factors—

Compliance Risks” below and Citi’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with 
the SEC on October 7, 2020.

(1)  Revenue previously referred to as net interest revenue is now referred to as net interest income. During the fourth quarter of 2021, Citi reclassified deposit insurance expenses from Interest expense to Other operating 
expenses for all periods presented. Amounts reclassified for each year were $1,207 million for 2021, $1,203 million for 2020, $781 million for 2019, $1,182 million for 2018 and $1,249 million for 2017. See Note 1 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2)  2017 includes the one-time impact related to enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform). 2020, 2019 and 2018 reflect the tax rate structure post Tax Reform. RoTCE for 2017 excludes the one-time impact 

from Tax Reform and is a non-GAAP financial measure. For additional information, see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—Income Taxes” below. 

(3)  The return on average common stockholders’ equity is calculated using net income less preferred stock dividends divided by average common stockholders’ equity. The return on average total Citigroup stockholders’ 

equity is calculated using net income divided by average Citigroup stockholders’ equity.

(4)  RoTCE and TBV are non-GAAP financial measures. For information on RoTCE and TBV, see “Capital Resources—Tangible Common Equity, Book Value Per Share, Tangible Book Value Per Share and Returns on Equity” 

below.

(5)  Citi’s risk-based capital and leverage ratios for 2017 are non-GAAP financial measures, which reflect full implementation of regulatory capital adjustments and deductions prior to the effective date of January 1, 2018.
(6)  Citi’s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach, and the reportable Total Capital ratio was the lower derived under the Basel III Advanced 
Approaches framework as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2019 to 2017. Citi’s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios were the lower derived under the Basel III 
Advanced Approaches framework as of December 31, 2020. 

(7)  Dividends declared per common share as a percentage of net income per diluted share.
(8)  Total common dividends declared plus common share repurchases as a percentage of net income available to common shareholders (Net income, less preferred dividends). See “Consolidated Statement of Changes in 

Stockholders’ Equity,” Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “Equity Security Repurchases” below for the component details.

INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS GROUP

As of December 31, 2021, Institutional Clients Group (ICG) included 
Banking and Markets and securities services (for additional information 
on these businesses, see “Citigroup Segments” above). ICG provided 
corporate, institutional, public sector and high-net-worth clients around the 
world with a full range of wholesale banking products and services, including 
fixed income and equity sales and trading, foreign exchange, prime 
brokerage, derivative services, equity and fixed income research, corporate 
lending, investment banking and advisory services, private banking, cash 
management, trade finance and securities services. ICG transacted with 
clients in both cash instruments and derivatives, including fixed income, 
foreign currency, equity and commodity products.

For information on Citi’s planned revision to its reporting structure, 

including the reporting of the private bank as part of a new reporting 
segment, Personal Banking and Wealth Management, see “Strategic 
Refresh—Market Exits and Planned Revision to Reporting Structure” above.
ICG revenue is generated primarily from fees and spreads associated with 
these activities. ICG earns fee income for assisting clients with transactional 
services and clearing and providing brokerage and investment banking 
services and other such activities. Such fees are recognized at the point 
in time when Citigroup’s performance under the terms of a contractual 
arrangement is completed, which is typically at the trade/execution date or 
closing of a transaction. Revenue generated from these activities is recorded in 
Commissions and fees and Investment banking. Revenue is also generated 
from assets under custody and administration, which is recognized as/when 
the associated promised service is satisfied, which normally occurs at the point 
in time the service is requested by the customer and provided by Citi. Revenue 
generated from these activities is primarily recorded in Administration and 
other fiduciary fees. For additional information on these various types of 
revenues, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In addition, as a market maker, ICG facilitates transactions, including 
holding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the differential 
between the price at which it buys and sells the products. These price 
differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on the inventory are 
recorded in Principal transactions. Mark-to-market gains and losses on 
certain credit derivatives (used to hedge the corporate loan portfolio) are also 

recorded in Principal transactions (for additional information on Principal 
transactions revenue, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
Other primarily includes realized gains and losses on available-for-sale 
(AFS) debt securities, gains and losses on equity securities not held in 
trading accounts and other non-recurring gains and losses. Interest income 
earned on assets held, less interest paid on long- and short-term debt and to 
customers on deposits, is recorded as Net interest income.

The amount and types of Markets revenues are impacted by a variety of 
interrelated factors, including market liquidity; changes in market variables 
such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices 
and credit spreads, as well as their implied volatilities; investor confidence 
and other macroeconomic conditions. Assuming all other market conditions 
do not change, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally 
result in increases in revenues. However, changes in market conditions 
can significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads and the fair 
value of product inventory. For example, a decrease in market liquidity may 
increase bid/offer spreads, decrease client activity levels and widen credit 
spreads on product inventory positions.

ICG’s management of the Markets businesses involves daily monitoring 

and evaluation of the above factors at the trading desk as well as the 
country level.

In the Markets businesses, client revenues are those revenues directly 

attributable to client transactions at the time of inception, including 
commissions, interest or fees earned. Client revenues do not include the 
results of client facilitation activities (e.g., holding product inventory 
in anticipation of client demand) or the results of certain economic 
hedging activities.

ICG’s international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 

80 countries and a proprietary network in 95 countries and jurisdictions. At 
December 31, 2021, ICG had $1.8 trillion in assets and $950 billion in deposits. 
Securities services and issuer services managed $24.0 trillion in assets under 
custody and administration at December 31, 2021, of which Citi provides both 
custody and administrative services to certain clients related to $1.9 trillion of 
such assets. Managed assets under trust were $3.8 trillion at December 31, 2021. 
For additional information on these operations, see “Administration and Other 
Fiduciary Fees” in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(1)  Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the private bank and corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. Gains (losses) on loan hedges include the 

mark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. The fixed premium costs of these hedges are netted against the private bank and corporate lending 
revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. Gains (losses) on loan hedges include $(131) million and $(74) million related to the corporate loan portfolio and $(13) million and $23 million related to the private bank 
for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. All of gains (losses) on loan hedges are related to the corporate loan portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2019. Citigroup’s results of operations 
excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.

(2)  2019 includes an approximate $350 million gain on Citi’s investment in Tradeweb.
(3)  Excludes principal transactions revenues of ICG businesses other than Markets, primarily treasury and trade solutions and the private bank.
(4)  Citi assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items. For example, securities that generate Net interest income may be risk managed by derivatives 

that are recorded in Principal transactions revenue. For a description of the composition of these revenue line items, see Notes 4, 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The discussion of the results of operations for ICG below excludes (where noted) the impact of gains (losses) on hedges of accrual loans, which are non-
GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.

2021 vs. 2020
Net income of $15.7 billion increased 36% versus the prior year, primarily driven 
by lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher expenses and lower revenues.

Revenues decreased 3%, reflecting lower Markets and securities services 

revenues, partially offset by higher Banking revenues. Banking revenues 
were up 7% (both including and excluding the impact of losses on loan 
hedges), driven by higher revenues in investment banking and the private 
bank, partially offset by lower revenues in treasury and trade solutions and 
corporate lending. Markets and securities services revenues were down 
11%, primarily reflecting a normalization in fixed income markets revenues, 
partially offset by growth in equity markets and securities services.

Citi expects that revenues in its markets and investment banking 

businesses will continue to reflect the overall market environment 
during 2022.

Within Banking:

•  Investment banking revenues were up 30%, reflecting growth in the 

overall market wallet. Advisory revenues increased 78%, reflecting strength 
in North America and EMEA, driven by growth in the market wallet as 
well as wallet share gains. Equity underwriting revenues increased 53%, 
reflecting strength in North America and EMEA, driven by growth in the 
market wallet, as well as wallet share gains. Debt underwriting revenues 
increased 3%, reflecting strength in EMEA, as growth in the market wallet 
was partially offset by a decline in wallet share.

•  Treasury and trade solutions revenues decreased 4% (both including and 
excluding the impact of FX translation), reflecting a decline in revenues 
in the cash business, partially offset by an increase in trade revenues. Cash 
revenues decreased, driven by the ongoing impact of lower deposit spreads. 
The decrease was partially offset by strong growth in fee revenues reflecting 
solid client engagement and growth in transaction volumes, including 
growth in USD clearing, commercial cards and cross-border solutions. The 
increase in trade revenues was driven by improved trade spreads and growth 
in loans, reflecting an increase in trade flows and originations, primarily 
in Asia and EMEA. Average trade loans increased 5% (both including and 
excluding the impact of FX translation).

•  Corporate lending revenues decreased 3%, including the impact of losses 
on loan hedges. Excluding the impact of losses on loan hedges, revenues 
decreased 1%, as lower cost of funds was more than offset by lower loan 
volumes, reflecting muted demand given strong client liquidity positions. 
Average loans decreased 20% during the current year.

•  Private bank revenues increased 5%. Excluding the impact of gains 
(losses) on loan hedges, revenues increased 6%, driven by strong 
performance in North America and EMEA. The higher revenues reflected 
continued momentum with new and existing clients, resulting in higher 
loan volumes and spreads, higher managed investments revenues and 
higher deposit volumes. The increase in revenues was partially offset by 
lower deposit spreads due to the ongoing low interest rate environment 
and lower capital markets revenue.

Within Markets and securities services:

•  Fixed income markets revenues decreased 22%, reflecting lower revenues 

across all regions, largely driven by a comparison to a strong prior 
year, as well as a normalization in market activity, particularly in rates 
and currencies, and spread products. Non-interest revenues decreased, 
reflecting lower investor client activity across rates and currencies and 
spread products. Net interest income also decreased, largely reflecting a 
change in the mix of trading positions.

Rates and currencies revenues decreased 27%, driven by the 

normalization in market activity, and a comparison to a strong prior year 
that included elevated levels of volatility related to the pandemic. Spread 
products and other fixed income revenues decreased 11%, driven by a 
comparison to a strong prior year and the normalization in market activity, 
particularly in flow trading and structured products, reflecting lower 
volatility and spreads, partially offset by strong securitization activity.
•  Equity markets revenues increased 25%, driven by growth across all 

products. Equity derivatives revenues increased reflecting higher client 
activity, particularly in EMEA and North America. Prime finance 
revenues increased due to favorable market conditions as well as growth 
in client balances. Cash equities revenues increased modestly, reflecting 
higher client activity. Non-interest revenues increased, primarily due to 
higher principal transactions revenues, reflecting higher client activity.
•  Securities services revenues increased 6%. Excluding the impact of FX 
translation, revenues increased 7%, as an increase in fee revenues with 
both new and existing clients, driven by growth in assets under custody 
and settlement volumes, was partially offset by lower deposit spreads.

Expenses were up 8%, primarily driven by continued investments in Citi’s 
transformation, business-led investments and higher incentive compensation, 
as well as transactional related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings.
Provisions reflected a benefit of $2.9 billion compared to costs of $5.6 billion in 

the prior year, driven by an ACL release and lower net credit losses.

Net credit losses declined to $396 million from $987 million in the prior 

year, driven by improvements in portfolio credit quality.

The ACL release was $3.3 billion compared to a build of $4.6 billion 
in the prior year. The release was primarily driven by improvements in 
portfolio credit quality as well as Citi’s improved macroeconomic outlook.

and Significant Estimates” below.

GLOBAL CONSUMER BANKING

As of December 31, 2021, Global Consumer Banking (GCB) consisted of consumer banking businesses in North America, Latin America (consisting of Citi’s

the U.S., retail services (for information on consumer market exits related to Latin America GCB and Asia GCB as well as Citi’s planned revision to its reporting 
structure, see “Strategic Refresh—Market Exits and Planned Revision to Reporting Structure” above).

GCB’s markets in the U.S., Mexico and Asia had a combined 2,154 branches in 19 countries and jurisdictions as of December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2021, 
GCB had $267 billion in loans and $362 billion in retail banking deposits (excluding approximately $10 billion of loans and $8 billion of deposits reclassified to 
held-for-sale as a result of Citi’s agreements to sell its consumer banking businesses in Australia and the Philippines).

2021 vs. 2020 
Net income was $5.9 billion, compared to a net loss of $46 million in the 
prior year, reflecting significantly lower cost of credit, partially offset by lower 
revenues and higher expenses.

Revenues decreased 9%, reflecting lower revenues in retail banking, 

branded cards and retail services.

Retail banking revenues decreased 7%, as the benefit of strong deposit 
growth and growth in assets under management (increase of 8%, reflecting 
favorable market conditions and strong client engagement) was more than 
offset by lower deposit spreads, as well as lower mortgage revenues. Average 
deposits increased 17%, driven by higher levels of consumer liquidity due 
to government stimulus, as well as continued strategic efforts to drive 
organic growth. 

Cards revenues decreased 10%. Branded cards revenues decreased 7%, 
primarily driven by continued higher payment rates, reflecting increased 
customer liquidity from government stimulus and relief programs, partially 
offset by higher spending-related revenues. Credit card spend volume 
increased 21%, reflecting a continued recovery in sales activity from the 
pandemic-driven low levels in the prior year. 

Retail services revenues decreased 15%, primarily driven by lower average 

loans (down 7%), reflecting higher payment rates from the increased 
customer liquidity from government stimulus and relief programs, as well 
as higher partner payments, reflecting higher income sharing as a result of 
lower net credit losses. For additional information on partner payments, see 
Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Credit card spend volume 
increased 18%, reflecting a continued recovery in sales activity from the 
pandemic-driven low levels in the prior year.

Expenses increased 6%, primarily driven by continued investments 
in Citi’s transformation, as well as business-led investments and higher 
volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings.

Provisions reflected a benefit of $1.0 billion, compared to costs of 

$9.1 billion in the prior year, primarily driven by a net ACL release compared 
to a net ACL build in the prior year, as well as lower net credit losses. Net 
credit losses decreased 41%, consisting of lower net credit losses in both 
branded cards (down 39% to $1.7 billion) and retail services (down 46% 
to $1.2 billion), primarily driven by lower loan volumes and improved 
delinquencies, primarily as a result of the higher payment rates. 

The net ACL release was $4.0 billion, compared to a net build of 
$4.1 billion in the prior year, reflecting improvement in portfolio credit 
quality and the continued improvement in the macroeconomic outlook. 
For additional information on Citi’s ACL, see “Significant Accounting 
Policies and Significant Estimates” below.

For additional information on North America GCB’s retail banking, and 
its branded cards and retail services portfolios, see “Credit Risk—Consumer 
Credit” below.

to North America GCB’s future results, see “Executive Summary” above and

LATIN AMERICA GCB

As of December 31, 2021, Latin America GCB provided traditional retail banking and branded card products to consumer and small business customers in 
Mexico through Citibanamex. 

As discussed above, Citi intends to exit its consumer, small business and middle-market banking operations in Mexico. For additional information, see 
Citi’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 11, 2022. For information on Citi’s planned revision to its reporting structure, including the 
reporting of the Mexico consumer, small business and middle-market banking operations as part of a new reporting segment, Legacy Franchises, see “Strategic 
Refresh—Market Exits and Planned Revision to Reporting Structure” above.

At December 31, 2021, Latin America GCB had 1,276 retail branches in Mexico, with $8.6 billion in retail banking loans and $24.8 billion in deposits. In 

addition, the business had $4.7 billion in outstanding card loan balances.

the reported results, see the table above.

2021 vs. 2020 
Net income was $798 million, compared to $250 million in the prior year, 
reflecting significantly lower cost of credit and modestly lower expenses, 
partially offset by lower revenues.

Revenues decreased 9%, reflecting lower cards and retail banking 

revenues, largely due to the continued impact of the pandemic.

Retail banking revenues decreased 4%, primarily driven by lower loan 

volumes and deposit spreads, partially offset by growth in assets under 
management. Average loans decreased 13%, reflecting the impact of the 
pandemic on customer activity. Assets under management increased 8%, 
reflecting favorable market conditions, as well as strong client engagement.
Cards revenues decreased 21%, primarily driven by lower average loans 

(down 11%), reflecting higher payment rates. Credit card spend volume 
increased 16%, reflecting a continued recovery in sales activity from the 
pandemic-driven low levels in the prior year.

Expenses decreased 2%, as productivity savings more than offset 

continued investments in Citi’s transformation. 

Provisions of $174 million decreased 87%, primarily driven by a net 
ACL release compared to a net ACL build in the prior year, partially offset by 
higher net credit losses resulting from pandemic-related charge-offs.

The net ACL release was $826 million, compared to a build of $329 
million in the prior year. The release reflected an improvement in portfolio 
credit quality, as well as continued improvement in the macroeconomic 
outlook and lower loan volumes. For additional information on Citi’s ACL,

ASIA GCB

As of December 31, 2021, Asia GCB provided traditional retail banking and branded card products to retail and small business customers. Included within Asia GCB 
were traditional retail banking and branded card products provided to retail customers in certain EMEA countries, primarily the UAE, Poland and Russia. 

As discussed above, Citi is pursuing exits of its consumer franchises in 13 markets across Asia and EMEA and will focus its consumer banking franchise in the 

two regions on four wealth centers: Singapore, Hong Kong, the UAE and London. In 2021, Citi entered into agreements to sell its consumer banking businesses 
in Australia and the Philippines, and made a decision to wind down and close its Korea consumer banking business (for additional information, see Note 2 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements). 

In addition, in January 2022, Citi entered into agreements to sell its consumer banking businesses in Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. 
For information on Citi’s planned revision to its reporting structure, including the reporting of the 13 exit markets as part of a new reporting segment, Legacy 
Franchises, see “Strategic Refresh—Market Exits and Planned Revision to Reporting Structure” above.

At December 31, 2021, on a combined basis, the businesses had 220 retail branches, $58.9 billion in retail banking loans and $117.7 billion in deposits. 
In addition, the businesses had $13.1 billion in outstanding card loan balances. These amounts exclude approximately $10 billion of loans ($7 billion of 
retail banking loans and $3 billion of credit card loan balances) and $8 billion of deposits reclassified to held-for-sale (HFS) as a result of Citi’s agreements 
to sell its consumer banking businesses in Australia and the Philippines. Australia and the Philippines are the only consumer businesses reclassified as HFS at 
December 31, 2021. For additional information, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The discussion of the results of operations for Asia GCB below excludes the impact of FX translation for all periods presented. Presentations of the results 
of operations, excluding the impact of FX translation, are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of certain of these metrics to the reported 
results, see the table above.

2021 vs. 2020
Net loss was $675 million, compared to net income of $475 million in the 
prior year. The net loss included the following items related to the 13 exit 
markets: (i) approximately $1.1 billion (approximately $0.8 billion after-
tax) related to charges incurred from the voluntary early retirement program 
(VERP) in connection with the wind-down of the Korea consumer banking 
business; (ii) an approximate $0.7 billion pretax loss ($0.6 billion after-tax) 
related to the agreement to sell the Australia consumer banking business, 
largely reflecting the impact of a CTA loss (net of hedges); and (iii) contract 
modification costs related to the Asia divestitures of $119 million 
($98 million after-tax).

Excluding the above items, net income was $807 million compared to net 
income of $475 million in the prior year, reflecting significantly lower cost of 
credit, partially offset by higher expenses and lower revenues.

Revenues decreased 16%, including the Australia loss on sale. Excluding 

the Australia loss on sale, revenues declined 6%, reflecting lower retail 
banking and cards revenues, largely due to the continued impact of the 
pandemic, including lower interest rates. 

Retail banking revenues decreased 22%, including the Australia loss 
on sale. Excluding the Australia loss on sale, revenues decreased 7%, as 
growth in both investment revenues and deposits was more than offset by 
lower deposit spreads due to lower interest rates and lower FX and insurance 
revenues. Assets under management increased 3%, reflecting the impact of 
improved market conditions, as well as client engagement. Average deposits 
increased 6% and average loans decreased 2%. The decline in retail banking 
revenues was also impacted by a 3% decrease in retail lending revenues, 
reflecting a decline in personal loans driven by spread compression.

Cards revenues decreased 5%, as lower average loans (down 14%, 
including the reclassification to held-for-sale related to Australia and the 
Philippines and higher payment rates) were partially offset by higher 
spending-related revenues (credit card spend volume up 8%), reflecting a 
continued recovery in sales activity from the pandemic-driven low levels in 
the prior year.

Expenses increased 30%, including approximately $1.2 billion of 
costs related to the Asia divestitures. Excluding the costs related to the 
Asia divestitures, expenses increased 6%, primarily driven by continued 
investments in Citi’s transformation, as well as business-led investments, 
partially offset by productivity savings.

Provisions decreased 74%, primarily driven by a net ACL release compared 

to a net ACL build in the prior year, as well as lower net credit losses. Net 
credit losses decreased 10%, primarily reflecting lower cards loan volumes 
and improved delinquencies.

The net ACL release was $376 million, compared to a build of 
$528 million in the prior year. The release reflected an improvement 
in portfolio credit quality. For additional information on Citi’s ACL, see 
“Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” below.

CORPORATE/OTHER

Activities not assigned to the operating segments (ICG and GCB) are included in Corporate/Other. As of December 31, 2021, Corporate/Other included 
certain unallocated costs of global staff functions (including certain finance, risk, human resources, legal and compliance), other corporate expenses and 
unallocated global operations and technology expenses and income taxes, as well as results of Corporate Treasury, certain North America legacy consumer loan

2021 vs. 2020 
Net income was $215 million, compared to a net loss of $1.1 billion in the 
prior year, reflecting higher revenues, lower expenses and lower cost of credit. 
Revenues of $667 million compared to $71 million in the prior year, 

primarily driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio.

Expenses decreased 14%, reflecting the absence of a civil money penalty in 
the prior year and the wind-down of legacy assets, partially offset by increases 
related to Citi’s transformation.

Provisions reflected a net benefit of $369 million, compared to costs 
of $178 million in the prior year, primarily driven by a net ACL release in 
the current year ($286 million compared to a net build of $200 million 
in the prior year). The release reflected the continued improvement in the 
macroeconomic outlook.

CAPITAL RESOURCES

Overview
Capital is used principally to support assets in Citi’s businesses and to 
absorb credit, market and operational losses. Citi primarily generates capital 
through earnings from its operating businesses. Citi may augment its 
capital through issuances of common stock and noncumulative perpetual 
preferred stock, among other issuances. Further, Citi’s capital levels may 
also be affected by changes in accounting and regulatory standards, as well 
as U.S. corporate tax laws and the impact of future events on Citi’s business 
results, such as changes in interest and foreign exchange rates, as well as 
business and asset dispositions. For additional information on capital-related 
trends, uncertainties and risks related to Citi’s legacy and exit businesses, 
including the impact of CTA losses, see “Executive Summary” above and 
“Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” and “—Operational Risks” below. 

During 2021, Citi returned a total of $11.8 billion of capital to common 
shareholders in the form of $4.2 billion in dividends and $7.6 billion in share 
repurchases totaling approximately 105 million common shares. 

Capital Management
Citi’s capital management framework is designed to ensure that Citigroup 
and its principal subsidiaries maintain sufficient capital consistent with 
each entity’s respective risk profile, management targets and all applicable 
regulatory standards and guidelines. Citi assesses its capital adequacy 
against a series of internal quantitative capital goals, designed to evaluate its 
capital levels in expected and stressed economic environments. Underlying 
these internal quantitative capital goals are strategic capital considerations, 
centered on preserving and building financial strength. 

The Citigroup Capital Committee, with oversight from the Risk 

Management Committee of Citigroup’s Board of Directors, has responsibility 
for Citi’s aggregate capital structure, including the capital assessment 
and planning process, which is integrated into Citi’s capital plan. Balance 
sheet management, including oversight of capital adequacy, for Citigroup’s 
subsidiaries is governed by each entity’s Asset and Liability Committee, where 
applicable. 

For additional information regarding Citi’s capital planning and stress 
testing exercises, see “Stress Testing Component of Capital Planning” below.

Current Regulatory Capital Standards
Citi is subject to regulatory capital standards issued by the Federal Reserve 
Board, which constitute the U.S. Basel III rules. These rules establish an 
integrated capital adequacy framework, encompassing both risk-based 
capital ratios and leverage ratios.

Risk-Based Capital Ratios
The U.S. Basel III rules set forth the composition of regulatory capital 
(including the application of regulatory capital adjustments and deductions), 
as well as two comprehensive methodologies (a Standardized Approach and 
Advanced Approaches) for measuring total risk-weighted assets. 

Total risk-weighted assets under the Advanced Approaches, which are 
primarily models based, include credit, market and operational risk-weighted 
assets. The Standardized Approach generally applies prescribed supervisory 
risk weights to broad categories of credit risk exposures. As a result, credit 
risk-weighted assets calculated under the Advanced Approaches are more risk 
sensitive than those calculated under the Standardized Approach. Market 
risk-weighted assets are currently calculated on a generally consistent basis 
under both approaches. The Standardized Approach excludes operational 
risk-weighted assets.

Under the U.S. Basel III rules, both Citi and Citibank, N.A. (Citibank) 
are required to maintain stated minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, 
Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios of 4.5%, 6.0% and 8.0%, respectively. 
Further, the U.S. Basel III rules implement the “capital floor provision” of 
the so-called “Collins Amendment” of the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires 
Advanced Approaches banking organizations to calculate each of the three 
risk-based capital ratios (Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and 
Total Capital) under both the U.S. Basel III Standardized Approach and 
the Advanced Approaches and comply with the more binding of each of the 
resulting risk-based capital ratios.

Tier 1 Leverage Ratio
Under the U.S. Basel III rules, Citi is also required to maintain a minimum 
Tier 1 Leverage ratio of 4.0%. The Tier 1 Leverage ratio, a non-risk-based 
measure of capital adequacy, is defined as Tier 1 Capital as a percentage 
of quarterly adjusted average total assets less amounts deducted from 
Tier 1 Capital. 

27

 
Supplementary Leverage Ratio
Citi is also required to calculate a Supplementary Leverage ratio, which 
differs from the Tier 1 Leverage ratio by also including certain off-balance 
sheet exposures within the denominator of the ratio (Total Leverage 
Exposure). The Supplementary Leverage ratio represents end-of-period Tier 
1 Capital to Total Leverage Exposure, with the latter defined as the sum of 
the daily average of on-balance sheet assets for the quarter and the average 
of certain off-balance sheet exposures calculated as of the last day of each 
month in the quarter, less applicable Tier 1 Capital deductions. Advanced 
Approaches banking organizations are required to maintain a stated 
minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 3.0%.

Further, U.S. GSIBs, including Citi, are subject to enhanced 
Supplementary Leverage ratio standards. These enhanced standards 
establish a 2.0% leverage buffer in addition to the stated 3.0% minimum 
Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement, for a total effective minimum 
Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement of 5.0%. If a U.S. GSIB fails to 
exceed this requirement, it will be subject to increasingly onerous restrictions 
(depending upon the extent of the shortfall) regarding capital distributions 
and discretionary executive bonus payments. 

Temporary Supplementary Leverage Ratio Relief
In April 2020, the Federal Reserve Board issued an interim final rule that 
temporarily changed the calculation of the Supplementary Leverage ratio for 
bank holding companies, including Citigroup, by excluding U.S. Treasuries 
and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from Total Leverage Exposure. 
The interim final rule was effective for Citigroup’s Supplementary 
Leverage ratio, as well as for Citigroup’s leverage-based total loss absorbing 
capacity (TLAC) and long-term debt (LTD) requirements, and expired as 
scheduled on March 31, 2021. Citigroup’s reported Supplementary Leverage 
ratio of 7.0% during the fourth quarter of 2020 benefited 109 basis points, as 
a result of the temporary relief. 

Regulatory Capital Treatment—Modified Transition of the 
Current Expected Credit Losses Methodology
In September 2020, the U.S. banking agencies issued a final rule 
(substantially unchanged from a March 2020 interim final rule) that 
modified the regulatory capital transition provision related to the current 
expected credit losses (CECL) methodology. The September 2020 final rule 
does not have any impact on U.S. GAAP accounting. 

The final rule permitted banks to delay for two years the “Day One” 
adverse regulatory capital effects resulting from adoption of the CECL 
methodology on January 1, 2020 until January 1, 2022, followed by a 
three-year transition to phase out the regulatory capital benefit provided by 
the delay.

In addition, for the ongoing impact of CECL, the agencies utilized a 25% 

scaling factor as an approximation of the increased reserve build under 
CECL compared to the previous incurred loss model and, therefore, allowed 
banks to add back to Common Equity Tier 1 Capital an amount equal 
to 25% of the change in CECL-based allowances in each quarter between 
January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. Beginning January 1, 2022, the 

cumulative 25% change in CECL-based allowances between January 1, 2020 
and December 31, 2021 will be phased in to regulatory capital (i) at 25% 
per year on January 1 of each year over the three-year transition period, and 
(ii) along with the delayed “Day One” impact.

Citigroup and Citibank elected the modified CECL transition provision 

provided by the rule beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2020. 
Accordingly, the Day One regulatory capital effects resulting from adoption 
of the CECL methodology, as well as the ongoing adjustments for 25% of the 
change in CECL-based allowances in each quarter between January 1, 2020 
and December 31, 2021, started to be phased in on January 1, 2022 and will 
be fully reflected in Citi’s regulatory capital as of January 1, 2025.

As of December 31, 2021, Citigroup’s reported Common Equity Tier 1 
Capital ratio of 12.2% benefited from the deferrals of the CECL transition 
provision by 24 basis points (bps), which resulted in an approximate 6 
bps decrease to Citigroup’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio upon 
commencement of the phase-in on January 1, 2022. In addition, this 
phase-in is expected to result in an additional 6 bps decrease to Citigroup’s 
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio on January 1 of each year through 
January 1, 2025. For additional information on Citigroup’s and Citibank’s 
regulatory capital ratios excluding the impact of the CECL transition 
provision, see “Capital Resources (Full Adoption of CECL)” below. 

TLAC Holdings
As previously disclosed, in January 2021, the U.S. banking agencies issued 
a final rule that created a new regulatory capital deduction applicable to 
Advanced Approaches banking organizations for certain investments in 
covered debt instruments issued by GSIBs. The final rule became effective 
for Citigroup and Citibank on April 1, 2021, and did not have a significant 
impact on either Citigroup’s or Citibank’s regulatory capital.

Regulatory Capital Buffers
Citi and Citibank are required to maintain several regulatory capital buffers 
above stated minimum capital requirements. These capital buffers would 
be available to absorb losses in advance of any potential impairment 
of regulatory capital below the stated minimum regulatory capital 
ratio requirements. 

Banking organizations that fall below their regulatory capital buffers 
are subject to limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus 
payments to executive officers based on a percentage of “Eligible Retained 
Income” (ERI), with increasing restrictions based upon the severity of 
the breach. ERI is equal to the greater of (i) the bank’s net income for the 
four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, net of any 
distributions and tax effects not already reflected in net income, and (ii) the 
average of the bank’s net income for the four calendar quarters preceding the 
current calendar quarter.

As of December 31, 2021, Citi’s regulatory capital ratios exceeded effective 
regulatory minimum requirements. Accordingly, Citi is not subject to payout 
limitations as a result of Basel III requirements. 

28

Stress Capital Buffer
Citigroup is subject to the Federal Reserve Board’s Stress Capital Buffer 
(SCB) rule, which integrates the annual stress testing requirements with 
ongoing regulatory capital requirements. The SCB equals the peak-to-trough 
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio decline under the Supervisory Severely 
Adverse scenario used in the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review 
(CCAR) and Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing (DFAST), plus four quarters of 
planned common stock dividends, subject to a floor of 2.5%. SCB-based 
minimum capital requirements will be reviewed and updated annually 
by the Federal Reserve Board as part of the CCAR process. For additional 
information regarding CCAR and DFAST, see “Stress Testing Component 
of Capital Planning” below. The fixed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer 
(for additional information, see below) will continue to apply under the 
Advanced Approaches. 

In August 2021, the Federal Reserve Board finalized and announced Citi’s 

SCB requirement of 3.0%. Accordingly, effective October 1, 2021, Citigroup 
is required to maintain a 10.5% effective minimum Common Equity Tier 1 
Capital ratio under the Standardized Approach. Previously, from October 1, 
2020 through September 30, 2021, Citi had been subject to a 2.5% SCB, and 
a 10.0% effective minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio under the 
Standardized Approach.

Capital Conservation Buffer and Countercyclical 
Capital Buffer
Citigroup is subject to a fixed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer under 
the Advanced Approaches. Citibank is subject to the fixed 2.5% Capital 
Conservation Buffer under both the Advanced Approaches and the 
Standardized Approach. 

In addition, Advanced Approaches banking organizations, such as 

Citigroup and Citibank, are subject to a discretionary Countercyclical Capital 
Buffer. The Federal Reserve Board last voted to affirm the Countercyclical 
Capital Buffer amount at the current level of 0% in December 2020.

GSIB Surcharge
The Federal Reserve Board imposes a risk-based capital surcharge upon 
U.S. bank holding companies that are identified as global systemically 
important bank holding companies (GSIBs), including Citi. The GSIB 
surcharge augments the SCB, Capital Conservation Buffer and, if invoked, 
any Countercyclical Capital Buffer.

A U.S. bank holding company that is designated a GSIB is required, on an 

annual basis, to calculate a surcharge using two methods and is subject to 
the higher of the resulting two surcharges. The first method (“method 1”) is 
based on the Basel Committee’s GSIB methodology. Under the second method 
(“method 2”), the substitutability category under the Basel Committee’s 
GSIB methodology is replaced with a quantitative measure intended to assess 
a GSIB’s reliance on short-term wholesale funding. In addition, method 1 
incorporates relative measures of systemic importance across certain global 
banking organizations and a year-end spot foreign exchange rate, whereas 
method 2 uses fixed measures of systemic importance and application of an 
average foreign exchange rate over a three-year period. The GSIB surcharges 

calculated under both method 1 and method 2 are based on measures of 
systemic importance from the year immediately preceding that in which 
the GSIB surcharge calculations are being performed (e.g., the method 1 
and method 2 GSIB surcharges calculated during 2021 will be based on 
2020 systemic indicator data). Generally, Citi’s surcharge determined under 
method 2 will result in a higher surcharge than its surcharge determined 
under method 1.

Should a GSIB’s systemic importance increase for more than one 
year, such that it becomes subject to a higher GSIB surcharge, the higher 
surcharge would not become effective for a full year after the second 
consecutive higher score (e.g., a higher surcharge calculated using data as of 
December 31, 2020 and December 30, 2021 would not become effective until 
January 1, 2023). However, if after two consecutive years of a higher score, a 
GSIB’s systemic importance changes such that the GSIB would be subject to 
a lower surcharge, the GSIB would be subject to the lower surcharge in the 
calendar year commencing one year later (e.g., a lower surcharge calculated 
using data as of December 31, 2022 would become effective January 1, 2024).
The following table sets forth Citi’s effective GSIB surcharge as determined 

under method 1 and method 2 during 2021 and 2020:

Method 1

Method 2

2021

2020

2.0%

3.0

2.0%

3.0

Citi’s GSIB surcharge effective during both 2021 and 2020 was 3.0%, as 

derived under the higher method 2 result. Citi’s GSIB surcharge effective 
for 2022 will remain unchanged at 3.0%, as derived under the higher 
method 2 result. 

Citi expects that its method 2 GSIB surcharge will continue to remain 

higher than its method 1 GSIB surcharge. Accordingly, based on Citi’s 
method 2 result as of December 31, 2020, and its estimated method 2 result 
as of December 31, 2021, Citi’s GSIB surcharge is expected to increase to 3.5% 
effective January 1, 2023. Citi’s GSIB surcharge effective for 2024 will likely 
be based on the lower of its method 2 scores for year-end 2021 and 2022, and 
therefore is not expected to exceed 3.5%.

Prompt Corrective Action Framework
In general, the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) regulations direct the U.S. 
banking agencies to enforce increasingly strict limitations on the activities 
of insured depository institutions that fail to meet certain regulatory capital 
thresholds. The PCA framework contains five categories of capital adequacy 
as measured by risk-based capital and leverage ratios: (i) “well capitalized,” 
(ii) “adequately capitalized,” (iii) “undercapitalized,” (iv) “significantly 
undercapitalized” and (v) “critically undercapitalized.”

Accordingly, an insured depository institution, such as Citibank, must 
maintain minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, Total 
Capital and Tier 1 Leverage ratios of 6.5%, 8.0%, 10.0% and 5.0%, respectively, 
to be considered “well capitalized.” In addition, insured depository institution 
subsidiaries of U.S. GSIBs, including Citibank, must maintain a minimum 

29

Both CCAR and DFAST include an estimate of projected revenues, losses, 
reserves, pro forma regulatory capital ratios, and any other additional capital 
measures deemed relevant by Citi. Projections are required over a nine-
quarter planning horizon under two supervisory scenarios (baseline and 
severely adverse conditions). All risk-based capital ratios reflect application of 
the Standardized Approach framework under the U.S. Basel III rules. 

In addition, Citibank is required to conduct the annual Dodd-Frank Act 
Stress Test. The annual stress test consists of a forward-looking quantitative 
evaluation of the impact of stressful economic and financial market 
conditions under several scenarios on Citibank’s regulatory capital. This 
program serves to inform the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as to 
how Citibank’s regulatory capital ratios might change during a hypothetical 
set of adverse economic conditions and to ultimately evaluate the reliability 
of Citibank’s capital planning process.

Citigroup and Citibank are required to disclose the results of their 

company-run stress tests. 

Temporary Federal Reserve Board Limitations on 
Capital Distributions
From the third quarter of 2020 to the second quarter of 2021, the Federal 
Reserve Board placed temporary limitations on capital distributions for 
Citi and other large banking organizations, to ensure that large banks 
maintained a high level of capital resilience throughout the COVID-19 
pandemic. Commencing July 1, 2021, Citi’s common stock dividends and 
share repurchases were no longer subject to limitations based on the average 
of Citi’s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters.

All large banks, including Citi, remain subject to limitations on capital 

distributions in the event of a breach of any regulatory capital buffers, 
including the Stress Capital Buffer, with the degree of such restrictions 
based on the extent to which the buffers are breached. For additional 
information, see “Regulatory Capital Buffers” above, and “Risk Factors—
Strategic Risks” below.

Supplementary Leverage ratio of 6.0% to be considered “well capitalized.” 
Citibank was “well capitalized” as of December 31, 2021.

Furthermore, to be “well capitalized” under current federal bank 

regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 
Capital ratio of at least 6.0%, a Total Capital ratio of at least 10.0% and not be 
subject to a Federal Reserve Board directive to maintain higher capital levels. 

Stress Testing Component of Capital Planning
Citi is subject to an annual assessment by the Federal Reserve Board as 
to whether Citigroup has effective capital planning processes as well as 
sufficient regulatory capital to absorb losses during stressful economic 
and financial conditions, while also meeting obligations to creditors and 
counterparties and continuing to serve as a credit intermediary. This annual 
assessment includes two related programs: the Comprehensive Capital 
Analysis and Review (CCAR) and Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing (DFAST).
For the largest and most complex firms, such as Citi, CCAR includes a 
qualitative evaluation of a firm’s abilities to determine its capital needs on a 
forward-looking basis. In conducting the qualitative assessment, the Federal 
Reserve Board evaluates firms’ capital planning practices, focusing on six 
areas of capital planning—namely, governance, risk management, internal 
controls, capital policies, incorporating stressful conditions and events, and 
estimating impact on capital positions. As part of the CCAR process, the 
Federal Reserve Board evaluates Citi’s capital adequacy, capital adequacy 
process and its planned capital distributions, such as dividend payments and 
common share repurchases. The Federal Reserve Board assesses whether Citi 
has sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic 
and financial market stress and whether Citi has robust, forward-looking 
capital planning processes that account for its unique risks. 

All CCAR firms, including Citi, are subject to a rigorous evaluation of 
their capital planning process. Firms with weak practices may be subject 
to a deficient supervisory rating, and potentially an enforcement action, 
for failing to meet supervisory expectations. For additional information 
regarding CCAR, see “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” below. 

DFAST is a forward-looking quantitative evaluation of the impact of 
stressful economic and financial market conditions on Citi’s regulatory 
capital. This program serves to inform the Federal Reserve Board and the 
general public as to how Citi’s regulatory capital ratios might change using 
a hypothetical set of adverse economic conditions as designed by the Federal 
Reserve Board. In addition to the annual supervisory stress test conducted by 
the Federal Reserve Board, Citi is required to conduct annual company-run 
stress tests under the same adverse economic conditions designed by the 
Federal Reserve Board.

(1)  Citi has elected to apply the modified transition provision related to the impact of the CECL accounting standard on regulatory capital, as provided by the U.S. banking agencies’ September 2020 final rule. Under 
the modified CECL transition provision, the changes in retained earnings (after-tax), deferred tax assets (DTAs) arising from temporary differences, and the ACL upon the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date were 
deferred and have commenced phase-in to regulatory capital at 25% per year beginning January 1, 2022. For the ongoing impact of CECL, Citigroup was allowed to adjust retained earnings and the ACL in an 
amount equal to 25% of the change in the ACL (pretax) for each period between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The cumulative adjustments to retained earnings and the ACL between January 1, 2020 
and December 31, 2021 commenced phase-in to regulatory capital at 25% per year beginning January 1, 2022, along with the deferred impacts related to the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date. Corresponding 
adjustments to average on-balance sheet assets are reflected in quarterly adjusted average total assets and Total Leverage Exposure. Additionally, the increase in DTAs arising from temporary differences upon the 
January 1, 2020 adoption date were deducted from risk-weighted assets (RWA) and commenced phase-in to RWA at 25% per year beginning January 1, 2022.

(2)  Citi’s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2021, and under the Basel III Advanced 

Approaches framework as of December 31, 2020, whereas Citi’s reportable Total Capital ratio was the lower derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework for all periods presented.

(3)  Tier 1 Leverage ratio denominator. Represents quarterly average total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital. 
(4)  Supplementary Leverage ratio denominator. Commencing with the second quarter of 2020 and continuing through the first quarter of 2021, Citigroup’s Total Leverage Exposure temporarily excluded U.S. Treasuries and 

deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. For additional information, see “Temporary Supplementary Leverage Ratio Relief” above.

(5)  Certain of the above prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with enhancements made in the current period. 

31

Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio 
As set forth in the table above, Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio 
at December 31, 2021 increased from September 30, 2021, primarily due 
to a decrease in risk-weighted assets and a temporary pause in common 
share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2021 in preparation for the 
implementation of the Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk 
(SA-CCR) on January 1, 2022. Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio 

increased from year-end 2020, largely driven by net income of $22.0 billion, 
a net decrease in risk-weighted assets and a temporary pause in common 
share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2021 in preparation for the 
implementation of SA-CCR, partially offset by the return of $11.8 billion 
of capital to common shareholders in the form of share repurchases and 
dividends, as well as adverse net movements in AOCI.

(1) 

Issuance costs of $131 million and $156 million related to noncumulative perpetual preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, are excluded from common stockholders’ equity and 
netted against such preferred stock in accordance with Federal Reserve Board regulatory reporting requirements, which differ from those under U.S. GAAP. 

(2)  Citi has elected to apply the modified transition provision related to the impact of the CECL accounting standard on regulatory capital, as provided by the U.S. banking agencies’ September 2020 final rule. Under the 
modified CECL transition provision, the changes in retained earnings (after-tax) and the ACL upon the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date were deferred and commenced phase-in to regulatory capital at 25% per 
year beginning January 1, 2022. For the ongoing impact of CECL, Citigroup was allowed to adjust retained earnings and the ACL in an amount equal to 25% of the change in the ACL (pretax) for each period between 
January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The cumulative adjustments to retained earnings and the ACL between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021 have also commenced phase in to regulatory capital at 
25% per year beginning January 1, 2022, along with the deferred impacts related to the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date.
Includes goodwill “embedded” in the valuation of significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions. 

(3) 
(4)  Of Citi’s $24.8 billion of net DTAs at December 31, 2021, $15.3 billion was included in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital pursuant to the U.S. Basel III rules, while $9.5 billion was excluded. Excluded from Citi’s Common 
Equity Tier 1 Capital as of December 31, 2021 was $11.3 billion of net DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit tax carry-forwards. The amount excluded was reduced by 
$1.8 billion of net DTLs primarily associated with goodwill and certain other intangible assets that are separately deducted from capital. DTAs arising from tax carry-forwards are required to be entirely deducted from 
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules. DTAs arising from temporary differences are required to be deducted from capital only if these DTAs exceed 10%/15% limitation under the U.S. Basel III 
rules. Citi’s DTAs do not currently exceed this limitation and, therefore, are not subject to deduction from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, but are subject to risk weighting at 250%. 

(5)  Represents Citigroup Capital XIII trust preferred securities, which are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules. 
(6)  Banking entities are required to be in compliance with the Volcker Rule of the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits conducting certain proprietary investment activities and limits their ownership of, and relationships with, 
covered funds. Commencing January 1, 2021, Citi no longer deducts permitted market-making positions in third-party covered funds from Tier 1 Capital, in accordance with the revised Volcker Rule 2.0 issued by the 
U.S. agencies in November 2019. Upon the removal of the capital deduction, permitted market-making positions in third-party covered funds are included in risk-weighted assets.

(7)  Represents the amount of non-grandfathered trust preferred securities that were previously eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules. Commencing January 1, 2022, non-grandfathered trust 

preferred securities have been fully phased out of Tier 2 Capital.

(8)  Under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess allowance for credit losses being deducted in 

arriving at credit risk-weighted assets, which differs from the Advanced Approaches framework, in which eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent 
that the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets. The total amount of eligible credit reserves in excess of expected credit losses that were eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital, subject to 
limitation, under the Advanced Approaches framework was $4.4 billion and $5.2 billion at December 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

(1)  Represents the daily average of on-balance sheet assets for the quarter.
(2)  Citi has elected to apply the modified transition provision related to the impact of the CECL accounting standard on regulatory capital, as provided by the U.S. banking agencies’ September 2020 final rule. Under the 
modified CECL transition provision, the changes in DTAs arising from temporary differences and the ACL upon the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date were deferred and commenced phase-in to regulatory capital 
at 25% per year beginning January 1, 2022. For the ongoing impact of CECL, Citigroup was allowed to adjust the ACL in an amount equal to 25% of the change in the ACL (pretax) for each period between January 1, 
2020 and December 31, 2021. The cumulative adjustments to the ACL between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021 have also commenced phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year beginning January 1, 
2022, along with the deferred impacts related to the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date. Corresponding adjustments to average on-balance sheet assets are reflected in Total Leverage Exposure.

(3)  Commencing with the second quarter of 2020 and continuing through the first quarter of 2021, Citigroup’s Total Leverage Exposure temporarily excluded U.S. Treasuries and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. For 

additional information, see “Temporary Supplementary Leverage Ratio Relief” above.

(4)  Represents the average of certain off-balance sheet exposures calculated as of the last day of each month in the quarter. 
(5)  Under the U.S. Basel III rules, banking organizations are required to include in Total Leverage Exposure the effective notional amount of sold credit derivatives, with netting of exposures permitted if certain conditions 

are met. 

(6)  Repo-style transactions include repurchase or reverse repurchase transactions as well as securities borrowing or securities lending transactions.

As set forth in the table above, Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio 
was 5.7% at December 31, 2021, compared to 5.8% at September 30, 2021 and 
7.0% at December 31, 2020. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily 
driven by an increase in Total Leverage Exposure, primarily driven by an 
increase in average on-balance sheet assets, as well as adverse net movements 
in AOCI, partially offset by net income in the quarter. The year-over-year 
decrease was primarily driven by an increase in Total Leverage Exposure, 
largely due to an approximate 100 basis point impact from the expiration of 
the Federal Reserve Board’s temporary Supplementary Leverage ratio relief. 
For additional information, see “Temporary Supplementary Leverage Ratio 
Relief” above.

(1)  For all periods presented, Citibank’s effective minimum risk-based capital requirements are inclusive of the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer (all of which must be composed of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital).
(2)  Citibank has elected to apply the modified transition provision related to the impact of the CECL accounting standard on regulatory capital, as provided by the U.S. banking agencies’ September 2020 final rule. Under 
the modified CECL transition provision, the changes in retained earnings (after-tax), deferred tax assets (DTAs) arising from temporary differences, and the ACL upon the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date were 
deferred and have commenced phase-in to regulatory capital at 25% per year beginning on January 1, 2022. For the ongoing impact of CECL, Citibank was allowed to adjust retained earnings and the ACL in an 
amount equal to 25% of the change in the ACL (pretax) for each period between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The cumulative adjustments to retained earnings and the ACL between January 1, 2020 
and December 31, 2021 have also commenced phase-in to regulatory capital at 25% per year beginning January 1, 2022, along with the deferred impacts related to the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date. 
Corresponding adjustments to average on-balance sheet assets are reflected in quarterly adjusted average total assets and Total Leverage Exposure. Additionally, the increase in DTAs arising from temporary 
differences upon the January 1, 2020 adoption date were deducted from risk-weighted assets (RWA) and commenced phase-in to RWA at 25% per year beginning January 1, 2022.

(3)  Under the Advanced Approaches framework, eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent that the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit 

risk-weighted assets, which differs from the Standardized Approach in which the ACL is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess ACL being deducted in arriving 
at credit risk-weighted assets.

(4)  Citibank’s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were the lower derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach, whereas Total Capital ratio was derived under the Basel III Advanced 

Approaches framework for all periods presented.

(5)  Citibank must maintain minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital and Tier 1 Leverage ratios of 6.5%, 8.0%, 10.0% and 5.0%, respectively, to be considered “well capitalized” under the 

revised Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) regulations applicable to insured depository institutions as established by the U.S. Basel III rules. Citibank must also maintain a minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 6.0% 
to be considered “well capitalized.” 

(6)  Tier 1 Leverage ratio denominator. Represents quarterly average total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital.
(7)  Supplementary Leverage ratio denominator. 
(8)  Certain of the above prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with enhancements made in the current period. 

As indicated in the table above, Citibank’s capital ratios at December 31, 
2021 were in excess of the stated and effective minimum requirements under 
the U.S. Basel III rules. In addition, Citibank was also “well capitalized” as of 
December 31, 2021.

Impact of Changes on Citigroup and Citibank Capital Ratios 
The following tables present the estimated sensitivity of Citigroup’s and 
Citibank’s capital ratios to changes of $100 million in Common Equity 
Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital (numerator), and changes of 
$1 billion in Advanced Approaches and Standardized Approach risk-weighted 
assets and quarterly adjusted average total assets, as well as Total Leverage 
Exposure (denominator), as of December 31, 2021. This information is 

provided for the purpose of analyzing the impact that a change in Citigroup’s 
or Citibank’s financial position or results of operations could have on these 
ratios. These sensitivities only consider a single change to either a component 
of capital, risk-weighted assets, quarterly adjusted average total assets or Total 
Leverage Exposure. Accordingly, an event that affects more than one factor 
may have a larger basis point impact than is reflected in these tables.

Citigroup Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries
At December 31, 2021, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., a U.S. broker-dealer 
registered with the SEC that is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of 
Citigroup, had net capital, computed in accordance with the SEC’s net capital 
rule, of $13 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement by $8 billion. 
Moreover, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, a broker-dealer registered 

with the United Kingdom’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) that 
is also an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had total capital 
of $28 billion at December 31, 2021, which exceeded the PRA’s minimum 
regulatory capital requirements.

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) 
U.S. GSIBs, including Citi, are required to maintain minimum levels of 
TLAC and eligible long-term debt (LTD), each set by reference to the GSIB’s 
consolidated risk-weighted assets (RWA) and total leverage exposure.

Minimum External TLAC Requirement
The minimum external TLAC requirement is the greater of (i) 18% of the 
GSIB’s RWA plus the then-applicable RWA-based TLAC buffer (see below) and 
(ii) 7.5% of the GSIB’s total leverage exposure plus a leverage-based TLAC 
buffer of 2% (i.e., 9.5%).

The RWA-based TLAC buffer equals the 2.5% capital conservation buffer, 

plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer (currently 0%), plus 
the GSIB’s capital surcharge as determined under method 1 of the GSIB 
surcharge rule (2.0% for Citi for 2021). Accordingly, Citi’s total current 
minimum TLAC requirement was 22.5% of RWA for 2021.

Minimum LTD Requirement
The minimum LTD requirement is the greater of (i) 6% of the GSIB’s 
RWA plus its capital surcharge as determined under method 2 of the GSIB 
surcharge rule (3.0% for Citi for 2021), for a total current requirement of 9% 
of RWA for Citi, and (ii) 4.5% of the GSIB’s total leverage exposure.

The table below details Citi’s eligible external TLAC and LTD amounts and 
ratios, and each effective minimum TLAC and LTD ratio requirement, as well 
as the surplus amount in dollars in excess of each requirement.

Adoption of SA-CCR also increased Citigroup’s Advanced RWA by 

approximately $29 billion, which resulted in a 29 bps decrease to Citigroup’s 
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio under the Advanced Approaches on 
January 1, 2022. Citigroup’s reported CET1 Capital ratio under the Advanced 
Approaches as of December 31, 2021 was 12.35%, 85 bps above its 11.5% 
CET1 Capital target, and 235 bps above its 10.0% effective regulatory 
minimum CET1 Capital requirement under the Advanced Approaches.

Citigroup voluntarily suspended share repurchases during the fourth 
quarter of 2021, in anticipation of the adverse impact resulting from SA-CCR 
adoption. Citi resumed common share repurchases in January 2022.

Regulatory Capital Standards Developments

Basel III Revisions 
As previously disclosed, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel 
Committee) has finalized certain Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms. 
The reforms relate to the methodologies in deriving credit, market and 
operational risk-weighted assets, the imposition of a new aggregate output 
floor for risk-weighted assets, and revisions to the leverage ratio framework.
The U.S. banking agencies may revise the U.S. Basel III rules in the 
future, in response to the Basel Committee’s Basel III post-crisis regulatory 
reforms. For information about risks related to changes in regulatory capital 
requirements, see “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks.” below.

Adoption of the Standardized Approach for Counterparty 
Credit Risk
In January 2020, the U.S. banking agencies issued a final rule to introduce 
the Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR). SA-CCR 
replaced the Current Exposure Method (CEM), which was the previous 
methodology used to calculate exposure for all derivative contracts under 
the Standardized Approach, as well as RWA for derivative contracts under 
the Advanced Approaches in cases where internal models are not used. In 
addition, SA-CCR replaced CEM in numerous other instances throughout 
the regulatory framework, including but not limited to the Supplementary 
Leverage Ratio, certain components of the GSIB score, single counterparty 
credit limits and legal lending limits.

Under SA-CCR, a banking organization calculates the exposure amount 

of its derivative contracts at the netting set level. Multiple derivative 
contracts are generally considered to be under the same netting set as long 
as each derivative contract is subject to the same qualifying master netting 
agreement. SA-CCR also introduced the concept of hedging sets, which 
allows a banking organization to fully or partially net derivative contracts 
within the same netting set that share similar risk factors. Moreover, SA-CCR 
incorporated updated supervisory and maturity factors to calculate the 
potential future exposure of a derivative contract, and provides for improved 
recognition of collateral. Under the final rule, the exposure amount of a 
netting set is equal to an alpha factor of 1.4 multiplied by the sum of the 
replacement cost and potential future exposure of the netting set.

Citi adopted SA-CCR as of the mandatory compliance date of January 1, 

2022. Adoption of SA-CCR increased Citigroup’s Standardized RWA by 
approximately $51 billion, which resulted in a 49 bps decrease to Citigroup’s 
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio under the Standardized Approaches 
on January 1, 2022. Citigroup’s reported CET1 Capital ratio under the 
Standardized Approach as of December 31, 2021 was 12.25%, 75 bps above its 
11.5% CET1 Capital target, and 175 bps above its 10.5% effective regulatory 
minimum CET1 Capital requirement under the Standardized Approach.

Tangible Common Equity, Book Value Per Share, Tangible 
Book Value Per Share and Return on Equity
Tangible common equity (TCE) represents common stockholders’ equity 
less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage 
servicing rights (MSRs)). RoTCE represents net income available to common 
shareholders as a percentage of average TCE. Tangible book value (TBV) 
per share represents TCE divided by common shares outstanding. These 
measures are non-GAAP financial measures. Other companies may calculate 
these measures in a different manner. Citi believes TCE, TBV and RoTCE 
provide alternate measures of capital strength and performance for investors, 
industry analysts and others.

RISK FACTORS

The following discussion sets forth what management currently believes 
could be the material risks and uncertainties that could impact Citi’s 
businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Other risks 
and uncertainties, including those not currently known to Citi or its 
management, could also negatively impact Citi’s businesses, results of 
operations and financial condition. Thus, the following should not be 
considered a complete discussion of all of the risks and uncertainties that 
Citi may face. For additional information about risks and uncertainties 
that could impact Citi, see “Executive Summary” and each respective 
business’ results of operations above and “Managing Global Risk” below. 
The following risk factors are categorized to improve the readability and 
usefulness of the risk factor disclosure, and, while the headings and risk 
factors generally align with Citi’s risk categorization, in certain instances 
the risk factors may not directly correspond with how Citi categorizes or 
manages its risks.

MARKET-RELATED RISKS
Macroeconomic, Geopolitical and Other Challenges and 
Uncertainties Globally Could Have a Negative Impact on 
Citi’s Businesses and Results of Operations.
In addition to the significant macroeconomic challenges posed by the 
pandemic (see the pandemic-related risk factor below), Citi has experienced, 
and could experience in the future, negative impacts to its businesses and 
results of operations as a result of other macroeconomic, geopolitical and 
other challenges, uncertainties and volatility.

For example, the recent action of Russian military forces and support 
personnel in Ukraine has escalated tensions between Russia and the U.S., 
NATO, the EU and the U.K. The U.S. has imposed, and is likely to impose 
material additional, financial and economic sanctions and export controls 
against certain Russian organizations and/or individuals, with similar 
actions either implemented or planned by the EU and the U.K. and other 
jurisdictions. During the week of February 21, 2022, the U.S., the U.K., and 
the EU each imposed packages of financial and economic sanctions that, 
in various ways, constrain transactions with numerous Russian entities 
and individuals; transactions in Russian sovereign debt; and investment, 
trade, and financing to, from, or in certain regions of Ukraine. Citi’s ability 
to engage in activity with certain consumer and institutional businesses in 
Russia and Ukraine or involving certain Russian or Ukrainian businesses 
and customers is dependent in part upon whether such engagement is 
restricted under any current or expected U.S., EU and other countries or U.K. 
sanctions and laws. Sanctions and export controls, as well as any actions 
by Russia, could adversely affect Citi’s business activities and customers 
in and from Russia and Ukraine. Moreover, actions by Russia, and any 
further measures taken by the U.S. or its allies, could have negative impacts 
on regional and global financial markets and economic conditions. 
For additional information about these and other related risks, see the 
operational processes and systems, cybersecurity and emerging markets risk 
factors below. For additional information about Citi’s exposures in Russia, see 
“Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—Russia” below.

Additionally, governmental fiscal and monetary actions, or expected 

actions, such as changes in interest rate policies and any program 
implemented by a central bank to change the size of its balance sheet, could 
significantly impact interest rates, economic growth rates, the volatility of 
global financial markets, foreign exchange rates and global capital flows. 
Further, it remains uncertain to what extent central banks may keep interest 
rates low or whether central banks might raise interest rates or reduce the 
size of their balance sheets, particularly as inflationary pressures continue 
and the U.S. and global economies continue to improve. While earlier in 
the pandemic the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) and other central banks 
took actions to support the global economy, including by further reducing 
their benchmark interest rates, mismatches between supply and demand of 
goods and services contributed to a rise in inflation in 2021, prompting the 
FRB to announce the approaching end of the period of extraordinarily low 
interest rates.

Interest rates on loans Citi makes are typically based off or set at a 
spread over a benchmark interest rate, and would likely decline or rise as 
benchmark rates decline or rise, respectively. While the interest rates at which 
Citi pays depositors are already low and unlikely to decline much further, 
declining or continued low interest rates for loans could further compress 
Citi’s net interest income. Citi’s net interest income could also be adversely 
affected due to a flattening of the interest rate yield curve (e.g., a lower spread 
between shorter-term versus longer-term interest rates), as Citi, similar to 
other banks, typically pays interest on deposits based on shorter-term interest 
rates and earns money on loans based on longer-term interest rates.

In contrast, an abrupt and sustained increase in interest rates could 
interfere with the global macroeconomic recovery, whether due to continued 
or increased inflationary pressures or otherwise. And while Citi estimates 
its overall net interest income would generally increase due to higher 
interest rates, higher rates could adversely affect Citi’s funding costs, levels of 
deposits in its consumer and institutional businesses and certain business or 
product revenues. For additional information on Citi’s interest rate risk, see 
“Managing Global Risk—Market Risk—Net Interest Income at Risk” below.
Additional areas of uncertainty include, among others, an elevated level of 
inflation resulting in adverse spill-over effects; the ability of Congress to raise 
the federal debt ceiling; slowing of the Chinese economy, including negative 
economic impacts associated with such slowdown or any policy actions; 
significant disruptions and volatility in financial markets; other geopolitical 
tensions and conflicts; protracted or widespread trade tensions; financial 
market, other economic and political disruption driven by anti-establishment 
movements; natural disasters; other pandemics; and election outcomes. For 
example, Citi’s market-making businesses can suffer losses resulting from 
the widening of credit spreads due to unanticipated changes in financial 
markets. In addition, adverse developments or downturns in one or more 
of the world’s larger economies would likely have a significant impact on 
the global economy or the economies of other countries because of global 
financial and economic linkages.

These and additional global macroeconomic, geopolitical and other 
challenges, uncertainties and volatilities have negatively impacted, and could 

43

 
continue to negatively impact, Citi’s businesses, results of operations and 
financial condition, including its credit costs, revenues across ICG and GCB 
and AOCI (which would in turn negatively impact Citi’s book and tangible 
book value).

STRATEGIC RISKS
Rapidly Evolving Challenges and Uncertainties Related to 
the COVID-19 Pandemic in the U.S. and Globally Will Likely 
Continue to Have Negative Impacts on Citi’s Businesses and 
Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all of the countries and jurisdictions 
in which Citi operates, including severely impacting global health, financial 
markets, consumer and business spending and economic conditions. The 
extent of the future pandemic impacts remain uncertain and will likely 
evolve by region, country or state, largely depending on the duration and 
severity of the public health consequences, including the duration and 
further spread of the coronavirus as well as any variants becoming more 
prevalent and impactful; further production, distribution, acceptance and 
effectiveness of vaccines; availability and efficiency of testing; the public 
response; and government actions. The future impacts to global economic 
conditions may include, among others:

•  further disruption of global supply chains;
•  higher inflation;
•  higher interest rates;
•  significant disruption and volatility in financial markets;
•  additional closures, reduced activity and failures of many businesses, 

leading to loss of revenues and net losses;

•  further institution of social distancing and restrictions on businesses 
and the movement of the public in and among the U.S. and other 
countries; and

•  reduced U.S. and global economic output.

The pandemic has had, and may continue to have, negative impacts on 
Citi’s businesses and overall results of operations and financial condition, 
which could be material. The extent of the impact on Citi’s operations and 
financial performance, including its ability to execute its business strategies 
and initiatives, will continue to depend significantly on future developments 
in the U.S. and globally. Such developments are uncertain and cannot be 
predicted, including the course of the coronavirus, as well as any weakness or 
slowing in the economic recovery or a further economic downturn, whether 
due to further supply chain disruptions, inflation trends, higher interest rates 
or otherwise.

The pandemic may not be sufficiently contained for an extended period of 
time. A prolonged health crisis could reduce economic activity in the U.S. and 
other countries, resulting in additional declines or weakness in employment 
trends and business and consumer confidence. These factors could negatively 
impact global economic activity and markets; cause a continued decline 
in the demand for Citi’s products and services and in its revenues; further 

increase Citi’s credit and other costs; and may result in impairment of 
long-lived assets or goodwill. These factors could also cause an increase 
in Citi’s balance sheet, risk-weighted assets and ACL, resulting in a decline 
in regulatory capital ratios or liquidity measures, as well as regulatory 
demands for higher capital levels and/or limitations or reductions in capital 
distributions (such as common share repurchases and dividends). Moreover, 
any disruption or failure of Citi’s performance of, or its ability to perform, 
key business functions, as a result of the continued spread of COVID-19 or 
otherwise, could adversely affect Citi’s operations.

The impact of the pandemic on Citi’s consumer and corporate borrowers 

will vary by sector or industry, with some borrowers experiencing greater 
stress levels, particularly as credit and customer assistance support further 
winds down, which could lead to increased pressure on their results of 
operations and financial condition, increased borrowings or credit ratings 
downgrades, thus likely leading to higher credit costs for Citi. These 
borrowers include, among others, businesses that are more directly impacted 
by the institution of social distancing, the movement of the public and store 
closures. In addition, stress levels ultimately experienced by Citi’s borrowers 
may be different from and more intense than assumptions made in prior 
estimates or models used by Citi, resulting in an increase in Citi’s ACL or net 
credit losses, particularly as the benefits of fiscal stimulus and government 
support programs diminish.

Ongoing legislative and regulatory changes in the U.S. and globally 
to address the economic impact from the pandemic could further affect 
Citi’s businesses, operations and financial performance. Citi could also face 
challenges, including legal and reputational, and scrutiny in its efforts to 
provide relief measures. Such efforts have resulted in, and may continue to 
result in, litigation, including class actions, and regulatory and government 
actions and proceedings. Such actions may result in judgments, settlements, 
penalties and fines adverse to Citi. In addition, the different types of 
government actions could vary in scale and duration across jurisdictions and 
regions with varying degrees of effectiveness.

Citi has taken measures to maintain the health and safety of its 
colleagues; however, these measures could result in additional expenses, 
and illness of employees could negatively affect staffing for a period of 
time. In addition, Citi’s ability to recruit, hire and onboard colleagues in 
key areas could be negatively impacted by pandemic restrictions as well as 
Citi’s COVID-19 vaccination requirement (see the qualified colleagues risk 
factor below).

Further, it is unclear how the macroeconomic or business environment 
or societal norms may be impacted after the pandemic. The post-pandemic 
environment may undergo unexpected developments or changes in financial 
markets, fiscal, monetary, tax and regulatory environments and consumer 
customer and corporate client behavior. These developments and changes 
could have an adverse impact on Citi’s results of operations and financial 
condition. Ongoing business and regulatory uncertainties and changes may 
make Citi’s longer-term business, balance sheet and strategic and budget 
planning more difficult or costly. Citi and its management and businesses 
may also experience increased or different competitive and other challenges 

44

in this environment. To the extent that it is not able to adapt or compete 
effectively, Citi could experience loss of business and its results of operations 
and financial condition could suffer (see the competitive challenges risk 
factor below).

Citi’s Ability to Return Capital to Common Shareholders 
Consistent with Its Capital Planning Efforts and Targets 
Substantially Depends on Regulatory Capital Requirements, 
Including the Results of the CCAR Process and Regulatory 
Stress Tests.
Citi’s ability to return capital to its common shareholders consistent with 
its capital planning efforts and targets, whether through its common stock 
dividend or through a share repurchase program, substantially depends, 
among other things, on regulatory capital requirements, including the Stress 
Capital Buffer (SCB), which is based upon the results of the CCAR process 
required by the FRB as well as the supervisory stress tests required under the 
Dodd- Frank Act (as described in more detail below).

Citi’s ability to return capital also depends on its results of operations 
and financial condition, the capital impact related to divestitures, forecasts 
of macroeconomic conditions, its implementation and maintenance of 
an effective capital planning process and management framework, and 
effectiveness in planning, managing and calculating its level of risk-weighted 
assets under both the Advanced Approaches and the Standardized Approach, 
Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) and global systemically important 
bank holding company (GSIB) surcharge, which has been made more 
challenging due to elevated levels of liquidity in the financial system related 
to the pandemic (see the macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties risk 
factor above).

Changes in regulatory capital rules, requirements or interpretations 
could have a material impact on Citi’s regulatory capital, both as a result of 
changes in Citi’s reported regulatory capital and integration into the CCAR 
process and regulatory stress tests. For example, Citi was required to adopt 
the Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR) as of 
January 1, 2022, which resulted in an approximate $51 billion increase in 
Citi’s risk-weighted assets under the Standardized Approach. Citi voluntarily 
suspended common share repurchases during the fourth quarter of 2021, in 
anticipation of the adverse impact resulting from the adoption of SA-CCR. 
Citi will be required to adopt SA-CCR for purposes of the supervisory stress 
test during the 2023 cycle and SA-CCR may be considered by management 
during the 2022 cycle for purposes of management’s own capital adequacy 
assessment. In addition, the U.S. banking agencies may potentially 
consider a number of changes to the U.S. regulatory capital framework 
in the future, including, but not limited to, revisions to the U.S. Basel III 
rules, recalibration of the GSIB surcharge and SLR, and enactment of the 
discretionary Countercyclical Capital Buffer. All of these potential changes 
could negatively impact Citi’s regulatory capital position or increase Citi’s 
regulatory capital requirements.

All CCAR firms, including Citi, will continue to be subject to a rigorous 

regulatory evaluation of capital planning practices, including, but not 
limited to, governance, risk management and internal controls. Citi’s ability 

to return capital may be adversely impacted if such an evaluation of Citi 
resulted in negative findings. In addition, Citi’s ability to accurately predict, 
interpret or explain to stakeholders the results of the CCAR process, and 
thus to address any market or investor perceptions, may be limited as the 
FRB’s assessment of Citi’s capital adequacy is conducted using the FRB’s 
proprietary stress test models. For additional information on limitations on 
Citi’s ability to return capital to common shareholders, as well as the CCAR 
process, supervisory stress test requirements and GSIB surcharge, see “Capital 
Resources—Overview” and “Capital Resources—Stress Testing Component 
of Capital Planning” above and the risk management risk factor below.

The FRB has stated that it expects leading capital adequacy practices to 

continue to evolve and to likely be determined by the FRB each year as a 
result of its cross-firm review of capital plan submissions. Similarly, the FRB 
has indicated that, as part of its stated goal to continually evolve its annual 
stress testing requirements, several parameters of the annual stress testing 
process may continue to be altered, including the severity of the stress test 
scenario, the FRB modeling of Citi’s balance sheet, pre-provision net revenue 
(PPNR) and stress losses, and the addition of components deemed important 
by the FRB.

Beginning January 1, 2022, Citi was required to phase into regulatory 
capital at 25% per year the changes in retained earnings, deferred tax assets 
and ACL determined upon the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date, as well 
as subsequent changes in the ACL between January 1, 2020 and December 
31, 2021. The FRB has stated that it plans to maintain its current framework 
for calculating allowances on loans in the supervisory stress test through the 
2023 supervisory stress test cycle, while continuing to evaluate appropriate 
future enhancements to this framework. The impacts on Citi’s capital 
adequacy of the FRB’s incorporation of CECL in its supervisory stress tests 
on an ongoing basis, and of other potential regulatory changes in the FRB’s 
stress testing methodologies, remain unclear. For additional information 
regarding the CECL methodology, including the transition provisions 
related to the adverse regulatory capital effects resulting from adoption 
of the CECL methodology, see “Capital Resources—Current Regulatory 
Capital Standards—Regulatory Capital Treatment—Modified Transition 
of the Current Expected Credit Losses Methodology” above and Note 1 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

In addition, the FRB has integrated the annual stress testing requirements 
with ongoing regulatory capital requirements. For Citigroup, the SCB equals 
the maximum decline in Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio under the 
supervisory severely adverse scenario over a nine-quarter CCAR measurement 
period, plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends, subject 
to a minimum requirement of 2.5%. Effective October 1, 2021, Citi’s SCB 
was 3.0%. The SCB is calculated by the FRB using its proprietary data and 
modeling of each firm’s results. Accordingly, Citi’s SCB may change annually, 
or possibly more frequently, based on the supervisory stress test results, thus 
potentially resulting in volatility in the calculation of the SCB. Similar to 
the other regulatory capital buffers, a breach of the SCB would result in 
graduated limitations on capital distributions. For additional information 
on the SCB, including its calculation, see “Capital Resources—Regulatory 
Capital Buffers” above.

45

Although various uncertainties exist regarding the extent of, and 
the ultimate impact to Citi from, these changes to the FRB’s regulatory 
capital, stress testing and CCAR regimes, these changes could increase the 
level of capital Citi is required or elects to hold, including as part of Citi’s 
management buffer, thus potentially impacting the extent to which Citi is 
able to return capital to shareholders.

Citi, Its Management and Its Businesses Must Continually 
Review, Analyze and Successfully Adapt to Ongoing 
Regulatory and Legislative Uncertainties and Changes in the 
U.S. and Globally.
Despite the adoption of final regulations and laws in numerous areas 
impacting Citi and its businesses over the past several years, Citi, its 
management and its businesses continually face ongoing regulatory and 
legislative uncertainties and changes, both in the U.S. and globally. While 
the areas of ongoing regulatory and legislative uncertainties and changes 
facing Citi are too numerous to list completely, various examples include, 
but are not limited to (i) potential fiscal, monetary, regulatory, tax and other 
changes arising from the U.S. federal government and other governments, 
including as a result of the differing priorities of the current U.S. presidential 
administration, changes in regulatory leadership or focus and actions of 
Congress or in response to the pandemic; (ii) potential changes to various 
aspects of the regulatory capital framework and requirements applicable to 
Citi (see the capital return risk factor and “Capital Resources—Regulatory 
Capital Standards Developments” above); and (iii) future legislative and 
regulatory requirements in the U.S. and globally related to climate change, 
including any new disclosure requirements (see the climate change risk 
factor below). When referring to “regulatory,” Citi is including both 
formal regulation and the views and expectations of its regulators in their 
supervisory roles.

U.S. and international regulatory and legislative initiatives have not 
always been undertaken or implemented on a coordinated basis, and areas 
of divergence have developed and continue to develop with respect to the 
scope, interpretation, timing, structure or approach, leading to inconsistent 
or even conflicting requirements, including within a single jurisdiction. 
For example, in May 2019, the European Commission adopted, as part of 
Capital Requirements Directive V (CRD V), a new requirement for major 
banking groups headquartered outside the EU (which would include Citi) 
to establish an intermediate EU holding company where the foreign bank 
has two or more institutions (broadly meaning banks, broker-dealers and 
similar financial firms) established in the EU. While in some respects 
the requirement mirrors an existing U.S. requirement for non-U.S. 
banking organizations to form U.S. intermediate holding companies, the 
implementation of the EU holding company requirement could lead to 
additional complexity with respect to Citi’s resolution planning, capital and 
liquidity allocation and efficiency in various jurisdictions.

Moreover, ongoing regulatory and legislative uncertainties and changes 

make Citi’s and its management’s long-term business, balance sheet and 
strategic budget planning difficult, subject to change and potentially more 
costly. U.S. and other regulators globally have implemented and continue 
to discuss various changes to certain regulatory requirements, which would 

require ongoing assessment by management as to the impact to Citi, its 
businesses and business planning. For example, while the Basel III post-crisis 
regulatory reforms and revised market risk framework have been finalized at 
the international level, there remain significant uncertainties with respect to 
the integration of these revisions into the U.S. regulatory capital framework. 
Business planning is required to be based on possible or proposed rules 
or outcomes, which can change dramatically upon finalization, or upon 
implementation or interpretive guidance from numerous regulatory bodies 
worldwide, and such guidance can change.

Regulatory and legislative changes have also significantly increased 
Citi’s compliance risks and costs (see the implementation and interpretation 
of regulatory changes risk factor below) and can adversely affect Citi’s 
businesses, results of operations and financial condition.

Citi’s Continued Investment and Other Initiatives as Part 
of Its Transformation and Strategic Refresh May Not Be as 
Successful as It Projects or Expects.
As part of its transformation initiatives, Citi continues to make significant 
investments to improve its infrastructure, risk management and controls 
and further enhance safety and soundness (for additional information, see 
the legal and regulatory proceedings risk factor below). Citi also continues 
to execute on its strategic refresh that includes, among other things, its exit 
of certain consumer banking businesses (see below) and its investments to 
deepen client relationships and enhance client offerings and capabilities in 
order to simplify the Company and enhance its allocation of resources.
For example, Citi continues to invest in its technology and digital 

capabilities across the franchise, including digital platforms and mobile and 
cloud-based solutions. In addition, Citi has been making other investments 
across the Company, such as in Citi’s wealth management business, 
commercial banking business, treasury and trade solutions, securities 
services and other businesses, including implementing new capabilities and 
partnerships. Citi has also been pursuing productivity improvements through 
various technology and digital initiatives, organizational simplification and 
location strategies. Failure to properly invest in and upgrade Citi’s technology 
and processes could result in an inability to be sufficiently competitive, serve 
clients effectively and avoid operational errors (for additional information, 
see the operational processes and systems risk factor below). There is no 
guarantee that these or other initiatives Citi may pursue will be as productive 
or effective as Citi expects, or at all.

Furthermore, Citi’s strategic refresh necessitates further changes in and 
exits of certain businesses, which involve significant execution complexity, 
and could result in additional losses, charges or other negative financial 
impacts. For example, Citi may not be able to achieve its objectives related to 
its exits of 13 consumer markets in Asia and EMEA or exit of the consumer, 
small business and middle-market banking operations in Mexico. These 
exits may not be as productive, effective or timely as Citi expects and may 
result in additional foreign currency translation adjustments (CTA) or other 
losses, charges or other negative financial or strategic impacts, which could 
be material. For additional information on CTA losses, see the incorrect 
assumptions or estimates risk factor below.

46

Citi’s investment and other initiatives may continue to evolve as its 
business strategies, the market environment and regulatory expectations 
change, which could make the initiatives more costly and more challenging 
to implement, and limit their effectiveness. Moreover, Citi’s ability to achieve 
expected returns on its investments and costs savings depends, in part, 
on factors that it cannot control, including, among others, interest rates; 
inflation; impacts related to the pandemic; customer, client and competitor 
actions; and ongoing regulatory changes.

Citi’s Ability to Utilize Its DTAs, and Thus Reduce the Negative 
Impact of the DTAs on Citi’s Regulatory Capital, Will Be Driven 
by Its Ability to Generate U.S. Taxable Income.
At December 31, 2021, Citi’s net DTAs were $24.8 billion, net of a valuation 
allowance of $4.2 billion, of which $9.5 billion was deducted from Citi’s 
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules, primarily 
relating to net operating losses, foreign tax credit and general business 
credit carry-forwards (for additional information, see “Capital Resources—
Components of Citigroup Capital” above).

Of the net DTAs at December 31, 2021, $2.8 billion related to foreign tax 
credit (FTC) carry-forwards, net of a valuation allowance. The carry-forward 
utilization period for FTCs is 10 years and represents the most time-sensitive 
component of Citi’s DTAs. The FTC carry-forwards at December 31, 2021 
expire over the period of 2022–2029. Citi must utilize any FTCs generated in 
the then-current-year tax return prior to utilizing any carry-forward FTCs.
The accounting treatment for realization of DTAs, including FTCs, is 
complex and requires significant judgment and estimates regarding future 
taxable earnings in the jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise and available 
tax planning strategies. Forecasts of future taxable earnings will depend 
upon various factors, including, among others, the continued impact of the 
pandemic and other macroeconomic conditions. In addition, any future 
increase in U.S. corporate tax rates could result in an increase in Citi’s DTA, 
which may subject more of Citi’s existing DTA to exclusion from regulatory 
capital while improving Citi’s ability to utilize its FTC carry-forwards.

Citi’s overall ability to realize its DTAs will primarily be dependent upon 
its ability to generate U.S. taxable income in the relevant tax carry-forward 
periods. Although utilization of FTCs in any year is generally limited to 21% 
of foreign source taxable income in that year, overall domestic losses (ODL) 
that Citi has incurred in the past allow it to reclassify domestic source income 
as foreign source. Failure to realize any portion of the net DTAs would have a 
corresponding negative impact on Citi’s net income and financial returns.
Citi has not been and does not expect to be subject to the Base Erosion 

Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT), which, if applicable to Citi in any given year, 
would have a significantly adverse effect on both Citi’s net income and 
regulatory capital.

For additional information on Citi’s DTAs, including FTCs, see 

“Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—Income Taxes” 
below and Notes 1 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Citi’s Interpretation or Application of the Complex Tax Laws 
to Which It Is Subject Could Differ from Those of the Relevant 
Governmental Authorities, Which Could Result in Litigation or 
Examinations and the Payment of Additional Taxes, Penalties 
or Interest.
Citi is subject to various income-based tax laws of the U.S. and its states 
and municipalities, as well as the numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions in 
which it operates. These tax laws are inherently complex and Citi must 
make judgments and interpretations about the application of these laws, 
including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform), to its entities, operations 
and businesses. In addition, Citi is subject to litigation or examinations with 
U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities regarding non-income-based tax matters. 
Citi’s interpretations or application of the tax laws, including with respect 
to Tax Reform, withholding, stamp, service and other non-income taxes, 
could differ from that of the relevant governmental taxing authority, which 
could result in the requirement to pay additional taxes, penalties or interest, 
which could be material. For additional information on the litigation 
and examinations involving non-U.S. tax authorities, see Note 27 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

A Deterioration in or Failure to Maintain Citi’s Co-Branding 
or Private Label Credit Card Relationships, Including as a 
Result of Early Termination, Bankruptcy or Liquidation, 
Could Have a Negative Impact on Citi’s Results of Operations 
or Financial Condition.
Citi has co-branding and private label relationships through its branded 
cards and retail services credit card businesses with various retailers and 
merchants globally, whereby in the ordinary course of business Citi issues 
credit cards to customers of the retailers or merchants. The five largest 
relationships across both businesses in North America GCB constituted an 
aggregate of approximately 9% of Citi’s revenues in 2021 (for additional 
information, see “Global Consumer Banking—North America GCB” 
above). Citi’s co-branding and private label agreements provide for shared 
economics between the parties and generally have a fixed term.

Over the last several years, a number of U.S. retailers have continued 
to experience declining sales due to the pandemic or otherwise, which has 
resulted in significant numbers of store closures and, in a number of cases, 
bankruptcies, as retailers attempt to cut costs and reorganize. In addition, as 
has been widely reported, competition among card issuers, including Citi, for 
these relationships is significant, and it has become increasingly difficult in 
recent years to maintain such relationships on the same terms or at all.
Citi’s co-branding and private label relationships could be negatively 

impacted by, among other things, the general economic environment; 
changes in consumer sentiment, spending patterns and credit card usage 
behaviors; a decline in sales and revenues, partner store closures, government 
imposed restrictions, reduced air and business travel, or other operational 
difficulties of the retailer or merchant; early termination due to a contractual 
breach or exercise of other early termination right; or other factors, including 
bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings, consolidations or other similar 
events, whether due to the ongoing impact of the pandemic or otherwise 
(see the pandemic-related risk factor above).

47

While various mitigating factors could be available to Citi if any of the 
above events were to occur—such as by replacing the retailer or merchant 
or offering other card products—these events, particularly early termination 
and bankruptcies or liquidations, could negatively impact the results of 
operations or financial condition of branded cards, retail services or Citi 
as a whole, including as a result of loss of revenues, increased expenses, 
higher cost of credit, impairment of purchased credit card relationships 
and contract-related intangibles or other losses (for information on Citi’s 
credit card related intangibles generally, see Note 16 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements).

Citi’s Inability in Its Resolution Plan Submissions to Address 
Any Shortcomings or Deficiencies Identified or Guidance 
Provided by the FRB and FDIC Could Subject Citi to More 
Stringent Capital, Leverage or Liquidity Requirements, or 
Restrictions on Its Growth, Activities or Operations, and 
Could Eventually Require Citi to Divest Assets or Operations.
Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act requires Citi to prepare and submit a plan to the 
FRB and the FDIC for the orderly resolution of Citigroup (the bank holding 
company) and its significant legal entities under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in 
the event of future material financial distress or failure. The eight U.S. GSIBs, 
including Citi, filed their most recent resolution plans with the FRB and 
FDIC on July 1, 2021. For additional information on Citi’s resolution plan 
submissions, see “Managing Global Risk—Liquidity Risk” below.

Under Title I, if the FRB and the FDIC jointly determine that Citi’s 
resolution plan is not “credible” (which, although not defined, is generally 
believed to mean the regulators do not believe the plan is feasible or would 
otherwise allow Citi to be resolved in a way that protects systemically 
important functions without severe systemic disruption), or would not 
facilitate an orderly resolution of Citi under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, 
and Citi fails to resubmit a resolution plan that remedies any identified 
deficiencies, Citi could be subjected to more stringent capital, leverage or 
liquidity requirements, or restrictions on its growth, activities or operations. 
If within two years from the imposition of any such requirements or 
restrictions Citi has still not remediated any identified deficiencies, then Citi 
could eventually be required to divest certain assets or operations. Any such 
restrictions or actions would negatively impact Citi’s reputation, market and 
investor perception, operations and strategy.

Citi’s Performance and the Performance of Its Individual 
Businesses Could Be Negatively Impacted if Citi Is Not Able 
to Effectively Compete for, Retain and Motivate Highly 
Qualified Colleagues.
Recent employment conditions have made the competition to hire and retain 
qualified employees significantly more challenging. Citi’s performance and 
the performance of its individual businesses largely depend on the talents 
and efforts of its diverse and highly qualified colleagues. Specifically, Citi’s 
continued ability to compete in each of its lines of business, to manage its 
businesses effectively and to execute its global strategy depends on its ability 
to attract new colleagues and to retain and motivate its existing colleagues. 

If Citi is unable to continue to attract, retain and motivate the most 
highly qualified colleagues, Citi’s performance, including its competitive 
position, the execution of its strategy and its results of operations could be 
negatively impacted.

Citi’s ability to attract, retain and motivate colleagues depends on 
numerous factors, some of which are outside of its control. For example, 
the competition for talent recently has been particularly intense because 
of economic conditions associated with the pandemic. Also, the banking 
industry generally is subject to more comprehensive regulation of employee 
compensation than other industries, including deferral and clawback 
requirements for incentive compensation, which can make it unusually 
challenging for Citi to compete in labor markets against businesses that 
are not subject to such regulation. Citi often competes for talent with such 
businesses, including, among others, technology companies. Further, 
Citi’s vaccination requirement for its U.S.-based employees could make 
it more difficult to compete for or retain colleagues. Other factors that 
could impact its ability to attract, retain and motivate colleagues include, 
among other things, Citi’s presence in a particular market or region, the 
professional opportunities it offers and its reputation. For information on 
Citi’s colleagues and workforce management, see “Human Capital Resources 
and Management” below.

Financial Services Companies and Others as well as Emerging 
Technologies Pose Increasingly Competitive Challenges to Citi.
Citi operates in an increasingly evolving and competitive business 
environment, which includes both financial and non-financial services firms, 
such as traditional banks, online banks, financial technology companies and 
others. These companies compete on the basis of, among other factors, size, 
reach, quality and type of products and services offered, price, technology 
and reputation. Certain competitors may be subject to different and, in some 
cases, less stringent legal and regulatory requirements, placing Citi at a 
competitive disadvantage.

Citi competes with financial services companies in the U.S. and globally 
that continue to develop and introduce new products and services. In recent 
years, non-financial services firms, such as financial technology companies, 
have begun to offer services traditionally provided by financial institutions, 
such as Citi, and have sought bank charters to provide these services. These 
firms attempt to use technology and mobile platforms to enhance the ability 
of companies and individuals to borrow, save and invest money.

Moreover, emerging technologies have the potential to intensify 

competition and accelerate disruption in the financial services industry. For 
example, there is increasing interest from clients and investors in digital 
assets such as cryptocurrencies. Financial services firms and other market 
participants have begun to offer services related to those assets such as 
custody and trading. However, Citi may not be able to provide the same or 
similar services for legal or regulatory reasons and such services increase 
compliance risk. In addition, changes in the payments space (e.g., instant 
and 24x7 payments) are accelerating, and, as a result, certain of Citi’s 
products and services could become less competitive.

48

In addition, as discussed above, it is unclear how the macroeconomic 
business environment or societal norms may be impacted as a result of the 
pandemic. Citi may experience increased or different competitive and other 
challenges in a post-pandemic environment. Increased competition and 
emerging technologies have required and could require Citi to change or 
adapt its products and services to attract and retain customers or clients or to 
compete more effectively with competitors, including new market entrants. 
Simultaneously, as Citi develops new products and services leveraging 
emerging technologies, new risks may emerge that, if not designed and 
governed adequately, may result in control gaps and in Citi operating outside 
of its risk appetite. For example, instant and 24x7 payments products could 
be accompanied by challenges to forecasting and managing liquidity, as well 
as increased operational and compliance risks.

To the extent that Citi is not able to compete effectively with financial 
technology companies and other firms, Citi could be placed at a competitive 
disadvantage, which could result in loss of customers and market share, and 
its businesses, results of operations and financial condition could suffer. For 
additional information on Citi’s competitors, see the co-brand and private 
label cards and qualified colleagues risk factors above and “Supervision, 
Regulation and Other—Competition” below.

OPERATIONAL RISKS
A Failure or Disruption of Citi’s Operational Processes 
or Systems Could Negatively Impact Citi’s Reputation, 
Customers, Clients, Businesses or Results of Operations 
and Financial Condition.
Citi’s global operations rely heavily on its technology, including the accurate, 
timely and secure processing, management, storage and transmission 
of confidential transactions, data and other information as well as the 
monitoring of a substantial amount of data and complex transactions in real 
time. For example, Citi obtains and stores an extensive amount of personal 
and client-specific information for its consumer and institutional customers 
and clients, and must accurately record and reflect their extensive account 
transactions. Citi’s operations must also comply with complex and evolving 
laws and regulations in the countries in which it operates.

With the evolving proliferation of new technologies and the increasing use 

of the internet, mobile devices and cloud technologies to conduct financial 
transactions, large global financial institutions such as Citi have been, and 
will continue to be, subject to an ever-increasing risk of operational loss, 
failure or disruption, including as a result of cyber or information security 
incidents. These risks have been exacerbated during the pandemic, when a 
substantial portion of Citi’s colleagues have worked remotely and customers 
and clients have increased their use of online banking and other platforms 
(for additional information, see the pandemic-related risk factor above and 
the cybersecurity risk factor below).

Although Citi has continued to upgrade its technology, including systems 

to automate processes and enhance efficiencies, operational incidents are 
unpredictable and can arise from numerous sources, not all of which are 
fully within Citi’s control. These include, among others, human error, 
such as manual transaction processing errors; fraud or malice on the part 

of employees or third parties; accidental system or technological failure; 
electrical or telecommunication outages; failures of or cyber incidents 
involving computer servers or infrastructure; or other similar losses or 
damage to Citi’s property or assets (see also the climate change risk factor 
below). For example, Citi has experienced and could experience further 
losses associated with manual transaction processing errors (for additional 
information, see “Revlon-Related Wire Transfer Litigation” in Note 27 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements).

Irrespective of the sophistication of the technology utilized by Citi, there 
will always be some room for human error. In view of the large transactions 
in which Citi engages, such errors could result in significant loss.

Operational incidents can also arise as a result of failures by third parties 
with which Citi does business, such as failures by internet, mobile technology 
and cloud service providers or other vendors to adequately follow procedures 
or processes, safeguard their systems or prevent system disruptions or 
cyber attacks.

Incidents that impact information security and/or technology operations 

may cause disruptions and/or malfunctions within Citi’s businesses (e.g., 
the temporary loss of availability of Citi’s online banking system or mobile 
banking platform), as well as the operations of its clients, customers or other 
third parties. In addition, operational incidents could involve the failure or 
ineffectiveness of internal processes or controls.

Given Citi’s global footprint and the high volume of transactions 
processed by Citi, certain failures, errors or actions may be repeated or 
compounded before they are discovered and rectified, which would further 
increase the consequences and costs. Operational incidents could result in 
financial losses as well as misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential 
and other information or assets, which could significantly negatively impact 
Citi’s reputation, customers, clients, businesses or results of operations and 
financial condition. Cyber-related and other operational incidents can also 
result in legal and regulatory proceedings, fines and other costs (see the legal 
and regulatory proceedings risk factor below).

For information on Citi’s management of operational risk, see “Managing 

Global Risk—Operational Risk” below.

Citi’s and Third Parties’ Computer Systems and Networks Have 
Been, and Will Continue to Be, Susceptible to an Increasing 
Risk of Continually Evolving, Sophisticated Cybersecurity 
Activities That Could Result in the Theft, Loss, Misuse or 
Disclosure of Confidential Client or Customer Information, 
Damage to Citi’s Reputation, Additional Costs to Citi, 
Regulatory Penalties, Legal Exposure and Financial Losses.
Citi’s computer systems, software and networks are subject to ongoing cyber 
incidents such as unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including 
confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of 
service, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber attacks and other 
similar events. These threats can arise from external parties, including 
cyber criminals, cyber terrorists, hacktivists and nation-state actors, as well 
as insiders who knowingly or unknowingly engage in or enable malicious 
cyber activities.

49

Third parties with which Citi does business, as well as retailers and other 
third parties with which Citi’s customers do business, may also be sources of 
cybersecurity risks, particularly where activities of customers are beyond Citi’s 
security and control systems. For example, Citi outsources certain functions, 
such as processing customer credit card transactions, uploading content 
on customer-facing websites and developing software for new products and 
services. These relationships allow for the storage and processing of customer 
information by third-party hosting of or access to Citi websites, which could 
lead to compromise or the potential to introduce vulnerable or malicious 
code, resulting in security breaches impacting Citi customers. Furthermore, 
because financial institutions are becoming increasingly interconnected 
with central agents, exchanges and clearing houses, including as a result 
of derivatives reforms over the last few years, Citi has increased exposure to 
cyber attacks through third parties. While many of Citi’s agreements with 
third parties include indemnification provisions, Citi may not be able to 
recover sufficiently, or at all, under the provisions to adequately offset any 
losses Citi may incur from third-party cyber incidents.

Citi has been subject to attempted and sometimes successful cyber attacks 

from external sources over the last several years, including (i) denial of 
service attacks, which attempt to interrupt service to clients and customers, 
(ii) hacking and malicious software installations, intended to gain 
unauthorized access to information systems or to disrupt those systems, 
(iii) data breaches due to unauthorized access to customer account data 
and (iv) malicious software attacks on client systems, in an attempt to gain 
unauthorized access to Citi systems or client data under the guise of normal 
client transactions. While Citi’s monitoring and protection services were 
able to detect and respond to the incidents targeting its systems before they 
became significant, they still resulted in limited losses in some instances as 
well as increases in expenditures to monitor against the threat of similar 
future cyber incidents. There can be no assurance that such cyber incidents 
will not occur again, and they could occur more frequently and on a more 
significant scale.

Further, although Citi devotes significant resources to implement, 
maintain, monitor and regularly upgrade its systems and networks with 
measures such as intrusion detection and prevention and firewalls to 
safeguard critical business applications, there is no guarantee that these 
measures or any other measures can provide absolute security. Because the 
methods used to cause cyber attacks change frequently or, in some cases, are 
not recognized until launched or even later, Citi may be unable to implement 
effective preventive measures or proactively address these methods until they 
are discovered. In addition, given the evolving nature of cyber threat actors 
and the frequency and sophistication of the cyber activities they carry out, 
the determination of the severity and potential impact of a cyber incident 
may not become apparent for a substantial period of time following discovery 
of the incident. Also, while Citi engages in certain actions to reduce the 
exposure resulting from outsourcing, such as performing security control 
assessments of third-party vendors and limiting third-party access to the 
least privileged level necessary to perform job functions, these actions cannot 
prevent all third-party-related cyber attacks or data breaches.

Cyber incidents can result in the disclosure of personal, confidential or 
proprietary customer or client information, damage to Citi’s reputation with 
its clients and the market, customer dissatisfaction and additional costs 
to Citi, including expenses such as repairing systems, replacing customer 
payment cards, credit monitoring or adding new personnel or protection 
technologies. Regulatory penalties, loss of revenues, exposure to litigation 
and other financial losses, including loss of funds, to both Citi and its clients 
and customers and disruption to Citi’s operational systems could also result 
from cyber incidents (for additional information on the potential impact 
of operational disruptions, see the operational processes and systems risk 
factor above). Moreover, the increasing risk of cyber incidents has resulted in 
increased legislative and regulatory scrutiny of firms’ cybersecurity protection 
services and calls for additional laws and regulations to further enhance 
protection of consumers’ personal data.

While Citi maintains insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms 
and conditions including significant self- insured deductibles, cover certain 
aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover 
all losses and may not take into account reputational harm, the cost of which 
could be immeasurable.

For additional information about Citi’s management of cybersecurity risk, 
see “Managing Global Risk—Operational Risk—Cybersecurity Risk” below.

Changes to or the Application of Incorrect Assumptions, 
Judgments or Estimates in Citi’s Financial Statements Could 
Cause Significant Unexpected Losses or Impacts in the Future.
U.S. GAAP requires Citi to use certain assumptions, judgments and estimates 
in preparing its financial statements, including, among other items, 
the estimate of the ACL; reserves related to litigation, regulatory and tax 
matters exposures; valuation of DTAs; the fair values of certain assets and 
liabilities; and the assessment of goodwill or other assets for impairment. 
If Citi’s assumptions, judgments or estimates underlying its financial 
statements are incorrect or differ from actual or subsequent events, Citi could 
experience unexpected losses or other adverse impacts, some of which could 
be significant.

For example, the CECL methodology requires that Citi provide reserves for 
a current estimate of lifetime expected credit losses for its loan portfolios and 
other financial assets, as applicable, at the time those assets are originated 
or acquired. This estimate is adjusted each period for changes in expected 
lifetime credit losses. Citi’s ACL estimate depends upon its CECL models and 
assumptions, forecasted macroeconomic conditions, including, among other 
things, U.S. unemployment rate and U.S. Real GDP, and the credit indicators, 
composition and other characteristics of Citi’s loan and other applicable 
financial assets. These model assumptions and forecasted macroeconomic 
conditions will change over time, whether due to the pandemic or otherwise, 
resulting in greater variability in Citi’s ACL compared to its provision for loan 
losses under the previous GAAP methodology, and, thus, impact its results of 
operations and financial condition, as well as regulatory capital due to the 
CECL phase-in beginning January 1, 2022.

50

Moreover, Citi has incurred losses related to its foreign operations that 
are reported in the CTA components of Accumulated other comprehensive 
income (loss) (AOCI). In accordance with U.S. GAAP, a sale, substantial 
liquidation or any other deconsolidation event of any foreign operations, 
such as those related to Citi’s legacy or exit businesses, would result in 
reclassification of any foreign CTA component of AOCI related to that 
foreign operation, including related hedges and taxes, into Citi’s earnings. 
For example, Citi incurred a pretax loss of approximately $680 million 
($580 million after-tax) in the third quarter of 2021 related to the sale of 
Citi’s Australia consumer banking business in Asia GCB, primarily reflecting 
the impact of a CTA loss. For additional information on Citi’s accounting 
policy for foreign currency translation and its foreign CTA components 
of AOCI, see Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For 
additional information on the key areas for which assumptions and estimates 
are used in preparing Citi’s financial statements, including those related to 
Citi’s ACL, see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” 
below and Notes 1 and 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Changes to Financial Accounting and Reporting Standards 
or Interpretations Could Have a Material Impact on How Citi 
Records and Reports Its Financial Condition and Results 
of Operations.
Periodically, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issues 
financial accounting and reporting standards that govern key aspects of Citi’s 
financial statements or interpretations thereof when those standards become 
effective, including those areas where Citi is required to make assumptions 
or estimates. Changes to financial accounting or reporting standards or 
interpretations, whether promulgated or required by the FASB or other 
regulators, could present operational challenges and could also require 
Citi to change certain of the assumptions or estimates it previously used in 
preparing its financial statements, which could negatively impact how it 
records and reports its financial condition and results of operations generally 
and/or with respect to particular businesses. For additional information on 
Citi’s accounting policies and changes in accounting, including the expected 
impacts on Citi’s results of operations and financial condition, see Note 1 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

If Citi’s Risk Management Processes, Strategies or Models Are 
Deficient or Ineffective, Citi May Incur Significant Losses 
and Its Regulatory Capital and Capital Ratios Could Be 
Negatively Impacted.
Citi utilizes a broad and diversified set of risk management and mitigation 
processes and strategies, including use of models in enacting processes 
and strategies as well as in analyzing and monitoring the various risks 
Citi assumes in conducting its activities. For example, Citi uses models as 
part of its comprehensive stress testing initiatives across the Company. Citi 
also relies on data to aggregate, assess and manage various risk exposures. 
Management of these risks is made even more challenging within a global 
financial institution such as Citi, particularly given the complex, diverse and 
rapidly changing financial markets and conditions in which Citi operates as 
well as that losses can occur unintentionally from untimely, inaccurate or 
incomplete processes.

In addition, in October 2020, Citigroup and Citibank entered into consent 

orders with the FRB and OCC that require Citigroup and Citibank to make 
improvements in various aspects of enterprise-wide risk management, 
compliance, data quality management and governance and internal controls 
(see “Citi’s Consent Order Compliance” above and the legal and regulatory 
proceedings risk factor below).

Citi’s risk management processes, strategies and models are inherently 
limited because they involve techniques, including the use of historical data 
in many circumstances, assumptions and judgments that cannot anticipate 
every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which Citi operates, 
nor can they anticipate the specifics and timing of such outcomes. Citi could 
incur significant losses, and its regulatory capital and capital ratios could be 
negatively impacted, if Citi’s risk management processes, including its ability 
to manage and aggregate data in a timely and accurate manner, strategies or 
models are deficient or ineffective. Such deficiencies or ineffectiveness could 
also result in inaccurate financial, regulatory or risk reporting.

Moreover, Citi’s Basel III regulatory capital models, including its 
credit, market and operational risk models, currently remain subject to 
ongoing regulatory review and approval, which may result in refinements, 
modifications or enhancements (required or otherwise) to these models. 
Modifications or requirements resulting from these ongoing reviews, as well 
as any future changes or guidance provided by the U.S. banking agencies 
regarding the regulatory capital framework applicable to Citi, have resulted 
in, and could continue to result in, significant changes to Citi’s risk- 
weighted assets. These changes can negatively impact Citi’s capital ratios and 
its ability to achieve its regulatory capital requirements.

CREDIT RISKS
Credit Risk and Concentrations of Risk Can Increase 
the Potential for Citi to Incur Significant Losses.
Credit risk primarily arises from Citi’s lending and other businesses in 
both ICG and GCB. Citi has credit exposures to consumer, corporate and 
public sector borrowers and other counterparties in the U.S. and various 
countries and jurisdictions globally, including end-of-period consumer 
loans of $271 billion and end-of-period corporate loans of $397 billion at 
year-end 2021.

A default by a borrower or other counterparty, or a decline in the credit 

quality or value of any underlying collateral, exposes Citi to credit risk. 
Despite Citi’s target client strategy, various macroeconomic, geopolitical 
and other factors, among other things, can increase Citi’s credit risk and 
credit costs, particularly for certain sectors, industries or countries (for 
additional information, see the pandemic-related, co-branding and private 
label credit card and macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties risk 
factors above and the emerging markets risk factor below). For example, a 
weakening of economic conditions, including higher unemployment levels, 
can adversely affect borrowers’ ability to repay their obligations. In addition, 
weakening economic conditions may result in Citi being unable to liquidate 
its collateral, as well as disputes with counterparties regarding the valuation 
of collateral Citi holds and Citi being unable to realize the fair value of 
such collateral.

51

While Citi provides reserves for expected losses for its credit exposures, as 
applicable, such reserves are subject to judgments and estimates that could 
be incorrect or differ from actual future events. Under the CECL accounting 
standard, the ACL reflects expected losses, rather than incurred losses, which 
has resulted in and could lead to additional volatility in the allowance and 
the provision for credit losses as forecasts of economic conditions change. 
In addition, Citi’s future allowance may be affected by seasonality of its 
cards portfolio balances based on historical evidence showing that (i) credit 
card balances typically decrease during the first and second quarters, as 
borrowers use tax refunds to pay down balances; and (ii) balances increase 
during the third and fourth quarters each year as payments are no longer 
impacted by tax refunds and the holiday season approaches. However, these 
seasonal trends could be affected in 2022 due to the impacts of the pandemic, 
government stimulus and expiration of consumer and small business relief 
programs. For additional information, see the incorrect assumptions or 
estimates and changes to financial accounting and reporting standards 
risk factors above. For additional information on Citi’s ACL, see “Significant 
Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” below and Notes 1 and 15 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information on Citi’s 
credit and country risk, see each respective business’s results of operations 
above and “Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk” and “Managing Global 
Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk” below and Notes 14 and 15 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Concentrations of risk to clients or counterparties engaged in the same 
or related industries or doing business in a particular geography, especially 
credit and market risks, can also increase Citi’s risk of significant losses. As 
of year-end 2021, Citi’s most significant concentration of credit risk was with 
the U.S. government and its agencies, which primarily results from trading 
assets and investments issued by the U.S. government and its agencies (for 
additional information, including concentrations of credit risk to other 
public sector entities, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
In addition, Citi routinely executes a high volume of securities, trading, 
derivative and foreign exchange transactions with non-U.S. sovereigns and 
with counterparties in the financial services industry, including banks, 
insurance companies, investment banks, governments, central banks and 
other financial institutions. Moreover, Citi has indemnification obligations in 
connection with various transactions that expose it to concentrations of risk, 
including credit risk from hedging or reinsurance arrangements related to 
those obligations (for additional information about these exposures, see Note 
26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). A rapid deterioration of a large 
borrower or other counterparty or within a sector or country in which Citi has 
large exposures or indemnifications or unexpected market dislocations could 
cause Citi to incur significant losses.

LIQUIDITY RISKS
The Maintenance of Adequate Liquidity and Funding Depends 
on Numerous Factors, Including Those Outside of Citi’s 
Control, Such as Market Disruptions and Increases in Citi’s 
Credit Spreads.
As a large, global financial institution, adequate liquidity and sources of 
funding are essential to Citi’s businesses. Citi’s liquidity and sources of 
funding can be significantly and negatively impacted by factors it cannot 
control, such as general disruptions in the financial markets, governmental 
fiscal and monetary policies, regulatory changes or negative investor 
perceptions of Citi’s creditworthiness, unexpected increases in cash or 
collateral requirements and the inability to monetize available liquidity 
resources, whether due to the pandemic or otherwise. Citi competes with 
other banks and financial institutions for both institutional and consumer 
deposits, which represent Citi’s most stable and lowest cost source of 
long-term funding. The competition for deposits has continued to increase 
in recent years, including, among others, as a result of online banks and 
digital banking. Furthermore, although Citi has had robust deposit growth 
since the onset of the pandemic, it remains unclear how “sticky” (likely 
to remain at Citi) those deposits may be, particularly in a less monetarily 
accommodative environment.

Moreover, Citi’s costs to obtain and access secured funding and 
long-term unsecured funding are directly related to its credit spreads 
and changes in interest and currency exchange rates. Changes in credit 
spreads are driven by both external market factors and factors specific to 
Citi, such as negative views by investors of the financial services industry 
or Citi’s financial prospects, and can be highly volatile. For additional 
information on Citi’s primary sources of funding, see “Managing Global 
Risk—Liquidity Risk” below.

Citi’s ability to obtain funding may be impaired and its cost of funding 
could increase if other market participants are seeking to access the markets 
at the same time, or if market appetite declines, as is likely to occur in a 
liquidity stress event or other market crisis. A sudden drop in market liquidity 
could also cause a temporary or lengthier dislocation of underwriting and 
capital markets activity. In addition, clearing organizations, central banks, 
clients and financial institutions with which Citi interacts may exercise the 
right to require additional collateral based on their perceptions or the market 
conditions, which could further impair Citi’s access to and cost of funding.
In addition, as a holding company, Citi relies on interest, dividends, 
distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividends 
as well as to satisfy its debt and other obligations. Several of Citi’s U.S. and 
non-U.S. subsidiaries are or may be subject to capital adequacy or other 
liquidity, regulatory or contractual restrictions on their ability to provide 
such payments, including any local regulatory stress test requirements. 
Citi’s broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on 
their ability to lend or transact with affiliates, as well as restrictions on their 
ability to use funds deposited with them in brokerage or bank accounts to 
fund their businesses. Limitations on the payments that Citi receives from 
its subsidiaries could also impact its liquidity. A bank holding company is 

52

required by law to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for its 
subsidiary banks. As a result, the FRB may require Citi to commit resources 
to its subsidiary banks even if doing so is not otherwise in the interests of Citi 
or its shareholders or creditors, reducing the amount of funds available to 
meet its obligations. In addition, in the event of a subsidiary’s liquidation or 
reorganization, Citi’s right to participate in a distribution of such subsidiary’s 
assets is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors.

The Credit Rating Agencies Continuously Review the Credit 
Ratings of Citi and Certain of Its Subsidiaries, and a Ratings 
Downgrade Could Have a Negative Impact on Citi’s Funding 
and Liquidity Due to Reduced Funding Capacity and 
Increased Funding Costs, Including Derivatives Triggers That 
Could Require Cash Obligations or Collateral Requirements.
The credit rating agencies, such as Fitch, Moody’s and S&P Global Ratings, 
continuously evaluate Citi and certain of its subsidiaries. Their ratings of Citi 
and its more significant subsidiaries’ long-term/ senior debt and short-term/
commercial paper are based on a number of factors, including standalone 
financial strength, as well as factors that are not entirely within the 
control of Citi and its subsidiaries, such as the agencies’ proprietary rating 
methodologies and assumptions, and conditions affecting the financial 
services industry and markets generally.

Citi and its subsidiaries may not be able to maintain their current 

respective ratings. A ratings downgrade could negatively impact Citi’s ability 
to access the capital markets and other sources of funds as well as the costs of 
those funds, and its ability to maintain certain deposits. A ratings downgrade 
could also have a negative impact on Citi’s funding and liquidity due to 
reduced funding capacity and the impact from derivative triggers, which 
could require Citi to meet cash obligations and collateral requirements. 
In addition, a ratings downgrade could have a negative impact on other 
funding sources such as secured financing and other margined transactions 
for which there may be no explicit triggers, and on contractual provisions 
and other credit requirements of Citi’s counterparties and clients that may 
contain minimum ratings thresholds in order for Citi to hold third-party 
funds. Some entities could have ratings limitations on their permissible 
counterparties, of which Citi may or may not be aware.

Furthermore, a credit ratings downgrade could have impacts that may 

not be currently known to Citi or are not possible to quantify. Certain of 
Citi’s corporate customers and trading counterparties, among other clients, 
could re-evaluate their business relationships with Citi and limit the trading 
of certain contracts or market instruments with Citi in response to ratings 
downgrades. Changes in customer and counterparty behavior could impact 
not only Citi’s funding and liquidity but also the results of operations of 
certain Citi businesses. For additional information on the potential impact 
of a reduction in Citi’s or Citibank’s credit ratings, see “Managing Global 
Risk—Liquidity Risk” below.

COMPLIANCE RISKS
Ongoing Interpretation and Implementation of Regulatory 
and Legislative Requirements and Changes and Heightened 
Regulatory Scrutiny and Expectations in the U.S. and Globally 
Have Increased Citi’s Compliance, Regulatory and Other Risks 
and Costs.
Citi is continually required to interpret and implement extensive and 
frequently changing regulatory and legislative requirements in the U.S. 
and other jurisdictions in which it does business, resulting in substantial 
compliance, regulatory and other risks and costs. In addition, there are 
heightened regulatory scrutiny and expectations in the U.S. and globally 
for large financial institutions, as well as their employees and agents, with 
respect to governance, infrastructure, data and risk management practices 
and controls. These requirements and expectations also include, among 
other things, those related to customer and client protection, market 
practices, anti-money laundering and sanctions. A failure to comply with 
these requirements and expectations or resolve any identified deficiencies 
could result in increased regulatory oversight and restrictions, enforcement 
proceedings, penalties and fines (for additional information, see the legal 
and regulatory proceedings risk factor below).

Over the past several years, Citi has been required to implement a 
significant number of regulatory and legislative changes across all of 
its businesses and functions, and these changes continue. The changes 
themselves may be complex and subject to interpretation, and will 
require continued investments in Citi’s global operations and technology 
solutions. In some cases, Citi’s implementation of a regulatory or legislative 
requirement is occurring simultaneously with changing or conflicting 
regulatory guidance, legal challenges or legislative action to modify or repeal 
existing rules or enact new rules. Moreover, in some cases, there have been 
entirely new regulatory or legislative requirements or regimes, resulting in 
large volumes of regulation and potential uncertainty regarding regulatory 
expectations for compliance.

Examples of regulatory or legislative changes that have resulted in 
increased compliance risks and costs include (i) various laws relating to 
the limitation of cross-border data movement and/or collection and use 
of customer information, including data localization and protection and 
privacy laws, which also can conflict with or increase compliance complexity 
with respect to other laws, including anti-money laundering laws; (ii) the 
FRB’s “total loss absorbing capacity” (TLAC) requirements; and (iii) the 
U.S. banking agencies’ regulatory capital rules and requirements, which 
have continued to evolve (for additional information, see the capital return 
risk factor and “Capital Resources” above). In addition, the U.S. banking 
agencies have prioritized issues of social, economic and racial justice, and 
are in the process of considering ways in which these issues can be mitigated, 
including through rulemaking, supervision and other means.

Increased and ongoing compliance and regulatory requirements, 

uncertainties, scrutiny and expectations have resulted in higher compliance 
costs for Citi, in part due to an increase in risk, regulatory and compliance 
staff over the last several years. Extensive and changing compliance 

53

requirements can also result in increased reputational and legal risks for Citi, 
as failure to comply with regulations and requirements, or failure to comply 
with regulatory expectations, can result in enforcement and/or regulatory 
proceedings, penalties and fines.

Citi Is Subject to Extensive Legal and Regulatory Proceedings, 
Examinations, Investigations, Consent Orders and Related 
Compliance Efforts and Other Inquiries That Could Result in 
Significant Monetary Penalties, Supervisory or Enforcement 
Orders, Business Restrictions, Limitations on Dividends, 
Changes to Directors and/or Officers and Collateral 
Consequences Arising from Such Outcomes.
At any given time, Citi is a party to a significant number of legal and 
regulatory proceedings and is subject to numerous governmental and 
regulatory examinations, investigations, consent orders and related 
compliance efforts, and other inquiries. Citi can also be subject to 
enforcement proceedings not only because of violations of laws and 
regulations, but also due to failures, as determined by its regulators, to have 
adequate policies and procedures, or to remedy deficiencies on a timely basis.
The October 2020 FRB and OCC consent orders require Citigroup and 
Citibank to implement targeted action plans and quarterly progress reports 
detailing the results and status of improvements relating principally 
to various aspects of enterprise-wide risk management, compliance, 
data quality management and governance and internal controls. These 
improvements will result in continued significant investments by Citi during 
2022 and beyond, as an essential part of Citi’s broader transformation efforts 
to enhance its infrastructure, governance, processes and risk and controls.
Although there are no restrictions on Citi’s ability to serve its clients, 
the OCC consent order requires Citibank to obtain prior approval of any 
significant new acquisition, including any portfolio or business acquisition, 
excluding ordinary course transactions. Moreover, the OCC consent order 
provides that the OCC has the right to assess future civil money penalties 
or take other supervisory and/or enforcement actions, including where the 
OCC determines Citibank has not made sufficient and sustainable progress 
to address the required improvements. Such actions by the OCC could 
include imposing business restrictions, including possible limitations on 
the declaration or payment of dividends and changes in directors and/or 
senior executive officers. More generally, the OCC and/or the FRB could take 
additional enforcement or other actions if the regulatory agency believes 
that Citi has not met regulatory expectations regarding compliance with the 
consent orders. For additional information regarding the consent orders, see 
“Citi’s Consent Order Compliance” above.

The global judicial, regulatory and political environment has generally 

been challenging for large financial institutions. The complexity of the 
federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes in the U.S., coupled 
with the global scope of Citi’s operations, also means that a single event 
or issue may give rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and 
regulatory proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies and 
authorities in the U.S. or by multiple regulators and other governmental 
entities in different jurisdictions, as well as multiple civil litigation claims in 
multiple jurisdictions.

U.S. and non-U.S. regulators have been increasingly focused on “conduct 
risk,” a term used to describe the risks associated with behavior by employees 
and agents, including third parties, that could harm clients, customers, 
employees or the integrity of the markets, such as improperly creating, 
selling, marketing or managing products and services or improper incentive 
compensation programs with respect thereto, failures to safeguard a party’s 
personal information, or failures to identify and manage conflicts of interest. 
In addition to the greater focus on conduct risk, the general heightened 
scrutiny and expectations from regulators could lead to investigations and 
other inquiries, as well as remediation requirements, more regulatory or 
other enforcement proceedings, civil litigation and higher compliance and 
other risks and costs.

Further, while Citi takes numerous steps to prevent and detect conduct 
by employees and agents that could potentially harm clients, customers, 
employees or the integrity of the markets, such behavior may not always be 
deterred or prevented. Banking regulators have also focused on the overall 
culture of financial services firms, including Citi.

In addition to regulatory restrictions or structural changes that could 
result from perceived deficiencies in Citi’s culture, such focus could also 
lead to additional regulatory proceedings. Furthermore, the severity of 
the remedies sought in legal and regulatory proceedings to which Citi is 
subject has remained elevated. U.S. and certain non-U.S. governmental 
entities have increasingly brought criminal actions against, or have sought 
criminal convictions from, financial institutions and individual employees, 
and criminal prosecutors in the U.S. have increasingly sought and 
obtained criminal guilty pleas or deferred prosecution agreements against 
corporate entities and individuals and other criminal sanctions for those 
institutions and individuals. These types of actions by U.S. and international 
governmental entities may, in the future, have significant collateral 
consequences for a financial institution, including loss of customers and 
business, and the inability to offer certain products or services and/or operate 
certain businesses. Citi may be required to accept or be subject to similar 
types of criminal remedies, consent orders, sanctions, substantial fines and 
penalties, remediation and other financial costs or other requirements in the 
future, including for matters or practices not yet known to Citi, any of which 
could materially and negatively affect Citi’s businesses, business practices, 
financial condition or results of operations, require material changes in Citi’s 
operations or cause Citi reputational harm.

Further, many large claims—both private civil and regulatory—asserted 

against Citi are highly complex, slow to develop and may involve novel 
or untested legal theories. The outcome of such proceedings is difficult to 
predict or estimate until late in the proceedings. Although Citi establishes 
accruals for its legal and regulatory matters according to accounting 
requirements, Citi’s estimates of, and changes to, these accruals involve 
significant judgment and may be subject to significant uncertainty, and 
the amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may 
be substantially higher than the amounts accrued (see the incorrect 
assumptions or estimates risk factor above). In addition, certain settlements 
are subject to court approval and may not be approved.

54

OTHER RISKS
Citi’s Presence in the Emerging Markets Subjects It to Various 
Risks as well as Increased Compliance and Regulatory Risks 
and Costs.
During 2021, emerging markets revenues accounted for approximately 35% 
of Citi’s total revenues (Citi generally defines emerging markets as countries 
in Latin America, Asia (other than Japan, Australia and New Zealand), and 
central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa in EMEA).

Although Citi continues to pursue its target client strategy, Citi’s presence 

in the emerging markets subjects it to various risks, such as limitations or 
unavailability of hedges on foreign investments; foreign currency volatility, 
including devaluations, sovereign volatility, election outcomes, regulatory 
changes and political events; foreign exchange controls, including inability 
to access indirect foreign exchange mechanisms; macroeconomic volatility 
and disruptions, including with respect to commodity prices; limitations on 
foreign investment; sociopolitical instability (including from hyperinflation); 
fraud; nationalization or loss of licenses; business restrictions; sanctions or 
asset freezes; potential criminal charges; closure of branches or subsidiaries; 
and confiscation of assets, whether related to geopolitical conflicts or 
otherwise; and these risks can be exacerbated in the event of a deterioration 
in relationships between the U.S. and an emerging market country. For 
example, Citi operates in several countries that have, or have had in the past, 
strict capital and currency controls, such as Argentina, that limit its ability 
to convert local currency into U.S. dollars and/or transfer funds outside of 
those countries. Among other things, Citi faces a risk of devaluation on its 
unhedged Argentine peso-denominated assets, which continue to increase 
(for further information on this and other risks, see “Managing Global 
Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—Argentina” below).

Moreover, if the economic situation in an emerging markets country in 
which Citi operates were to deteriorate below a certain level, U.S. regulators 
may impose mandatory loan loss or other reserve requirements on Citi, 
which would increase its credit costs and decrease its earnings (for further 
information, see “Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—
Argentina” below).

In addition, political turmoil and instability have occurred in various 

regions and emerging market countries across the globe which have 
required, and may continue to require, management time and attention 
and other resources (such as monitoring the impact of sanctions on certain 
emerging markets economies as well as impacting Citi’s businesses and 
results of operations in affected countries).

Climate Change Could Have a Negative Impact on Citi’s Results 
of Operations and Financial Condition.
Citi operates in countries, states and regions in which many of its businesses, 
and the activities of many of its customers and clients, are exposed to 
the adverse impacts of climate change, as well as uncertainties related to 
the transition to a low-carbon economy. Climate change presents both 
immediate and long-term risks to Citi and its customers and clients, with the 
risks expected to increase over time.

Climate risks can arise from both physical risks (those risks related to 
the physical effects of climate change) and transition risks (risks related to 
regulatory, compliance, technological, stakeholder and legal changes from 
a transition to a low-carbon economy). The physical and transition risks 
can manifest themselves differently across Citi’s risk categories in the short, 
medium and long terms.

The physical risk from climate change could result from increased 
frequency and/or severity of adverse weather events. For example, adverse 
weather events could damage or destroy Citi’s or its counterparties’ properties 
and other assets and disrupt operations, making it more difficult for 
counterparties to repay their obligations, whether due to reduced profitability, 
asset devaluations or otherwise. These events could also increase the volatility 
in financial markets affecting Citi’s trading businesses and increase its 
counterparty exposures and other financial risks, which may result in lower 
revenues and higher cost of credit.

Transition risks may arise from changes in regulations or market 

preferences toward a low-carbon economy, which in turn could have negative 
impacts on asset values, results of operations or the reputations of Citi and 
its customers and clients. For example, Citi’s corporate credit exposures 
include oil and gas, power and other industries that may experience reduced 
demand for carbon-intensive products due to the transition to a low-carbon 
economy. Moreover, U.S. and non-U.S. banking regulators and others are 
increasingly focusing on the issue of climate risk at financial institutions, 
both directly and with respect to their clients. As an example, on December 
16, 2021, the OCC requested feedback on draft principles designed to support 
the identification and management of climate-related financial risks at 
institutions with more than $100 billion in total consolidated assets.

Even as regulators begin to mandate additional disclosure of climate-
related information by companies across sectors, there may continue to be a 
lack of information for more robust climate-related risk analyses. Third party 
exposures to climate-related risks and other data generally are limited in 
availability and variable in quality. Modeling capabilities to analyze climate-
related risks and interconnections are improving but remain incomplete. 
Legislative or regulatory uncertainties and changes regarding climate-related 
risk management and disclosures are likely to result in higher regulatory, 
compliance, credit, reputational and other risks and costs (for additional 
information, see the ongoing regulatory and legislative uncertainties and 
changes risk factor above). In addition, Citi could face increased regulatory, 
reputational and legal scrutiny as a result of its climate risk, sustainability 
and other ESG related commitments.

For information on Citi’s climate and other sustainability initiatives, see 
“Sustainability and Other ESG Matters” below. For additional information 
on Citi’s management of climate risk, see “Managing Global Risk—Other 
Risks—Climate Risk” below.

55

The Transition Away from and Discontinuance of the London 
Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and Any Other Interest Rate 
Benchmark Could Have Adverse Consequences for Market 
Participants, Including Citi.
For decades, LIBOR and other rates or indices deemed to be benchmarks 
have been widely used across financial products and markets globally. These 
benchmarks have been the subject of ongoing national and international 
regulatory scrutiny and reform, resulting in regulators generally expecting 
or requiring banks, including Citi, to cease entering into new contracts that 
reference USD LIBOR as a benchmark by December 31, 2021. The LIBOR 
administrator ceased publication of non-USD LIBOR and one-week and 
two-month USD LIBOR on a representative basis on December 31, 2021, with 
plans to cease publication of all other USD LIBOR tenors on June 30, 2023. 
As a result, Citi ceased entering into new contracts referencing USD LIBOR 
as of January 1, 2022, other than for limited purposes as permitted by 
regulatory guidance.

LIBOR and other benchmarks have been used in a substantial number 

of Citi’s outstanding securities and products, including, among others, 
derivatives, corporate loans, commercial and residential mortgages, credit 
cards, securitized products and other structured securities. Despite ongoing 
actions to prepare for the transition away from LIBOR (see “Managing 
Global Risk—Other Risks—LIBOR Transition Risk” below), market 
participants, including Citi, may not be adequately prepared for uncertainties 
associated with these benchmarks’ discontinuance or, as necessary, be 
able to successfully modify their outstanding contracts or products that 
reference these benchmarks. For example, the transition away from and 
discontinuance of LIBOR or any other benchmark rate presents various 
uncertainties and operational, legal, reputational or compliance, financial 
and other risks and challenges to holders of these contracts and products, 
as well as financial markets and institutions, including Citi. These include, 
among others, the pricing, liquidity, observability, value of, return on and 
market for financial instruments and contracts that reference LIBOR or any 
other benchmark rate.

While Citi has adopted alternative reference rates for new contracts to 
replace these outgoing benchmarks, in some instances, it is possible that 
the characteristics of these new rates may not be sufficiently similar to, 
or produce the economic equivalent of, the benchmark rates that they 
are intended to replace. Alternative reference rates, such as the Secured 
Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), are calculated using components 
different from those used in the calculation of LIBOR and may fluctuate 
differently than, and not be representative of, LIBOR. In order to compensate 
for these differences, certain of Citi’s financial instruments and commercial 
agreements allow for a benchmark replacement adjustment. However, 
there can be no assurance that any benchmark replacement adjustment 
will be sufficient to produce the economic equivalent of LIBOR, either 
at the benchmark replacement date or over the life of such instruments 
and agreements.

Further, investors, counterparties and other market participants may not 

consider the new alternative rates to be a suitable substitute or successor 
for all of the purposes for which these benchmarks have historically been 

used (including, without limitation, as a representation of the unsecured 
short-term funding costs of banks), which may, in turn, reduce their 
market acceptance. Any failure of the alternative rates to gain broad market 
acceptance could adversely affect market demand for Citi’s products or 
securities linked to such alternative rates and thus market prices of such 
instruments. As part of its transition, Citi is relying or has relied on guidance 
provided by the accounting standard setters related to the transition away 
from LIBOR. In the event that such guidance is insufficient or otherwise 
unable to be implemented as intended, LIBOR transition could disrupt Citi’s 
hedge accounting relationships and/or lead to increased costs in connection 
with determining whether contract amendments result in a modification or 
an extinguishment from an accounting perspective. Changes in observability 
of the alternative reference rates could impact the fair value hierarchy 
classification of financial instruments and contracts.

Moreover, the LIBOR transition presents challenges related to contractual 

mechanics of existing financial instruments and contracts that reference 
such benchmarks that mature after discontinuance of the relevant 
benchmark. Certain of these legacy instruments and contracts do not provide 
for fallbacks to alternative reference rates, which makes it unclear what the 
applicable future replacement benchmark rates and associated payments 
might be after the current benchmark’s cessation. Citi may not be able 
to amend certain instruments and contracts due to an inability to obtain 
sufficient levels of consent from counterparties or security holders. Although 
this will depend on the precise contractual terms of the instrument, such 
consent requirements are often conditions of securities, such as floating 
rate notes.

Even if the instruments and contracts provide for a transition to an 

alternative reference rate, the new rate may, particularly in times of financial 
stress, significantly differ from the prior rates. As a result, Citi may need 
to consider proactively addressing any contractual uncertainties or rate 
differences in such instruments and contracts, which would likely be both 
time consuming and costly, and may not ultimately be successful. While 
statutory solutions have been enacted in certain jurisdictions to address 
these contractual concerns (for example, the State of New York and the EU), 
the availability and effectiveness of these statutory mechanisms to cover 
all impacted financial instruments and products to which Citi is a party 
is uncertain.

In addition, the transition away from and discontinuance of LIBOR and 
other benchmark rates have subjected financial institutions, including Citi, 
to heightened scrutiny from regulators. Failure to successfully transition 
away from LIBOR and other benchmark rates could result in adverse 
regulatory actions, disputes, including potential litigation involving holders 
of outstanding products and contracts that reference LIBOR, and other 
benchmark rates and reputational harm to Citi. Citi may also need to further 
invest in and develop internal systems and infrastructure to transition to 
alternative benchmark rates to manage its businesses and support its clients.

SUSTAINABILITY AND OTHER 
ESG MATTERS

Introduction
Citi has progressively developed its understanding of environmental, social 
and governance (ESG) issues for more than 20 years and has a demonstrated 
record of ESG progress, including participating in the creation and adoption 
of ESG-related principles and standards. This section summarizes some of 
Citi’s key ESG initiatives, including its Sustainable Progress Strategy and net 
zero and Action for Racial Equity commitments.

In January 2022, Citi published its 2021 Task Force on Climate-Related 

Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Report to provide its stakeholders with 
information on Citi’s continued progress to address climate risk and to 
fulfill its commitment to publish an initial net zero plan within one year 
of announcing the net zero commitment. This represents Citi’s fourth 
TCFD Report.

For information regarding Citi’s management of climate risk, see 

“Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—Climate Risk” below.

ESG and Climate-Related Governance

ESG Governance
Citi’s Board of Directors (Board) provides oversight of Citi’s management 
activities to ensure responsible business practices (for additional information, 
see “Managing Global Risk—Risk Governance” below). For example, 
the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee of the Board 
oversees many of Citi’s ESG activities, including reviewing Citi’s policies 
and programs for environmental and social sustainability, climate change, 
human rights, diversity and other ESG issues, as well as advising on 
engagement with external stakeholders.

The Risk Management Committee of the Board provides oversight of Citi’s 

Independent Risk Management function and reviews Citi’s risk policies and 
frameworks, including receiving climate risk-related updates.

In 2021, Citi formed a Global ESG Council consisting of senior members 

of its management in order to provide enhanced oversight of Citi’s ESG 
goals and activities. In addition, a number of teams and senior managers 
contribute to the oversight of different areas such as sustainability; 
community investing; talent and diversity; ethics and business practices; 
and remuneration.

Climate Change Governance
Citi’s oversight of climate risk has continued to evolve with its expanding 
climate commitments. In 2021, Citi established its ESG Council, expanded 
its Climate Risk team and enhanced its climate risk and net zero-related 
governance through creation of a Net Zero Task Force. The Task Force, led by 
Citi’s Chief Sustainability Officer and including leaders from various business 
units, was established to support the development and launch of Citi’s net 
zero plan.

Key ESG Initiatives

Sustainable Progress Strategy
Citi’s Sustainable Progress Strategy is summarized in its Environmental 
and Social Policy Framework. The three pillars of the strategy each 
have climate-related elements and serve as the foundation for Citi’s 
climate commitments.

•  The first pillar, “Low-Carbon Transition,” focuses on financing and 
facilitating low-carbon solutions and supporting Citi’s clients in their 
decarbonization and transition strategies.

•  The second pillar, “Climate Risk,” focuses on Citi’s efforts to measure, 
manage and reduce the climate risk and impact of its client portfolio. 
Areas of activity include, portfolio analysis and stakeholder engagement as 
well as enhancing TCFD implementation and disclosure.

•  The third pillar, “Sustainable Operations,” focuses on Citi’s efforts to 
reduce the environmental footprint of its facilities and strengthen its 
sustainability culture. This includes minimizing the impact of its global 
operations through operational footprint goals and further integrates 
sustainable practices across all countries in which Citi operates.

Net Zero Emissions by 2050
In March 2021, Citi announced its commitment to achieving net zero 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with its financing by 2050, 
and net zero GHG emissions for its operations by 2030; both are significant 
targets given the size and breadth of Citi’s lending portfolios and businesses. 
Citi made this commitment as part of its ongoing work to reduce its 
climate impact and help address the challenges that climate change poses 
to the global economy and broader society. Citi’s net zero commitment 
demonstrates how identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks 
and opportunities remains a top business priority for Citi.

While many financial institutions, including Citi, face increasing 
public pressure to divest from carbon-intensive sectors, Citi believes it has 
an important role to play in advising and financing the transition to net 
zero, and it plans to work closely with clients in this effort. Citi recognizes 
that large-scale, rapid divestment could result in an abrupt and disorderly 
transition to a low-carbon economy, creating both economic and social 
upheaval on a global scale. Citi believes that an orderly, responsible and 
equitable transition, which accounts for the immediate economic needs 
of communities, workers, environmental justice and broader economic 
development concerns, is essential for the retention of political and social 
support to move to a low-carbon economy.

Citi’s 2021 TCFD Report discusses its initial 2050 net zero plan, including 

2030 emissions targets for its Energy and Power loan portfolios that 
were developed in line with the Net Zero Banking Alliance Guidelines for 
Climate Target Setting for Banks. Citi’s net zero plan incorporates a twofold 
approach: (i) assessment of climate-related factors affecting its clients, and 
(ii) engagement to understand their transition opportunities.

Citi’s net zero approach includes the following areas of activity:

•  Client Transition Assessment, Advisory and Finance: Seek to 

understand clients’ GHG emissions and work with them to develop their 
transition plans and advise on capacity building

•  Clean Tech Finance: Support clients and expedite the commercialization 
and adoption of climate technology globally through transition and 
environmental finance as well as public-private partnerships
•  Public Policy Engagement: Support enabling public policy and 

regulation in the U.S. and other countries, including through trade 
associations and other industry groups

57

In line with Citi’s continued commitment to expand access to banking 
products and services that can help advance economic progress—especially 
for underbanked and unbanked communities—on February 24, 2022, Citi 
announced plans to eliminate overdraft fees, returned item fees and overdraft 
protection fees by mid 2022. In addition to eliminating these fees, Citi will 
continue to offer a robust suite of free overdraft protection services for its 
consumers. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details of 
Citi’s Commissions and fees revenues.

The 2021 TCFD Report and any other ESG-related reports and 
information included elsewhere on Citi’s investor relations website are 
not incorporated by reference into, and do not form any part of this 
2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

•  Risk Management: Assess climate risk exposure across Citi’s lending 
portfolios and review client carbon reduction progress, with ongoing 
review and refining of Citi’s ESRM Policy as needed

•  Portfolio Management: Active portfolio management to align with 

net zero targets, including considerations of transition measures taken 
by clients

The 2050 net zero commitment includes the following framework, 

delineating the key areas required to achieve its commitment:

•  Calculate Emissions: Calculate baseline financed emissions for each 

carbon-intensive sector

•  Transition Pathway: Identify the appropriate climate scenario 

transition pathway

•  Target Setting: Establish emissions reduction targets for 2030 and beyond
•  Implementation Strategy: Engage with and assess clients to determine 

transition opportunities

•  External Engagement: Solicit feedback from clients, investors and other 
stakeholders, as the work continues to evolve and the parties collectively 
define net zero for the banking sector

In 2021, Citi continued to expand its participation in the financial 
industry’s net zero leadership initiatives. Citi is a member of key industry 
initiatives that enhance its understanding of climate-related issues, improve 
its access to data and promote efficient communication and coordination 
across various climate efforts. These initiatives include the Partnership 
for Carbon Accounting Financials, the Net Zero Banking Alliance and the 
Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero.

Action for Racial Equity
Effectively responding to the needs of communities of color in the U.S. 
represents a strategic imperative for the private sector. A wide range of data 
and studies have found that many major gaps in economic opportunity, 
education, income, housing and wealth run along racial lines, particularly 
between Black and white households. These gaps have not only had 
implications for Black Americans and other people of color but the broader 
economy as well.

Accordingly, in September 2020, Citi and the Citi Foundation announced 
Action for Racial Equity to help provide greater access to banking and credit 
in communities of color, increase investment in Black-owned businesses, 
expand affordable housing and homeownership among Black Americans 
and advance anti-racist practices within Citi and across the financial services 
industry. As part of Action for Racial Equity, Citi and the Citi Foundation 
have invested more than $1 billion in strategic initiatives to help close the 
racial wealth gap and increase economic mobility in the U.S. Action for 
Racial Equity builds on Citi’s longstanding focus on advancing financial 
inclusion and economic opportunity for communities of color in the U.S. and 
accelerates its efforts in a time of increased calls for racial equity and shifting 
population demographics in a changing economy.

HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
AND MANAGEMENT

Attracting and retaining a highly qualified and motivated workforce is a 
strategic priority for Citi. Citi seeks to enhance the competitive strength of its 
workforce through the following efforts:

•  Continuous innovation in recruiting, training, compensation, promotion 

and engagement of colleagues.

•  Actively seeking and listening to diverse perspectives at all levels of the 

organization.

•  Optimizing transparency concerning workforce goals, to promote 

accountability, credibility and effectiveness in achieving those goals.

Workforce Size and Distribution
As of December 31, 2021, Citi employed approximately 223,400 colleagues in nearly 100 countries. The Company’s workforce is constantly evolving and 
developing, benefiting from a strong mix of internal and external hiring into new and existing positions. In 2021, Citi welcomed 46,907 new colleagues in 
addition to the roles filled by colleagues through internal mobility. The following table shows the geographic distribution of those colleagues by segment, 
region and gender:

(2)  Part-time colleagues represented less than 1.5% of Citi’s global workforce.

Board Oversight
Citi devotes substantial resources to managing its workforce, guided by a 
culture of accountability and excellence. Citigroup’s Board of Directors (the 
Board) provides strategic oversight and direction to management regarding 
workforce policies and includes many members with experience in overseeing 
workforce issues.

In addition, the Board’s Personnel and Compensation Committee 
regularly reviews management’s achievements against human capital 
management goals, such as addressing representation of women and U.S. 
minorities in assistant vice president (AVP) to managing director (MD) levels, 
as well as talent recruitment and development initiatives.

The Board works with the Nomination, Governance and Public 
Affairs Committee to evaluate potential successors to the Chief Executive 
Officer (CEO). With respect to regular succession of the CEO and senior 
management, Citi’s Board evaluates internal, and, when appropriate, 
external candidates. To find external candidates, Citi seeks input from 
members of the Board, senior management and recruiting firms. To 
develop internal candidates, Citi engages in a number of practices, formal 
and informal, designed to familiarize the Board with Citi’s talent pool. 
The formal process involves an annual talent review conducted by senior 
management at which the Board studies the most promising members of 
senior management. The Board learns about each person’s experience, skills, 
areas of expertise, accomplishments, goals and risk and control assessments. 
This review is conducted at a regularly scheduled Board meeting on an 
annual basis.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Citigroup’s Board is committed to ensuring that the Board and Citi’s 
Executive Management Team (see “Managing Global Risk—Risk 
Governance” below) are composed of individuals whose backgrounds reflect 
the diversity represented by Citi’s employees, customers and stakeholders. In 
addition, over the past several years, Citi has increased efforts to diversify its 
workforce, including, among other things, taking actions with respect to pay 
equity, representation goals and use of diverse slates in recruiting.

Pay Equity
Citi has focused on measuring and addressing pay equity within 
the organization:

•  In 2018, Citi was the first major U.S. financial institution to publicly 
release the results of a pay equity review comparing its compensation 
of women to men and U.S. minorities to U.S. non-minorities. Since 
2018, Citi has continued to be transparent about pay equity, including 
disclosing its unadjusted or “raw” pay gap for both women and 
U.S. minorities.

•  Citi’s 2021 pay equity review determined that, on an adjusted basis, 

women globally are paid on average more than 99% of what men are 
paid at Citi. In addition, the review determined there was no statistically 
significant difference in adjusted compensation between U.S. minorities 
and non-minorities. Following the review, appropriate pay adjustments 
were made as part of Citi’s 2021 compensation cycle.

59

•  Citi’s 2021 raw gap analysis showed that the median pay for women 
globally is 74% of the median for men, similar to 2020, and up from 
73% in 2019 and 71% in 2018. The median pay for U.S. minorities is 
more than 96% of the median for non-minorities, which is up from 
just under 94% in 2020, 94% in 2019 and 93% in 2018.

Representation Goals
Increasing the number of women globally and U.S. Black employees into 
senior AVP to MD levels will position Citi to further close the raw pay gap 
and increase the diversity of the Company. At the AVP to MD levels, Citi 
established representation goals of 40% for women globally and 8% for 
U.S. Black employees by the end of 2021. As of December 31, 2021, Citi 
exceeded its goals for AVP to MD levels for women globally (at 40.6%) and 
U.S. Black employees (at 8.1%).

Citi is the first major Wall Street bank to participate in Management 

Leadership for Tomorrow’s Black Equity at Work Certification, to help 
measure internal progress toward Black equity in the workplace.

In addition, consistent with its ongoing support of measurement and 
transparency, Citi will conduct a third-party racial equity audit to help assess 
the true impact of Citi’s Action for Racial Equity initiatives (for additional 
information, see “Sustainability and Other ESG Matters—Action for Racial 
Equity” above).

Diverse Slates in Recruitment
In 2021, Citi expanded the use of diverse slates in its recruiting efforts to have 
at least two women or U.S. minorities interview for U.S.-based roles and at 
least two women interview for global hire roles at the AVP to MD levels.

Since implementation, Citi has increased the share of diverse candidates 
on slates by 26% and more than doubled the total number of diverse slates 
between March and December 2021. Candidate slates were as follows:

•  74.4% of roles included a diverse slate with at least two women globally 

and/or U.S. underrepresented minorities for U.S. hires; and

•  92.2% of roles included a diverse slate with at least one woman globally 
and/or U.S. underrepresented minority for U.S. hires compared to 86% 
in 2020.

In 2021, women representation in Citi’s full-time global campus 

programs surpassed its goal of 50%, increasing to 51% from 49% in 2020. In 
addition, Black and Hispanic/Latino representation within Citi’s full-time 
U.S. campus programs increased to 28% from 24% in 2020.

Workforce Development
Citi highly values a workplace environment where colleagues can bring 
their authentic selves to work and where diverse perspectives and ideas are 
embraced. Citi encourages career growth and development by offering broad 
and diverse opportunities to colleagues. Highlights of these opportunities 
include the following:

•  Citi provides a range of internal development and rotational programs to 
colleagues at all levels, including various training programs and events 
to assist high-performing colleagues in building the skills needed to 
transition to manager and supervisory roles.

•  Citi has a focus on internal talent development and aims to provide 

colleagues with career growth opportunities, with 37% of open positions 
filled internally in 2021. These opportunities are particularly important 
as Citi focuses on providing career paths for its internal talent base as 
part of its efforts to increase organic growth and promotions within 
the organization.

Moreover, in 2021, a diverse group of human resources and business 

stakeholders collaborated to provide input on the current state and 
target future state for promotions at Citi. Their analysis resulted in the 
identification of opportunities for improvement to create greater transparency 
and alignment of the promotion process across Citi’s businesses, functions 
and regions.

Wellness
During the past two years, the pandemic’s impact has been substantial on 
the mental and physical health of Citi colleagues and their families. As the 
Company transforms and the future of work evolves, colleague wellness is 
a central component of Citi’s focus. Coming out of the pandemic, Citi has 
announced three working models: colleagues will be designated as hybrid, 
resident or remote, based on job-specific requirements.

As colleagues pivoted to remote work during their respective country 
lockdowns, Citi’s health plans also expanded to keep colleagues at home 
and safe. In the U.S., Citi offered free virtual care visits, home delivery of 
prescriptions, enhanced bereavement leave and no-cost COVID testing.

In addition to providing access to COVID vaccinations, which included 
several onsite locations in Asia and the U.S., Citi organized drive-through 
flu vaccination programs in the U.S. for thousands of colleagues and 
their family members. All colleagues globally were provided time off for 
vaccinations and boosters and to recover from any side effects, if needed.

To support the ongoing health of its workforce, on October 28, 2021 Citi 
announced a COVID-19 vaccination policy requiring all U.S. colleagues and 
new hires to be fully vaccinated or receive an approved accommodation 
or state-permitted exemption, as a condition of employment. As of the 
January 14, 2022 deadline, over 99% of U.S. colleagues were in compliance 
with the vaccine policy.

Citi also took actions to support the emotional well-being of its colleagues. 

Citi significantly enhanced free mental well-being programs in our largest 
region by doubling the number of free counseling sessions for colleagues and 
their family members and adding real-time text, video and message-based 
counseling. Citi also debuted a new online tool so that all colleagues 
around the globe could easily find their local Employee Assistance programs 
and resources. Citi also expanded live, town hall-style mental well-being 
programming to include targeted events with subject matter experts aimed at 
parents, caregivers and other at-risk groups.

Citi’s wellness vision is not simply a reaction to its external environment. 

It has consistently been about nurturing colleagues and their families, 
however their families are grown. Citi continues to broaden gender 
affirmation medical coverage and incorporate it in its basic medical plan 
coverage around the world. Citi also enhanced its fertility coverage and 
support. In North America, Citi’s new Adoption and Surrogacy Assistance 
Program provides reimbursement to help with certain expenses in the 
adoption of a child or surrogacy parenting arrangement.

60

In early 2020, Citi expanded its Paid Parental Leave Policy to include Citi 
colleagues around the world. At a minimum, all Citi colleagues are eligible 
for 16 weeks of paid pregnancy leave or four weeks of paid parental bonding 
leave. Colleagues working in countries that require leave policies above the 
global minimum continue to maintain even longer periods of paid time off.

workforce, see “Risk Factors” above. For additional information about Citi’s 
human capital management initiatives and goals, see Citi’s upcoming 
2022 proxy statement to be filed with the SEC in March 2022, as well as its

MANAGING GLOBAL RISK

Overview
For Citi, effective risk management is of primary importance to its overall 
operations. Accordingly, Citi’s risk management process has been designed to 
monitor, evaluate and manage the principal risks it assumes in conducting 
its activities. Specifically, the activities that Citi engages in, and the risks 
those activities generate, must be consistent with Citi’s Mission and Value 
Proposition and the key principles that guide it, as well as Citi’s risk appetite. 
As discussed above, Citi is continuing its efforts to comply with the FRB 
and OCC consent orders, relating principally to various aspects of risk 
management, compliance, data quality management and governance, 
and internal controls (see “Citi’s Consent Order Compliance” and “Risk 
Factors—Compliance Risks” above).

Risk management must be built on a foundation of ethical culture. 

Under Citi’s Mission and Value Proposition, which was developed by its senior 
leadership and distributed throughout the Company, Citi strives to serve its 
clients as a trusted partner by responsibly providing financial services that 
enable growth and economic progress while earning and maintaining the 
public’s trust by constantly adhering to the highest ethical standards. As 
such, Citi asks all colleagues to ensure that their decisions pass three tests: 
they are in Citi’s clients’ interests, create economic value and are always 
systemically responsible. In addition, Citi evaluates colleagues’ performance 
against behavioral expectations set out in Citi’s Leadership Principles, which 
were designed in part to effectuate Citi’s Mission and Value Proposition. Other 
culture-related efforts in connection with conduct risk, ethics and leadership, 
escalation and treating customers fairly help Citi to execute its Mission and 
Value Proposition.

Citi has established an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework 
to ensure that all of Citi’s risks are managed appropriately and consistently 
across Citi and at an aggregate, enterprise-wide level. The ERM Framework 
details the principles used to support effective enterprise-wide risk 
management across the end-to-end risk management lifecycle. The ERM 
Framework also provides clarity on the expected activities in relation to risk 
management of the Citigroup Board of Directors (the Board), Citi’s Executive 
Management Team (See “Risk Governance—Executive Management Team” 
below) and employees across the lines of defense. The underlying pillars of 
the framework encompass:

•  Culture—the core principles and behaviors that underpin a strong 
culture of risk awareness, in line with Citi’s Mission and Value 
Proposition, and Leadership Principles;

•  Governance—the committee structure and reporting arrangements that 
support the appropriate oversight of risk management activities at the 
Board and Executive Management Team levels;

•  Risk Management—the end-to-end risk management cycle including 

the identification, measurement, monitoring, controlling and reporting of 
all risks including emerging, growing, idiosyncratic or otherwise material 
risks, and aggregated to an enterprise-wide level; and

•  Enterprise Programs—the key risk management programs performed 
across the risk management lifecycle for all risk categories; these 
programs also outline the specific roles played by each of the lines of 
defense in these processes.

64

Each of these pillars is underpinned by Supporting Capabilities, which 

are the infrastructure, people, technology and data, and modelling and 
analytical capabilities that are in place to enable the execution of the ERM 
Framework.

Citi’s approach to risk management requires that its risk-taking be 
consistent with its risk appetite. Risk appetite is the aggregate type and level 
of risk Citi is willing to take in order to meet its strategic objectives and 
business plan. Citi’s Risk Appetite Framework sets boundaries for risk-taking 
and consists of a set of risk appetite statements as well as the governance 
processes through which the risk appetite is established, communicated, 
cascaded and monitored.

Citi’s risks are generally categorized and summarized as follows:

•  Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the decline in credit quality 
(or downgrade risk) or failure of a borrower, counterparty, third party or 
issuer to honor its financial or contractual obligations.

•  Liquidity risk is the risk that Citi will not be able to efficiently meet both 
expected and unexpected current and future cash flow and collateral 
needs without adversely affecting either daily operations or financial 
conditions of Citi.

•  Market risk (Trading and Non-Trading): Market risk of trading 

portfolios is the risk of loss arising from changes in the value of Citi’s 
assets and liabilities resulting from changes in market variables, such as 
equity and commodity prices or credit spreads. Market risk of non-trading 
portfolios is the risk to current or projected financial condition and 
resilience arising from movements in interest rates and resulting from 
repricing risk, basis risk, yield curve risk and options risk.

•  Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed 

internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. It includes 
legal risk, which is the risk of loss (including litigation costs, settlements 
and regulatory fines) resulting from the failure of Citi to comply with 
laws, regulations, prudent ethical standards and contractual obligations 
in any aspect of Citi’s business, but excludes strategic and reputation risks 
(see below).

•  Compliance risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition 
and resilience arising from violations of laws, rules or regulations, or 
from non-conformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and 
procedures or ethical standards.

•  Reputation risk is the risk to current or projected financial conditions 

and resilience arising from negative public opinion.

•  Strategic risk is the risk of a sustained impact (not episodic impact) to 
Citi’s core strategic objectives as measured by impacts on anticipated 
earnings, market capitalization, or capital, arising from the external 
factors affecting the Company’s operating environment; as well as the 
risks associated with defining the strategy and executing the strategy, 
which are identified, measured and managed as part of the Strategic Risk 
Framework at the Enterprise Level.

 
Citi uses a lines of defense model as a key component of its ERM 

Framework to manage its risks. The lines of defense model brings together 
risk-taking, risk oversight and risk assurance under one umbrella and 
provides an avenue for risk accountability of first line of defense, a construct 
for effective challenge by the second line of defense (Independent Risk 
Management and Independent Compliance Risk Management), and 
empowers independent risk assurance by the third line of defense (Internal 
Audit). In addition, Citi has enterprise support functions that support safety 
and soundness across Citi. Each of the lines of defense and enterprise support 
functions, along with the Board, are empowered to perform relevant risk 
management processes and responsibilities in order to manage Citi’s risks in 
a consistent and effective manner.

First Line of Defense: Front Line Units and Front Line 
Unit Activities
Citi’s first line of defense owns the risks inherent in or arising from their 
business and is responsible for identifying, measuring, monitoring, 
controlling and reporting those risks consistent with Citi’s strategy, Mission 
and Value Proposition, Leadership Principles and risk appetite.

Front line units are responsible and held accountable for managing the 
risks associated with their activities within the boundaries set by independent 
risk management. They are also responsible for designing and implementing 
effective internal controls and maintaining processes for managing their risk 
profile, including through risk mitigation, so that it remains consistent with 
Citi’s established risk appetite.

Front line unit activities are considered part of the first line of defense and 
are subject to the oversight and challenge of independent risk management.
The first line of defense is composed of Citi’s Business Management, 

Regional and Country Management, certain Corporate Functions (Enterprise 
Operations and Technology, Chief Administrative Office, Global Public Affairs, 
Office of the Citibank Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Finance), as well as 
other front line unit activities. Front line units may also include enterprise 
support units and activities—see “Enterprise Support Functions” below.

Second Line of Defense: Independent Risk Management 
Independent risk management units are independent of front line units. 
They are responsible for overseeing the risk-taking activities of the first 
line of defense and challenging the first line of defense in the execution 
of their risk management responsibilities. They are also responsible for 
independently identifying, measuring, monitoring, controlling and reporting 
aggregate risks and for setting standards for the management and oversight 
of risk. Independent risk management is comprised of Independent Risk 
Management (IRM) and Independent Compliance Risk Management 
(ICRM) and are led by chief risk executives (i.e., Chief Risk Officer (CRO) 
and Chief Compliance Officer (CCO)) who have unrestricted access to 
the Citigroup Board of Directors and its Risk Management Committee to 
facilitate the ability to execute their specific responsibilities pertaining to 
escalation to the Citigroup Board of Directors.

Independent Risk Management
The IRM organization sets risk and control standards for the first line of 
defense and actively manages and oversees aggregate credit, market (trading 
and non-trading), liquidity, strategic, operational and reputation risks across 
Citi, including risks that span categories, such as concentration risk, country 
risk and climate risk.

IRM is organized to align to risk categories, legal entities/regions and 
Company-wide, cross-risk functions or processes (i.e., foundational areas). 
There are teams that report to an independent CRO for various risk categories 
and legal entities/regions. In addition, there are foundational teams that 
report to Foundational Risk Management heads. The Risk Category, Legal 
Entity/Regional CROs and Foundational Risk Management Heads report to 
the Citigroup CRO.

Independent Compliance Risk Management
The ICRM organization actively oversees compliance risk across Citi, sets 
compliance risk and control standards for the first line of defense to manage 
compliance risk and promotes business conduct and activity that is consistent 
with Citi’s Mission and Value Proposition and the compliance risk appetite. 
Citi’s objective is to embed an enterprise-wide compliance risk management 
framework and culture that identifies, measures, monitors, controls and 
escalates compliance risk across Citi.

ICRM is aligned by product line, function and geography to provide 
compliance risk management advice and credible challenge on day-to-day 
matters and strategic decision-making for key initiatives. ICRM also has 
program-level Enterprise Compliance units responsible for setting standards 
and establishing priorities for program-related compliance efforts. These 
Compliance Risk Management heads report directly to the CCO.

Third Line of Defense: Internal Audit
Internal Audit is independent of front line units and independent risk 
management units. The role of Internal Audit is to provide independent, 
objective, reliable, valued and timely assurance to the Citigroup Board of 
Directors, its Audit Committee, Citi senior management and regulators over 
the effectiveness of governance, risk management and controls that mitigate 
current and evolving risks and enhance the control culture within Citi. 
Internal Audit reports to a chief audit executive (i.e., Citi’s Chief Auditor) 
who has unrestricted access to the Board and the board of directors of certain 
subsidiaries or their respective audit committees to facilitate the ability to 
execute specific responsibilities pertaining to escalation of risks and issues. 
The Internal Audit function has designated Chief Auditors responsible for 
assessing the design and effectiveness of controls within the various business 
units, functions, geographies and legal entities in which Citi operates.

65

Enterprise Support Functions
Enterprise support functions engage in activities that support safety and 
soundness across Citi. These functions provide advisory services and/or 
design, implement, maintain and oversee Company-wide programs that 
support Citi in maintaining an effective control environment.

Enterprise support functions are comprised of Human Resources, 
International Franchise Management, Legal (including Citi Security and 
Investigative Services).

Enterprise support functions, units and activities are subject to the 
relevant Company-wide independent oversight processes specific to the 
risk category that they generate (e.g., operational risk, compliance risk, 
reputation risk).

Risk Governance
Citi’s ERM Framework encompasses risk management processes to address 
risks undertaken by Citi through identification, measurement, monitoring, 
controlling and reporting of all risks. The ERM Framework integrates these 
processes with appropriate governance to complement Citi’s commitment to 
maintaining strong and consistent risk management practices.

Board Oversight
The Board is responsible for oversight of risk management and holds the 
Executive Management Team accountable for implementing the ERM 
Framework and meeting strategic objectives within Citi’s risk appetite.

Executive Management Team
The Board delegates authority to an Executive Management Team for 
directing and overseeing day-to-day management of Citi. The Executive 
Management Team is led by the Citigroup CEO and provides oversight of 
group activities, both directly and through authority delegated to committees 
it has established to oversee the management of risk, to ensure continued 
alignment with Citi’s strategy and risk appetite.

Board and Executive Management Committees
The Board executes its responsibilities either directly or through its 
committees. The Board has delegated authorities to the following Board 
standing committees to help fulfill its oversight and risk management 
responsibilities:

•  Risk Management Committee (RMC): assists the Board in fulfilling 

its responsibility with respect to (i) oversight of Citi’s risk management 
framework, including the significant policies and practices used in 
managing credit, market, liquidity, strategic, operational, compliance, 
reputation and certain other risks, including those pertaining to capital 
management, and (ii) performance oversight of the Global Risk 
Review—credit, capital and collateral review functions.

•  Audit Committee: provides oversight of Citi’s financial reporting 

and internal control risk, as well as Internal Audit and Citi’s external 
independent accountants.

•  Personnel and Compensation Committee: provides oversight of 
incentive compensation plans and risk related to compensation.
•  Ethics, Conduct and Culture Committee: provides oversight of Citi’s 

Conduct Risk Management Program.

•  Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee: provides 

oversight of reputational issues, Environmental, Social and Governance 
(ESG) and sustainability matters, and legal and regulatory compliance 
risks as they relate to corporate governance matters.

In addition to the above, the Board has established the following ad 
hoc committee:

•  Transformation Oversight Committee: provides oversight of the 

actions of Citi’s management to develop and execute a transformation 
of Citi’s risk and control environment pursuant to the recent regulatory 
consent orders (for additional information see “Citi’s Consent Order 
Compliance” above).

The Executive Management Team has established five standing committees 
that cover the primary risks to which Citi (i.e., Group) is exposed. These 
consist of:

•  Group Strategic Risk Committee (GSRC): provides governance oversight 
of Citi’s management actions to adequately identify, monitor, report, 
manage and escalate all material strategic risks facing Citi.

•  Citigroup Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO): responsible for 
governance over management’s Liquidity Risk and Market Risk 
(non-trading) management and for monitoring and influencing the 
balance sheet, investment securities and capital management activities 
of Citigroup.

•  Group Risk Management Committee (GRMC): provides governance 
oversight of Credit Risk and Market Risk (trading) management in the 
Trading Book.

•  Group Business Risk and Control Committee (GBRCC): provides 
governance oversight of Citi’s Compliance and Operational Risks.
•  Group Reputation Risk Committee (GRRC): provides governance 

oversight for Reputation Risk management across Citi.

In addition to the Executive Management committees listed above, the Board 
may establish ad-hoc committees in response to regulatory feedback or to 
manage additional activities where deemed necessary.

To manage concentration of risk within credit risk, Citi has in place 
a framework consisting of industry limits, an idiosyncratic framework 
consisting of single name concentrations for each business and across 
Citigroup and a specialized framework consisting of product limits.

Credit exposures are generally reported in notional terms for accrual 
loans, reflecting the value at which the loans as well as other off-balance 
sheet commitments are carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Credit 
exposure arising from capital markets activities is generally expressed as the 
current mark-to-market, net of margin, reflecting the net value owed to Citi 
by a given counterparty.

The credit risk associated with these credit exposures is a function of 
the idiosyncratic creditworthiness of the obligor, as well as the terms and 
conditions of the specific obligation. Citi assesses the credit risk associated 
with its credit exposures on a regular basis through its Allowance for Credit 
Losses (ACL) process (see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant 
Estimates—Allowance for Credit Losses” below and Notes 1 and 15 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements), as well as through regular stress testing 
at the company, business, geography and product levels. These stress-testing 
processes typically estimate potential incremental credit costs that would 
occur as a result of either downgrades in the credit quality or defaults of the 
obligors or counterparties. For additional information on Citi’s credit risk 
management, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

CREDIT RISK

Overview
Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the decline in credit quality 
of a client, customer or counterparty (or downgrade risk) or the failure 
of a borrower, counterparty, third party or issuer to honor its financial or 
contractual obligations. Credit risk arises in many of Citigroup’s business 
activities, including:

•  consumer, commercial and corporate lending;
•  capital markets derivative transactions;
•  structured finance; and
•  securities financing transactions (repurchase and reverse repurchase 

agreements, and securities loaned and borrowed).

Credit risk also arises from clearing and settlement activities, when Citi 
transfers an asset in advance of receiving its counter-value or advances funds 
to settle a transaction on behalf of a client. Concentration risk, within credit 
risk, is the risk associated with having credit exposure concentrated within a 
specific client, industry, region or other category.

Credit risk is one of the most significant risks Citi faces as an institution. 

For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Credit Risk” above. As a 
result, Citi has an established framework in place for managing credit risk 
across all businesses that includes a defined risk appetite, credit limits and 
credit policies. Citi’s credit risk management also includes processes and 
policies with respect to problem recognition, including “watch lists,” portfolio 
reviews, stress tests, updated risk ratings and classification triggers.

With respect to Citi’s clearing and settlement activities, intraday client 
usage of clearing lines is monitored against limits, as well as against usage 
patterns with settlement activity monitored daily and intraday for select 
products. To the extent that a problem develops, Citi typically moves the 
client to a secured (collateralized) operating model. Generally, Citi’s intraday 
clearing and settlement lines are uncommitted and cancelable at any time.

67

CONSUMER CREDIT
Citi fulfills a broad spectrum of customers’ financial needs with activities 
spanning retail banking, wealth management, credit card, personal loan, 
mortgage and small business banking through North America GCB. During 
2021, Citi also provided such activities in 18 countries in Latin America 
GCB and Asia GCB (for information on Citi’s consumer market exits in 
Latin America GCB and Asia GCB, see “Strategic Refresh—Market Exits 
and Planned Revision to Reporting Structure” above). The retail banking

As shown in the chart above, GCB’s net credit loss rate decreased quarter-

over-quarter and year-over-year for the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily 
reflecting the continued impact of government stimulus, unemployment 
benefits and consumer relief programs in North America GCB, and a decline 
following the peak charge-offs in Asia GCB and Latin America GCB in 
recent quarters. 

GCB’s 90+ days past due delinquency rate remained unchanged quarter-

over-quarter. The 90+days past due delinquency rate decreased year-over-
year, primarily due to the continued impacts of government stimulus, 
unemployment benefits and consumer relief programs in North America 
GCB, as well as lower delinquencies in Asia GCB and Latin America GCB, 
following the charge-off of peak delinquencies in recent quarters.

North America GCB provides mortgage, home equity, small business 
and personal loans through Citi’s retail banking network and card products 
through branded cards and retail services businesses. The retail bank is 
concentrated in six major metropolitan cities in the U.S. (for additional 
information on the U.S. retail bank, see “North America GCB” above).
As of December 31, 2021, approximately 74% of North America GCB 

consumer loans consisted of branded and retail services cards, which 
generally drives the overall credit performance of North America GCB (for 
additional information on North America GCB’s cards portfolios, including 
delinquency and net credit loss rates, see “Credit Card Trends” below).

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in North America 
GCB for the fourth quarter of 2021 decreased quarter-over-quarter and year-
over-year, primarily reflecting the continued impact of high payment rates in 
cards, driven by government stimulus. 

Year-over-year, the payment rates were also impacted by unemployment 

benefits and consumer relief programs.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate in North America GCB increased 

modestly quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to seasonality in cards, while 
the 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased year-over-year, primarily 
reflecting the continued impact of high payment rates in cards, driven by 
government stimulus.

Latin America GCB operates in Mexico through Citibanamex and 
provides credit cards, consumer mortgages and small business and personal 
loans. Latin America GCB serves a more mass-market segment in Mexico 
and focuses on developing multiproduct relationships with customers.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in Latin America 
GCB for the fourth quarter of 2021 decreased quarter-over-quarter and year-
over-year. The impact of charge-offs of delinquent loans in prior quarters 
resulted in lower delinquencies that led to lower net credit losses in the 
current quarter. 

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased quarter-over-quarter 
and year-over-year. The impact of charge-offs of delinquent loans in prior 
quarters and higher payment rates resulted in a lower 90+ days past due 
delinquency rate in the current quarter.

Retail services partners directly with more than 20 retailers and dealers to 
offer private label and co-branded cards. Retail services’ target market focuses 
on select industry segments such as home improvement, specialty retail, 
consumer electronics and fuel.

Retail services continually evaluates opportunities to add partners within 
target industries that have strong loyalty, lending or payment programs and 
growth potential.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in retail services for 
the fourth quarter of 2021 decreased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, 
primarily reflecting the continued impact of high payment rates, driven by 
government stimulus. Year-over-year, the payment rates were also impacted 
by unemployment benefits and consumer relief programs.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-over-quarter 

due to seasonality, and decreased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the 
continued impact of high payment rates, driven by government stimulus. 
Year-over-year, the payment rates were also impacted by unemployment 
benefits and consumer relief programs.

During 2021, Asia GCB operated in 17 countries and jurisdictions in 
Asia and EMEA and provided credit cards, consumer mortgages and small 
business and personal loans.

As shown in the chart above, the fourth quarter of 2021 net credit loss 
rate in Asia GCB decreased quarter-over-quarter, driven by the charge-off of 
peak delinquencies in recent quarters. Year-over-year, the net credit loss rate 
decreased, as elevated losses during the prior year returned to pre-pandemic 
levels. The decrease was also driven by the reclassification of approximately 
$10 billion of loans to held-for-sale as a result of Citi’s entry into agreements 
to sell its consumer banking businesses in Australia and the Philippines (Asia 
HFS reclass).

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased quarter-over-quarter 
and year-over-year, driven by the charge-off of peak delinquencies in recent 
quarters, as elevated losses returned to pre-pandemic levels, as well as the 
impact of the Asia HFS reclass.

The performance of Asia GCB’s portfolios continues to reflect the strong 
credit profiles in the region’s target customer segments. Regulatory changes 
in many markets in Asia over the past few years have also resulted in 
improved credit quality.

For additional information on cost of credit, loan delinquency and other 
information for Citi’s consumer loan portfolios, see each respective business’s 
results of operations above and Notes 13 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.

(1)  End-of-period (EOP) loans include interest and fees on credit cards.
(2)  The ratios of 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due are calculated based on EOP loans, net of unearned income.
(3)  The 90+ days past due balances for North America—branded and North America—retail services are generally still accruing interest. Citigroup’s policy is generally to accrue interest on credit card loans until 180 days 

past due, unless notification of bankruptcy filing has been received earlier.

(4)  The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios for North America GCB exclude loans guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies since the potential loss predominantly resides with the 
U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) were $185 million ($1.1 billion), $171 million ($0.7 billion) and $135 million ($0.5 billion) at December 31, 
2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans) were $74 million, 
$98 million and $72 million at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

(5)  Asia includes delinquencies and loans in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.
(6)  During 2021, Citi’s Australia and the Philippines consumer banking businesses were reclassified as HFS, due to Citi’s entry into agreements to sell the businesses. Accordingly, Australia and the Philippines consumer 
loans are recorded in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and hence the loans and related delinquencies and ratios are not included in this table. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for 
additional information.

(7)  The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are primarily related to U.S. mortgages guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies since the potential 

loss predominantly resides with the U.S. agencies. The amounts excluded for 90+ days past due EOP loans were $138 million ($0.4 billion), $183 million ($0.5 billion) and $172 million ($0.4 billion) at December 31, 
2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans) were $35 million, 
$73 million and $55 million at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

(2)  The ratios of net credit losses are calculated based on average loans, net of unearned income.
(3)  Asia includes NCLs and average loans in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.
(4)  As a result of Citi’s entry into agreements to sell its consumer banking businesses in Australia and the Philippines during 2021, these businesses were reclassified as HFS beginning in 2021. As a result of HFS 

accounting treatment, approximately $6 million of net credit losses (NCLs) was recorded as a reduction in revenue (Other revenue)  in 2021. Accordingly, these NCLs are not included in this table, as well as Loans HFS 
that are recorded in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

CORPORATE CREDIT
Consistent with its overall strategy, Citi’s corporate clients are typically 
corporations that value the depth and breadth of Citi’s global network. Citi 
aims to establish relationships with these clients that, consistent with client 
needs, encompass multiple products, including cash management and trade 
services, foreign exchange, lending, capital markets and M&A advisory. 
During 2021, Citi’s corporate credit exposures also included exposures in the 
private bank, excluding certain loans managed on a delinquency basis. For 
information on Citi’s planned revision to its reporting structure effective for 
the first quarter of 2022, including the reporting of the private bank as part 
of a new reporting segment, Personal Banking and Wealth Management, 
see “Strategic Refresh—Market Exits and Planned Revision to Reporting 
Structure” above.

Corporate Credit Portfolio
The following table details Citi’s corporate credit portfolio within ICG 
(excluding certain loans in the private bank, which are managed on a 
delinquency basis, as well as loans carried at fair value and held-for-sale),

The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings across the 

corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison of credit exposure across 
all lines of business, geographic regions and products. Counterparty risk 
ratings reflect an estimated probability of default for a counterparty and 
are derived by leveraging validated statistical models, scorecard models and 
external agency ratings (under defined circumstances), in combination 
with consideration of factors specific to the obligor or market, such as 
management experience, competitive position, regulatory environment and 
commodity prices. Facility risk ratings are assigned that reflect the probability 
of default of the obligor and factors that affect the loss given default of the 
facility, such as support or collateral. Internal obligor ratings that generally 
correspond to BBB and above are considered investment grade, while those 
below are considered non-investment grade.

Note: Total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments. 

In addition to the obligor and facility risk ratings assigned to all 

exposures, Citi may classify exposures in the corporate credit portfolio. These 
classifications are consistent with Citi’s interpretation of the U.S. banking 
regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which may categorize exposures 
as special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss.

Risk ratings and classifications are reviewed regularly, and adjusted 
as appropriate. The credit review process incorporates quantitative and 
qualitative factors, including financial and non-financial disclosures or 
metrics, idiosyncratic events or changes to the competitive, regulatory or 
macroeconomic environment. This includes but is not limited to exposures 
in those sectors significantly impacted by the pandemic (including consumer 
retail, commercial real estate and transportation). 

Citi believes the corporate credit portfolio to be appropriately rated and 

classified as of December 31, 2021. Since the onset of the pandemic, Citi 
has taken action to adjust internal ratings and classifications of exposures 
as both the macroeconomic environment and obligor-specific factors have 
changed, particularly where additional stress has been seen.

As obligor risk ratings are downgraded, the probability of default 
increases. Downgrades of obligor risk ratings tend to result in a higher 
provision for credit losses. In addition, downgrades may result in the 
purchase of additional credit derivatives or other risk mitigants to hedge the 
incremental credit risk, or may result in Citi’s seeking to reduce exposure 
to an obligor or an industry sector. Citi will continue to review exposures 
to ensure that the appropriate probability of default is incorporated into all 
risk assessments.

For additional information on Citi’s corporate credit portfolio, see Note 14 

to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(4)  Net credit losses (recoveries) are for the year ended December 31, 2020 and exclude delinquency-managed private bank credit losses of $10 million.
(5)  Represents the amount of purchased credit protection in the form of derivatives to economically hedge funded and unfunded exposures. Of the $38.8 billion of purchased credit protection, $36.8 billion represents 

the total notional amount of purchased credit derivatives on individual reference entities. The remaining $2.0 billion represents the first loss tranche of portfolios of purchased credit derivatives with a total notional of 
$16.1 billion, where the protection seller absorbs the first loss on the referenced loan portfolios.

(6)  Autos total credit exposure includes securitization financing facilities secured by auto loans and leases, extended mainly to the finance company subsidiaries of global auto manufacturers, bank subsidiaries and 

(7) 

independent auto finance companies, of approximately $20.2 billion ($10.3 billion in funded, with more than 99% rated investment grade) at December 31, 2020.
In addition to this exposure, Citi has energy-related exposure within the public sector (e.g., energy-related state-owned entities) and the transportation and industrials sector (e.g., off-shore drilling entities) included in 
the table above. As of December 31, 2020, Citi’s total exposure to these energy-related entities was approximately $7.0 billion, of which approximately $3.8 billion consisted of direct outstanding funded loans.

78

Exposure to Commercial Real Estate
As of December 31, 2021, ICG’s total corporate credit exposure to commercial 
real estate (CRE) was $66 billion, with $44 billion consisting of direct 
outstanding funded loans (mainly included in the real estate and private 
bank categories in the above table), or 7% of Citi’s total outstanding 
loans. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, more than 70% of ICG’s total 
corporate CRE exposure was to borrowers in the U.S. Also as of December 31, 
2021, approximately 77% of ICG’s total corporate CRE exposure was rated 
investment grade.

As of December 31, 2021, the ACLL was 0.9% of funded CRE exposure, 

including 2.4% of funded non-investment-grade exposure.

Of the total CRE exposure:

•  $20 billion ($12 billion of direct outstanding funded loans) relates to 

Community Reinvestment Act-related lending provided pursuant to Citi’s 
regulatory requirements to meet the credit needs of borrowers in low and 
moderate income neighborhoods.

•  $20 billion ($16 billion of direct outstanding funded loans) relates to 

exposure secured by mortgages on underlying properties or in well-rated 
securitization exposures.

•  $15 billion ($5 billion of direct outstanding funded loans) relates to 

unsecured loans to large REITs, with nearly 74% of the exposure rated 
investment grade.

•  $11 billion ($11 billion of direct outstanding funded loans) relates to CRE 
exposure in the private bank, of which 100% is secured by mortgages. 
In addition, 48% of the exposure is also full recourse to the client. As of 
December 31, 2021, 82% of the exposure was rated investment grade.

Credit Risk Mitigation
As part of its overall risk management activities, Citi uses credit derivatives 
and other risk mitigants to hedge portions of the credit risk in its corporate 
credit portfolio, in addition to outright asset sales. Citi may enter into partial-
term hedges as well as full-term hedges. In advance of the expiration of 
partial-term hedges, Citi will determine, among other factors, the economic 
feasibility of hedging the remaining life of the instrument. The results of the 
mark-to-market and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives are 
reflected primarily in Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement 
of Income.

At December 31, 2021, September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, ICG 
(excluding the delinquency-managed private bank portfolio) had economic 
hedges on the corporate credit portfolio of $39.6 billion, $38.1 billion 
and $38.8 billion, respectively. Citi’s expected credit loss model used in 
the calculation of its ACL does not include the favorable impact of credit 
derivatives and other mitigants that are marked to market. In addition, 
the reported amounts of direct outstandings and unfunded lending 
commitments in the tables above do not reflect the impact of these hedging 
transactions. The credit protection was economically hedging underlying ICG 
(excluding the delinquency-managed private bank portfolio) corporate credit 
portfolio exposures with the following risk rating distribution:

(1)  On January 1, 2020, Citi adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 326, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (CECL). The ASC introduces a new credit loss methodology requiring earlier recognition of credit 
losses while also providing additional disclosure about credit risk. On January 1, 2020, Citi recorded a $4.1 billion, or an approximate 29%, pretax increase in the Allowance for credit losses, along with a $3.1 billion 
after-tax decrease in Retained earnings and a deferred tax asset increase of $1.0 billion. This transition impact reflects (i) a $4.9 billion build to the consumer ACL due to longer estimated tenors than under the 
incurred loss methodology under prior U.S. GAAP, net of recoveries; and (ii) a $0.8 billion decrease to the corporate ACL due to shorter remaining tenors, incorporation of recoveries and use of more specific historical 
loss data based on an increase in portfolio segmentation across industries and geographies. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the impact of Citi’s adoption of CECL.
(2)  Citi had a change in accounting related to its variable post-charge-off third-party collection costs that was recorded as an adjustment to its January 1, 2020 opening allowance for credit losses on loans of $443 

million. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Includes all adjustments to the allowance for credit losses, such as changes in the allowance from acquisitions, dispositions, securitizations, FX translation, purchase accounting adjustments, etc.

(3) 
(4)  2021 includes an approximate $280 million reclass related to Citi’s agreement to sell its consumer banking business in Australia and an approximate $90 million reclass related to Citi’s agreement to sell its consumer 

banking business in the Philippines. Those ACLL were reclassified to Other assets during 2021. 2021 also includes a decrease of approximately $134 million related to FX translation.

(5)  2020 includes reductions of approximately $4 million related to the transfer to HFS of various real estate loan portfolios. In addition, 2020 includes an increase of approximately $97 million related to FX translation.
(6)  2019 includes reductions of approximately $42 million related to the sale or transfer to HFS of various loan portfolios. In addition, 2019 includes a reduction of approximately $60 million related to FX translation.
(7)  2018 includes reductions of approximately $201 million related to the sale or transfer to HFS of various loan portfolios, which include approximately $106 million related to the transfer of various real estate loan 

portfolios to HFS. In addition, 2017 includes an increase of approximately $115 million related to FX translation.

(8)  2017 includes reductions of approximately $261 million related to the sale or transfer to HFS of various loan portfolios, which include approximately $106 million related to the transfer of various real estate loan 

portfolios to HFS. In addition, 2017 includes an increase of approximately $115 million related to FX translation.

(9)  December 31, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017 exclude $6.1 billion, $6.9 billion, $4.1 billion, $3.2 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, of loans which are carried at fair value.
(10) 2020 corporate ACLUC includes a non-provision transfer of $68 million, representing reserves on performance guarantees. The reserves on these contracts were reclassified out of the ACL on unfunded lending 

commitments and into other liabilities.

(11) Represents additional credit reserves recorded as Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
(12) Beginning in 2020, under CECL, the ACLL represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio and troubled debt restructurings. See “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” 
and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements below. Attribution of the ACLL is made for analytical purposes only and the entire ACLL is available to absorb credit losses in the overall portfolio. Prior to 2020, 
the ACLL represented management’s estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio, as well as probable losses related to large individually evaluated impaired loans and TDRs. See “Superseded Accounting 
Principles” in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets and Renegotiated Loans
There is a certain amount of overlap among non-accrual loans and 
assets and renegotiated loans. The following summary provides a general 
description of each category.

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets:

•  Corporate and consumer (including commercial banking) non-accrual 
status is based on the determination that payment of interest or principal 
is doubtful.

•  A corporate loan may be classified as non-accrual and still be performing 
under the terms of the loan structure. Non-accrual loans may still be 
current on interest payments. Citi’s corporate non-accrual loans were 
$1.9 billion, $2.4 billion and $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2021, 
September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Of these, 
approximately 54%, 56% and 59% were performing at December 31, 2021, 
September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

•  Consumer non-accrual status is generally based on aging, i.e., the 

borrower has fallen behind on payments.

•  Consumer mortgage loans, other than Federal Housing Administration 
(FHA) insured loans, are classified as non-accrual within 60 days of 
notification that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy. In addition, home 
equity loans are classified as non-accrual if the related residential first 
mortgage loan is 90 days or more past due.

•  North America branded cards and retail services are not included because, 
under industry standards, credit card loans accrue interest until such 
loans are charged off, which typically occurs at 180 days of contractual 
delinquency.

Renegotiated Loans:

•  Includes both corporate and consumer loans whose terms have been 

modified in a troubled debt restructuring (TDR).

•  Includes both accrual and non-accrual TDRs.

86

Non-Accrual Loans
The table below summarizes Citigroup’s non-accrual loans as of the periods indicated. Non-accrual loans may still be current on interest payments. In 
situations where Citi reasonably expects that only a portion of the principal owed will ultimately be collected, all payments received are reflected as a reduction 
of principal and not as interest income. For all other non-accrual loans, cash interest receipts are generally recorded as revenue.

In addition to modifications reflected as TDRs at December 31, 2021 and 2020, Citi also modified 
none and $47 million, respectively, of commercial loans risk rated “Substandard Non-Performing” or 
worse (asset category defined by banking regulators) in offices outside the U.S. These modifications 
were not considered TDRs because the modifications did not involve a concession or because 
the modifications qualified for exemptions from TDR accounting provided by the CARES Act or the 
interagency guidance.

LIQUIDITY RISK

Overview
Adequate and diverse sources of funding and liquidity are essential to Citi’s 
businesses. Funding and liquidity risks arise from several factors, many of 
which are mostly or entirely outside Citi’s control, such as disruptions in the 
financial markets, changes in key funding sources, credit spreads, changes in 
Citi’s credit ratings and macroeconomic, geopolitical and other conditions. 
For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Liquidity Risks” above.
Citi’s funding and liquidity management objectives are aimed at 

(i) funding its existing asset base, (ii) growing its core businesses, 
(iii) maintaining sufficient liquidity, structured appropriately, so that Citi 
can operate under a variety of adverse circumstances, including potential 
Company-specific and/or market liquidity events in varying durations and 
severity, and (iv) satisfying regulatory requirements, including, among other 
things, those related to resolution planning (for additional information, 
see “Resolution Plan” and “Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)” below). 
Citigroup’s primary liquidity objectives are established by entity, and in 
aggregate, across two major categories:

•  Citibank (including Citibank Europe plc, Citibank Singapore Ltd. and 

Citibank (Hong Kong) Ltd.); and

•  Citi’s non-bank and other entities, including the parent holding company 
(Citigroup Inc.), Citi’s primary intermediate holding company (Citicorp 
LLC), Citi’s broker-dealer subsidiaries (including Citigroup Global 
Markets Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Limited. and Citigroup Global 
Markets Japan Inc.) and other bank and non-bank subsidiaries that are 
consolidated into Citigroup (including Citibanamex).

At an aggregate Citigroup level, Citi’s goal is to maintain sufficient 
funding in amount and tenor to fully fund customer assets and to provide 
an appropriate amount of cash and high-quality liquid assets (as discussed 
below), even in times of stress, in order to meet its payment obligations as 
they come due. The liquidity risk management framework provides that in 
addition to the aggregate requirements, certain entities be self-sufficient or 
net providers of liquidity, including in conditions established under their 
designated stress tests.

Citi’s primary funding sources include (i) corporate and consumer 
deposits via Citi’s bank subsidiaries, including Citibank, N.A. (Citibank), (ii) 
long-term debt (primarily senior and subordinated debt) mainly issued by 
Citigroup Inc., as the parent, and Citibank, and (iii) stockholders’ equity. 
These sources may be supplemented by short-term borrowings, primarily in 
the form of secured funding transactions.

As referenced above, Citi’s funding and liquidity framework ensures that 
the tenor of these funding sources is of sufficient term in relation to the tenor 
of its asset base. The goal of Citi’s asset/liability management is to ensure 
that there is sufficient liquidity and tenor in the liability structure relative 
to the liquidity profile of the assets. This reduces the risk that liabilities will 
become due before assets mature or are monetized. This excess liquidity is 
held primarily in the form of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA), as set forth 
in the table below. 

Citi’s liquidity is managed via a centralized treasury model by Treasury, in 
conjunction with regional and in-country treasurers with oversight provided 
by Independent Risk Management and various Asset & Liability Committees 
(ALCOs) at the Citigroup, region, country and business levels. Pursuant 
to this approach, Citi’s HQLA is managed with emphasis on asset-liability 
management and entity-level liquidity adequacy throughout Citi.

Citi’s CRO and Chief Financial Officer co-chair Citigroup’s ALCO, which 

includes Citi’s Treasurer and other senior executives. The ALCO sets the 
strategy of the liquidity portfolio and monitors portfolio performance (for 
additional information about the ALCO, see “Risk Governance—Board 
and Executive Management Committees” above). Significant changes to 
portfolio asset allocations are approved by the ALCO. Citi also has other 
ALCOs, which are established at various organizational levels to ensure 
appropriate oversight for countries, franchise businesses and regions, serving 
as the primary governance committees for managing Citi’s balance sheet and 
liquidity.

As a supplement to ALCO, Citi’s Funding and Liquidity Risk Committee 
(FLRC) is a more focused assembly for funding and liquidity risk matters. 
The FLRC reviews and discusses the funding and liquidity risk profile of, as 
well as risk management practices for Citigroup and Citibank and reports its 
findings and recommendations to each relevant ALCO as appropriate.

Liquidity Monitoring and Measurement

Stress Testing 
Liquidity stress testing is performed for each of Citi’s major entities, operating 
subsidiaries and/or countries. Stress testing and scenario analyses are 
intended to quantify the potential impact of an adverse liquidity event on 
the balance sheet and liquidity position, and to identify viable funding 
alternatives that can be utilized. These scenarios include assumptions about 
significant changes in key funding sources, market triggers (such as credit 
ratings), potential uses of funding and macroeconomic, geopolitical and 
other conditions. These conditions include expected and stressed market 
conditions as well as Company-specific events.

Liquidity stress tests are performed to ascertain potential mismatches 
between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons and over 
different stressed conditions. To monitor the liquidity of an entity, these stress 
tests and potential mismatches are calculated with varying frequencies, with 
several tests performed daily.

Given the range of potential stresses, Citi maintains contingency funding 
plans on a consolidated basis and for individual entities. These plans specify 
a wide range of readily available actions for a variety of adverse market 
conditions or idiosyncratic stresses.

Note: The amounts set forth in the table above are presented on an average basis. For securities, the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be realized and, therefore, exclude any securities that are 

encumbered and incorporate any haircuts applicable under the U.S. LCR rule. The table above incorporates various restrictions that could limit the transferability of liquidity between legal entities, including Section 23A 
of the Federal Reserve Act.

(1)  Foreign government debt includes securities issued or guaranteed by foreign sovereigns, agencies and multilateral development banks. Foreign government debt securities are held largely to support local liquidity 

requirements and Citi’s local franchises and principally include government bonds from Japan, Mexico, South Korea, India and Hong Kong.

The table above includes average amounts of HQLA held at Citigroup’s 
operating entities that are eligible for inclusion in the calculation of 
Citigroup’s consolidated Liquidity Coverage ratio (LCR), pursuant to the U.S. 
LCR rules. These amounts include the HQLA needed to meet the minimum 
requirements at these entities and any amounts in excess of these minimums 
that are assumed to be transferable to other entities within Citigroup. 
Citigroup’s HQLA increased quarter-over-quarter as of the fourth quarter of 
2021, primarily reflecting an increase in deposits. 

As of December 31, 2021, Citigroup had $961 billion of available liquidity 
resources to support client and business needs, including end-of-period HQLA 
assets; additional unencumbered securities, including excess liquidity held 
at bank entities that is non-transferable to other entities within Citigroup; 
and available assets not already accounted for within Citi’s HQLA to support 
Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and Federal Reserve Bank discount window 
borrowing capacity.

Short-Term Liquidity Measurement: Liquidity Coverage 
Ratio (LCR)
In addition to internal 30-day liquidity stress testing performed for Citi’s 
major entities, operating subsidiaries and countries, Citi also monitors its 
liquidity by reference to the LCR.

The LCR is calculated by dividing HQLA by estimated net outflows 
assuming a stressed 30-day period, with the net outflows determined by 
standardized stress outflow and inflow rates prescribed in the LCR rule. The 
outflows are partially offset by contractual inflows from assets maturing 
within 30 days. Similar to outflows, the inflows are calculated based on 
prescribed factors to various assets categories, such as retail loans as well as 
unsecured and secured wholesale lending. The minimum LCR requirement 
is 100%.

 The table below details the components of Citi’s LCR calculation and 

HQLA in excess of net outflows for the periods indicated:

Long-Term Liquidity Measurement: Net Stable Funding 
Ratio (NSFR)
As previously disclosed, in October 2020, the U.S. banking agencies adopted 
a final rule to assess the availability of a bank’s stable funding against a 
required level. 

In general, a bank’s available stable funding includes portions of equity, 
deposits and long-term debt, while its required stable funding will be based 
on the liquidity characteristics of its assets, derivatives and commitments. 
Standardized weightings are required to be applied to the various asset and 
liabilities classes. The ratio of available stable funding to required stable 
funding is required to be greater than 100%. 

The final rule became effective beginning July 1, 2021, while public 
disclosure requirements to report the ratio will occur on a semiannual basis 
beginning June 30, 2023. Citi was in compliance with the final rule as of 
December 31, 2021.

Loans
As part of its funding and liquidity objectives, Citi seeks to fund its existing 
asset base appropriately as well as maintain sufficient liquidity to grow 
its GCB and ICG businesses, including its loan portfolio. Citi maintains a 
diversified portfolio of loans to its consumer and institutional clients. The 
table below details the average loans, by business and/or segment, and the 
total end-of-period loans for each of the periods indicated:

As of the fourth quarter of 2021, end-of period loans declined 1% year-

over-year and were largely unchanged quarter-over-quarter. 

On an average basis, loans were largely unchanged both year-over-year 

and sequentially. Excluding the impact of FX translation, average loans 
increased 1% year-over-year and were largely unchanged sequentially. On 
this basis, average GCB loans declined 4% year-over-year, primarily reflecting 
the reclassification of loans to held-for-sale as a result of Citi’s entry into 
agreements to sell its consumer banking businesses in Australia and 
the Philippines.

Excluding the impact of FX translation, average ICG loans increased 5% 
year-over-year. Loans in corporate lending declined 12% on an average basis, 
reflecting net repayments as Citi continued to assist its clients in accessing 
the capital markets, as well as lower demand. Private bank loans increased 
10%, largely driven by increased secured lending to high-net-worth clients. 
Markets and securities services loans increased 29%, reflecting an increase 
in securitization financing. TTS loans increased 15%, reflecting an increase 
in trade flows and originations. 

Average Corporate/Other loans continued to decline (down 46%), driven 

by the wind-down of legacy assets.

Excluding the impact of FX translation, average deposits in GCB increased 
7%, with continued strong growth in North America.

Excluding the impact of FX translation, average deposits in ICG grew 6% 
year-over-year, with strong growth in the private bank and securities services.

Long-Term Debt 
Long-term debt (generally defined as debt with original maturities of one 
year or more) represents the most significant component of Citi’s funding 
for the Citigroup parent company and Citi’s non-bank subsidiaries and is a 
supplementary source of funding for the bank entities. 

Long-term debt is an important funding source due in part to its 

multiyear contractual maturity structure. The weighted-average maturity of 
unsecured long-term debt issued by Citigroup and its affiliates (including 
Citibank) with a remaining life greater than one year was approximately 
8.6 years as of December 31, 2021, unchanged from the prior quarter and 
the prior year. The weighted-average maturity is calculated based on the 
contractual maturity of each security. For securities that are redeemable prior 
to maturity at the option of the holder, the weighted-average maturity is 
calculated based on the earliest date an option becomes exercisable.

Citi’s long-term debt outstanding at the Citigroup parent company 
includes benchmark senior and subordinated debt and what Citi refers to 
as customer-related debt, consisting of structured notes, such as equity- 
and credit-linked notes, as well as non-structured notes. Citi’s issuance 
of customer-related debt is generally driven by customer demand and 
complements benchmark debt issuance as a source of funding for Citi’s 
non-bank entities. Citi’s long-term debt at the bank includes Citibank 
benchmark senior debt, FHLB borrowings and securitizations.

Note: Amounts represent the current value of long-term debt on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet that, 
for certain debt instruments, includes consideration of fair value, hedging impacts and unamortized 
discounts and premiums.

(1)  Non-bank includes long-term debt issued to third parties by the parent holding company (Citigroup) 
and Citi’s non-bank subsidiaries (including broker-dealer subsidiaries) that are consolidated into 
Citigroup. As of December 31, 2021, non-bank included $65.9 billion of long-term debt issued by 
Citi’s broker-dealer and other subsidiaries, as well as certain Citigroup consolidated hedging activities.

(2)  Local country and other includes debt issued by Citi’s affiliates in support of their local operations. 
Within non-bank, certain secured financing is also included. Within bank, borrowings under certain 
U.S. government-sponsored liquidity programs are also included. 

(3)  Predominantly credit card securitizations, primarily backed by branded credit card receivables.

As of the fourth quarter of 2021, Citi’s total long-term debt outstanding 

decreased year-over-year, primarily driven by declines in unsecured 
benchmark senior debt at the non-bank entities and the bank, as well as 
securitizations and FHLB borrowings at the bank. The decrease in total 
long-term debt was partially offset by the issuance of customer-related debt 
at the non-bank entities. Sequentially, long-term debt outstanding decreased, 
driven primarily by decreases in unsecured benchmark senior debt at the 
non-bank entities and securitizations at the bank, partially offset by the 
issuance of customer-related debt at the non-bank entities.

As part of its liability management, Citi also has considered, and may 
continue to consider, opportunities to redeem or repurchase its long-term 
debt pursuant to open market purchases, tender offers or other means. 
Such redemptions and repurchases help reduce Citi’s overall funding costs. 
During 2021, Citi redeemed or repurchased an aggregate of approximately 
$33.8 billion of its outstanding long-term debt.

(ii)  Citigroup executed an inter-affiliate agreement with Citicorp, 

Citigroup’s operating material legal entities and certain other affiliated 
entities pursuant to which Citicorp is required to provide liquidity 
and capital support to Citigroup’s operating material legal entities 
in the event Citigroup were to enter bankruptcy proceedings (Citi 
Support Agreement); 

(iii)  pursuant to the Citi Support Agreement:

•  Citigroup made an initial contribution of assets, including certain 
high-quality liquid assets and inter-affiliate loans (Contributable 
Assets), to Citicorp, and Citicorp became the business-as-usual 
funding vehicle for Citigroup’s operating material legal entities;

•  Citigroup will be obligated to continue to transfer Contributable Assets 
to Citicorp over time, subject to certain amounts retained by Citigroup 
to, among other things, meet Citigroup’s near-term cash needs; 
•  in the event of a Citigroup bankruptcy, Citigroup will be required to 

contribute most of its remaining assets to Citicorp; and

(iv)  the obligations of both Citigroup and Citicorp under the Citi Support 

Agreement, as well as the Contributable Assets, are secured pursuant to 
a security agreement.

The Citi Support Agreement provides two mechanisms, besides Citicorp’s 
issuing of dividends to Citigroup, pursuant to which Citicorp will be required 
to transfer cash to Citigroup during business as usual so that Citigroup can 
fund its debt service as well as other operating needs: (i) one or more funding 
notes issued by Citicorp to Citigroup and (ii) a committed line of credit under 
which Citicorp may make loans to Citigroup. 

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)
U.S. GSIBs are required to maintain minimum levels of TLAC and eligible 
LTD, each set by reference to the GSIB’s consolidated risk-weighted 
assets (RWA) and total leverage exposure. The intended purpose of the 
requirements is to facilitate the orderly resolution of U.S. GSIBs under the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Code and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act. For additional 
information, including Citi’s TLAC and LTD amounts and ratios, see “Capital 
Resources—Current Regulatory Capital Standards” and “Risk Factors—
Compliance Risks” above. 

Resolution Plan
Citi is required under Title I of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform 
and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) and the rules 
promulgated by the FDIC and Federal Reserve Board to periodically submit a 
plan for Citi’s rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in 
the event of material financial distress or failure. 

On December 17, 2019, the Federal Reserve Board and FDIC issued 
feedback on the resolution plans filed on July 1, 2019 by the eight U.S. 
Global Systemically Important Banks, including Citigroup. The Federal 
Reserve Board and FDIC identified one shortcoming, but no deficiencies, in 
Citigroup’s resolution plan relating to governance mechanisms. Based on 
regulatory changes effective December 31, 2019, Citigroup’s 2021 resolution 
plan submission, which was filed on July 1, 2021 was a targeted resolution 
plan, only including a subset of the information of a full resolution plan and 
additional information, identified by the Federal Reserve Board and FDIC 
on July 1, 2020. Citigroup will alternate between submitting a full resolution 
plan and a targeted resolution plan on a biennial cycle. For additional 
information on Citi’s resolution plan submissions, see “Risk Factors—
Strategic Risks” above. Citigroup’s preferred resolution strategy is “single 
point of entry” under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 

Under Citi’s preferred “single point of entry” resolution plan strategy, 
only Citigroup, the parent holding company, would enter into bankruptcy, 
while Citigroup’s material legal entities (as defined in the public section of 
its 2021 resolution plan, which can be found on the Federal Reserve Board’s 
and FDIC’s websites) would remain operational outside of any resolution 
or insolvency proceedings. Citigroup’s resolution plan has been designed to 
minimize the risk of systemic impact to the U.S. and global financial systems, 
while maximizing the value of the bankruptcy estate for the benefit of 
Citigroup’s creditors, including its unsecured long-term debt holders. 
In addition, in line with the Federal Reserve Board’s final total loss-
absorbing capacity (TLAC) rule, Citigroup believes it has developed the 
resolution plan so that Citigroup’s shareholders and unsecured creditors—
including its unsecured long-term debt holders—bear any losses resulting 
from Citigroup’s bankruptcy. Accordingly, any value realized by holders of 
its unsecured long-term debt may not be sufficient to repay the amounts 
owed to such debt holders in the event of a bankruptcy or other resolution 
proceeding of Citigroup.

The FDIC has also indicated that it was developing a single point of entry 
strategy to implement the Orderly Liquidation Authority under Title II of the 
Dodd-Frank Act, which provides the FDIC with the ability to resolve a firm 
when it is determined that bankruptcy would have serious adverse effects on 
financial stability in the U.S.

As previously disclosed, in response to feedback received from the Federal 

Reserve Board and FDIC, Citigroup took the following actions:

(i)  Citicorp LLC (Citicorp), an existing wholly owned subsidiary of 

Citigroup, was established as an intermediate holding company (an 
IHC) for certain of Citigroup’s operating material legal entities;

95

SECURED FUNDING TRANSACTIONS AND SHORT-
TERM BORROWINGS
Citi supplements its primary sources of funding with short-term financings 
that generally include (i) secured funding transactions consisting of 
securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, i.e., repos, and 
(ii) to a lesser extent, short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper 
and borrowings from the FHLB and other market participants. 

Secured Funding Transactions
Secured funding is primarily accessed through Citi’s broker-dealer 
subsidiaries to fund efficiently both (i) secured lending activity and (ii) a 
portion of the securities inventory held in the context of market-making and 
customer activities. Citi also executes a smaller portion of its secured funding 
transactions through its bank entities, which are typically collateralized by 
government debt securities. Generally, daily changes in the level of Citi’s 
secured funding are primarily due to fluctuations in secured lending activity 
in the matched book (as described below) and securities inventory. 

Secured funding of $191 billion as of December 31, 2021 decreased 3% 
from the prior-year period and 9% sequentially. Excluding the impact of FX 
translation, secured funding decreased 1% from the prior-year period and 
8% sequentially, driven by normal business activity. The average balance 
for secured funding was approximately $222 billion for the quarter ended 
December 31, 2021.

The portion of secured funding in the broker-dealer subsidiaries that 
funds secured lending is commonly referred to as “matched book” activity. 
The majority of this activity is secured by high-quality liquid securities such 

as U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities and foreign government 
debt securities. Other secured funding is secured by less liquid securities, 
including equity securities, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities, 
the tenor of which is generally equal to or longer than the tenor of the 
corresponding matched book assets.

The remainder of the secured funding activity in the broker-dealer 

subsidiaries serves to fund securities inventory held in the context of market-
making and customer activities. To maintain reliable funding under a wide 
range of market conditions, including under periods of stress, Citi manages 
these activities by taking into consideration the quality of the underlying 
collateral and establishing minimum required funding tenors. The weighted 
average maturity of Citi’s secured funding of less liquid securities inventory 
was greater than 110 days as of December 31, 2021.

Citi manages the risks in its secured funding by conducting daily stress 
tests to account for changes in capacity, tenor, haircut, collateral profile and 
client actions. In addition, Citi maintains counterparty diversification by 
establishing concentration triggers and assessing counterparty reliability and 
stability under stress. Citi generally sources secured funding from more than 
150 counterparties.

Short-Term Borrowings
Citi’s short-term borrowings of $28 billion as of the fourth quarter of 2021 
decreased 5% year-over-year, reflecting a decline in FHLB advances, and 6% 
sequentially, primarily driven by a decline in structured notes (see Note 17 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on Citigroup’s 
and its affiliates’ outstanding short-term borrowings).

96

CREDIT RATINGS
Citigroup’s funding and liquidity, funding capacity, ability to access capital 
markets and other sources of funds, the cost of these funds and its ability to 
maintain certain deposits are partially dependent on its credit ratings. 
The table below shows the ratings for Citigroup and Citibank as of 

December 31, 2021. While not included in the table below, the long-term and 
short-term ratings of Citigroup Global Markets Holding Inc. (CGMHI) were 
BBB+/A-2 at S&P Global Ratings and A+/F1 at Fitch as of December 31, 2021.

S&P Global Ratings

Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades
Ratings downgrades by Moody’s, Fitch or S&P Global Ratings could 
negatively impact Citigroup’s and/or Citibank’s funding and liquidity due to 
reduced funding capacity, including derivative triggers, which could take the 
form of cash obligations and collateral requirements.

The following information is provided for the purpose of analyzing 
the potential funding and liquidity impact to Citigroup and Citibank of 
a hypothetical simultaneous ratings downgrade across all three major 
rating agencies. This analysis is subject to certain estimates, estimation 
methodologies, judgments and uncertainties. Uncertainties include potential 
ratings limitations that certain entities may have with respect to permissible 
counterparties, as well as general subjective counterparty behavior. For 
example, certain corporate customers and markets counterparties could 
re-evaluate their business relationships with Citi and limit transactions in 
certain contracts or market instruments with Citi. Changes in counterparty 
behavior could impact Citi’s funding and liquidity, as well as the results 
of operations of certain of its businesses. The actual impact to Citigroup 
or Citibank is unpredictable and may differ materially from the potential 
funding and liquidity impacts described below. For additional information 
on the impact of credit rating changes on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, 
see “Risk Factors—Liquidity Risks” above.

Citigroup Inc. and Citibank—Potential Derivative Triggers
As of December 31, 2021, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-notch 
downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of Citigroup Inc. across all 
three major rating agencies could impact Citigroup’s funding and liquidity 
due to derivative triggers by approximately $0.8 billion, compared to $1.1 
billion as of September 30, 2021. Other funding sources, such as secured 
financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are 
no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected.

As of December 31, 2021, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-notch 
downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of Citibank across all three 
major rating agencies could impact Citibank’s funding and liquidity due to 
derivative triggers by approximately $0.6 billion, compared to $0.5 billion 
as of September 30, 2021. Other funding sources, such as secured financing 
transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit 
triggers, could also be adversely affected.

In total, as of December 31, 2021, Citi estimates that a one-notch 

downgrade of Citigroup and Citibank across all three major rating agencies 
could result in increased aggregate cash obligations and collateral 
requirements of approximately $1.4 billion, compared to $1.6 billion as 
of September 30, 2021 (see also Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements). As detailed under “High-Quality Liquid Assets” above, Citigroup 
has various liquidity resources available to its bank and non-bank entities in 
part as a contingency for the potential events described above.

In addition, a broad range of mitigating actions are currently included 

in Citigroup’s and Citibank’s contingency funding plans. For Citigroup, 
these mitigating factors include, but are not limited to, accessing surplus 
funding capacity from existing clients, tailoring levels of secured lending 
and adjusting the size of select trading books and collateralized borrowings 
at certain Citibank subsidiaries. Mitigating actions available to Citibank 
include, but are not limited to, selling or financing highly liquid government 
securities, tailoring levels of secured lending, adjusting the size of select 
trading assets, reducing loan originations and renewals, raising additional 
deposits or borrowing from the FHLB or central banks. Citi believes these 
mitigating actions could substantially reduce the funding and liquidity risk, 
if any, of the potential downgrades described above.

Citibank—Additional Potential Impacts
In addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a potential 
downgrade of Citibank’s senior debt/long-term rating across any of the 
three major rating agencies could also have an adverse impact on the 
commercial paper/short-term rating of Citibank. Citibank has provided 
liquidity commitments to consolidated asset-backed commercial paper 
conduits, primarily in the form of asset purchase agreements. As of December 
31, 2021, Citibank had liquidity commitments of approximately $9.0 billion 
to consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits, compared to $10.0 
billion as of September 30, 2021 (for additional information, see Note 21 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements).

In addition to the above-referenced liquidity resources of certain Citibank 

entities, Citibank could reduce the funding and liquidity risk, if any, of the 
potential downgrades described above through mitigating actions, including 
repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial paper conduits. 
In the event of the potential downgrades described above, Citi believes that 
certain corporate customers could re-evaluate their deposit relationships 
with Citibank. This re-evaluation could result in clients adjusting their 
discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository institution, which 
could potentially reduce certain deposit levels at Citibank. However, Citi could 
choose to adjust pricing, offer alternative deposit products to its existing 
customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers, in addition to the 
mitigating actions referenced above.

MARKET RISK

OVERVIEW
Market risk is the potential for losses arising from changes in the value of 
Citi’s assets and liabilities resulting from changes in market variables such 
as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and 
credit spreads, as well as their implied volatilities. Market risk emanates from 
both Citi’s trading and non-trading portfolios. For additional information on 
market risk and market risk management, see “Risk Factors” above.

Each business is required to establish, with approval from Citi’s market 
risk management, a market risk limit framework for identified risk factors 
that clearly defines approved risk profiles and is within the parameters 
of Citi’s overall risk appetite. These limits are monitored by the Risk 
organization, including various regional, legal entity and business Risk 
Management committees, Citi’s country and business Asset & Liability 
Committees and the Citigroup Risk Management and Asset & Liability 
Committees. In all cases, the businesses are ultimately responsible for the 
market risks taken and for remaining within their defined limits.

MARKET RISK OF NON-TRADING PORTFOLIOS
Market risk from non-trading portfolios stems from the potential impact of 
changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on Citi’s net interest 
income, and on Citi’s Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 
(AOCI) from its debt securities portfolios. Market risk from non-trading 
portfolios also includes the potential impact of changes in foreign exchange 
rates on Citi’s capital invested in foreign currencies.

Net Interest Income at Risk
Net interest income, for interest rate exposure purposes, is the difference 
between the yield earned on the non-trading portfolio assets (including 
customer loans) and the rate paid on the liabilities (including customer 
deposits or company borrowings). Net interest income is affected by changes 
in the level of interest rates, as well as the amounts and mix of assets and 
liabilities, and the timing of contractual and assumed repricing of assets and 
liabilities to reflect market rates.

Citi’s principal measure of risk to net interest income is interest rate 
exposure (IRE). IRE measures the change in expected net interest income 
in each currency resulting solely from unanticipated changes in forward 
interest rates.

Citi’s estimated IRE incorporates various assumptions including 
prepayment rates on loans, customer behavior and the impact of pricing 
decisions. For example, in rising interest rate scenarios, portions of the 
deposit portfolio may be assumed to experience rate increases that are less 
than the change in market interest rates. In declining interest rate scenarios, 
it is assumed that mortgage portfolios experience higher prepayment rates. 
Citi’s estimated IRE below assumes that its businesses and/or Citi Treasury 
make no additional changes in balances or positioning in response to the 
unanticipated rate changes.

Citi is planning to transition the sensitivity analysis for its IRE (see the 
current IRE sensitivity impacts below), employing enhanced methodologies 
and changes to certain assumptions. The changes include, among other 
things, assumptions around the projected balance sheet (being more static), 
coupled with revisions to the treatment of certain business contributions to 
IRE, mainly accrual positions in ICG’s Markets businesses. These changes 
are planned for 2022, and will result in a higher impact to Citi’s NII and 
AOCI and a better reflection of the nature of the portfolios.

In order to manage changes in interest rates effectively, Citi may modify 
pricing on new customer loans and deposits, purchase fixed-rate securities, 
issue debt that is either fixed or floating or enter into derivative transactions 
that have the opposite risk exposures. Citi regularly assesses the viability of 
these and other strategies to reduce its interest rate risks and implements 
such strategies when it believes those actions are prudent.

Citi manages interest rate risk as a consolidated Company-wide position. 

Citi’s client-facing businesses create interest rate-sensitive positions, 
including loans and deposits, as part of their ongoing activities. Citi Treasury 
aggregates these risk positions and manages them centrally. Operating 
within established limits, Citi Treasury makes positioning decisions and uses 
tools, such as Citi’s investment securities portfolio, company-issued debt and 
interest rate derivatives, to target the desired risk profile. Changes in Citi’s 
interest rate risk position reflect the accumulated changes in all non-trading 
assets and liabilities, with potentially large and offsetting impacts, as well as 
in Citi Treasury’s positioning decisions.

Citigroup employs additional measurements, including stress testing the 

impact of non-linear interest rate movements on the value of the balance 
sheet, and the analysis of portfolio duration and volatility, particularly as they 
relate to mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities and the potential 
impact of the change in the spread between different market indices.

Interest Rate Risk of Investment Portfolios—Impact 
on AOCI
Citi also measures the potential impacts of changes in interest rates on 
the value of its AOCI, which can in turn impact Citi’s common equity and 
tangible common equity. This will impact Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 and 
other regulatory capital ratios. Citi’s goal is to benefit from an increase in the 
market level of interest rates, while limiting the impact of changes in AOCI 
on its regulatory capital position.

AOCI at risk is managed as part of the Company-wide interest rate 
risk position. AOCI at risk considers potential changes in AOCI (and the 
corresponding impact on the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio) relative to 
Citi’s capital generation capacity.

(1)  Certain trading-oriented businesses within Citi have accrual-accounted positions that are excluded from the estimated impact to net interest income in the table, since these exposures are managed economically in 

combination with mark-to-market positions. The U.S. dollar interest rate exposure associated with these businesses was $(179) million for a 100 bps instantaneous increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2021.
Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.

(2) 

The year-over-year increase in the estimated impact to net interest 
income primarily reflected changes in Citi’s balance sheet composition 
and Citi Treasury positioning. The year-over-year changes in the estimated 
impact to AOCI and the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio primarily 
reflected the impact of the composition of Citi Treasury’s investment and 
derivatives portfolio.

In the event of a parallel instantaneous 100 bps increase in interest 

rates, Citi expects that the negative impact to AOCI would be offset in 
shareholders’ equity through the expected recovery of the impact on AOCI 
through accretion of Citi’s investment portfolio over a period of time. As of 
December 31, 2021, Citi expects that the $4.6 billion negative impact to AOCI 

in such a scenario could potentially be offset over approximately 27 months.
The following table sets forth the estimated impact to Citi’s net interest 

income, AOCI and the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio (on a fully 
implemented basis) under five different changes in interest rate scenarios 
for the U.S. dollar and Citi’s other currencies. The 100 bps downward rate 
scenarios are impacted by the low level of interest rates in several countries 
and the assumption that market interest rates, as well as rates paid to 
depositors and charged to borrowers, do not fall below zero (i.e., the “flooring 
assumption”). The rate scenarios are also impacted by convexity related to 
mortgage products.

As shown in the table above, the magnitude of the impact to Citi’s net interest 
income and AOCI is greater under Scenario 2 as compared to Scenario 3. This 
is because the combination of changes to Citi’s investment portfolio, partially 
offset by changes related to Citi’s pension liabilities, results in a net position 
that is more sensitive to rates at shorter- and intermediate-term maturities.

Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates—Impacts on AOCI 
and Capital
As of December 31, 2021, Citi estimates that an unanticipated parallel 
instantaneous 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar against all of the other 
currencies in which Citi has invested capital could reduce Citi’s tangible 
common equity (TCE) by approximately $1.5 billion, or 0.9%, as a result 
of changes to Citi’s FX translation adjustment in AOCI, net of hedges. This 
impact would be primarily due to changes in the value of the Mexican peso, 
Euro, Singapore dollar and Indian rupee.

This impact is also before any mitigating actions Citi may take, including 
ongoing management of its FX translation exposure. Specifically, as currency 
movements change the value of Citi’s net investments in foreign currency-
denominated capital, these movements also change the value of Citi’s risk-
weighted assets denominated in those currencies. This, coupled with Citi’s 
foreign currency hedging strategies, such as foreign currency borrowings, 
foreign currency forwards and other currency hedging instruments, lessens 
the impact of foreign currency movements on Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 
Capital ratio. Changes in these hedging strategies, as well as hedging costs, 
divestitures and tax impacts, can further affect the actual impact of changes 
in foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital as compared to an unanticipated 
parallel shock, as described above.

In addition, the effect of Citi’s ongoing management strategies with 
respect to quarterly changes in foreign exchange rates, and the quarterly 
impact of these changes on Citi’s TCE and Common Equity Tier 1 Capital 
ratio, are shown in the table below. For additional information on the 
changes in AOCI, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Note: Revenue previously referred to as net interest revenue is now referred to as net interest income. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2021, Citi reclassified deposit insurance expenses (FDIC and other similar insurance 

(1) 

(2) 

assessments outside of the U.S.) from Interest expense to Other operating expenses for all periods presented. Amounts reclassified for each year were $1,207 million for 2021, $1,203 million for 2020 and $781 million for 2019.
Interest revenue and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments related to the tax-exempt bond portfolio and certain tax-advantaged loan programs (based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 
21%) of $192 million, $196 million and $208 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Interest expense associated with certain hybrid financial instruments, which are classified as Long-term debt and accounted for at fair value, is reported together with any changes in fair value as part of Principal 
transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income and is therefore not reflected in Interest expense in the table above.

(3)  The average rate on interest revenue and net interest margin reflects the taxable equivalent gross-up adjustment. See footnote 1 above.
(4)  Citi’s net interest margin (NIM) is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets.

Interest revenue and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments discussed in the table above.

Citi’s net interest income (NII) in the fourth quarter of 2021 was 

$10.8 billion ($10.9 billion on a taxable equivalent basis), largely 
unchanged versus the prior year, as a modest increase in non-ICG Markets 
NII (approximately $60 million) offset an equivalent decline in ICG Markets 
(fixed income markets and equity markets). Citi’s NIM was 1.98% on a 
taxable equivalent basis in the fourth quarter of 2021, a decrease of one basis 
point from the prior quarter, largely reflecting deposit growth.

Citi’s NII for 2021 decreased 5%, or approximately $2.3 billion, to 
$42.5 billion ($42.7 billion on a taxable equivalent basis) versus the prior 
year. The decrease was primarily related to a decline in non-ICG Markets NII, 
largely reflecting lower interest rates and lower loan balances. In 2021, Citi’s 
NIM was 1.99% on a taxable equivalent basis, compared to 2.22% in 2020, 
primarily driven by lower rates and a mix-shift in balances.

Market Risk of Trading Portfolios
Trading portfolios include positions resulting from market-making activities, 
hedges of certain available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, the CVA relating 
to derivative counterparties and all associated hedges, fair value option 
loans and hedges of the loan portfolio within capital markets origination 
within ICG.

The market risk of Citi’s trading portfolios is monitored using a 

combination of quantitative and qualitative measures, including, but not 
limited to:

•  factor sensitivities; 
•  value at risk (VAR); and 
•  stress testing.

Each trading portfolio across Citi’s businesses has its own market risk 
limit framework encompassing these measures and other controls, including 
trading mandates, new product approval, permitted product lists and pre-
trade approval for larger, more complex and less liquid transactions.

The following chart of total daily trading-related revenue (loss) captures 
trading volatility and shows the number of days in which revenues for Citi’s 
trading businesses fell within particular ranges. Trading-related revenue 
includes trading, net interest and other revenue associated with Citi’s 
trading businesses. It excludes DVA, FVA and CVA adjustments incurred due 
to changes in the credit quality of counterparties, as well as any associated 
hedges of that CVA. In addition, it excludes fees and other revenue associated 
with capital markets origination activities. Trading-related revenues are 
driven by both customer flows and the changes in valuation of the trading 
inventory. As shown in the chart below, positive trading-related revenue was 
achieved for 95.8% of the trading days in 2021.

Factor Sensitivities
Factor sensitivities are expressed as the change in the value of a position for 
a defined change in a market risk factor, such as a change in the value of 
a U.S. Treasury Bond for a one-basis-point change in interest rates. Citi’s 
Global Market Risk function, within the Independent Risk Management 
organization, works to ensure that factor sensitivities are calculated, 
monitored and limited for all material risks taken in the trading portfolios.

Value at Risk (VAR)
VAR estimates, at a 99% confidence level, the potential decline in the value of 
a position or a portfolio under normal market conditions assuming a one-
day holding period. VAR statistics, which are based on historical data, can be 
materially different across firms due to differences in portfolio composition, 
differences in VAR methodologies and differences in model parameters. As a 
result, Citi believes VAR statistics can be used more effectively as indicators 
of trends in risk-taking within a firm, rather than as a basis for inferring 
differences in risk-taking across firms.

Citi uses a single, independently approved Monte Carlo simulation VAR 

model (see “VAR Model Review and Validation” below), which has been 
designed to capture material risk sensitivities (such as first- and second-
order sensitivities of positions to changes in market prices) of various asset 

classes/risk types (such as interest rate, credit spread, foreign exchange, 
equity and commodity risks). Citi’s VAR includes positions that are measured 
at fair value; it does not include investment securities classified as AFS or 
HTM. For information on these securities, see Note 13 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.

Citi believes its VAR model is conservatively calibrated to incorporate 

fat-tail scaling and the greater of short-term (approximately the most 
recent month) and long-term (three years) market volatility. The Monte 
Carlo simulation involves approximately 450,000 market factors, making 
use of approximately 350,000 time series, with sensitivities updated daily, 
volatility parameters updated intra-monthly and correlation parameters 
updated monthly. The conservative features of the VAR calibration contribute 
an approximate 33% add-on to what would be a VAR estimated under the 
assumption of stable and perfectly, normally distributed markets.

As set forth in the table below, Citi’s average trading VAR decreased 

$5 million from 2020 to 2021, mainly due to a reduction of market volatility, 
given improved macroeconomic conditions, compared to 2020. Citi’s average 
trading and credit portfolio VAR decreased $24 million from 2020 to 2021 
due to VAR volatility recalibration.

(1)  Covariance adjustment (also known as diversification benefit) equals the difference between the total VAR and the sum of the VARs tied to each risk type. The benefit reflects the fact that the risks within individual and 
across risk types are not perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VAR on a given day will be lower than the sum of the VARs relating to each risk type. The determination of the primary drivers of changes to the 
covariance adjustment is made by an examination of the impact of both model parameter and position changes.

(2)  The total trading VAR includes mark-to-market and certain fair value option trading positions in ICG, with the exception of hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value option loans and all CVA exposures. Available-for-sale 

and accrual exposures are not included.

(3)   The specific risk-only component represents the level of equity and fixed income issuer-specific risk embedded in VAR.
(4)   The credit portfolio is composed of mark-to-market positions associated with non-trading business units including Citi Treasury, the CVA relating to derivative counterparties and all associated CVA hedges. FVA and DVA 

are not included. The credit portfolio also includes hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value option loans and hedges to the leveraged finance pipeline within capital markets origination in ICG.

VAR Model Review and Validation
Generally, Citi’s VAR review and model validation process entails reviewing 
the model framework, major assumptions and implementation of the 
mathematical algorithm. In addition, product specific back-testing 
on portfolios is periodically completed as part of the ongoing model 
performance monitoring process and reviewed with Citi’s U.S. banking 
regulators. Furthermore, Regulatory VAR back-testing (as described below) 
is performed against buy-and-hold profit and loss on a monthly basis 
for multiple sub-portfolios across the organization (trading desk level, 
ICG business segment and Citigroup) and the results are shared with U.S. 
banking regulators.

Material VAR model and assumption changes must be independently 
validated within Citi’s Independent Risk Management organization. All 
model changes, including those for the VAR model, are validated by the 
model validation group within Citi’s Model Risk Management. In the event 
of significant model changes, parallel model runs are undertaken prior to 
implementation. In addition, significant model and assumption changes are 
subject to the periodic reviews and approval by Citi’s U.S. banking regulators.
Citi uses the same independently validated VAR model for both Regulatory 

VAR and Risk Management VAR (i.e., total trading and total trading and 
credit portfolios VARs) and, as such, the model review and validation process 
for both purposes is as described above.

Regulatory VAR, which is calculated in accordance with Basel III, differs 
from Risk Management VAR due to the fact that certain positions included 
in Risk Management VAR are not eligible for market risk treatment in 
Regulatory VAR. The composition of Risk Management VAR is discussed 
under “Value at Risk” above. The applicability of the VAR model for positions 
eligible for market risk treatment under U.S. regulatory capital rules is 
periodically reviewed and approved by Citi’s U.S. banking regulators.
In accordance with Basel III, Regulatory VAR includes all trading 

book-covered positions and all foreign exchange and commodity exposures. 
Pursuant to Basel III, Regulatory VAR excludes positions that fail to meet 
the intent and ability to trade requirements and are therefore classified as 
non-trading book and categories of exposures that are specifically excluded 
as covered positions. Regulatory VAR excludes CVA on derivative instruments 
and DVA on Citi’s own fair value option liabilities. CVA hedges are excluded 
from Regulatory VAR and included in credit risk-weighted assets as computed 
under the Advanced Approaches for determining risk-weighted assets.

Regulatory VAR Back-Testing
In accordance with Basel III, Citi is required to perform back-testing to 
evaluate the effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR model. Regulatory VAR 
back-testing is the process in which the daily one-day VAR, at a 99% 
confidence interval, is compared to the buy-and-hold profit and loss 
(i.e., the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end 
of the day and re-priced the following day). Buy-and-hold profit and loss 
represents the daily mark-to-market profit and loss attributable to price 
movements in covered positions from the close of the previous business 
day. Buy-and-hold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue, net 
interest, fees and commissions, intra-day trading profit and loss and changes 
in reserves.

Based on a 99% confidence level, Citi would expect two to three days in 
any one year where buy-and-hold losses exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given 
the conservative calibration of Citi’s VAR model (as a result of taking the 
greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-tail scaling of volatilities), 
Citi would expect fewer exceptions under normal and stable market 
conditions. Periods of unstable market conditions could increase the number 
of back-testing exceptions.

110

The following graph shows the daily buy-and-hold profit and loss 

associated with Citi’s covered positions compared to Citi’s one-day Regulatory 
VAR during 2021. As of December 31, 2021, one back-testing exception was 
observed at the Citigroup level.

The difference between the 54.4% of days with buy-and-hold gains for 
Regulatory VAR back-testing and the 95.8% of days with trading, net interest 
and other revenue associated with Citi’s trading businesses, shown in the 
histogram of daily trading-related revenue below, reflects, among other 
things, that a significant portion of Citi’s trading-related revenue is not 
generated from daily price movements on these positions and exposures, as 
well as differences in the portfolio composition of Regulatory VAR and Risk 
Management VAR.

(1)   Buy-and-hold profit and loss, as defined by the banking regulators under Basel III, represents the daily mark-to-market revenue movement attributable to the trading position from the close of the previous business 

day. Buy-and-hold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue and net interest intra-day trading profit and loss on new and terminated trades, as well as changes in reserves. Therefore, it is not comparable to the 
trading-related revenue presented in the chart of daily trading-related revenue above.

111

Stress Testing
Citi performs market risk stress testing on a regular basis to estimate 
the impact of extreme market movements. It is performed on individual 
positions and trading portfolios, as well as in aggregate, inclusive of multiple 
trading portfolios. Citi’s market risk management, after consultations with 
the businesses, develops both systemic and specific stress scenarios, reviews 
the output of periodic stress testing exercises and uses the information to 
assess the ongoing appropriateness of exposure levels and limits. Citi uses 
two complementary approaches to market risk stress testing across all major 
risk factors (i.e., equity, foreign exchange, commodity, interest rate and 
credit spreads): top-down systemic stresses and bottom-up business-specific 
stresses. Systemic stresses are designed to quantify the potential impact of 
extreme market movements on an institution-wide basis, and are constructed 
using both historical periods of market stress and projections of adverse 
economic scenarios. Business-specific stresses are designed to probe the risks 
of particular portfolios and market segments, especially those risks that are 
not fully captured in VAR and systemic stresses.

The systemic stress scenarios and business-specific stress scenarios at 
Citi are used in several reports reviewed by senior management and also to 
calculate internal risk capital for trading market risk. In general, changes 
in market values are defined over a one-year horizon. For the most liquid 
positions and market factors, changes in market values are defined over a 
shorter two-month horizon. The limited set of positions and market factors 
whose market value changes are defined over a two-month horizon are those 
that in management’s judgment have historically remained very liquid 
during financial crises, even as the trading liquidity of most other positions 
and market factors materially declined.

112

OPERATIONAL RISK

Overview
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal 
processes, people and systems or from external events. This includes legal 
risk, which is the risk of loss (including litigation costs, settlements, and 
regulatory fines) resulting from the failure of Citi to comply with laws, 
regulations, prudent ethical standards, and contractual obligations in any 
aspect of its businesses, but excludes strategic and reputation risks. Citi also 
recognizes the impact of operational risk on the reputation risk associated 
with Citi’s business activities.

Citi has a governance structure for the oversight of operational risk 
exposures through Business Risk and Controls Committees (BRCCs), which 
include a Citigroup BRCC as well as business, functions, regional and 
country BRCCs. BRCCs are chaired by the individuals in the first line of 
defense and provide escalation channels for senior management to review 
operational risk exposures including breaches of operational risk appetite, 
key indicators, operational risk events, and control issues. Membership 
includes senior business and functions leadership as well as members of the 
second line of defense.

Operational risk is inherent in Citi’s global business activities, as well 

In addition, Independent Risk Management, including the Operational 

Risk Management group, works proactively with Citi’s businesses and 
functions to drive a strong and embedded operational risk management 
culture and framework across Citi. The Operational Risk Management 
group actively challenges business and functions implementation of the 
Operational Risk Management Framework requirements and the quality of 
operational risk management practices and outcomes.

Information about businesses’ key operational risks, historical operational 

risk losses and the control environment is reported by each major business 
segment and functional area. Citi’s operational risk profile and related 
information is summarized and reported to senior management, as well as 
to the Audit and Risk Committees of Citi’s Board of Directors by the Head of 
Operational Risk Management.

Operational risk is measured through Operational Risk Capital and 
Operational Risk Regulatory Capital for the Advanced Approaches under 
Basel III. Projected operational risk losses under stress scenarios are 
estimated as a required part of the FRB’s CCAR process.

For additional information on Citi’s operational risks, see “Risk 

Factors—Operational Risk” above.

Cybersecurity Risk

Overview
Cybersecurity risk is the business risk associated with the threat posed by a 
cyber attack, cyber breach or the failure to protect Citi’s most vital business 
information assets or operations, resulting in a financial or reputational loss 
(for additional information, see the operational processes and systems and 
cybersecurity risk factors in “Risk Factors—Operational Risks” above). With 
an evolving threat landscape, ever-increasing sophistication of threat actor 
tactics, techniques and procedures, and use of new technologies to conduct 
financial transactions, Citi and its clients, customers and third parties are 
and will continue to be at risk from cyber attacks and information security 
incidents. Citi recognizes the significance of these risks and, therefore, 
leverages an intelligence-led strategy to protect against, detect and respond 
to, and recover from cyber attacks. Further, Citi actively participates in 
financial industry, government and cross-sector knowledge-sharing groups to 
enhance individual and collective cybersecurity preparedness and resilience.

as related support functions, and can result in losses. Citi maintains a 
comprehensive Citi-wide risk taxonomy to classify operational risks that 
it faces using standardized definitions across Citi’s Operational Risk 
Management Framework (see discussion below). This taxonomy also 
supports regulatory requirements and expectations inclusive of those related 
to U.S. Basel III, Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), 
Heightened Standards for Large Financial Institutions and Dodd Frank 
Annual Stress Testing (DFAST).

Citi manages operational risk consistent with the overall framework 
described in “Managing Global Risk—Overview” above. Citi’s goal is to 
keep operational risk at appropriate levels relative to the characteristics of its 
businesses, the markets in which it operates, its capital and liquidity and the 
competitive, economic and regulatory environment. This includes effectively 
managing operational risk and maintaining or reducing operational risk 
exposures within Citi’s operational risk appetite.

Citi’s Independent Operational Risk Management group has established 

a global-Operational Risk Management Framework with policies and 
practices for identification, measurement, monitoring, managing and 
reporting operational risks and the overall operating effectiveness of the 
internal control environment. As part of this framework, Citi has defined its 
operational risk appetite and established a manager’s control assessment 
(MCA) process for self-identification of significant operational risks, 
assessment of the performance of key controls and mitigation of residual risk 
above acceptable levels.

Each major business segment must implement operational risk processes 

consistent with the requirements of this framework. This includes:

•  understanding the operational risks they are exposed to;
•  designing controls to mitigate identified risks;
•  establishing key indicators;
•  monitoring and reporting whether the operational risk exposures are in or 

out of their operational risk appetite;

•  having processes in place to bring operational risk exposures within 

acceptable levels;

•  periodically estimate and aggregate the operational risks they are 

exposed to; and

•  ensuring that sufficient resources are available to actively improve the 

operational risk environment and mitigate emerging risks.

Citi considers operational risks that result from the introduction of new 

or changes to existing products, or result from significant changes in its 
organizational structures, systems, processes and personnel.

113

 
Risk Management
Citi’s technology and cybersecurity risk management program is built on 
three lines of defense. Citi’s first line of defense under the Office of the Chief 
Information Security Officer provides frontline business, operational and 
technical controls and capabilities to protect against cybersecurity risks, and 
to respond to cyber incidents and data breaches. Citi manages these threats 
through state-of-the-art Fusion Centers, which serve as central commands 
for monitoring and coordinating responses to cyber threats. The enterprise 
information security team is responsible for infrastructure defense and 
security controls, performing vulnerability assessments and third-party 
information security assessments, employee awareness and training 
programs and security incident management. In each case the team works 
in coordination with a network of information security officers who are 
embedded within the businesses and functions globally.

Citi’s Operational Risk Management-Technology and Cyber (ORM-T/C) 

and Independent Compliance Risk Management-Technology and 
Information Security (ICRM-T) groups serve as the second line of defense, 
and actively evaluate, anticipate and challenge Citi’s risk mitigation 
practices and capabilities. Citi seeks to proactively identify and remediate 
technology and cybersecurity risks before they materialize as incidents 
that negatively affect business operations. Accordingly, the ORM-T/C team 
independently challenges and monitors capabilities in accordance with Citi’s 
defined Technology and Cyber Risk Appetite statements. To address evolving 
cybersecurity risks and corresponding regulations, ORM-T/C and ICRM-T 
teams collectively also monitor cyber legal and regulatory requirements, 
identify and define emerging risks, execute strategic cyber threat assessments, 
perform new products and initiative reviews, perform data management 
risk oversight and conduct cyber risk assurance reviews (inclusive of 
third-party assessments). In addition, ORM-T/C employs tools and oversees 
and challenges metrics that are both tailored to cybersecurity and technology 
and aligned with Citi’s overall operational risk management framework to 
effectively track, identify and manage risk.

Internal audit serves as the third line of defense and independently 
provides assurance on how effectively the organization as a whole manages 
cybersecurity risk. Citi also has multiple senior committees such as the 
Information Security Risk Committee (ISRC), which governs enterprise-level 
risk tolerance inclusive of cybersecurity risk.

Board Oversight
Citi’s Board of Directors provides oversight of management’s efforts to 
mitigate cybersecurity risk and respond to cyber incidents. The Board receives 
regular reports on cybersecurity and engages in discussions throughout the 
year with management and subject-matter experts on the effectiveness of 
Citi’s overall cybersecurity program. The Board also obtains updates on Citi’s 
inherent cybersecurity risks and Citi’s road map and progress for addressing 
these risks.

Moreover, Citi’s Board and its committee members receive 

contemporaneous reporting on significant cyber events including response, 
legal obligations, and outreach and notification to regulators, and customers 

when needed, as well as guidance to management as appropriate. In 2021, 
the Board of Directors underwent a cyber incident tabletop exercise. Also 
in 2021, the Board’s Risk Management Committee approved a standalone 
Cybersecurity Risk Appetite Statement against which Citi’s performance is 
measured quarterly. For additional information on the Board’s oversight of 
cybersecurity risk management, see Citi’s 2022 proxy statement to be filed 
with the SEC in March 2022.

COMPLIANCE RISK
Compliance risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and 
resilience arising from violations of laws, rules, or regulations, or from 
non-conformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures 
or ethical standards. Compliance risk exposes Citi to fines, civil money 
penalties, payment of damages and the voiding of contracts. Compliance 
risk can result in diminished reputation, harm to Citi’s customers, limited 
business opportunities and lessened expansion potential. It encompasses 
the risk of noncompliance with all laws and regulations, as well as prudent 
ethical standards and some contractual obligations. It could also include 
exposure to litigation (known as legal risk) from all aspects of traditional 
and non-traditional banking.

Citi seeks to operate with integrity, maintain strong ethical standards 
and adhere to applicable policies and regulatory and legal requirements. 
Citi must maintain and execute a proactive Compliance Risk Management 
(CRM) Policy that is designed to manage compliance risk effectively 
across Citi, with a view to fundamentally strengthen the compliance risk 
management culture across the lines of defense taking into account Citi’s 
risk governance framework and regulatory requirements. Independent 
Compliance Risk Management’s (ICRM) primary objectives are to:

•  Drive and embed a culture of compliance and control throughout Citi;
•  Maintain and oversee an integrated CRM Policy and Compliance Risk 
Framework that facilitates enterprise-wide compliance with local, 
national or cross-border laws, rules or regulations, Citi’s internal policies, 
standards and procedures and relevant standards of conduct;

•  Assess compliance risks and issues across product lines, functions and 

geographies, supported by globally consistent systems and compliance risk 
management processes; and

•  Provide compliance risk data aggregation and reporting capabilities.

To anticipate, control and mitigate compliance risk, Citi has 

established the CRM Policy to achieve standardization and centralization 
of methodologies and processes, and to enable more consistent and 
comprehensive execution of compliance risk management.

Citi has a commitment, as well as an obligation, to identify, assess and 
mitigate compliance risks associated with its businesses and functions. ICRM 
is responsible for oversight of Citi’s CRM Policy, while all businesses and 
global control functions are responsible for managing their compliance risks 
and operating within the Compliance Risk Appetite.

114

The responsibility for enhancing and protecting Citi’s reputation is shared 

by all colleagues, who are guided by Citi’s Code of Conduct. Colleagues are 
expected to exercise sound judgment and common sense in decisions and 
actions. They are also expected to promptly escalate all issues that present 
potential reputation risk in line with policy.

STRATEGIC RISK
As discussed above, strategic risk is the risk of a sustained impact (not 
episodic impact) to Citi’s core strategic objectives as measured by impacts 
on anticipated earnings, market capitalization, or capital, arising from the 
external factors affecting the Company’s operating environment; as well as 
the risks associated with defining the strategy and executing the strategy, 
which are identified, measured and managed as part of the Strategic Risk 
Framework at the Enterprise Level.

In this context, external factors affecting Citi’s operating environment 
are the economic environment, geopolitical/political landscape, industry/
competitive landscape, societal trends, customer/client behavior, regulatory/
legislative environment and trends related to investors/shareholders.

Citi’s Executive Management Team is responsible for the development and 

execution of Citi’s strategy. This strategy is translated into forward-looking 
plans (collectively Citi’s Strategic Plan) that are then cascaded across the 
organization. Citi’s Strategic Plan is presented to the board on an annual 
basis and is aligned with Risk Appetite thresholds and includes Top Risk 
identification as required by internal frameworks. It is also aligned with limit 
requirements for capital allocation. Governance and oversight of strategic 
risk is facilitated by internal committees on a group-wide basis as well as 
strategic committees at the ICG, GCB and regional levels.

Citi works to ensure that strategic risks are adequately considered and 
addressed across its various risk management activities, and that strategic 
risks are assessed in the context of Citi’s risk appetite. Citi conducts a 
top-down, bottom-up risk identification process to identify risks, including 
strategic risks. Business segments undertake a quarterly risk identification 
process to systematically identify and document all material risks faced by 
Citi. Independent Risk Management oversees the Risk Identification process 
through regular reviews and coordinates identification and monitoring of 
Top Risks. Independent Risk Management also manages strategic risk by 
monitoring risk appetite thresholds in conjunction with various strategic risk 
committees, which are part of the governance structure that Citi has in place 
to manage its strategic risks.

For additional information on Citi’s strategic risks, see “Risk Factors—

Strategic Risks” above.

Citi carries out its objectives and fulfills its responsibilities through the 
Compliance Risk Framework, which is composed of the following integrated 
key activities, to holistically manage compliance risk:

•  Management of Citi’s compliance with laws, rules and regulations 
by identifying and analyzing changes, assessing the impact, and 
implementing appropriate policies, processes and controls;

•  Developing and providing compliance training to ensure colleagues are 

aware of and understand the key laws, rules and regulations;

•  Monitoring the Compliance Risk Appetite, which is articulated through 
qualitative compliance risk statements describing Citi’s appetite for 
certain types of risk and quantitative measures to monitor the Company’s 
compliance risk exposure;

•  Monitoring and testing of compliance risks and controls in assessing 
conformance with laws, rules, regulations and internal policies; and
•  Issue identification, escalation and remediation to drive accountability, 

including measurement and reporting of compliance risk metrics against 
established thresholds in support of the CRM Policy and Compliance 
Risk Appetite.

As discussed above, Citi is working to address the FRB and OCC consent 
orders, which include improvements to Citi’s Compliance Risk Framework 
and its Enterprise-wide application (for additional information regarding the 
consent orders, see “Citi’s Consent Order Compliance” above).

REPUTATION RISK
Citi’s reputation is a vital asset in building trust with its stakeholders and 
Citi is diligent in enhancing and protecting its reputation with its colleagues, 
customers, investors and regulators. To support this, Citi has developed a 
reputation risk framework. Under this framework, Citigroup and Citibank 
have implemented a risk appetite statement and related key indicators to 
monitor corporate activities and operations relative to our risk appetite. 
The framework also requires that business segments and regions escalate 
significant reputation risks that require review or mitigation through a 
Reputation Risk Committee or equivalent.

The Reputation Risk Committees, which are composed of Citi’s most 
senior executives, govern the process by which material reputation risks are 
identified, monitored, reported, managed, and escalated. The Reputation 
Risk Committees determine the appropriate actions to be taken in line 
with risk appetite and regulatory expectations, while promoting a culture 
of risk awareness and high standards of integrity and ethical behavior 
across the Company, consistent with Citi’s mission and value proposition. 
The Reputation Risk Committees in the business segments and regions 
are part of the governance infrastructure that Citi has in place to review 
the reputation risk posed by business activities, sales practices, product 
design, or perceived conflicts of interest. These committees may also raise 
potential reputation risks for due consideration by the Reputation Risk 
Committee at the corporate level. The Citigroup Reputation Risk Committee 
may escalate reputation risks to the Nomination, Governance and Public 
Affairs Committee or other appropriate committee of the Citigroup Board 
of Directors.

115

OTHER RISKS

LIBOR Transition Risk
The LIBOR administrator ceased publication of non-USD LIBOR and 
one week and two-month USD LIBOR on a representative basis on 
December 31, 2021, with plans to cease publication of all other USD LIBOR 
tenors on June 30, 2023. Regulators expect banks, including Citi, to have 
ceased entering into new contracts that reference USD LIBOR as a benchmark 
by December 31, 2021, except for limited circumstances as set out in 
regulatory guidance.

Citi recognizes that a transition away from and discontinuance of 

LIBOR presents various risks and challenges that could significantly impact 
financial markets and market participants, including Citi (for information 
about Citi’s risks from a transition away from and discontinuation of LIBOR 
or any other benchmark rates, see “Risk Factors—Other Risks” above). 
Accordingly, Citi has continued its efforts to identify and manage its LIBOR 
transition risks.

For example, Citi continues to closely monitor legislative, regulatory 
and other developments related to LIBOR transition matters and legislative 
relief. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) published 
the Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) Fallbacks Protocol for existing IBOR 
derivatives transactions, which became effective in January 2021. The 
IBOR Fallbacks Protocol provides derivatives market participants with new 
fallbacks for legacy and new derivatives contracts if both counterparties 
adhere to the protocol or engage in bilateral amendments (see discussion 
below regarding Citi’s adherence to the protocol). In April 2021, legislation 
was adopted in New York State that provides for the use of a statutory 
replacement for USD LIBOR in certain New York law legacy contracts. Similar 
federal legislation was passed in the House of Representatives in December 
2021 and is pending passage by the Senate, although there is no guarantee 
that the federal legislative proposal will become law.

In addition, Citi has established a LIBOR governance and implementation 

program focused on identifying and addressing the impact of LIBOR 
transition on Citi’s clients, operational capabilities and financial contracts. 
The program operates globally across Citi’s businesses and functions and 
includes active involvement of senior management, oversight by Citi’s Asset 
and Liability Committee and reporting to the Risk Management Committee 
of Citigroup’s Board of Directors. As part of the program, Citi has continued 
to implement its LIBOR transition action plans and associated roadmaps 
under the following key workstreams: program management; transition 
strategy and risk management; customer management, including internal 
communications and training, legal/contract management and product 
management; financial exposures and risk management; regulatory 
and industry engagement; operations and technology; and finance, 
risk, tax and treasury.

During 2021, Citi continued to participate in a number of working groups 

formed by global regulators, including the Alternative Reference Rates 
Committee (ARRC) convened by the FRB. These working groups promote 
and advance development of alternative reference rates and seek to identify 
and address potential challenges from any transition to such rates. Citi’s 

LIBOR transition action plans and associated roadmaps are intended to be 
consistent with the timelines recommended by these working groups. This 
includes the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s SOFR First Initiative, 
which is designed to promote derivatives trading in SOFR. Citi also continued 
to engage with regulators, financial accounting bodies and others on LIBOR 
transition matters.

Citi’s LIBOR transition efforts include, among other things, reducing its 
overall exposure to LIBOR, increasing Citi’s virtual client communication 
efforts and client transition facilitation, including outreach regarding new 
industry-led protocols and solutions, and using alternative reference rates in 
certain newly issued financial instruments and products. In the past several 
years, Citi has issued preferred stock and benchmark debt referencing the 
Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) and issued customer-related 
debt referencing SOFR and the Sterling Overnight Interbank Average Rate 
(SONIA), the recommended replacement rate for Sterling LIBOR. Citi has also 
originated and arranged loans referencing SOFR and SONIA and executed 
SOFR and SONIA-based derivatives contracts. Further, Citi has also been 
investing in its systems and infrastructure, as client activity moves away from 
LIBOR to alternative reference rates. Since the ARRC’s recommendation of 
CME Group’s Term SOFR in July 2021, Citi has focused on systems’ readiness 
to provide Term SOFR loan and derivatives to clients, where permitted.

In 2021, Citi also focused on remediating existing LIBOR contracts for 
which publication ceased on a representative basis on December 31, 2021. 
Substantially all of these contracts were remediated by December 31, 2021, 
and Citi continues to actively engage in and track the remediation of any 
remaining contracts after December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, Citi’s 
overall USD LIBOR gross notional exposure for contracts maturing after 
the LIBOR cessation date of June 30, 2023 was approximately $7.1 trillion, 
which includes approximately $4 trillion of cleared derivatives that are 
covered by planned Central Counterparty Clearing House (CCP) conversions, 
and approximately $2.4 trillion of bilateral derivatives that are covered by 
robust contract fallback language. The remaining exposure of approximately 
$0.7 trillion includes bilateral derivatives and cash products that will be 
addressed by 2022 contract remediation plans.

In addition, for LIBOR contracts that have not yet been remediated, Citi 

continues to review the effect of relevant legislative solutions, which are 
expected to facilitate the transition to replacement rates.

Climate Risk
Climate change presents immediate and long-term risks to Citi and its clients 
and customers, with the risks expected to increase over time. Climate risk 
refers to the risk of loss arising from climate change and is comprised of 
both physical risk and transition risk. Physical risk considers how chronic 
and acute climate change (e.g., increased storms, drought, fires, floods) can 
directly damage physical assets (e.g., real estate, crops) or otherwise impact 
their value or productivity. Transition risk considers how changes in policy, 
technology, business practices and market preferences to address climate 
change (e.g., carbon pricing policies, power generation shifts from fossil fuels 
to renewable energy) can lead to changes in the value of assets, commodities 
and companies.

116

Climate risk is an overarching risk that can act as a driver of other 
categories of risk, such as credit risk from obligors exposed to high climate 
risk, reputational risk from increased stakeholder concerns about financing 
high-carbon industries and operational risk from physical risks to Citi’s 
facilities and personnel.

Citi currently identifies climate risk as an “emerging risk” within its 
enterprise risk management framework. Emerging risks are risks or thematic 
issues that are either new to the landscape, or in the case of climate risk, 
existing risks that are rapidly changing or evolving in an escalating fashion, 
which are difficult to assess due to limited data or other uncertainties. 
For additional information on climate risk, see “Risk Factors—Other 
Risks” above.

Citi reviews factors related to climate risk under its longstanding 
Environmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM) Policy, which 
includes a focus on climate risk related to financed projects and clients in 
high-carbon sectors. Cautious of the credit risk of stranded assets, as well as 
the reputational risks associated with the coal sector due to its high carbon 
emissions, Citi began a phase-down of its financing of thermal coal mining 
companies in 2015 and of new coal-fired power plants in 2018. As Citi’s 
phase-down has continued, Citi’s ESRM Policy was updated to include a 
prohibition on all project-related financing of new coal-fired power plants 
and new or expanding thermal coal mines as well as clear timetables to 
reduce financing of companies with high exposure to coal fired power and 
coal mining who do not pursue low-carbon transition in the coming years. 
These sector approaches allow Citi to set a comprehensive and industry-wide 
approach to clarify its positions, set clear expectations for its clients and 
help address certain climate risk driven credit risk concerns while reducing 
reputation risk.

Citi continues to explore and test methodologies for quantifying how 
climate risks could impact the individual credit profiles of its clients across 
various sectors. To assist in embedding climate risk assessments in its credit 
assessment process, Citi is developing sector-specific climate risk assessments. 
Such climate risk assessments are designed to supplement publicly 
available client disclosures and data provided from third-party vendors and 
facilitate conversations with clients on their most material climate risks 
and management plans for adaptation and mitigation. In the near term, 
Citi’s assessments will consider sectors that have been identified as higher 
climate risk by Citi’s risk identification process. This will not only help Citi 
better understand its clients’ businesses and climate-related risks, but will 
also provide a source of climate data. Citi’s net zero plan is leading to the 
further integration of climate risk discussions into client engagement and 
client selection.

Furthermore, Citi is developing globally consistent principles and 
approaches for managing climate risk across Citi. Climate risk will be 
embedded into relevant policies and processes over time.

In addition, Citi continues to participate in financial industry 

collaborations to develop and pilot new methodologies and approaches for 
measuring and assessing the potential financial risks of climate change. 
Citi is also closely monitoring regulatory developments on climate risk and 
sustainable finance, and actively engaging with regulators on these topics.

For additional information about sustainability and other ESG matters at 

Citi, see “Sustainability and Other ESG Matters” above.

Country Risk

Top 25 Country Exposures 
The following table presents Citi’s top 25 exposures by country (excluding 
the U.S.) as of December 31, 2021. (Including the U.S., the total exposure as 
of December 31, 2021 to the top 25 countries would represent approximately 
98% of Citi’s exposure to all countries.) 

For purposes of the table, loan amounts are reflected in the country 
where the loan is booked, which is generally based on the domicile of the 
borrower. For example, a loan to a Chinese subsidiary of a Switzerland-based 
corporation will generally be categorized as a loan in China. In addition, 
Citi has developed regional booking centers in certain countries, most 

significantly in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland, in order to more 
efficiently serve its corporate customers. As an example, with respect to the 
U.K., only 33% of corporate loans presented in the table below are to U.K. 
domiciled entities (36% for unfunded commitments), with the balance of the 
loans predominately to European domiciled counterparties. Approximately 
87% of the total U.K. funded loans and 88% of the total U.K. unfunded 
commitments were investment grade as of December 31, 2021. 

Trading account assets and investment securities are generally categorized 
based on the domicile of the issuer of the security of the underlying reference 
entity. For additional information on the assets included in the table, see the 
footnotes to the table below.

ICG loans reflect funded corporate loans and private bank loans, net of unearned income. As of December 31, 2021, private bank loans in the table above totaled $31.8 billion, concentrated in the U.K. ($8.8 billion), 
Hong Kong ($8.6 billion) and Singapore ($7.5 billion).

(2)  Other funded includes other direct exposures such as accounts receivable, loans HFS, other loans in Corporate/Other and investments accounted for under the equity method.
(3)  Unfunded exposure includes unfunded corporate lending commitments, letters of credit and other contingencies.
(4)  Net mark-to-market counterparty risk on OTC derivatives and securities lending/borrowing transactions (repos). Exposures are shown net of collateral and inclusive of CVA. Includes margin loans.
(5) 
(6)  Trading account assets are shown on a net basis and include issuer risk on cash products and derivative exposure where the underlying reference entity/issuer is located in that country.

Investment securities include debt securities available-for-sale, recorded at fair market value, and debt securities held-to-maturity, recorded at amortized cost.

Russia
Citi operates both its ICG and GCB businesses in Russia, although the 
Company is currently pursuing the exit of its GCB business in the country. All 
of Citi’s domestic operations in Russia are conducted through a subsidiary 
of Citibank, which uses the Russian ruble as its functional currency. Citi’s 
net investment in Russia was approximately $1 billion as of December 31, 
2021. The majority of Citi’s net investment was hedged for foreign currency 
depreciation as of December 31, 2021, using forward foreign exchange 
contracts. Citi’s total third-party exposure was approximately $8.2 billion 
as of December 31, 2021. These assets primarily consisted of corporate 
and consumer loans, local government debt securities, reverse repurchase 
agreements, and cash on deposit and placements with the Bank of Russia 
and other financial institutions. A significant portion of Citi’s third-party 
exposures were funded with domestic deposit liabilities from both ICG and 
GCB clients. Further, Citi has approximately $1.6 billion of additional 
exposures to Russian counterparties that are not held on the Russian 
subsidiary and are not included in the $8.2 billion above.

The $5.4 billion in Russia credit and other exposures in the “Top 25 
Country Exposures” table above does not include approximately $1.0 billion 
of cash and placements with the Bank of Russia and other financial 
institutions and $1.8 billion of reverse repurchase agreements with 
various counterparties.

Citi continues to monitor the current Russia–Ukraine geopolitical 
situation and economic conditions and will mitigate its exposures and 
risks as appropriate. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—
Market-Related Risk,” “—Operational Risks” and “—Other Risks” above.

Argentina
Citi operates in Argentina through its ICG businesses. As of 
December 31, 2021, Citi’s net investment in its Argentine operations was 
approximately $1.5 billion. Citi uses the U.S. dollar as the functional 
currency for its operations in highly inflationary countries under U.S. GAAP. 
Citi uses Argentina’s official market exchange rate to remeasure its net 
Argentine peso-denominated assets into the U.S. dollar. As of December 31, 
2021, the official Argentine peso exchange rate against the U.S. dollar 
was 102.73.

The Central Bank of Argentina maintains certain capital and currency 
controls that generally restrict Citi’s ability to access U.S. dollars in Argentina 
and remit substantially all of its earnings from its Argentine operations. 
Citi’s net investment in its Argentine operations is likely to increase as Citi 
continues to generate net income from its Argentine franchise and the 
majority of its earnings cannot be remitted.

Due to the currency controls implemented by the Central Bank of 
Argentina, certain indirect foreign exchange mechanisms have developed 
that some Argentine entities may use to obtain U.S. dollars, generally at rates 
that are significantly higher than Argentina’s official exchange rate. Citibank 
Argentina is precluded from accessing these alternative mechanisms, 
and these exchange mechanisms cannot be used to remeasure Citi’s net 
monetary assets into the U.S. dollar under U.S. GAAP. Citi cannot predict 
future fluctuations in Argentina’s official market exchange rate or to what 
extent Citi may be able to access U.S. dollars at the official exchange rate in 
the future.

Citi economically hedges the foreign currency risk in its net Argentine 

peso-denominated assets to the extent possible and prudent using non-
deliverable forward (NDF) derivative instruments that are primarily executed 
outside of Argentina. As of December 31, 2021, the international NDF market 
had very limited liquidity, resulting in Citi being unable to economically 
hedge nearly all of its Argentine peso exposure. As a result, and to the extent 
that Citi does not execute NDF contracts for this unhedged exposure in the 
future, Citi would record devaluations on its net Argentine peso-denominated 
assets in earnings, without any benefit from a change in the fair value of 
derivative positions used to economically hedge the exposure. 

Citi continually evaluates its economic exposure to its Argentine 
counterparties and reserves for changes in credit risk and sovereign risk 
associated with its Argentine assets. Citi believes it has established appropriate 
allowances for credit losses on its Argentine loans, and appropriate fair value 
adjustments on Argentine assets and liabilities measured at fair value, for 
such risks under U.S. GAAP as of December 31, 2021. However, U.S. regulatory 
agencies may require Citi to record additional reserves in the future, 
increasing ICG’s cost of credit, based on the perceived country risk associated 
with its Argentine exposures. 

For additional information on Citi’s emerging markets risks, including 

those related to its Argentine exposures, see “Risk Factors” above.

FFIEC—Cross-Border Claims on Third Parties and Local 
Country Assets
Citi’s cross-border disclosures are set forth below, based on the country 
exposure bank regulatory reporting guidelines of the Federal Financial 
Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC). The following summarizes some 
of the FFIEC key reporting guidelines:

•  Amounts are based on the domicile of the ultimate obligor, counterparty, 

collateral (only including qualifying liquid collateral), issuer or 
guarantor, as applicable (e.g., a security recorded by a Citi U.S. entity 
but issued by the U.K. government is considered U.K. exposure; a loan 
recorded by a Citi Mexico entity to a customer domiciled in Mexico 
where the underlying collateral is held in Germany is considered 
German exposure). 

•  Amounts do not consider the benefit of collateral received for secured 

financing transactions (i.e., repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase 
agreements and securities loaned and borrowed) and are reported based 
on notional amounts. 

•  Netting of derivative receivables and payables, reported at fair value, is 
permitted, but only under a legally binding netting agreement with the 
same specific counterparty, and does not include the benefit of margin 
received or hedges.

•  Credit default swaps (CDS) are included based on the gross notional 

amount sold and purchased and do not include any offsetting CDS on the 
same underlying entity. 

•  Loans are reported without the benefit of hedges.

Given the requirements noted above, Citi’s FFIEC cross-border exposures 

and total outstandings tend to fluctuate, in some cases significantly, from 
period to period. As an example, because total outstandings under FFIEC 
guidelines do not include the benefit of margin or hedges, market volatility in 
interest rates, foreign exchange rates and credit spreads may cause significant 
fluctuations in the level of total outstandings, all else being equal.
