MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Second Quarter of 2021&#8212;Results Demonstrated Progress Across the Franchise 

As described further throughout this Executive Summary, during the second quarter of 2021: 

&#8226; Citi&#8217;s earnings increased significantly versus the prior-year period, largely reflecting an allowance for credit loss (ACL) release of $2.4 billion as a result of an improvement in portfolio quality as well as the continued improvement in Citi&#8217;s macroeconomic outlook (see &#8220;Cost of Credit&#8221; below). 

&#8226; Citi&#8217;s revenues declined, as continued strength in equity markets, the private bank and securities services in Institutional Clients Group ( ICG ) was more than offset by normalization in market activity in fixed income markets within ICG and lower average card loans in Global Consumer Banking ( GCB ), as well as the impact of lower interest rates. 

&#8226; Citi continued to invest in its transformation, including infrastructure supporting its risk and control environment, as well as other strategic investments. 

&#8226; Citi had deposit growth across GCB and ICG , reflecting consistent client engagement, with both corporate and consumer clients continuing to hold higher levels of liquidity, while loans declined reflecting higher repayment rates across both GCB and ICG . 

&#8226; Citi returned $4.1 billion of capital to its common shareholders in the form of $1.1 billion in dividends and $3.0 billion in common share repurchases, totaling approximately 40 million common shares, while maintaining robust regulatory capital ratios. Year-to-date, Citi returned nearly $7 billion of capital to its common shareholders, the maximum amount permitted under Federal Reserve Board rules. 

&#8226; During the quarter, the Federal Reserve Board communicated that Citi&#8217;s Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) requirement would be 3.0% for the four-quarter window of fourth quarter of 2021 to third quarter of 2022 (the 2021 CCAR cycle). For information on Citi&#8217;s SCB, see &#8220;Capital Resources&#8212;Stress Capital Buffer&#8221; below. 

For a discussion of trends, uncertainties and risks that will or could impact Citi&#8217;s businesses, results of operations and financial condition during the remainder of 2021, see this Executive Summary, each respective business&#8217;s results of operations and &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; below, and &#8220;COVID-19 Pandemic Overview,&#8221; &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Managing Global Risk&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Second Quarter of 2021 Results Summary 

Citigroup 

Citigroup reported net income of $6.2 billion, or $2.85 per share, compared to net income of $1.1 billion, or $0.38 per share, in the prior-year period. The increase in net income was driven by lower cost of credit, partially offset by lower revenues and higher expenses. Citigroup&#8217;s effective tax rate was 16% in the current quarter compared to 5% in the second quarter of 2020. The current quarter tax rate reflects certain tax benefit items related to non-U.S. operations. For additional information on Citi&#8217;s tax rate, see &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; below. Earnings per share also increased significantly, reflecting the increase in net income, as well as a slight decline in average diluted shares outstanding. 

Citigroup revenues of $17.5 billion in the second quarter of 2021 decreased 12% from the prior-year period, primarily reflecting lower revenues in both GCB and ICG . 

Citigroup&#8217;s end-of-period loans decreased 1% to $677 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation 

into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes (FX translation), Citigroup&#8217;s end-of-period loans decreased 3%, reflecting a higher level of repayments in both GCB and ICG . Citigroup&#8217;s end-of-period deposits increased 6% to $1.3 trillion. Excluding the impact of FX translation, Citigroup&#8217;s end-of-period deposits increased 4%, primarily driven by growth in both GCB and ICG , reflecting consistent client engagement and elevated levels of liquidity in the financial system. (Citi&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition excluding the impact of FX translation are non-GAAP financial measures.) 

Expenses 

Citigroup operating expenses of $11.2 billion increased 7% from the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of FX translation, expenses increased 4%, reflecting a normalization relative to a low comparison in the prior-year period related to the pandemic, along with continued investments in Citi&#8217;s transformation, as well as other strategic investments, partially offset by efficiency savings. 

As previously announced, Citi continues to expect to incur higher expenses in 2021 compared to 2020, as it accelerates certain strategic investments and continues to invest in its transformation as noted above. 

Cost of Credit 

Citi&#8217;s total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims was a benefit of $1.1 billion, compared to a cost of $8.2 billion in the prior-year period, driven by net ACL reserve releases of $2.4 billion across ICG , GCB and Corporate/Other . Citi&#8217;s net ACL release primarily reflected improvements in portfolio quality, as well as the continued improvement in Citi&#8217;s macroeconomic outlook. For additional information on Citi&#8217;s ACL, see &#8220;Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates&#8212;Citi&#8217;s Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)&#8221; below. 

Net credit losses of $1.3 billion decreased 39% from the prior-year period. Consumer net credit losses of $1.2 billion decreased 33%, primarily reflecting lower loan volumes and improved delinquencies in the North America cards portfolios. Corporate net credit losses decreased to $89 million from $324 million in the prior-year period, driven by improvements in overall portfolio credit quality. 

For additional information on Citi&#8217;s consumer and corporate credit costs, see each respective business&#8217;s results of operations and &#8220;Credit Risk&#8221; below. 

Capital 

Citigroup&#8217;s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio was 11.8% as of June 30, 2021, based on the Basel III Standardized Approaches for determining risk-weighted assets, compared to 11.5% as of June 30, 2020, based on the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework for determining risk-weighted assets. The increase in the ratio reflected net income, partially offset by the return of capital to common shareholders and an increase in risk-weighted assets. 

Citigroup&#8217;s Supplementary Leverage ratio as of June 30, 2021 was 5.8%, compared to 6.6% as of June 30, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by the expiration of a temporary relief granted by the Federal Reserve Board. For additional information on Citi&#8217;s capital ratios, see &#8220;Capital Resources&#8221; below. 

Global Consumer Banking 

GCB net income of $1.8 billion compared to a net loss of $703 million in the prior-year period, reflecting lower cost of credit, partially offset by lower revenues and higher expenses. GCB operating expenses of $4.6 billion increased 10% from the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of FX translation, expenses increased 7%, reflecting continued investments in Citi&#8217;s transformation, as well as other strategic investments, an acceleration in marketing and higher volume-related costs, partially offset by efficiency savings. 

GCB revenues of $6.8 billion decreased 7%. Excluding the impact of FX translation, revenues decreased 10%, as continued strong deposit growth and momentum in investment management were more than offset by lower average card loans and lower deposit spreads across all three regions. 

North America GCB revenues of $4.2 billion decreased 11%, with lower revenues across Citi-branded cards, Citi retail services and retail banking. Citi-branded cards revenues of $2.0 billion decreased 12%, reflecting lower average loans. Citi retail services revenues of $1.2 billion decreased 14%, primarily driven by lower average loans. Retail banking revenues of $1.0 billion decreased 7%, as the benefit of stronger deposit volumes was more than offset by lower deposit spreads, as well as lower mortgage revenues. 

Year-over-year, North America GCB average deposits of $204 billion increased 18%, assets under management of $85 billion increased 23% and average retail banking loans of $50 billion decreased 4%. Average Citi-branded card loans of $79 billion decreased 4%, while average Citi retail services loans of $42 billion decreased 8%, both reflecting higher payment rates. Citi-branded card purchase sales of $104 billion increased 40% and Citi retail services purchase sales of $24 billion also increased 40%, reflecting a continued recovery in 

sales activity from the low levels in the prior-year period related to the pandemic. For additional information on the results of operations of North America GCB for the second quarter of 2021, see &#8220; Global Consumer Banking &#8212; North America GCB &#8221; below. 

International GCB revenues (consisting of Latin America GCB and Asia GCB (which includes the results of operations in certain EMEA countries)) of $2.6 billion increased 1% versus the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of FX translation, international GCB revenues declined 6%, largely reflecting the continued impact of the pandemic. On this basis, Latin America GCB revenues declined 11%, driven by lower loan volumes and lower deposit spreads, partially offset by growth in assets under management. Asia GCB revenues decreased 3%, as strong investment revenues were more than offset by lower deposit spreads. For additional information on the results of operations of Latin America GCB and Asia GCB for the second quarter of 2021, including the impact of FX translation, see &#8220; Global Consumer Banking &#8212; Latin America GCB &#8221; and &#8220; Global Consumer Banking &#8212; Asia GCB &#8221; below. 

Year-over-year, excluding the impact of FX translation, international GCB average deposits of $149 billion increased 8%, average retail banking loans of $76 billion increased 1% and assets under management of $147 billion increased 15%. On this basis, international GCB average card loans of $21 billion decreased 8%, reflecting higher payments rates, while card purchase sales of $24 billion increased 26%, reflecting a 

continued recovery in sales activity from the low levels in the 

prior-year period related to the pandemic. 

Institutional Clients Group 

ICG net income of $3.8 billion increased significantly, driven by lower cost of credit, partially offset by lower revenues and higher expenses. ICG operating expenses increased 4% to $6.3 billion. Excluding the impact of FX translation, expenses increased 2%, primarily driven by continued investments in Citi&#8217;s transformation, along with other strategic investments, partially offset by lower incentive compensation and efficiency savings. 

ICG revenues of $10.4 billion decreased 14%, primarily reflecting a 30% decline in Markets and securities services revenues, partially offset by a 6% increase in Banking revenues. The increase in Banking revenues included the impact of $37 million of losses on loan hedges related to corporate lending, compared to aggregate losses of $431 million related to corporate lending ($414 million) and the private bank ($17 million) in the prior-year period. 

Excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, Banking revenues of $5.6 billion decreased 1%, as higher revenues in the private bank and investment banking were more than offset by lower revenues in corporate lending and treasury and trade solutions. Investment banking revenues of $1.8 billion increased 1%, primarily reflecting revenue growth in advisory and equity underwriting, largely offset by lower revenues in debt underwriting. Advisory revenues increased 77% to $405 million, equity underwriting revenues increased 11% to $544 million and debt underwriting revenues decreased 21% to $823 million. 

Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $2.3 billion declined 1%, or 2% excluding the impact of FX translation, as 

higher fee revenues, reflecting strong client engagement, and growth in trade were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates. Private bank revenues increased 6% to $1.0 

billion. Excluding the impact of losses on loan hedges, private bank revenues increased 4%, driven by higher fees and 

lending volumes, partially offset by the impact of lower 

interest rates. Corporate lending revenues of $511 million increased from $232 million. Excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, corporate lending revenues of $548 million decreased 15%, primarily due to lower loan volumes. 

Markets and securities services revenues of $4.8 billion decreased 30%. Fixed income markets revenues of $3.2 billion decreased 43% versus a strong prior-year period in both rates and spread products. Equity markets revenues of $1.1 billion increased 37%, driven by strong performance in derivatives and prime finance, reflecting solid client activity and favorable market conditions. Securities services revenues of $672 million increased 9%. Excluding the impact of FX translation, securities services revenues increased 5%, primarily reflecting growth in fee revenues, driven by growth in assets under custody and settlement volumes, partially offset by lower deposit spreads. For additional information on the results of operations of ICG for the second quarter of 2021, see &#8220; Institutional Clients Group &#8221; below. 

Corporate/Other 

Corporate/Other net income was $542 million in the second quarter of 2021, compared to a net loss of $58 million in the prior-year period, primarily driven by certain income tax benefit items related to non-U.S. operations in the current period (approximately $450 million), as well as a net ACL release on Citi&#8217;s residual legacy portfolio versus a build in the prior-year period. Operating expenses of $378 million increased 14%, primarily driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation. 

Corporate/Other revenues of $267 million declined from $290 million in the prior-year period, as positive marks on investments were more than offset by the absence of AFS gains. For additional information on the results of operations of Corporate/Other for the second quarter of 2021, see &#8220; Corporate/Other &#8221; below. 

COVID-19 PANDEMIC 

Due to the continued virus contagion and challenges in vaccine distribution, the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to have adverse, albeit relatively lessening, impacts on macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. and around the world. Despite these impacts, Citi has maintained strong capital and liquidity positions with consistently strong business operations. For information on Citi&#8217;s support of its colleagues, customers and communities and its management of pandemic risks, see &#8220;COVID-19 Pandemic Overview&#8221; in Citigroup&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(1) In the fourth quarter of 2020, Citi revised the 2020 second quarter accounting conclusion for its variable post-charge-off third-party collection costs from a &#8220;change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle&#8221; to a &#8220;change in accounting principle,&#8221; which required an adjustment to January 1, 2020 opening retained earnings, rather than 2020 net income. As a result, Citi&#8217;s full-year and quarterly results for 2020 were revised to reflect this change as if it were effective as of January 1, 2020, as follows: an increase to beginning retained earnings on January 1, 2020 of $330 million and a decrease of $443 million in the allowance for credit losses on loans, as well as a $113 million decrease in other assets related to income taxes; a decrease of $18 million to provisions for credit losses on loans in the first quarter and increases of $339 million and $122 million to provisions for credit losses on loans in the second and third quarters, respectively; and increases in operating expenses of $49 million and $45 million with a corresponding decrease in net credit losses, in the first and second quarters, respectively. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

(2) Certain series of preferred stock have semiannual payment dates. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

(3) The return on average common stockholders&#8217; equity is calculated using net income less preferred stock dividends divided by average common stockholders&#8217; equity. The return on average total Citigroup stockholders&#8217; equity is calculated using net income divided by average Citigroup stockholders&#8217; equity. 

(4) RoTCE and TBV are non-GAAP financial measures. For information on RoTCE and TBV, see &#8220;Capital Resources&#8212;Tangible Common Equity, Book Value Per Share, Tangible Book Value Per Share and Return on Equity&#8221; below. 

(5) Citi&#8217;s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach framework as of June 30, 2021, and under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework as of June 30, 2020, whereas Citi&#8217;s reportable Total Capital ratio was derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework for both periods presented. 

(6) Dividend payout ratio is calculated as dividends declared per common share as a percentage of net income per diluted share. 

(7) Total payout ratio is calculated as total common dividends declared plus common share repurchases as a percentage of net income available to common shareholders ( Net income less preferred dividends). See &#8220;Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders&#8217; Equity,&#8221; Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and &#8220;Equity Security Repurchases&#8221; below for the component details.

2Q21 vs. 2Q20 

Net income was $1.3 billion, compared to a net loss of $734 million in the prior-year period, reflecting significantly lower cost of credit, partially offset by lower revenues and higher expenses. 

Revenues decreased 11%, reflecting lower revenues in Citi-branded cards, Citi retail services and retail banking. 

Retail banking revenues decreased 7%, as the benefit of stronger deposit volumes and growth in assets under management (increase of 23%, reflecting favorable market conditions, as well as strong client engagement) was more than offset by lower deposit spreads, reflecting lower interest rates, as well as lower mortgage revenues. Average deposits increased 18%, driven by government stimulus payments, as well as continued strategic efforts to drive organic growth. 

Cards revenues decreased 13%. Citi-branded cards revenues decreased 12%, primarily reflecting lower average loans (down 4%), driven by higher payment rates, reflecting increased customer liquidity from government stimulus and relief programs. Purchase sales increased 40%, reflecting a continued recovery in sales activity from the prior-year period low levels driven by the pandemic. 

Citi retail services revenues decreased 14%, primarily driven by lower average loans (down 8%), reflecting higher payment rates from the increased customer liquidity. Purchase sales increased 40%, reflecting a continued recovery in sales activity from the prior-year period low levels driven by the pandemic. 

Expenses increased 8%, primarily driven by continued investments in Citi&#8217;s transformation, as well as other strategic investments and an acceleration in marketing, partially offset by efficiency savings. 

Provisions reflected a benefit of $91 million, compared to costs of $3.3 billion in the prior-year period, primarily driven by a net ACL release in the current quarter compared to a net ACL build in the prior-year period, as well as lower net credit losses. Net credit losses decreased 44%, consisting of lower net credit losses in both Citi-branded cards (down 40% to $467 million) and Citi retail services (down 49% to $326 million), primarily driven by lower loan volumes and improved delinquencies, as a result of higher payment rates due to higher levels of liquidity from government stimulus and other relief programs. 

The net ACL release was $0.9 billion, compared to a build of $1.8 billion in the prior-year period, reflecting improvement in portfolio quality and Citi&#8217;s improved macroeconomic outlook. For additional information on Citi&#8217;s ACL, see &#8220;Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates&#8221; below.

Year-to-date, North America GCB experienced similar trends to those described above. Net income was $3.2 billion, compared to a net loss of $1.7 billion in the prior-year period, as significantly lower cost of credit more than offset lower revenues and higher expenses. 

Revenues decreased 13%, reflecting lower revenues in retail banking, Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services.

2Q21 vs. 2Q20 

Net income was $352 million, compared to a net loss of $3 million in the prior-year period, reflecting significantly lower cost of credit, partially offset by lower revenues and higher expenses. 

Revenues decreased 11%, reflecting lower cards and retail banking revenues, largely due to the impact of the pandemic. 

Retail banking revenues decreased 5%, primarily driven by lower loan volumes and deposit spreads, partially offset by growth in assets under management. Average loans decreased 14%, reflecting the impact of the pandemic on customer activity. Assets under management increased 8%, reflecting favorable market conditions, as well as strong client engagement. 

Cards revenues decreased 24%, primarily driven by lower average loans (down 13%), reflecting higher payment rates, as well as the continued impact of the pandemic on customer activity. Purchase sales increased 39%, reflecting a continued recovery in sales activity from the low levels in the prior-year period driven by the pandemic. 

Expenses increased 5%, primarily driven by continued investments in Citi&#8217;s transformation, as well as other strategic investments, partially offset by efficiency savings. 

Provisions reflected a benefit of $167 million, compared to costs of $495 million in the prior-year period, primarily driven by a net ACL release in the current period compared to a net ACL build in the prior-year period. Net credit losses increased 6%, driven by the expiration of consumer relief programs and the continued adverse impacts of the pandemic in Mexico. 

The net ACL release was $423 million, compared to a build of $239 million in the prior-year period. The release reflected an improvement in portfolio quality, as well as the impact of Citi&#8217;s improved macroeconomic outlook and lower loan volumes. For additional information on Citi&#8217;s ACL, see &#8220;Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates&#8221; below.

2Q21 vs. 2Q20 

Net income was $173 million, compared to $28 million in the prior-year period, reflecting significantly lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher expenses and lower revenues. 

Revenues decreased 3%, primarily reflecting lower retail banking revenues, largely due to the continued impact of the pandemic, including lower interest rates. 

Retail banking revenues decreased 4%, as solid growth in both investment revenues and deposits was more than offset by lower deposit spreads due to lower interest rates and lower FX and insurance revenues. Assets under management increased 21% and investment sales increased 15%, reflecting the impact of market conditions, as well as strong client engagement. Average deposits increased 9% and average loans increased 4%. The decline in retail banking revenues was also impacted by a 5% decrease in retail lending revenues, reflecting a decline in personal loans and mortgages driven by spread compression. 

Cards revenues were largely unchanged, as lower average loans (down 6%, largely reflecting higher payment rates) were offset by higher spending-related revenues (purchase sales up 23%), reflecting a continued recovery in sales activity from the pandemic-driven low levels in the prior-year period. 

Expenses increased 8%, primarily driven by continued investments in Citi&#8217;s transformation, as well as other strategic investments, partially offset by efficiency savings. 

Provisions decreased 73%, primarily driven by a net ACL release compared to a net ACL build in the prior-year period, as well as lower net credit losses. Net credit losses decreased 6%, primarily reflecting lower cards loan volumes and improved delinquencies. 

The net ACL release was $60 million, compared to a build of $262 million in the prior-year period. The release reflected an improvement in portfolio quality as well as the impact of Citi&#8217;s improved macroeconomic outlook. For

(1) Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the private bank and corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. Gains (losses) on loan hedges include the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. The fixed premium costs of these hedges are netted against the private bank and corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. Gains (losses) on loan hedges include $(37) million and $(109) million related to the corporate loan portfolio and $0 million and $(9) million related to the private bank for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021. Gains (losses) on loan hedges include $(414) million and $340 million related to the corporate loan portfolio and $(17) million and $45 million related to the private bank for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. Citigroup&#8217;s results of operations excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures. 

(2) Excludes principal transactions revenues of ICG businesses other than Markets , primarily treasury and trade solutions and the private bank. 

(3) Citi assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items. For example, securities that generate Net interest revenue may be risk managed by derivatives that are recorded in Principal transactions revenue. For a description of the composition of these revenue line items, see Notes 4, 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The discussion of the results of operations for ICG below excludes (where noted) the impact of gains (losses) on hedges of accrual loans, which are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above. 

2Q21 vs. 2Q20 

Net income of $3.8 billion increased significantly versus the prior-year period, primarily driven by lower cost of credit, partially offset by lower revenues and higher expenses. 

Revenues declined 14%, reflecting lower Markets and securities services revenues (decrease of 30%), partially offset by higher Banking revenues (increase of 6% including the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges). Excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, Banking revenues were down 1%, driven by lower revenues in corporate lending and treasury and trade solutions, partially offset by higher revenues in the private bank and investment banking. Markets and securities services revenues were down 30%, primarily reflecting a normalization in fixed income revenues, partially offset by growth in equity markets and securities services. 

Within Banking : 

&#8226; Investment banking revenues increased 1%, as higher revenues in both advisory and equity underwriting were largely offset by lower debt underwriting revenues. Advisory revenues increased 77%, reflecting strength in North America and EMEA , with overall growth in the market wallet as well as wallet share gains. Equity underwriting revenues increased 11%, primarily driven by solid performance in EMEA , partially offset by North America , largely reflecting growth in the market wallet. Debt underwriting revenues decreased 21%, primarily reflecting a decline in North America , largely driven by a decline in wallet share, as activity was primarily concentrated in non-investment-grade underwriting, while Citi skews toward investment-grade underwriting, as well as a strong prior-year comparison, particularly in investment-grade underwriting. 

&#8226; Treasury and trade solutions revenues decreased 1%. Excluding the impact of FX translation, revenues declined 2%, reflecting a decline in the cash business, partially offset by an increase in trade. Cash revenues decreased, as strong growth in fee revenues reflecting solid client 

engagement and growth in transaction volumes, including 

the early signs of recovery in commercial cards from the low levels in the prior-year period due to the pandemic, was more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates. In trade, revenues increased across North America , EMEA and Asia , primarily reflecting improved loan spreads. End-of-period trade loans grew 6% (4% excluding the 

impact of FX translation), reflecting increasing client demand and improving macroeconomic conditions. 

&#8226; Corporate lending revenues were $511 million versus $232 million in the prior-year period, including the impact of losses on loan hedges. Excluding the impact of losses on loan hedges, revenues decreased 15%, primarily driven by lower loan volumes, reflecting continued weakness in demand given stronger client liquidity positions as well as higher repayment rates. 

&#8226; Private bank revenues increased 6%. Excluding the impact of losses on loan hedges, revenues increased 4%, primarily reflecting strength in North America and EMEA . The increase in revenues was driven by higher fees, including higher managed investments revenue and higher lending volumes and spreads, reflecting solid client engagement, partially offset by lower deposit spreads and lower capital markets revenues. 

Within Markets and securities services : 

&#8226; Fixed income markets revenues decreased 43%, with declines across all regions, reflecting a comparison to a strong prior-year period in rates and spread products and a normalization in market activity. Non-interest revenues decreased, reflecting a normalization in activity and volatility across rates and currencies and spreads products. Net interest revenues also decreased, largely reflecting a change in the mix of trading positions. 

Rates and currencies revenues decreased 44%, driven by the normalization in market activity and a comparison to a strong prior-year period that included elevated levels of volatility related to the pandemic. 

Spread products and other fixed income revenues decreased 39%, driven by a comparison to a strong prior-year period in flow trading and commodities, reflecting the normalization in activity, including lower volatility. 

&#8226; Equity markets revenues increased 37%, reflecting strength in equity derivatives and prime finance, partially offset by a modest decline in cash equities. Equity derivatives revenues increased, reflecting a favorable year-over-year comparison as well as an increase in client activity in structured products, particularly in North America and EMEA . Prime finance revenues increased, primarily driven by favorable market conditions, increased dividend activity compared to the prior-year period and growth in client balances. Non-interest 

revenues increased, primarily driven by higher principal transactions, largely due to the higher client activity. 

&#8226; Securities services revenues increased 9%. Excluding the impact of FX translation, revenues increased 5%, as an increase in fee revenues, driven by growth in assets under custody and settlement volumes, was partially offset by a decline in deposit spreads due to the continued low interest rate environment. 

Expenses were up 4%. Excluding the impact of FX translation, expenses increased 2%, primarily driven by continued investments in Citi&#8217;s transformation, along with strategic investments, partially offset by lower incentive compensation and efficiency savings. 

Provisions reflected a benefit of $810 million compared to costs of $3.9 billion in the prior-year period, driven by an ACL release and lower net credit losses. Net credit losses declined to $89 million from $324 million in the prior-year period, driven by improvements in overall portfolio quality. 

The ACL release for the quarter was $0.9 billion, compared to a build of $3.5 billion in the prior-year period. The release was primarily driven by an improvement in portfolio quality as well as Citi&#8217;s improved macroeconomic outlook. For additional information on Citi&#8217;s ACL, see &#8220;Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates&#8221; below.

2Q21 YTD vs. 2Q20 YTD 

Year-to-date, ICG experienced similar trends to those described above. Net income increased 80%, driven by the same factors described above. 

Revenues declined 8%, driven by a 14% decrease in Markets and securities services revenues as well as a 1% decrease in Banking revenues (including the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges). Excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, Banking revenues increased 4%, as growth in investment banking and the private bank was partially offset by a decrease in treasury and trade solutions and corporate lending. Markets and securities services revenues decreased 14%, primarily driven by a normalization in fixed income markets revenues due to a strong prior-year period, partially offset by growth in equity markets and securities services. 

Within Banking : 

&#8226; Investment banking revenues increased 20%. Advisory revenues increased 12%, driven by growth in the market wallet. Equity underwriting revenues increased significantly, primarily driven by strength in the market wallet as well as wallet share gains. Debt underwriting revenues decreased 10%, driven by the same factors described above. 

&#8226; Treasury and trade solutions revenues decreased 6% including and excluding the impact of FX translation, driven by the same factors described above. 

&#8226; Corporate lending revenues decreased 36%, including the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges. Excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, revenues decreased 6%, primarily driven by the same factors described above. The decrease in revenues was partially offset by lower marks on the portfolio, given lower market volatility than in the first half of 2020 due to the pandemic. 

&#8226; Private bank revenues increased 3%. Excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, revenues increased 6%, driven by the same factors described above. 

Within Markets and securities services : 

&#8226; Fixed income markets revenues decreased 25%, reflecting a strong prior-year comparison particularly in rates and currencies, while spread products and other revenues declined slightly. 

&#8226; Equity markets revenues increased 31%, primarily driven by equity derivatives and prime finance, as well as modestly higher cash equity revenues. 

&#8226; Securities services revenues increased 5%. Excluding the impact of FX translation, revenues increased 2%, driven by the same factors described above. 

Expenses increased 6%, driven by the same factors described above. 

Provisions reflected a net benefit of $2.6 billion, compared to costs of $5.9 billion, driven by the same factors described above. 

CORPORATE/OTHER 

Corporate/Other includes certain unallocated costs of global staff functions (including finance, risk, human resources, legal and compliance), other corporate expenses and unallocated global operations and technology expenses and income taxes, as well as Corporate Treasury, certain North America legacy consumer loan portfolios, other legacy assets and discontinued operations (for additional information on Corporate/Other , see &#8220;Citigroup Segments&#8221; above). At June 30, 2021, Corporate/Other had $101 billion in assets.

2Q21 vs. 2Q20 

Net income was $542 million, compared to a net loss of $58 million in the prior-year period, primarily driven by certain income tax benefit items related to non-U.S. operations in the current quarter (see &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; below), as well as significantly lower cost of credit, partially offset by lower revenues and higher expenses. 

Revenues decreased 8%, as positive marks on investments were more than offset by the absence of AFS gains. 

Expenses increased 14%, primarily driven by the impact of FX translation. 

Provisions reflected a benefit of $121 million, compared to costs of $164 million in the prior-year period, primarily driven by a net ACL release on legacy assets in the current quarter. 

The net ACL release was $102 million, compared to a build of $166 million in the prior-year period, primarily reflecting Citi&#8217;s improved macroeconomic outlook. For additional information on Citi&#8217;s ACL, see &#8220;Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates&#8221; below.

2Q21 YTD vs. 2Q20 YTD 

Net income was $409 million, compared to a net loss of $314 million in the prior-year period, largely reflecting the same factors described above. 

Revenues decreased 7%, primarily reflecting the same factors described above. 

Expenses increased 19%, driven by the same factors described above, as well as an increase in brand marketing and transformation spend. 

Provisions reflected a benefit of $233 million, compared to costs of $356 million in the prior-year period, driven by the same factors described above. The ACL release was $216 million, compared to a build of $362 million in the prior-year period, driven by the same factors described above. 

CAPITAL RESOURCES 

For additional information about capital resources, including Citi&#8217;s capital management, regulatory capital buffers, the stress testing component of capital planning and current regulatory capital standards and developments, see &#8220;Capital Resources&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

During the second quarter of 2021, Citi returned a total of $4.1 billion of capital to common shareholders in the form of share repurchases (approximately 4 0 million common shares) and dividends. For additional information, see &#8220;Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Repurchases of Equity Securities and Dividends&#8221; below. Year-to-date, Citi returned nearly $7 billion of capital to its common shareholders, the maximum amount permitted under Federal Reserve Board rules. 

Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio 

Citi&#8217;s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio was 11.8% as of June 30, 2021 under the Basel III Standardized Approach, and 11.8% as of March 31, 2021 and 11.7% as of December 31, 2020, both under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework. 

Citi&#8217;s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio remained unchanged from March 31, 2021, as net income of $6.2 billion was offset by the return of $4.1 billion of capital to common shareholders in the current quarter, an increase in risk-weighted assets and a reduction in the benefit of the modified CECL transition provision as a result of the ACL releases during the quarter. 

Citi&#8217;s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio increased from year-end 2020, primarily driven by the year-to-date net income of $14.1 billion, partially offset by the return of $6.7 billion of capital to common shareholders, adverse net movements in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) , an increase in risk-weighted assets and a reduction in the benefit of the modified CECL transition provision as a result of the ACL releases during the year. 

Stress Capital Buffer 

In June 2021, the Federal Reserve Board communicated that Citi&#8217;s Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) requirement will increase from the current requirement of 2.5% to 3.0% for the four-quarter window of October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022. Incorporating this interim SCB (which will be finalized by the end of August 2021), and the current GSIB surcharge of 3.0%, results in an effective minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital requirement of 10.5% under the Standardized Approach, effective October 1, 2021. Citi&#8217;s effective minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital requirement under the Advanced Approaches (using the fixed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer) will remain unchanged at 10.0%. 

The SCB applies to Citigroup only. The regulatory capital framework applicable to Citibank, including the Capital Conservation Buffer, is unchanged by Citigroup&#8217;s SCB. For additional information regarding the SCB, see &#8220;Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Capital Buffers&#8212;Stress Capital Buffer&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information regarding CCAR and DFAST, see &#8220;Capital Resources&#8212;Stress Testing Component of Capital Planning&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Expiration of Federal Reserve Board Limitations on Capital Distributions 

In June 2021, the Federal Reserve Board announced that the temporary limitations placed on capital distributions in 2020 would be lifted. Commencing July 1, 2021, Citi&#8217;s common stock dividends and share repurchases are no longer subject to limitations based on the average of Citi&#8217;s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters. 

All large banks, including Citi, remain subject to limitations on capital distributions in the event of a breach of any regulatory capital buffers, including the Stress Capital Buffer, with the degree of such restrictions based on the extent to which the buffers are breached. For additional information, see &#8220;Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Capital Buffers&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Strategic Risks&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(1) Citi&#8217;s effective minimum risk-based capital requirements include the 2.5% Stress Capital Buffer and 3.0% GSIB surcharge under the Standardized Approach, and the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and 3.0% GSIB surcharge under the Advanced Approaches (all of which must be composed of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital). The effective minimum requirements are applicable through September 30, 2021. See &#8220;Stress Capital Buffer&#8221; above for additional information. 

(2) Citi has elected to apply the modified transition provision related to the impact of the CECL accounting standard on regulatory capital, as provided by the U.S. banking agencies&#8217; September 2020 final rule. Under the modified CECL transition provision, the changes in retained earnings (after-tax), deferred tax assets (DTAs) arising from temporary differences and the allowance for credit losses upon the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date have been deferred and will phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022. For the ongoing impact of CECL, Citigroup is allowed to adjust retained earnings and the allowance for credit losses in an amount equal to 25% of the change in the allowance for credit losses (pretax) for each period between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The cumulative adjustments to retained earnings and the allowance for credit losses between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021 will also phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022, along with the deferred impacts related to the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date. Corresponding adjustments to average on-balance sheet assets are reflected in quarterly adjusted average total assets and Total Leverage Exposure. In addition, the increase in DTAs arising from temporary differences upon the January 1, 2020 adoption date has been deducted from risk-weighted assets (RWA) and will phase in to RWA at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022. 

(3) Citi&#8217;s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach as of June 30, 2021, and under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, whereas Citi&#8217;s reportable Total Capital ratio was derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework for all periods presented. 

(4) Tier 1 Leverage ratio denominator. Represents quarterly average total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital. 

(5) Supplementary Leverage ratio denominator. Commencing with the second quarter of 2020 and continuing through the first quarter of 2021, Citigroup&#8217;s Total Leverage Exposure temporarily excluded U.S. Treasuries and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. The Supplementary Leverage ratio as of the second quarter of 2021 declined approximately 100 basis points as a result of the expiration of the temporary relief. For additional information, see &#8220;Capital Resources&#8212;Current Regulatory Capital Standards&#8212;Temporary Supplementary Leverage Ratio Relief&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

As indicated in the table above, Citigroup&#8217;s risk-based capital ratios at June 30, 2021 were in excess of the stated and effective minimum requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules. In addition, Citi was also &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under current federal bank regulatory agency definitions as of June 30, 2021.

(1) Issuance costs of $125 million and $156 million related to outstanding noncumulative perpetual preferred stock as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, are excluded from common stockholders&#8217; equity and are netted against such preferred stock in accordance with Federal Reserve Board regulatory reporting requirements, which differ from those under U.S. GAAP. 

(2) Citi has elected to apply the modified transition provision related to the impact of the CECL accounting standard on regulatory capital, as provided by the U.S. banking agencies&#8217; September 2020 final rule. Under the modified CECL transition provision, the changes in retained earnings (after-tax) and the allowance for credit losses upon the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date have been deferred and will phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022. For the ongoing impact of CECL, Citigroup is allowed to adjust retained earnings and the allowance for credit losses in an amount equal to 25% of the change in the allowance for credit losses (pretax) for each period between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The cumulative adjustments to retained earnings and the allowance for credit losses between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021 will also phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022, along with the deferred impacts related to the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date. 

(3) Includes goodwill &#8220;embedded&#8221; in the valuation of significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions. 

Footnotes continue on the following page. 

(4) Of Citi&#8217;s $24.5 billion of net DTAs at June 30, 2021, $15.1 billion was includable in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital pursuant to the U.S. Basel III rules, while $9.4 billion was excluded. Excluded from Citi&#8217;s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital as of June 30, 2021 was $11.2 billion of net DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit tax carry-forwards. The amount excluded was reduced by $1.8 billion of net DTLs primarily associated with goodwill and certain other intangible assets that are separately deducted from capital. DTAs arising from tax carry-forwards are required to be entirely deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules. DTAs arising from temporary differences are required to be deducted from capital only if these DTAs exceed 10%/15% limitations under the U.S. Basel III rules. Citi&#8217;s DTAs do not currently exceed these limitations and, therefore, are not subject to deduction from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, but are subject to risk weighting at 250%. 

(5) Represents Citigroup Capital XIII trust preferred securities, which are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules. 

(6) Banking entities are required to be in compliance with the Volcker Rule of the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits conducting certain proprietary investment activities and limits their ownership of, and relationships with, covered funds. Commencing January 1, 2021, Citi no longer deducts permitted market making positions in third-party covered funds from Tier 1 Capital, in accordance with the revised Volcker Rule 2.0 issued by the U.S. agencies in November 2019. Upon the removal of the capital deduction, permitted market making positions in third-party covered funds are included in risk-weighted assets. 

(7) Represents the amount of non-grandfathered trust preferred securities eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules, which will be fully phased out of Tier 2 Capital by January 1, 2022. 

(8) Under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess allowance for credit losses being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted assets, which differs from the Advanced Approaches framework, in which eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent that the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets. The total amount of eligible credit reserves in excess of expected credit losses that were eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital, subject to limitation, under the Advanced Approaches framework was $5.2 billion and $5.1 billion at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

(1) Represents the daily average of on-balance sheet assets for the quarter. 

(2) Citi has elected to apply the modified transition provision related to the impact of the CECL accounting standard on regulatory capital, as provided by the U.S. banking agencies&#8217; September 2020 final rule. Under the modified CECL transition provision, the changes in DTAs arising from temporary differences and the allowance for credit losses upon the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date have been deferred and will phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022. For the ongoing impact of CECL, Citigroup is allowed to adjust the allowance for credit losses in an amount equal to 25% of the change in the allowance for credit losses (pretax) for each period between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The cumulative adjustments to the allowance for credit losses between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021 will also phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022, along with the deferred impacts related to the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date. Corresponding adjustments to average on-balance sheet assets are reflected in Total Leverage Exposure. 

(3) Commencing with the second quarter of 2020 and continuing through the first quarter of 2021, Citigroup&#8217;s Total Leverage Exposure temporarily excluded U.S. Treasuries and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. For additional information, see &#8220;Capital Resources&#8212;Current Regulatory Capital Standards&#8212;Temporary Supplementary Leverage Ratio Relief&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

(4) Represents the average of certain off-balance sheet exposures calculated as of the last day of each month in the quarter. 

(5) Under the U.S. Basel III rules, banking organizations are required to include in Total Leverage Exposure the effective notional amount of sold credit derivatives, with netting of exposures permitted if certain conditions are met. 

(6) Repo-style transactions include repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions as well as securities borrowing and securities lending transactions. 

(7) Other off-balance sheet exposures include unfunded commitments other than those that are unconditionally cancellable. 

As set forth in the table above, Citigroup&#8217;s Supplementary Leverage ratio was 5.8% at June 30, 2021, compared to approximately 7.0% at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The ratio decreased from the first quarter of 2021 and the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily attributable to an approximate 100 basis point impact from the expiration of the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s temporary Supplementary Leverage ratio relief. For additional information, see &#8220;Capital Resources&#8212;Current Regulatory Capital Standards&#8212;Temporary Supplementary Leverage Ratio Relief&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Capital Resources of Citigroup&#8217;s Subsidiary U.S. Depository Institutions 

Citigroup&#8217;s subsidiary U.S. depository institutions are also subject to regulatory capital standards issued by their respective primary bank regulatory agencies, which are similar to the standards of the Federal Reserve Board.

(2) Citibank has elected to apply the modified transition provision related to the impact of the CECL accounting standard on regulatory capital, as provided by the U.S. banking agencies&#8217; September 2020 final rule. Under the modified CECL transition provision, the changes in retained earnings (after-tax), deferred tax assets (DTAs) arising from temporary differences and the allowance for credit losses upon the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date have been deferred and will phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022. For the ongoing impact of CECL, Citibank is allowed to adjust retained earnings and the allowance for credit losses in an amount equal to 25% of the change in the allowance for credit losses (pretax) for each period between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The cumulative adjustments to retained earnings and the allowance for credit losses between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021 will also phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022, along with the deferred impacts related to the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date. Corresponding adjustments to average on-balance sheet assets are reflected in quarterly adjusted average total assets and Total Leverage Exposure. In addition, the increase in DTAs arising from temporary differences upon the January 1, 2020 adoption date has been deducted from risk-weighted assets (RWA) and will phase in to RWA at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022. 

(3) Under the Advanced Approaches framework, eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent that the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets, which differs from the Standardized Approach in which the ACL is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess ACL being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted assets. 

(4) Citibank&#8217;s reportable Total Capital ratio was derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework, whereas Citibank&#8217;s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were the lower derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach for all periods presented. 

(5) Citibank must maintain minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital and Tier 1 Leverage ratios of 6.5%, 8.0%, 10.0% and 5.0%, respectively, to be considered &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under the revised Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) regulations applicable to insured depository institutions as established by the U.S. Basel III rules. Citibank must also maintain a minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 6.0% to be considered &#8220;well capitalized.&#8221; 

(6) Tier 1 Leverage ratio denominator. Represents quarterly average total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital. 

(7) Supplementary Leverage ratio denominator. Citibank did not elect to temporarily exclude U.S. Treasuries and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from Total Leverage Exposure. For additional information, see &#8220;Capital Resources&#8212;Current Regulatory Capital Standards&#8212;Temporary Supplementary Leverage Ratio Relief&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

As indicated in the table above, Citibank&#8217;s capital ratios at June 30, 2021 were in excess of the stated and effective minimum requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules. In addition, Citibank was also &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; as of June 30, 2021. 

Impact of Changes on Citigroup and Citibank Capital Ratios 

The following tables present the estimated sensitivity of Citigroup&#8217;s and Citibank&#8217;s capital ratios to changes of $100 million in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital (numerator), and changes of $1 billion in 

Advanced Approaches and Standardized Approach risk-weighted assets and quarterly adjusted average total assets, as well as Total Leverage Exposure (denominator), as of June 30, 2021. This information is provided for the purpose of analyzing the impact that a change in Citigroup&#8217;s or Citibank&#8217;s financial position or results of operations could have on these ratios. These sensitivities only consider a single change to either a component of capital, risk-weighted assets, quarterly adjusted average total assets or Total Leverage Exposure. Accordingly, an event that affects more than one factor may have a larger basis point impact than is reflected in these tables.

(1) Loans modified under Citi&#8217;s consumer relief programs continue to be reported in the same delinquency bucket they were in at the time of modification (which have various durations, and certain of which may be renewed by the customer). Consumer relief programs in Asia and Mexico largely expired during the fourth quarter of 2020. 

(2) End-of-period (EOP) loans include interest and fees on credit cards. 

(3) The ratios of 90+ days past due and 30&#8211;89 days past due are calculated based on EOP loans, net of unearned income. 

(4) The 90+ days past due balances for North America &#8212;Citi-branded and North America &#8212;Citi retail services are generally still accruing interest. Citigroup&#8217;s policy is generally to accrue interest on credit card loans until 180 days past due, unless notification of bankruptcy filing has been received earlier. 

(5) The 90+ days past due and 30&#8211;89 days past due and related ratios for North America GCB exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies since the potential loss predominantly resides with the U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) were $150 million ($0.7 billion), $176 million ($0.7 billion) and $130 million ($0.5 billion) as of June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively. The amounts excluded for loans 30&#8211;89 days past due and (EOP loans) were $80 million ($0.7 billion), $84 million ($0.7 billion) and $86 million ($0.5 billion) as of June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively. 

(6) Asia includes delinquencies and loans in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented. 

(7) The loans 90+ days past due and related ratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies since the potential loss predominantly resides with the U.S. agencies. The amounts excluded for 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) for each period were $125 million ($0.3 billion), $169 million ($0.4 billion) and $173 million ($0.4 billion) as of June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively.

Portfolio Mix&#8212;Geography and Counterparty 

Citi&#8217;s corporate credit portfolio is diverse across geography and counterparty. The following table shows the percentage of this portfolio by region (excluding the delinquency-managed private bank portfolio) based on Citi&#8217;s internal management geography: 

June 30, 2021 March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 North America 57 &#160; % 57 % 56 % EMEA 25 &#160; 25 25 Asia 13 &#160; 13 13 Latin America 5 &#160; 5 6 Total 100 &#160; % 100 % 100 % 

The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison of credit exposure across all lines of business, geographic regions and products. Counterparty risk ratings reflect an estimated probability of default for a counterparty and are derived by leveraging validated statistical models, scorecard models and external agency ratings (under defined circumstances), in combination with consideration of factors specific to the obligor or market, such as management experience, competitive position, regulatory environment and commodity prices. Facility risk ratings are assigned that reflect the probability of default of the obligor and factors that affect the loss given default of the facility, such as support or collateral. Internal obligor ratings that generally correspond to BBB and above are considered investment grade, while those below are considered non-investment grade. 

The following table presents the corporate credit portfolio (excluding the delinquency-managed private bank portfolio) by facility risk rating as a percentage of the total corporate credit portfolio: 

&#160; Total exposure &#160; June 30, 2021 March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 AAA/AA/A 49 &#160; % 50 % 49 % BBB 32 &#160; 31 31 BB/B 16 &#160; 16 17 CCC or below 3 &#160; 3 3 Total 100 &#160; % 100 % 100 % 

Note: Total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments. 

In addition to the obligor and facility risk ratings assigned to all exposures, Citi may classify exposures in the corporate credit portfolio. These classifications are consistent with Citi&#8217;s interpretation of the U.S. banking regulators&#8217; definition of criticized exposures, which may categorize exposures as special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss. 

Risk ratings and classifications are reviewed regularly, and adjusted as appropriate. The credit review process incorporates quantitative and qualitative factors, including financial and non-financial disclosures or metrics, idiosyncratic events or changes to the competitive, regulatory or macroeconomic environment. This includes but is not limited to exposures in those sectors significantly impacted by the pandemic (including consumer retail, commercial real estate and transportation). 

Citigroup believes the corporate credit portfolio to be appropriately rated and classified as of June 30, 2021. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Citigroup has taken action to adjust internal ratings and classifications of exposures as both the macroeconomic environment and obligor-specific factors have changed, particularly where additional stress has been seen. 

As obligor risk ratings are downgraded, the probability of default increases. Downgrades of obligor risk ratings tend to result in a higher provision for credit losses. In addition, 

downgrades may result in the purchase of additional credit derivatives or other risk mitigants to hedge the incremental credit risk, or may result in Citi&#8217;s seeking to reduce exposure to an obligor or an industry sector. Citi will continue to review exposures to ensure that the appropriate probability of default is incorporated into all risk assessments.

As of June 30, 2021, the ACLL was 1.2% of funded CRE exposure, including 3.6% of funded non-investment-grade exposure. 

Of the total CRE exposure: 

&#8226; $20 billion of the exposure ($12 billion of direct outstanding funded loans) relates to Community Reinvestment Act-related lending provided pursuant to Citi&#8217;s regulatory requirements to meet the credit needs of borrowers in low and moderate income neighborhoods. 

&#8226; $20 billion of the exposure ($15 billion of direct outstanding funded loans) relates to exposure secured by mortgages on underlying properties or in well-rated securitization exposures. 

&#8226; $13 billion of the exposure ($5 billion of direct outstanding funded loans) relates to unsecured loans to large REITs, with nearly 79% of the exposure rated investment grade. 

&#8226; $12 billion of exposure ($11 billion of direct outstanding funded loans) relates to CRE exposure in the private bank of which 100% is secured by mortgages. In addition, 47% of the exposure is also full recourse to the client. As of June 30, 2021, 77% of the exposure was rated investment grade.

(7) In addition to this exposure, Citi has energy-related exposure within the public sector (e.g., energy-related state-owned entities) and the transportation and industrials sector (e.g., off-shore drilling entities) included in the table above. As of December 31, 2020, Citi&#8217;s total exposure to these energy-related entities was approximately $7.0 billion, of which approximately $3.8 billion consisted of direct outstanding funded loans. 

Credit Risk Mitigation 

As part of its overall risk management activities, Citigroup uses credit derivatives and other risk mitigants to hedge portions of the credit risk in its corporate credit portfolio, in addition to outright asset sales. Citi may enter into partial-term hedges as well as full-term hedges. In advance of the expiration of partial-term hedges, Citi will determine, among other factors, the economic feasibility of hedging the remaining life of the instrument. The results of the mark-to-market and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives are reflected primarily in Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 

At June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, ICG (excluding the delinquency-managed private bank portfolio) had economic hedges on the corporate credit portfolio of $37.2 billion, $38.8 billion and $38.8 billion, respectively. Citigroup&#8217;s expected credit loss model used in the calculation of its ACL does not include the favorable impact of credit derivatives and other mitigants that are marked to market. In addition, the reported amounts of direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments in the tables above do not reflect the impact of these hedging transactions. The credit protection was economically hedging underlying ICG (excluding the delinquency-managed private bank portfolio) corporate credit portfolio exposures with the following risk rating distribution:

The difference between the domicile of the booking unit and the domicile of the managing unit is not material. 

(2) Loans secured primarily by real estate. 

(3) Consumer loans are net of unearned income of $676 million, $700 million, $749 million, $739 million and $734 million at June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021, December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020, respectively. Unearned income on consumer loans primarily represents unamortized origination fees and costs, premiums and discounts. 

(4) Corporate loans include private bank loans and are net of unearned income of $(841) million, $(844) million, $(844) million, $(857) million and $(854) million at June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021, December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020, respectively. Unearned income on corporate loans primarily represents interest received in advance, but not yet earned, on loans originated on a discounted basis. 

(5) Because loans carried at fair value do not have an ACLL, they are excluded from the ACLL ratio calculation.

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets and Renegotiated Loans 

For additional information on Citi&#8217;s non-accrual loans and assets and renegotiated loans, see &#8220;Non-Accrual Loans and Assets and Renegotiated Loans&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Non-Accrual Loans 

The table below summarizes Citigroup&#8217;s non-accrual loans as of the periods indicated. Non-accrual loans may still be current on interest payments. In situations where Citi reasonably expects that only a portion of the principal owed will ultimately be collected, all payments received are reflected as a reduction of principal and not as interest income. For all other non-accrual loans, cash interest receipts are generally recorded as revenue.

(2) In addition to modifications reflected as TDRs at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, Citi also modified zero and $47 million, respectively, of commercial loans risk rated &#8220;Substandard Non-Performing&#8221; or worse (asset category defined by banking regulators) in offices outside the U.S. These modifications were not considered TDRs because the modifications did not involve a concession or because the modifications qualified for exemptions from TDR accounting provided by the CARES Act or the interagency guidance. 

(3) Includes $806 million and $873 million of non-accrual loans included in the non-accrual loans table above at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The remaining loans were accruing interest.

Note: The amounts set forth in the table above are presented on an average basis. For securities, the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be realized and, therefore, exclude any securities that are encumbered and incorporate any haircuts applicable under the U.S. LCR rule. The table above incorporates various restrictions that could limit the transferability of liquidity between legal entities, including Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. 

(1) Foreign government debt includes securities issued or guaranteed by foreign sovereigns, agencies and multilateral development banks. Foreign government debt securities are held largely to support local liquidity requirements and Citi&#8217;s local franchises and principally include government bonds from Japan, Mexico, Hong Kong, South Korea and India. 

The table above includes average amounts of HQLA held at Citigroup&#8217;s operating entities that are eligible for inclusion in the calculation of Citigroup&#8217;s consolidated Liquidity Coverage ratio (LCR), pursuant to the U.S. LCR rules. These amounts include the HQLA needed to meet the minimum requirements at these entities and any amounts in excess of these minimums that are assumed to be transferable to other entities within Citigroup. Citigroup&#8217;s HQLA decreased quarter-over-quarter, primarily reflecting liquidity being deployed into trading activities. 

As of June 30, 2021, Citigroup had approximately $972 billion of available liquidity resources to support client and business needs, including end-of-period HQLA assets; additional unencumbered securities, including excess liquidity held at bank entities that is non-transferable to other entities within Citigroup; and available assets not already accounted for within Citi&#8217;s HQLA to support Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and Federal Reserve Bank discount window borrowing capacity. 

Short-Term Liquidity Measurement: Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) 

In addition to internal 30-day liquidity stress testing performed for Citi&#8217;s major entities, operating subsidiaries and countries, Citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the LCR. The table below details the components of Citi&#8217;s LCR calculation and HQLA in excess of net outflows for the periods indicated: 

In billions of dollars Jun. 30, 2021 Mar. 31, 2021 Jun. 30, 2020 HQLA $ 522.6 &#160; $ 534.8 $ 489.8 Net outflows 461.7 &#160; 463.7 420.1 LCR 113 &#160; % 115 % 117 % HQLA in excess of net outflows $ 60.9 &#160; $ 71.1 $ 69.7 

Note: The amounts are presented on an average basis. 

As of June 30, 2021, Citigroup&#8217;s average LCR decreased from the quarter ended March 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by Citi deploying liquidity and optimizing its overall HQLA. 

Long-Term Liquidity Measurement: Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) 

As previously disclosed, in October 2020, the U.S. banking agencies adopted a final rule to assess the availability of a bank&#8217;s stable funding against a required level. 

In general, a bank&#8217;s available stable funding will include portions of equity, deposits and long-term debt, while its required stable funding will be based on the liquidity characteristics of its assets, derivatives and commitments. The ratio of available stable funding to required stable funding will be required to be greater than 100%. 

The final rule became effective beginning July 1, 2021, while public disclosure requirements to report the ratio will occur on a semiannual basis beginning June 30, 2023. Citi was in compliance with the final rule as of its effective date. 

Loans 

The table below details the average loans, by business and/or segment, and the total end-of-period loans for each of the periods indicated:

(1) Includes loans in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented. 

End-of-period loans decreased 1% year-over-year and grew 2% quarter-over-quarter. 

On an average basis, loans declined 5% year-over-year and grew 1% sequentially. Excluding the impact of FX translation, average loans declined 7% year-over-year and grew 1% sequentially. On this basis, average GCB loans declined 4% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher payment rates given high levels of liquidity due to U.S. fiscal stimulus. 

Excluding the impact of FX translation, average ICG loans declined 8% year-over-year. Loans in corporate lending declined 32% on an average basis, reflecting net repayments as Citi continued to assist its clients in accessing the capital markets, as well as lower demand. Private bank loans increased 12%, largely driven by secured lending to high-net-worth clients. Markets and securities services loans increased 

24%, reflecting an increase in securitization financing. TTS loans decreased 1%, as a recovery in trade flows was more than offset by the continued low level of spend in commercial cards. On an end-of-period basis, and excluding the impact of FX translation, TTS loans increased 3%, reflecting increasing client demand and improving macroeconomic conditions. 

Average Corporate/Other loans continued to decline (down 34%), driven by the wind-down of legacy assets.

(2) Includes deposits in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented. 

End-of-period deposits increased 6% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. 

On an average basis, deposits increased 7% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Excluding the impact of FX translation, average deposits grew 5% from the prior-year period and 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase reflected continued client engagement as well as the elevated level of liquidity in the financial system. On this basis, average deposits in GCB increased 14%, with strong growth in North America and Asia . 

Excluding the impact of FX translation, average deposits in ICG grew 2% year-over-year, with strong growth in the private bank and securities services, partly offset by a reduction in TTS. 

Long-Term Debt 

The weighted-average maturity of unsecured long-term debt issued by Citigroup and its affiliates (including Citibank) with a remaining life greater than one year was approximately 8.8 years as of June 30, 2021, compared to 8.7 years as of the prior year and 8.9 years as of the prior quarter. The weighted-average maturity is calculated based on the contractual maturity of each security. For securities that are redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the holder, the weighted-average maturity is calculated based on the earliest date an option becomes exercisable. 

Citi&#8217;s long-term debt outstanding at the Citigroup parent company includes benchmark senior and subordinated debt and what Citi refers to as customer-related debt, consisting of structured notes, such as equity- and credit-linked notes, as well as non-structured notes. Citi&#8217;s issuance of customer-related debt is generally driven by customer demand and complements benchmark debt issuance as a source of funding for Citi&#8217;s non-bank entities. Citi&#8217;s long-term debt at the bank includes bank notes, FHLB advances and securitizations. 

Long-Term Debt Outstanding 

The following table sets forth Citi&#8217;s end-of-period total long-term debt outstanding for each of the dates indicated:

Note: Amounts represent the current value of long-term debt on Citi&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet that, for certain debt instruments, includes consideration of fair value, hedging impacts and unamortized discounts and premiums. 

(1) Non-bank includes long-term debt issued to third parties by the parent holding company (Citigroup) and Citi&#8217;s non-bank subsidiaries (including broker-dealer subsidiaries) that are consolidated into Citigroup. As of June 30, 2021, non-bank included $61.5 billion of long-term debt issued by Citi&#8217;s broker-dealer and other subsidiaries, as well as certain Citigroup consolidated hedging activities. 

(2) Local country and other includes debt issued by Citi&#8217;s affiliates in support of their local operations. Within non-bank, certain secured financing is also included. 

(3) Predominantly credit card securitizations, primarily backed by Citi-branded credit card receivables. 

Citi&#8217;s total long-term debt outstanding decreased year-over-year, primarily driven by declines in unsecured benchmark senior debt, securitizations and FHLB borrowings at the bank, partially offset by the issuance of customer-related debt at the non-bank entities. Sequentially, long-term debt outstanding increased, driven primarily by increases in unsecured benchmark senior debt and customer-related debt at the non-bank entities. 

As part of its liability management, Citi has considered, and may continue to consider, opportunities to redeem or repurchase its long-term debt pursuant to open market purchases, tender offers or other means. Such redemptions and repurchases help reduce Citi&#8217;s overall funding costs. During the second quarter of 2021, Citi redeemed or repurchased an aggregate of approximately $12.3 billion of its outstanding long-term debt. 

Long-Term Debt Issuances and Maturities

Secured Funding Transactions and Short-Term Borrowings 

Citi supplements its primary sources of funding with short-term financings that generally include (i) secured funding transactions consisting of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, i.e., repos, and (ii) to a lesser extent, short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper and borrowings from the FHLB and other market participants. 

Secured Funding Transactions 

Secured funding is primarily accessed through Citi&#8217;s broker-dealer subsidiaries to fund efficiently both (i) secured lending activity and (ii) a portion of the securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities. Citi also executes a smaller portion of its secured funding transactions through its bank entities, which are typically collateralized by government debt securities. Generally, daily changes in the level of Citi&#8217;s secured funding are primarily due to fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book (as described below) and securities inventory. 

Secured funding of $222 billion as of June 30, 2021 increased 3% from the prior-year period and 1% sequentially. Excluding the impact of FX translation, secured funding declined 2% from the prior-year period and increased 1% sequentially, both driven by normal business activity. The average balance for secured funding was approximately $237 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2021. 

The portion of secured funding in the broker-dealer subsidiaries that funds secured lending is commonly referred to as &#8220;matched book&#8221; activity. The majority of this activity is secured by high-quality liquid securities such as U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities and foreign government debt securities. Other secured funding is secured by less liquid securities, including equity securities, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities, the tenor of which is generally equal to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding matched book assets. 

The remainder of the secured funding activity in the broker-dealer subsidiaries serves to fund securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities. To maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market conditions, including under periods of stress, Citi manages these activities by taking into consideration the quality of the underlying collateral and establishing minimum required funding tenors. The weighted average maturity of Citi&#8217;s secured funding of less liquid securities inventory was greater than 110 days as of June 30, 2021. 

Citi manages the risks in its secured funding by conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in capacity, tenor, haircut, collateral profile and client actions. In addition, Citi maintains counterparty diversification by establishing concentration triggers and assessing counterparty reliability and stability under stress. Citi generally sources secured funding from more than 150 counterparties. 

Short-Term Borrowings 

Citi&#8217;s short-term borrowings of $31 billion decreased 22% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, primarily driven by a decline in FHLB advances (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on Citigroup&#8217;s and its affiliates&#8217; outstanding short-term borrowings). 

Credit Ratings 

While not included in the table below, the long-term and short-term ratings of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. (CGMHI) were BBB+/A-2 at Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s and A/F1 at Fitch as of June 30, 2021.

Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades 

Ratings downgrades by Moody&#8217;s, Fitch or S&#38;P could negatively impact Citigroup&#8217;s and/or Citibank&#8217;s funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity, including derivative triggers, which could take the form of cash obligations and collateral requirements. 

The following information is provided for the purpose of analyzing the potential funding and liquidity impact to Citigroup and Citibank of a hypothetical simultaneous 

ratings downgrade across all three major rating agencies. This analysis is subject to certain estimates, estimation methodologies, judgments and uncertainties. Uncertainties include potential ratings limitations that certain entities may have with respect to permissible counterparties, as well as general subjective counterparty behavior. For example, certain corporate customers and markets counterparties could re-evaluate their business relationships with Citi and limit transactions in certain contracts or market instruments with Citi. Changes in counterparty behavior could impact Citi&#8217;s funding and liquidity, as well as the results of operations of certain of its businesses. The actual impact to Citigroup or Citibank is unpredictable and may differ materially from the potential funding and liquidity impacts described below. For additional information on the impact of credit rating changes on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212; Liquidity Risks&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Citigroup Inc. and Citibank&#8212;Potential Derivative Triggers 

As of June 30, 2021, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of Citigroup Inc. across all three major rating agencies could impact Citigroup&#8217;s funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by approximately $1.0 billion, compared to $1.5 billion as of March 31, 2021. Other funding sources, such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected. 

As of June 30, 2021, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of Citibank across all three major rating agencies could impact Citibank&#8217;s funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by approximately $0.5 billion, unchanged from March 31, 2021. Other funding sources, such as secured funding transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely impacted. 

In total, as of June 30, 2021, Citi estimates that a one-notch downgrade of Citigroup and Citibank across all three major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately $1.4 billion, compared to $1.9 billion as of March 31, 2021 (see also Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). As detailed under &#8220;High-Quality Liquid Assets&#8221; above, Citigroup has various liquidity resources available to its bank and non-bank entities in part as a contingency for the potential events described above. 

In addition, a broad range of mitigating actions are currently included in Citigroup&#8217;s and Citibank&#8217;s contingency funding plans. For Citigroup, these mitigating factors include, but are not limited to, accessing surplus funding capacity from existing clients, tailoring levels of secured lending and adjusting the size of select trading books and collateralized borrowings at certain Citibank subsidiaries. Mitigating actions available to Citibank include, but are not limited to, selling or financing highly liquid government securities, tailoring levels of secured lending, adjusting the size of select trading assets, reducing loan originations and renewals, raising additional deposits or borrowing from the FHLB or central banks. Citi believes these mitigating actions could substantially reduce the funding and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades described above. 

Citibank&#8212;Additional Potential Impacts 

In addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a potential downgrade of Citibank&#8217;s senior debt/long-term rating across any of the three major rating agencies could also have an adverse impact on the commercial paper/short-term rating of Citibank. As of June 30, 2021, Citibank had liquidity commitments of approximately $9.0 billion to consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits, compared to $10.0 billion as of March 31, 2021 (for additional information, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 

In addition to the above-referenced liquidity resources of certain Citibank entities, Citibank could reduce the funding and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades described above through mitigating actions, including repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial paper conduits. In the event of the potential downgrades described above, Citi believes that certain corporate customers could re-evaluate their deposit relationships with Citibank. This re-evaluation could result in clients&#8217; adjusting their discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository institution, which could potentially reduce certain deposit levels at Citibank. However, Citi could choose to adjust pricing, offer alternative deposit products to its existing customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers, in addition to the mitigating actions referenced above. 

MARKET RISK 

Market risk emanates from both Citi&#8217;s trading and non-trading portfolios. For additional information on market risk and market risk management at Citi, see &#8220;Market Risk&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Market Risk of Non-Trading Portfolios 

The following table sets forth the estimated impact to Citi&#8217;s net interest revenue, AOCI and the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio (on a fully implemented basis), each assuming an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 basis point (bps) increase in interest rates:

(1) Certain trading-oriented businesses within Citi have accrual-accounted positions that are excluded from the estimated impact to net interest revenue in the table, since these exposures are managed economically in combination with mark-to-market positions. The U.S. dollar interest rate exposure associated with these businesses was $(9) million for a 100 bps instantaneous increase in interest rates as of June 30, 2021. 

(2) Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments. 

The sequential increase in Citi&#8217;s net interest revenue was driven by U.S. dollar exposure and primarily reflected an increase in interest rates. The sequential increase in the estimated impact to AOCI and the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio primarily reflected changes in the composition of Citi&#8217;s Treasury&#8217;s investment and interest rate portfolio. 

The relatively small quarterly change in the estimated impact to AOCI primarily reflected a continuation of the positioning strategy of Citi Treasury&#8217;s investment securities and related interest rate derivatives portfolio. 

In the event of a parallel instantaneous 100 bps increase in interest rates, as of June 30, 2021, Citi expects that the $5.0 billion negative impact to AOCI would be offset in stockholders&#8217; equity through the expected recovery of the impact on AOCI through accretion of Citi&#8217;s investment portfolio over approximately 37 months. 

The following table sets forth the estimated impact to Citi&#8217;s net interest revenue, AOCI and the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio (on a fully implemented basis) under five different changes in interest rate scenarios for the U.S. dollar and Citi&#8217;s other currencies. The 100 bps downward rate scenarios are impacted by the low level of interest rates in several countries and the assumption that market interest rates, as well as rates paid to depositors and charged to borrowers, do not fall below zero (i.e., the &#8220;flooring assumption&#8221;). The rate scenarios are also impacted by convexity related to mortgage products.

Note: Each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur instantaneously. Changes in interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and the 10-year rate are interpolated. 

(1) Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments. 

As shown in the table above, the magnitude of the impact to Citi&#8217;s net interest revenue and AOCI is greater under Scenario 2 as compared to Scenario 3. This is because the combination of changes to Citi&#8217;s investment portfolio, partially offset by changes related to Citi&#8217;s pension liabilities, results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at shorter- and intermediate-term maturities. 

Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates&#8212;Impacts on AOCI and Capital 

As of June 30, 2021, Citi estimates that an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar against all of the other currencies in which Citi has invested capital could reduce Citi&#8217;s tangible common equity (TCE) by approximately $1.7 billion, or 1.0%, as a result of changes to Citi&#8217;s foreign currency translation adjustment in AOCI , net of hedges. This impact would be primarily due to changes in the value of the Mexican peso, Euro and Indian rupee. 

This impact is also before any mitigating actions Citi may take, including ongoing management of its foreign currency translation exposure. Specifically, as currency movements change the value of Citi&#8217;s net investments in foreign currency-denominated capital, these movements also change the value of Citi&#8217;s risk-weighted assets denominated in those currencies. This, coupled with Citi&#8217;s foreign currency hedging strategies, such as foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency forwards and other currency hedging instruments, lessens the impact of foreign currency movements on Citi&#8217;s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio. Changes in these hedging strategies, as well as hedging costs, divestitures and tax impacts, can further affect the actual impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi&#8217;s capital as compared to an unanticipated parallel shock, as described above. 

The effect of Citi&#8217;s ongoing management strategies with respect to changes in foreign exchange rates, and the impact of these changes on Citi&#8217;s TCE and Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio, are shown in the table below. For additional information on the changes in AOCI , see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Note: All interest expense amounts include FDIC, as well as other similar deposit insurance assessments outside of the U.S. 

(1) Interest revenue and Net interest revenue include the taxable equivalent adjustments primarily related to the tax-exempt bond portfolio and certain tax-advantaged loan programs (based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%) of $51 million, $53 million and $43 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively. 

(2) Interest expense associated with certain hybrid financial instruments, which are classified as Long-term debt and accounted for at fair value, is reported together with any changes in fair value as part of Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income and is therefore not reflected in Interest expense in the table above. 

(3) The average rate on interest revenue and net interest margin reflects the taxable equivalent gross-up adjustment. See footnote 1 above. 

(4) Citi&#8217;s net interest margin (NIM) is calculated by dividing net interest revenue by average interest-earning assets.

(1) Interest revenue and Net interest revenue include the taxable equivalent adjustments discussed in the table above. 

Citi&#8217;s net interest revenue (NIR) in the second quarter of 2021 decreased 8% to $10.2 billion versus the prior-year period. Citi&#8217;s NIR on a taxable equivalent basis also decreased 8% (as set forth in the table above). Excluding the impact of FX translation, this NIR declined year-over-year by approximately $1.1 billion, driven by a decline of approximately $1.0 billion in non- ICG Markets NIR and a $0.1 billion decline in ICG Markets (fixed income markets and equity markets) NIR. The decrease in non- ICG Markets NIR reflected lower loan balances and the impact of lower interest rates. The decrease in ICG Markets NIR largely reflected a change in the mix of trading positions in support of client activity. 

Citi&#8217;s NIM was 1.92% on a taxable equivalent basis in the second quarter of 2021, a decrease of 3 basis points from the prior quarter, primarily reflecting lower cards NIR due to higher payment rates, and modest growth in the balance sheet due to higher deposits, partially offset by an increase in ICG Markets NIR.

Market Risk of Trading Portfolios 

Value at Risk (VAR) 

Citi believes its VAR model is conservatively calibrated to incorporate fat-tail scaling and the greater of short-term (approximately the most recent month) and long-term (three years) market volatility. As of June 30, 2021, Citi estimates that the conservative features of the VAR calibration contribute an approximate 35% add-on to what would be a VAR estimated under the assumption of stable and perfectly, normally distributed markets. As of March 31, 2021, the add-on was 34%. 

As set forth in the table below, Citi&#8217;s average trading VAR increased quarter-over-quarter, mainly due to an increase in exposure from interest rate hedges, increased yield curve positioning and commodities exposures, all in ICG &#8217;s Markets businesses. Citi&#8217;s average trading and credit portfolio VAR also increased quarter-over-quarter, largely driven by the same factors.

(1) Covariance adjustment (also known as diversification benefit) equals the difference between the total VAR and the sum of the VARs tied to each risk type. The benefit reflects the fact that the risks within individual and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VAR on a given day will be lower than the sum of the VARs relating to each risk type. The determination of the primary drivers of changes to the covariance adjustment is made by an examination of the impact of both model parameter and position changes. 

(2) The total trading VAR includes mark-to-market and certain fair value option trading positions in ICG , with the exception of hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value option loans and all CVA exposures. Available-for-sale and accrual exposures are not included. 

(3) The specific risk-only component represents the level of equity and fixed income issuer-specific risk embedded in VAR. 

(4) The credit portfolio is composed of mark-to-market positions associated with non-trading business units including Citi Treasury, the CVA relating to derivative counterparties and all associated CVA hedges. FVA and DVA are not included. The credit portfolio also includes hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value option loans and hedges to the leveraged finance pipeline within capital markets origination in ICG .

Regulatory VAR Back-testing 

In accordance with Basel III, Citi is required to perform back-testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR model. Regulatory VAR back-testing is the process in which the daily one-day VAR, at a 99% confidence interval, is compared to the buy-and-hold profit and loss (i.e., the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of the day and re-priced the following day). Buy-and-hold profit and loss represents the daily mark-to-market profit and loss attributable to price movements in covered positions from the close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue, net interest, fees and commissions, intra-day trading profit and loss and changes in reserves. 

Based on a 99% confidence level, Citi would expect two to three days in any one year where buy-and-hold losses exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the conservative calibration of Citi&#8217;s VAR model (as a result of taking the greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-tail scaling of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer exceptions under normal and stable market conditions. Periods of unstable market conditions could increase the number of back-testing exceptions. 

As of June 30, 2021, there were no back-testing exceptions observed for Citi&#8217;s Regulatory VAR for the prior 12 months. 

STRATEGIC RISK 

For additional information regarding strategic risk, including Citi&#8217;s management of strategic risk, see &#8220;Managing Global Risk&#8212;Strategic Risk&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s First Quarter of 2021 Form 10-Q and Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Country Risk 

Top 25 Country Exposures 

The following table presents Citi&#8217;s top 25 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of June 30, 2021. (Including the U.S, the total exposure as of June 30, 2021 to the top 25 countries would represent approximately 96% of Citi&#8217;s exposure to all countries.) 

For purposes of the table, loan amounts are reflected in the country where the loan is booked, which is generally based on the domicile of the borrower. For example, a loan to a 

Chinese subsidiary of a Switzerland-based corporation will generally be categorized as a loan in China. In addition, Citi has developed regional booking centers in certain countries, most significantly in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland, in order to more efficiently serve its corporate customers. As an example, with respect to the U.K., only 32% of corporate loans presented in the table below are to U.K. domiciled entities (33% for unfunded commitments), with the balance of the loans predominately to European domiciled counterparties. Approximately 83% of the total U.K. funded loans and 84% of the total U.K. unfunded commitments were investment grade as of June 30, 2021. 

Trading account assets and investment securities are generally categorized based on the domicile of the issuer of the security of the underlying reference entity. For additional information on the assets included in the table, see the footnotes to the table below.

Argentina 

Citi operates in Argentina through its ICG businesses. As of June 30, 2021, Citi&#8217;s net investment in its Argentine operations was approximately $1.2 billion. Citi uses the U.S. dollar as the functional currency for its operations in Argentina because the Argentine economy is considered highly inflationary under U.S. GAAP. 

As previously disclosed, the government of Argentina has continued to maintain certain capital and currency controls that restrict Citi&#8217;s ability to access U.S. dollars in Argentina and remit earnings from its Argentine operations. Citi&#8217;s net investment in its Argentine operations is likely to increase as Citi generates net income in its Argentine franchise and its earnings are unable to be remitted. 

Citi economically hedges the foreign currency risk in its net Argentine peso-denominated assets to the extent possible and prudent using non-deliverable forward (NDF) derivative instruments that are primarily executed outside of Argentina. As of June 30, 2021, the international NDF market had very limited liquidity, resulting in Citi&#8217;s being unable to economically hedge nearly all of its Argentine peso exposure. As a result, and to the extent that Citi does not execute NDF contracts for this unhedged exposure in the future, Citi would record devaluations on its net Argentine peso&#8208;denominated assets in earnings, without any benefit from a change in the fair value of derivative positions used to economically hedge the exposure. 

Citi continually evaluates its economic exposure to its Argentine counterparties and reserves for changes in credit risk and sovereign risk associated with its Argentine assets. Citi believes it has established appropriate allowances for credit losses on its Argentine loans, and appropriate fair value adjustments on Argentine assets and liabilities measured at fair value, for such risks under U.S. GAAP as of June 30, 2021. However, U.S. regulatory agencies may require Citi to record additional reserves in the future, increasing ICG &#8217;s cost of credit, based on the perceived country risk associated with its Argentine exposures. For additional information on emerging markets risks, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Strategic Risks&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES 

This section contains a summary of Citi&#8217;s most significant accounting policies. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citigroup&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K contains a summary of all of Citigroup&#8217;s significant accounting policies. These policies, as well as estimates made by management, are integral to the presentation of Citi&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. While all of these policies require a certain level of management judgment and estimates, this section highlights and discusses the significant accounting policies that require management to make highly difficult, complex or subjective judgments and estimates at times regarding matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change (see also &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Operational Risks&#8221; in Citigroup&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K). Management has discussed each of these significant accounting policies, the related estimates and its judgments with the Audit Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors. 

Valuations of Financial Instruments 

Citigroup holds debt and equity securities, derivatives, retained interests in securitizations, investments in private equity and other financial instruments. A substantial portion of these assets and liabilities is reflected at fair value on Citi&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet as Trading account assets , Available-for-sale securities and Trading account liabilities . 

Citi purchases securities under agreements to resell (reverse repos or resale agreements) and sells securities under agreements to repurchase (repos), a substantial portion of which is carried at fair value. In addition, certain loans, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and deposits, as well as certain securities borrowed and loaned positions that are collateralized with cash, are carried at fair value. Citigroup holds its investments, trading assets and liabilities, and resale and repurchase agreements on Citi&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet to meet customer needs and to manage liquidity needs, interest rate risks and private equity investing. 

When available, Citi generally uses quoted market prices to determine fair value and classifies such items within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy established under ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement . If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed valuation models that use, where possible, current market-based or independently sourced market parameters, such as interest rates, currency rates and option volatilities. Such models are often based on a discounted cash flow analysis. In addition, items valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be classified under the fair value hierarchy as Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable. 

Citi is required to exercise subjective judgments relating to the applicability and functionality of internal valuation models, the significance of inputs or value drivers to the valuation of an instrument and the degree of illiquidity and subsequent lack of observability in certain markets. The fair value of these instruments is reported on Citi&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet where the changes in fair value are recognized in either the Consolidated Statement of Income or in AOCI . 

Losses on available-for-sale securities whose fair values are less than the amortized cost, where Citi intends to sell the security or could more-likely-than-not be required to sell the security, are recognized in earnings. Where Citi does not intend to sell the security nor could more-likely-than-not be required to sell the security, the portion of the loss related to credit is recognized as an allowance for credit losses with a corresponding provision for credit losses and the remainder of the loss is recognized in other comprehensive income. Such losses are capped at the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of the security. 

For equity securities carried at cost or under the measurement alternative, decreases in fair value below the carrying value are recognized as impairment in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Moreover, for certain equity method investments, decreases in fair value are only recognized in earnings in the Consolidated Statement of Income if such decreases are judged to be an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). Adjudicating the temporary nature of fair value impairments is also inherently judgmental. 

The fair value of financial instruments incorporates the effects of Citi&#8217;s own credit risk and the market view of counterparty credit risk, the quantification of which is also complex and judgmental. For additional information on Citi&#8217;s fair value analysis, see Notes 6, 20 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(1) As of June 30, 2021, in North America GCB , Citi-branded cards ACLL/EOP loans was 8.6% and Citi retail services ACLL/EOP loans was 12.7%. 

Citi&#8217;s reserves for expected credit losses on funded loans and unfunded lending commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the Allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) and Other liabilities (Allowance for credit losses on unfunded lending commitments (ACLUC)), respectively. In addition, Citi reserves for expected credit losses on other financial assets carried at amortized cost, including held-to-maturity securities, reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowed, deposits with banks and other financial receivables. These reserves, together with the ACLL and ACLUC, are referred to as the ACL. Changes in the ACL are reflected as Provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income each reporting period. 

The ACL is composed of quantitative and qualitative management adjustment components. The quantitative component uses a forward-looking base macroeconomic forecast. The qualitative management adjustment component reflects economic uncertainty using alternative downside macroeconomic scenarios and portfolio characteristics and current economic conditions not captured in the quantitative component, such as adjustments to reflect uncertainty around the estimated impact of the pandemic on credit losses. Both the quantitative and qualitative management adjustment components are further discussed below. 

Quantitative Component 

Citi estimates expected credit losses for its quantitative component using (i) its comprehensive internal data on loss and default history, (ii) internal credit risk ratings, (iii) external credit bureau and rating agencies information, and (iv) a reasonable and supportable forecast of macroeconomic conditions. 

For its consumer and corporate portfolios, Citi&#8217;s expected credit losses are determined primarily by utilizing models that consider the borrowers&#8217; probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD). The loss likelihood and severity models used for estimating expected credit losses are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic variables that inform the forecasts, and cover a wide range of geographic, industry, product and business segments. 

In addition, Citi&#8217;s models determine expected credit losses based on leading credit indicators, including loan delinquencies, changes in portfolio size, default frequency, risk ratings and loss recovery rates (among other things), as well as other current economic factors and credit trends, including housing prices, unemployment and gross domestic product (GDP). 

Qualitative Component 

The qualitative management adjustment component includes, among other things, management adjustments to reflect economic uncertainty based on the likelihood and severity of downside scenarios and certain portfolio characteristics not captured in the quantitative component, such as concentrations, collateral valuation, model limitations, idiosyncratic events and other factors as required by banking supervisory guidance for the ACL. The qualitative management adjustment component also reflects the uncertainty around the estimated impact of the pandemic on credit loss estimates. The ultimate extent of the pandemic&#8217;s impact on Citi&#8217;s ACL will depend on, among other things, (i) how consumers respond to the conclusion of government stimulus and assistance programs, (ii) the impact on unemployment, (iii) the timing and extent of the economic recovery, (iv) the severity and duration of any resurgence of COVID-19, (v) the rate of distribution and administration of vaccines and (vi) the extent of any market volatility. 

2Q21 Changes in the Allowance 

In the second quarter of 2021, Citi released $1.5 billion of the ACL for its consumer portfolios and $0.9 billion of the ACL for its corporate portfolios, for a total release of $2.4 billion. The releases in consumer and corporate ACLs were driven primarily by improvements in portfolio quality and macroeconomic forecasts. The overall qualitative management adjustments were largely unchanged compared to the previous quarter. Based on its latest macroeconomic forecast, Citi believes its analysis of the ACL reflects the forward view of the economic analysis as of June 30, 2021. 

Macroeconomic Variables 

Citi considers a multitude of macroeconomic variables for both the base and downside macroeconomic forecasts it uses to estimate the ACL, including domestic and international variables for its global portfolios and exposures. Citi&#8217;s forecasts of the U.S. unemployment rate and U.S. Real GDP growth rate represent the key macroeconomic variables that most significantly affect its estimate of the ACL. 

The tables below show Citi&#8217;s forecasted quarterly average U.S. unemployment rate and year-over-year U.S. Real GDP growth rate used in determining Citi&#8217;s ACL for each quarterly reporting period from 2Q20 to 2Q21:

(1) The year-over-year growth rate is the percentage change in the Real (inflation adjusted) GDP level. 

Under the base macroeconomic forecast as of 2Q21, U.S. Real GDP growth is expected to remain strong in 2021 and 2022 and the unemployment rate is expected to continue to improve as the U.S. moves past the peak of the pandemic-related health and economic crisis. 

Consumer 

As discussed above, Citi&#8217;s total consumer ACL release (including Corporate/Other ) of $1.5 billion in the second quarter of 2021 reduced the ACL balance to $16.1 billion, or 5.84% of total consumer loans at June 30, 2021. The release was primarily driven by the improvements in portfolio credit quality, as well as the improved macroeconomic forecast. Citi&#8217;s consumer ACL is largely driven by the cards businesses. 

For cards, including Citi&#8217;s international businesses, the level of reserves relative to EOP loans decreased to 9.72% at June 30, 2021, compared to 10.72% at March 31, 2021, primarily driven by improvements in portfolio credit quality, as well as the improved macroeconomic forecast. For the remaining consumer exposures, the level of reserves relative to EOP loans decreased to 1.5% at June 30, 2021, compared to 1.8% at March 31, 2021. 

Corporate 

Citi&#8217;s corporate ACLL release of $0.9 billion in the second quarter of 2021 reduced the ACLL reserve balance to $3.1 billion, or 0.80% of total funded loans, and was primarily driven by improvements in portfolio credit quality, as well as the improved macroeconomic forecast. 

The Allowance for credit losses on unfunded lending commitments (ACLUC) build of $43 million in the second quarter of 2021 increased the total ACLUC reserve balance included in Other liabilities to $2.1 billion at June 30, 2021. 

ACLL and Non-accrual Ratios 

At June 30, 2021, the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total funded loans was 2.88% (5.84% for consumer loans and 0.80% for corporate loans) compared to 3.29% at March 31, 2021 (6.41% for consumer loans and 1.06% for corporate loans). 

Citi&#8217;s total non-accrual loans were $4.4 billion at June 30, 2021, down $708 million from March 31, 2021. Consumer non-accrual loans decreased $178 million to $1.8 billion at June 30, 2021 from $2.0 billion at March 31, 2021, while corporate non-accrual loans decreased $530 million to $2.6 billion at June 30, 2021 from $3.1 billion at March 31, 2021. In addition, the ratio of non-accrual loans to total corporate loans was 0.64%, and 0.65% of non-accrual loans to total consumer loans, at June 30, 2021. 

Regulatory Capital Impact 

Citi has elected to phase in the CECL impact for regulatory capital purposes. The transition provisions were recently modified to defer the phase-in. After two years with no impact on capital, the CECL transition impact will phase in over a three-year transition period with 25% of the impact (net of deferred taxes) recognized on the first day of each subsequent year, commencing January 1, 2022, and will be fully implemented on January 1, 2025. In addition, 25% of the build (pretax) made in 2020 and 2021 will be deferred and amortized over the same timeframe. 

For a further description of the ACL and related accounts, see Notes 1 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

For a discussion of the adoption of the CECL accounting pronouncement, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Goodwill 

Citi tests goodwill for impairment annually as of July 1 (the annual test) and through interim assessments between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate, a decision to sell or dispose of all or a significant portion of a reporting unit or a significant decline in Citi&#8217;s stock price. 

Citi performed the annual test as of July 1, 2020. The fair values of the Company&#8217;s reporting units as a percentage of their carrying values ranged from approximately 115% to 136%, resulting in no impairment. While the inherent risk related to uncertainty is embedded in the key assumptions used in the valuations, the current environment continues to evolve. Deterioration in business performance or macroeconomic and market conditions, including potential adverse effects to economic forecasts due to the severity and duration of the pandemic, as well as the responses of governments, customers and clients, could negatively influence the assumptions used in the valuations, in particular, the discount and growth rates used in the net income projections. If the future were to differ from management&#8217;s best estimate of key economic assumptions and associated cash flows were to decrease, Citi could potentially experience material goodwill impairment charges in the future. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion on goodwill. 

Litigation Accruals 

See the discussion in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding Citi&#8217;s policies on establishing accruals for litigation and regulatory contingencies. 

INCOME TAXES 

Deferred Tax Assets 

For additional information on Citi&#8217;s deferred tax assets (DTAs), see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Strategic Risks,&#8221; &#8220;Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates&#8212;Income Taxes&#8221; and Notes 1 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

At June 30, 2021, Citigroup had recorded net DTAs of approximately $24.5 billion, an increase of $0.3 billion from March 31, 2021 and a decrease of $0.3 billion from December 31, 2020. The increase for the quarter was driven by a valuation allowance (VA) release (see DTA Realizability below) and losses in Other comprehensive income . 

The table below summarizes Citi&#8217;s net DTAs balance: 

Jurisdiction/Component DTAs balance In billions of dollars June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Total U.S. $ 21.7 &#160; $ 22.2 Total foreign 2.8 &#160; 2.6 Total $ 24.5 &#160; $ 24.8 

Of Citi&#8217;s total net DTAs of $24.5 billion as of June 30, 2021, $9.4 billion (primarily relating to net operating losses, foreign tax credit (FTC) and general business credit carry-forwards, which decreased by $0.4 billion in the current quarter) was deducted in calculating Citi&#8217;s regulatory capital. Net DTAs arising from temporary differences are deducted from regulatory capital if in excess of the 10%/15% limitations (see &#8220;Capital Resources&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K). For the quarter ended June 30, 2021, Citi did not have any such DTAs. Accordingly, the remaining $15.1 billion of net DTAs as of June 30, 2021 was not deducted in calculating regulatory capital pursuant to Basel III standards and was appropriately risk weighted under those rules. 

DTA Realizability 

Citi believes that the realization of the recognized net DTAs of $24.5 billion at June 30, 2021 is more-likely-than-not based on management&#8217;s expectations as to future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise, as well as consideration of available tax planning strategies (as defined in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ). 

In the second quarter of 2021, as part of the normal planning process, Citi updated its forecasts of operating income and foreign source income. With respect to Citi&#8217;s general basket for foreign tax credits (FTCs), Citi&#8217;s revised forecast provided a sufficient level of forecasted taxable income to maintain the level of general basket FTCs currently recognized. With respect to non-U.S. branches, Citi&#8217;s forecasts evidenced a sufficient level of forecasted taxable income to utilize previously unrecognized DTAs related to non-U.S. branch FTC carry-forwards in 2021 and 2022. As a result, the second quarter includes a VA release of approximately $450 million related to these FTCs. As part of its normal planning process in the fourth quarter of 2021, Citi expects to further update its forecasts of operating income and foreign source income, which in turn could affect Citi&#8217;s valuation allowance against FTC carry-forwards. 

Effective Tax Rate 

Citi&#8217;s reported effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2021 was approximately 16%. This compares to an effective tax rate of approximately 5% in the second quarter of 2020. The effective tax rate in the current quarter was driven by the $450 million VA release related to non-U.S. branch FTC carry-forwards. In the second quarter of 2020, the effective tax rate was driven by the higher relative impact of tax-advantaged investments and other tax benefits on a relatively low level of earnings before taxes. 

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Citi&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms, including without limitation that information required to be disclosed by Citi in its SEC filings is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Citi&#8217;s Disclosure Committee assists the CEO and CFO in their responsibilities to design, establish, maintain and evaluate the effectiveness of Citi&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures. The Disclosure Committee is responsible for, among other things, the oversight, maintenance and implementation of the disclosure controls and procedures, subject to the supervision and oversight of the CEO and CFO. 

Citi&#8217;s management, with the participation of its CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of Citigroup&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of June 30, 2021. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that at that date Citigroup&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO SECTION 219 OF THE IRAN THREAT REDUCTION AND SYRIA HUMAN RIGHTS ACT 

Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (Section 219), which added Section 13(r) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Citi is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with certain individuals or entities that are the subject of sanctions under U.S. law. Disclosure is generally required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. Citi, in its related quarterly report on Form 10-Q, previously disclosed no reportable activities for the first quarter of 2021. 

During the second quarter of 2021, Citigroup reported 71 transactions pursuant to Section 219. On May 10, 2021, Citibank Europe plc, acting as an intermediary bank, processed a permissible transaction between two Irish banks for visa-related fees paid to the Iranian Embassy in Ireland. The total value of the payment was EUR 100.00 (approximately USD 119.06). These transactions were authorized under the travel exemption of the Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations (i.e., 31 CFR &#167; 560.210). In addition, in May of 2021, Citigroup&#8217;s Russian subsidiary (Citi Russia) unblocked and released 69 transactions involving entities designated pursuant to Executive Orders 13382 and 13224. The total value of the transactions, which were related to payments of small bills for services, as well as salary payments, was RUB 11,371,791.17 

(approximately USD 225,429.26). All transactions were processed pursuant to a specific license issued by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on May 26, 2021. Citi Russia received nominal fees for three of the 69 payments, which were outgoing and subject to tariffs. Finally, on June 16, 2021, two subsidiaries of Citigroup Inc. processed a transaction between the Central Bank of Iran (the CBI) and an international organization (IO). The CBI sent funds to the IO&#8217;s Korean won account at Citibank Korea Inc., which were then converted to U.S. dollars and transferred to the IO&#8217;s U.S. dollar account at Citibank, N.A., New York branch. The total value of the payment was approximately USD 16,455,375.44. The transaction was a payment for the Government of Iran&#8217;s membership dues to the IO. Citi obtained a two-year license from OFAC for such payments on May 19, 2021. Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s two subsidiaries realized nominal fees for the processing of this payment. 

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

Securities and Commodities Regulation&#8212;Swap Dealer/ Security-Based Swap Dealer Requirements 

Rules of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) govern the registration and regulation of swap dealers. As previously disclosed, several Citigroup subsidiaries, including Citibank, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (CGMI), Citigroup Global Markets Limited (CGML), Citigroup Global Markets Europe (CGME) and Citigroup Energy Inc., are registered with the CFTC as swap dealers. On July 22, 2020, the CFTC adopted final rules establishing capital and financial reporting requirements for swap dealers that will take effect in October 2021. 

In addition, the SEC has adopted rules governing the registration and regulation of security-based swap dealers. The regulations include requirements related to (i) capital, margin and segregation, (ii) record-keeping, reporting and notification and (iii) risk management practices for uncleared security-based swaps and the cross-border application of certain security-based swap requirements. These requirements will also take effect in October 2021.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES 

Accounting for Financial Instruments &#8212; Credit Losses 

Overview 

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments &#8212; Credit Losses (Topic 326). The ASU introduced a new credit loss methodology, the current expected credit losses (CECL) methodology, which requires earlier recognition of credit losses while also providing additional disclosure about credit risk. Citi adopted the ASU as of January 1, 2020, which, as discussed below, resulted in an increase in Citi&#8217;s Allowance for credit losses and a decrease to opening Retained earnings , net of deferred income taxes, at January 1, 2020. 

The CECL methodology utilizes a lifetime &#8220;expected credit loss&#8221; measurement objective for the recognition of credit losses for loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, receivables and other financial assets measured at amortized cost at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired. The ACL is adjusted each period for changes in expected lifetime credit losses. The CECL methodology represents a significant change from prior U.S. GAAP and replaced the prior multiple existing impairment methods, which generally required that a loss be incurred before it was recognized. Within the life cycle of a loan or other financial asset, the methodology generally results in the earlier recognition of the provision for credit losses and the related ACL than prior U.S. GAAP. For available-for-sale debt securities where fair value is less than cost that Citi intends to hold or more-likely-than-not will not be required to sell, credit-related impairment, if any, is recognized through an ACL and adjusted each period for changes in credit risk. 

January 1, 2020 CECL Transition (Day 1) Impact 

The CECL methodology&#8217;s impact on expected credit losses, among other things, reflects Citi&#8217;s view of the current state of the economy, forecasted macroeconomic conditions and quality of Citi&#8217;s portfolios. At the January 1, 2020 date of adoption, based on forecasts of macroeconomic conditions and exposures at that time, the aggregate impact to Citi was an approximate $ 4.1 billion, or an approximate 29 %, pretax increase in the Allowance for credit losses , along with a $ 3.1 billion after-tax decrease in Retained earnings and a deferred tax asset increase of $ 1.0 billion. This transition impact reflects (i) a $ 4.9 billion build to the Allowance for credit losses for Citi&#8217;s consumer exposures, primarily driven by the impact on credit card receivables of longer estimated tenors under the CECL lifetime expected credit loss methodology (loss coverage of approximately 23 months) compared to shorter estimated tenors under the probable loss methodology under prior U.S. GAAP (loss coverage of approximately 14 months), net of recoveries; and (ii) a release of $ 0.8 billion of reserves primarily related to Citi&#8217;s corporate net loan loss exposures, largely due to more precise contractual maturities that result in shorter remaining tenors, incorporation of recoveries and use of more specific historical loss data based 

on an increase in portfolio segmentation across industries and geographies. 

Under the CECL methodology, the Allowance for credit losses consists of quantitative and qualitative components. Citi&#8217;s quantitative component of the Allowance for credit losses is model based and utilizes a single forward-looking macroeconomic forecast and discounts inputs for the corporate classifiably managed portfolios, complemented by the qualitative component described below, in estimating expected credit losses and discounts inputs for the corporate classifiably managed portfolios. Reasonable and supportable forecast periods vary by product. For example, Citi&#8217;s consumer models use a 13-quarter reasonable and supportable period and revert to historical loss experience thereafter, while its corporate loan models use a nine-quarter reasonable and supportable period followed by a three-quarter graduated transition to historical loss experience. 

The qualitative management adjustment component includes, among other things, management adjustments to reflect economic uncertainty based on the likelihood and severity of downside scenarios and certain portfolio characteristics not captured in the quantitative component, such as concentrations, collateral coverage, model limitations, idiosyncratic events and other factors as required by banking supervisory guidance for the ACL. The qualitative management adjustment component also includes management adjustments to reflect the uncertainty around the estimated impact of the pandemic on credit loss estimates. 

Accounting for Variable Post-Charge-Off Third-Party Collection Costs 

In the fourth quarter of 2020, Citi revised the 2020 second quarter accounting conclusion for its variable post-charge-off third-party collection costs from a &#8220;change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle&#8221; to a &#8220;change in accounting principle,&#8221; which required an adjustment to January 1, 2020 opening retained earnings, rather than 2020 net income. As a result, Citi&#8217;s full-year and quarterly results for 2020 were revised to reflect this change as if it were effective as of January 1, 2020, as follows: 

&#8226; An increase to beginning retained earnings on January 1, 2020 of $ 330 million and a decrease of $ 443 million in the allowance for credit losses on loans, as well as a $ 113 million decrease in other assets related to income taxes. 

&#8226; A decrease of $ 18 million to provisions for credit losses on loans in the first quarter and increases of $ 339 million and $ 122 million to provisions for credit losses on loans in the second and third quarters, respectively. 

&#8226; Increases in operating expenses of $ 49 million and $ 45 million with a corresponding decrease in net credit losses, in the first and second quarters, respectively. 

In making these revisions, Citi considered the guidance in ASC Topic 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections ; ASC Topic 270, Interim Reporting ; ASC Topic 250-S99-1, Assessing Materiality ; and ASC Topic 250-S99-23, Accounting Changes Not Retroactively Applied Due to Immateriality, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements . Citi believes that the effects of the revisions were not material to any previously reported quarterly or annual period. 

Reference Rate Reform 

In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting , which provides optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. Specifically, the guidance permits an entity, when certain criteria are met, to consider amendments to contracts made to comply with reference rate reform to meet the definition of a modification under U.S. GAAP. It further allows hedge accounting to be maintained and permits a one-time transfer or sale of qualifying held-to-maturity securities. The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments are permitted to be adopted any time through December 31, 2022 and do not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022, except for certain optional expedients elected for certain hedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2022. The ASU was adopted by Citi as of June 30, 2020 with prospective application and did not impact financial results in 2020. 

In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope , which clarifies that the scope of the initial accounting relief issued by the FASB in March 2020 includes derivative instruments that do not reference a rate that is expected to be discontinued but that use an interest rate for margining, discounting or contract price alignment that is modified as a result of reference rate reform (commonly referred to as the &#8220;discounting transition&#8221;). The amendments do not apply to contract modifications made after December 31, 2022, new hedging relationships entered into after December 31, 2022 and existing hedging relationships evaluated for effectiveness in periods after December 31, 2022, except for hedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2022, that apply certain optional expedients in which the accounting effects are recorded through the end of the hedging relationship. The ASU was adopted by Citi on a full retrospective basis upon issuance and did not impact financial results in 2020. 

FUTURE ACCOUNTING CHANGES 

Long-Duration Insurance Contracts 

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-12, Financial Services&#8212;Insurance: Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts , which changes the existing recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosures for long-duration contracts issued by an insurance entity. Specifically, the guidance (i) improves the timeliness of recognizing changes in the liability for future policy benefits and prescribes the rate used to discount future cash flows for long-duration insurance contracts, (ii) simplifies and improves the accounting for certain market-based options or guarantees associated with deposit (or account balance) contracts, (iii) simplifies the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and (iv) introduces additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. Citi has certain insurance subsidiaries, primarily in Mexico, that issue long-duration insurance contracts such as traditional life insurance policies and life-contingent annuity contracts that will be impacted by the requirements of ASU 2018-12. 

The effective date of ASU 2018-12 was deferred for all insurance entities by ASU 2019-09, Financial Services&#8212;Insurance: Effective Date (issued in October 2019) and by ASU 2020-11, Financial Services&#8212;Insurance: Effective Date and Early Application (issued in November 2020). Citi plans to adopt the targeted improvements in ASU 2018-12 on January 1, 2023 and is currently evaluating the impact of the standard on its insurance subsidiaries. Citi does not expect a material impact to its results of operations as a result of adopting the standard. 

2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT DISPOSALS 

Discontinued Operations 

The Company&#8217;s results from Discontinued operations consisted of residual activities related to previously divested operations. All Discontinued operations results are recorded within Corporate/Other . 

The following table summarizes financial information for all Discontinued operations :

(1) Amounts in each period relate to the sale of the Egg Banking business in 2011. 

Cash flows from Discontinued operations were not material for the periods presented. 

Significant Disposals 

Citi did not have any significant disposals to report as of June 30, 2021. As of August 4, 2021, Citi had not entered into any definitive sales agreements related to its recently announced intention to pursue exits of its consumer franchises in 13 markets across Asia and EMEA . 

For a description of the Company&#8217;s significant disposal transactions in prior periods and financial impact, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

3. BUSINESS SEGMENTS 

Citigroup&#8217;s activities are conducted through two business segments: Global Consumer Banking ( GCB) and Institutional Clients Group (ICG) , with the remaining operations in Corporate/Other , which includes activities not assigned to a specific business segment as well as certain North America legacy loan portfolios, discontinued operations and other legacy assets. 

Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, Citi changed its allocation for certain recurring expenses that are attributable to the business segments from Corporate/Other to GCB and ICG . These expenses include incremental investments related to risks and controls, technology capabilities and information security initiatives, as well as some incremental spend related to the pandemic. The prior-period reportable operating segment results have been revised to conform the presentation for all periods to reflect this revised allocation methodology. Citi&#8217;s consolidated results were unchanged for all periods presented as a result of the changes discussed above. 

For additional information regarding Citigroup&#8217;s business segments, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(1) Citi&#8217;s consumer credit card programs have certain partner-sharing agreements that vary by partner. These agreements are subject to contractually based performance thresholds that, if met, would require Citi to make ongoing payments to the partner. The threshold is based on the profitability of a program and is generally calculated based on predefined program revenues less predefined program expenses. In most of Citi&#8217;s partner-sharing agreements, program expenses include net credit losses and, to the extent that the increase in net credit losses reduces Citi&#8217;s liability for the partners&#8217; share for a given program year, would generally result in lower payments to partners in total for that year and vice versa. Further, in some instances, other partner payments are based on program sales and new account acquisitions. 

(2) Includes overdraft fees of $ 24 million and $ 20 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 47 million and $ 51 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Overdraft fees are accounted for under ASC 310. 

(3) Consists primarily of fees earned from structuring and underwriting loan syndications or related financing activity. This activity is accounted for under ASC 310. 

(4) Commissions and fees includes $( 2,073 ) million and $( 1,426 ) million not accounted for under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $( 3,822 ) million and $( 3,228 ) million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Amounts reported in Commissions and fees accounted for under other guidance primarily include card-related loan fees, card reward programs and certain partner payments, corporate finance fees, insurance premiums and loan servicing fees.

6. PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS 

Principal transactions revenue consists of realized and unrealized gains and losses from trading activities. Trading activities include revenues from fixed income, equities, credit and commodities products and foreign exchange transactions that are managed on a portfolio basis and characterized below based on the primary risk managed by each trading desk. Not included in the table below is the impact of net interest revenue related to trading activities, which is an integral part of trading activities&#8217; profitability. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about net interest revenue related to trading activities. Principal transactions include CVA (credit valuation adjustments) and FVA (funding valuation adjustments) on over-the-counter derivatives, and gains (losses) on certain economic hedges on loans in ICG . These adjustments are discussed further in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

In certain transactions, Citi incurs fees and presents these fees paid to third parties in operating expenses.

Evaluating Investments for Impairment 

AFS Debt Securities 

Overview&#8212;AFS Debt Securities 

The Company conducts periodic reviews of all AFS debt securities with unrealized losses to evaluate whether the impairment resulted from expected credit losses or from other factors and to evaluate the Company&#8217;s intent to sell such securities. 

An AFS debt security is impaired when the current fair value of an individual AFS debt security is less than its amortized cost basis. 

The Company recognizes the entire difference between amortized cost basis and fair value in earnings for impaired AFS debt securities that Citi has an intent to sell or for which Citi believes it will more-likely-than-not be required to sell prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis. However, for those AFS debt securities that the Company does not intend to sell and is not likely to be required to sell, only the credit-related impairment is recognized in earnings by recording an allowance for credit losses. Any remaining fair value decline for such securities is recorded in AOCI . The Company does not consider the length of time that the fair value of a security is below its amortized cost when determining if a credit loss exists. 

For AFS debt securities, credit losses exist where Citi does not expect to receive contractual principal and interest cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security. The allowance for credit losses is limited to the amount by which the AFS debt security&#8217;s amortized cost basis exceeds its fair value. The allowance is increased or decreased if credit conditions subsequently worsen or improve. Reversals of credit losses are recognized in earnings. 

The Company&#8217;s review for impairment of AFS debt securities generally entails: 

&#8226; identification and evaluation of impaired investments; 

&#8226; consideration of evidential matter, including an evaluation of factors or triggers that could cause individual positions to qualify as credit impaired and those that would not support credit impairment; and 

&#8226; documentation of the results of these analyses, as required under Citi&#8217;s policies. 

The sections below describe the Company&#8217;s process for identifying expected credit impairments for debt security types that have the most significant unrealized losses as of June 30, 2021. 

Mortgage-Backed Securities 

Citi records no allowances for credit losses on U.S. government-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities, because the Company expects to incur no credit losses in the event of default due to a history of incurring no credit losses and due to the nature of the counterparties. 

State and Municipal Securities 

The process for estimating credit losses in Citigroup&#8217;s AFS state and municipal bonds is primarily based on a credit analysis that incorporates third-party credit ratings. Citi monitors the bond issuers and any insurers providing default protection in the form of financial guarantee insurance. The average external credit rating, ignoring any insurance, is Aa2/AA. In the event of an external rating downgrade or other indicator of credit impairment (i.e., based on instrument-specific estimates of cash flows or probability of issuer default), the subject bond is specifically reviewed for adverse changes in the amount or timing of expected contractual principal and interest payments. 

For AFS state and municipal bonds with unrealized losses that Citi plans to sell or would more-likely-than-not be required to sell, the full impairment is recognized in earnings. For AFS state and municipal bonds where Citi has no intent to sell and it is more-likely-than-not that the Company will not be required to sell, Citi records an allowance for expected credit losses for the amount it expects not to collect, capped at the difference between the bond&#8217;s amortized cost basis and fair value. 

Equity Method Investments 

Management assesses equity method investments that have fair values that are less than their respective carrying values for other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). Fair value is measured as price multiplied by quantity if the investee has publicly listed securities. If the investee is not publicly listed, other methods are used (see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 

For impaired equity method investments that Citi plans to sell prior to recovery of value or would more-likely-than-not be required to sell, with no expectation that the fair value will recover prior to the expected sale date, the full impairment is recognized as OTTI in Other revenue regardless of severity and duration. The measurement of the OTTI does not include partial projected recoveries subsequent to the balance sheet date. 

For impaired equity method investments that management does not plan to sell and is not more-likely-than-not to be required to sell prior to recovery of value, the evaluation of whether an impairment is other-than-temporary is based on (i) whether and when an equity method investment will recover in value and (ii) whether the investor has the intent and ability to hold that investment for a period of time sufficient to recover the value. The determination of whether the impairment is considered other-than-temporary considers the following indicators: 

&#8226; the cause of the impairment and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events that may influence the operations of the issuer; 

&#8226; the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value; and 

&#8226; the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the carrying value.

Non-Marketable Equity Securities Not Carried at Fair Value 

Non-marketable equity securities are required to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings unless (i) the measurement alternative is elected or (ii) the investment represents Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock or certain exchange seats that continue to be carried at cost. 

The election to measure a non-marketable equity security using the measurement alternative is made on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Under the measurement alternative, an equity security is carried at cost plus or minus changes resulting from observable prices in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The carrying value of the equity security is adjusted to fair value on the date of an observed transaction. Fair value may differ from the observed transaction price due to a number of factors, including marketability adjustments and differences in rights and obligations when the observed transaction is not for the identical investment held by Citi. 

Equity securities under the measurement alternative are also assessed for impairment. On a quarterly basis, management qualitatively assesses whether each equity security under the measurement alternative is impaired. Impairment indicators that are considered include, but are not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality or business prospects of the investee; 

&#8226; a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic or technological environment of the investee; 

&#8226; a significant adverse change in the general market condition of either the geographical area or the industry in which the investee operates; 

&#8226; a bona fide offer to purchase, an offer by the investee to sell or a completed auction process for the same or similar investment for an amount less than the carrying amount of that investment; and 

&#8226; factors that raise significant concerns about the investee&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern, such as negative cash flows from operations, working capital deficiencies or noncompliance with statutory capital requirements or debt covenants. 

When the qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, the investment is written down to fair value, with the full difference between the fair value of the investment and its carrying amount recognized in earnings. 

Below is the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020:

A similar impairment analysis is performed for non-marketable equity securities carried at cost. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, there was no impairment loss recognized in earnings for non-marketable equity securities carried at cost. 

Investments in Alternative Investment Funds That Calculate Net Asset Value 

The Company holds investments in certain alternative investment funds that calculate net asset value (NAV), or its equivalent, including private equity funds, funds of funds and real estate funds, as provided by third-party asset managers. Investments in such funds are generally classified as non-marketable equity securities carried at fair value. The fair values of these investments are estimated using the NAV of the Company&#8217;s ownership interest in the funds. Some of these investments are in &#8220;covered funds&#8221; for purposes of the Volcker Rule, which prohibits certain proprietary investment activities and limits the ownership of, and relationships with, covered funds. On April 21, 2017, Citi&#8217;s request for extension of the permitted holding period under the Volcker Rule for certain of its investments in illiquid funds was approved, allowing the Company to hold such investments until the earlier of five years from the July 21, 2017 expiration date of the general conformance period or the date such investments mature or are otherwise conformed with the Volcker Rule.

(1) The above tables do not include loan modifications that meet the TDR relief criteria in the CARES Act or the interagency guidance. 

(2) TDRs involving changes in the amount or timing of principal payments may involve principal forgiveness or deferral of periodic and/or final principal payments. Because forgiveness of principal is rare for corporate loans, modifications typically have little to no impact on the loans&#8217; projected cash flows and thus little to no impact on the allowance established for the loans. Charge-offs for amounts deemed uncollectible may be recorded at the time of the restructuring or may have already been recorded in prior periods such that no charge-off is required at the time of the modification. 

(3) TDRs involving changes in the amount or timing of interest payments may involve a below-market interest rate. 

The following table presents total corporate loans modified in a TDR as well as those TDRs that defaulted and for which the payment default occurred within one year of a permanent modification. Default is defined as 60 days past due, except for classifiably managed commercial banking loans, where default is defined as 90 days past due.
