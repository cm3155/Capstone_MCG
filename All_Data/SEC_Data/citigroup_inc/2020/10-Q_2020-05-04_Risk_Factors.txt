 

RISK FACTORS 

Macroeconomic and Other Challenges and Uncertainties Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic Will Likely Continue to Have Negative Impacts on Citi&#8217;s Businesses and Results of Operations and Financial Condition. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and will likely continue to have, negative impacts on Citi&#8217;s businesses, revenues, expenses, credit costs and overall results of operations and financial condition, which could be material. The pandemic and responses to it have had, and will likely continue to have, a severe impact on global economic conditions, including: 

&#8226; 

sharply reduced U.S. and global economic output and employment; 

&#8226; 

disruption of global supply chains; 

&#8226; 

significant disruption and volatility in financial markets; 

&#8226; 

temporary closures, reduced activity and failures of many businesses, leading to loss of revenues and net losses; and 

&#8226; 

the institution of social distancing and restrictions on movement in the United States and other countries. 

The extent of the COVID-19 pandemic&#8217;s impact on Citi&#8217;s financial performance and operations, including its ability to execute its business initiatives and strategies, will depend on future developments in the U.S. and globally, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the duration and further spread of the disease. The impact will in part be dependent on government and other actions taken to lessen the health and economic repercussions, such as restrictions on movement of people, transportation and businesses, and various fiscal, monetary and other governmental actions. Ongoing legislative and regulatory changes in the U.S. and globally to address the economic impact from the pandemic, such as consumer and corporate relief measures, could further affect Citi&#8217;s businesses and results. Citi could also face challenges, including legal and reputational, and scrutiny in its implementation of and ongoing efforts to provide these relief measures. In addition, the different types of government actions could vary in scale and duration across jurisdictions and regions with varying degrees of effectiveness. The impact of the pandemic on Citi&#8217;s consumer and corporate borrowers will also vary by region, sector or industry, with some borrowers experiencing greater stress levels, which could lead to increased pressure on the results of operations and financial condition of such borrowers, increased borrowings or ratings downgrades, thus likely leading to higher loan losses. In addition, stress levels ultimately experienced by Citi&#8217;s borrowers may be different from and more intense than assumptions made in earlier estimates or models used by Citi during or prior to the emergence of the pandemic. 

The pandemic may not be fully contained for an extended period of time, with the re-emergence of widespread infections possible. A prolonged health crisis could continue to reduce economic activity in the U.S. and other countries, resulting in a further decline in employment and business and consumer confidence. These factors could further negatively impact global economic activity and Citi&#8217;s consumer customers and corporate clients; cause a continued decline in Citi&#8217;s revenues 

&#160;

and the use of its products and services; and further increase Citi&#8217;s credit and other costs. These factors could also cause a continued increase in Citi&#8217;s balance sheet and risk-weighted assets, resulting in a decline in regulatory capital ratios or liquidity measures. Moreover, any disruption or failure of Citi&#8217;s performance of, or its ability to perform, key business functions, as a result of the continued spread of COVID-19 or otherwise, could adversely affect Citi&#8217;s operations. 

A substantial portion of Citi&#8217;s employees have been affected by local COVID-19 restrictions and have been forced to work remotely. As a result, any disruption to Citi&#8217;s information technology systems, including from cyber incidents, could have adverse effects on Citi&#8217;s businesses. In addition, these systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, and Citi could experience service denials or disruptions if demand for such systems were to exceed capacity or if a third-party system fails or experiences any interruptions. Citi has also taken measures to maintain the health and safety of its employees; however, widespread illness could negatively affect staffing within certain functions, businesses or geographies. In addition, Citi&#8217;s ability to recruit, hire and onboard employees in key areas could be negatively impacted by global COVID-19 restrictions. 

Further, it is unclear how the macroeconomic business environment or societal norms may be impacted after the pandemic. The post-COVID-19 environment may undergo unexpected developments or changes in financial markets, the fiscal, tax and regulatory environments and consumer customer and corporate client behavior. These developments and changes could have an adverse impact on Citi&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. Ongoing business and regulatory uncertainties and changes may make Citi&#8217;s longer-term business, balance sheet and budget planning more difficult or costly. Citi, its management and its businesses may also experience increased or different competitive and other challenges in this environment. To the extent that Citi is not able to adapt or compete effectively, the Company could experience loss of business and its results of operations and financial condition could suffer. 

For additional information about trends, uncertainties and risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as Citi&#8217;s management of COVID-19-related risks, see &#8220;COVID-19 Overview,&#8221; above. 

For information about the other most significant risks and uncertainties that could impact Citi&#8217;s businesses, results of operations and financial condition, which could be exacerbated or realized by the COVID-19-related risks discussed above, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Certain series of preferred stock have semi-annual payment dates. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The return on average common stockholders&#8217; equity is calculated using net income less preferred stock dividends divided by average common stockholders&#8217; equity. The return on average total Citigroup stockholders&#8217; equity is calculated using net income divided by average Citigroup stockholders&#8217; equity.

Citi&#8217;s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework as of March 31, 2020, and the Basel III Standardized Approach as of March 31, 2019, whereas Citi&#8217;s reportable Total Capital ratio was the lower derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework for all periods presented. This reflects the U.S. Basel III requirement to report the lower of risk-based capital ratios under both the Standardized Approach and Advanced Approaches in accordance with the Collins Amendment of the Dodd-Frank Act. 

(5) 

Dividends declared per common share as a percentage of net income per diluted share. 

(6) 

Total common dividends declared plus common stock repurchases as a percentage of net income available to common shareholders ( Net income , less preferred dividends). See &#8220;Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders&#8217; Equity,&#8221; Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and &#8220;Equity Security Repurchases&#8221; below for the component details.
