 

RISK FACTORS 

Macroeconomic and Other Challenges and Uncertainties Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic Will Likely Continue to Have Negative Impacts on Citi&#8217;s Businesses and Results of Operations and Financial Condition. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has become global, affecting all of the countries and jurisdictions where Citi operates. The pandemic and responses to it have had, and will likely continue to have, a severe impact on global economic conditions, although the impacts will likely vary from time to time by region, country or state, largely depending on the duration and severity of the public health consequences, including availability of any effective therapeutic or vaccine and public response. These impacts to global economic conditions include, among others: 

&#8226; sharply reduced U.S. and global economic output, resulting in significant losses of employment and lower consumer spending, cards purchase sales and loan volumes; 

&#8226; lower interest rates; 

&#8226; disruption of global supply chains; 

&#8226; significant disruption and volatility in financial markets; 

&#8226; closures, reduced activity and failures of many businesses, leading to loss of revenues and net losses; and 

&#8226; the institution of social distancing and restrictions on movement in and among the United States and other countries. 

The pandemic has had, and will likely continue to have, negative impacts on Citi&#8217;s businesses, revenues, expenses, credit costs and overall results of operations and financial condition, which could be material. The extent of the impact on Citi&#8217;s financial performance and operations, including its ability to execute its business initiatives and strategies, will continue to depend on future developments in the U.S. and globally, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the duration and further spread of the disease, as well as the severity of the economic downturn or any delay or weakness in the economic recovery. The impact will in part be dependent on government and other actions taken to lessen the health and economic repercussions, such as additional fiscal stimulus and/or monetary policy actions, medical investments and advances, restrictions on movement of people, transportation and businesses, and the effectiveness of past and any future fiscal, monetary and other governmental actions. 

Ongoing legislative and regulatory changes in the U.S. and globally to address the economic impact from the pandemic, such as consumer and corporate relief measures and continued lower interest rates, could further affect Citi&#8217;s businesses, credit costs and results. Citi could also face challenges, including legal and reputational, and scrutiny in its implementation of and ongoing efforts to provide these relief measures. Such implementations and efforts have resulted in, and may continue to result in, litigation, including class actions, and regulatory and government actions and proceedings. Such actions may result in judgments, settlements, penalties and fines adverse to Citi. In addition, the 

different types of government actions could vary in scale and duration across jurisdictions and regions with varying degrees of effectiveness. 

The impact of the pandemic on Citi&#8217;s consumer and corporate borrowers will also vary by region, sector or industry, with some borrowers experiencing greater stress levels, which could lead to increased pressure on their results of operations and financial condition, increased borrowings or credit ratings downgrades, thus likely leading to higher credit costs for Citi. In addition, stress levels ultimately experienced by Citi&#8217;s borrowers may be different from and more intense than assumptions made in earlier estimates or models used by Citi, resulting in a further increase in Citi&#8217;s allowance for credit losses or net credit losses. 

The pandemic may not be contained for an extended period of time, due to a further emergence or reemergence of widespread infections. A prolonged health crisis could continue to reduce economic activity in the U.S. and other countries, resulting in additional declines in employment and business and consumer confidence and a prolonged period of lower interest rates. These factors could further negatively impact global economic activity and markets and Citi&#8217;s consumer customers and corporate clients; cause a continued decline in Citi&#8217;s revenues and the demand for its products and services; and further increase Citi&#8217;s credit and other costs. These factors could also cause a continued increase in Citi&#8217;s balance sheet, risk-weighted assets and allowance for credit loss reserves, resulting in a decline in regulatory capital ratios or liquidity measures, as well as regulatory demands for higher capital levels and/or limitations or reductions in capital distributions (such as common share repurchases and dividends). Moreover, any disruption or failure of Citi&#8217;s performance of, or its ability to perform, key business functions, as a result of the continued spread of COVID-19 or otherwise, could adversely affect Citi&#8217;s operations. 

Any disruption to, breaches of or attacks on Citi&#8217;s information technology systems, including from cyber incidents, could have adverse effects on Citi&#8217;s businesses. These systems are supporting a substantial portion of Citi&#8217;s employees who have been affected by local pandemic restrictions and have been forced to work remotely. In addition, these systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, and Citi could experience service denials or disruptions if demand for such systems were to exceed capacity or if a third-party system fails or experiences any interruptions. Citi has also taken measures to maintain the health and safety of its employees; however, these measures could result in increased expenses, and widespread illness could negatively affect staffing within certain functions, businesses or geographies. In addition, Citi&#8217;s ability to recruit, hire and onboard employees in key areas could be negatively impacted by global pandemic restrictions. 

Further, it is unclear how the macroeconomic business environment or societal norms may be impacted after the pandemic. The post-pandemic environment may undergo unexpected developments or changes in financial markets, the fiscal, monetary, tax and regulatory environments and consumer customer and corporate client behavior. These developments and changes could have an adverse impact on Citi&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. Ongoing 

business and regulatory uncertainties and changes may make Citi&#8217;s longer term business, balance sheet and budget planning more difficult or costly. Citi, its management and its businesses may also experience increased or different competitive and other challenges in this environment. To the extent that it is not able to adapt or compete effectively, Citi could experience loss of business and its results of operations and financial condition could suffer. 

For additional information about trends, uncertainties and risks related to the pandemic, as well as Citi&#8217;s management of pandemic-related risks, see &#8220;COVID-19 Pandemic Overview&#8221; above. 

For information about the other most significant risks and uncertainties that could impact Citi&#8217;s businesses, results of operations and financial condition, which could be exacerbated or realized by the pandemic-related risks discussed above, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(1) Certain series of preferred stock have semi-annual payment dates. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

(2) The return on average common stockholders&#8217; equity is calculated using net income less preferred stock dividends divided by average common stockholders&#8217; equity. The return on average total Citigroup stockholders&#8217; equity is calculated using net income divided by average Citigroup stockholders&#8217; equity. 

(3) For information on RoTCE and TBV, see &#8220;Capital Resources&#8212;Tangible Common Equity, Book Value Per Share, Tangible Book Value Per Share and Returns on Equity&#8221; below. RoTCE and TBV are non-GAAP financial measures. 

(4) Citi&#8217;s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework as of September 30, 2020 and the Basel III Standardized Approach as of September 30, 2019, whereas Citi&#8217;s reportable Total Capital ratio was the lower derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework for all periods presented. This reflects the U.S. Basel III requirement to report the lower of risk-based capital ratios under both the Standardized Approach and Advanced Approaches in accordance with the Collins Amendment of the Dodd-Frank Act. 

(5) Dividend payout ratio is calculated as dividends declared per common share as a percentage of net income per diluted share. 

(6) Total payout ratio is calculated as total common dividends declared plus common stock repurchases as a percentage of net income available to common shareholders ( Net income , less preferred dividends).
