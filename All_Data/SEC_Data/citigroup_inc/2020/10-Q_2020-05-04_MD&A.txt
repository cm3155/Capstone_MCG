 

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

First Quarter of 2020&#8212;Results Demonstrated Financial Strength and Operational Resilience in a Challenging Environment 

As described further throughout this Executive Summary, during the first quarter of 2020, Citi demonstrated financial strength and operational resilience, despite a significant deterioration in economic conditions late in the quarter due to the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic and while protecting the health, safety and welfare of its employees and supporting its customers and communities: 

&#8226; 

Citi&#8217;s earnings were significantly reduced by higher reserves taken during the quarter. Citi built approximately $4.9 billion of net loan loss reserves, reflecting the impact of changes in Citi&#8217;s economic outlook on estimated lifetime losses on the March 31, 2020 portfolios under the new Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) standard due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the challenging environment, Citi had solid revenue growth in Institutional Clients Group (ICG) , reflecting strong performance in fixed income and equity markets, as well as mark-to-market gains on loan hedges, partially offset by a decline in treasury and trade solutions, due to the impact of lower interest rates and lower corporate lending revenues. 

&#8226; 

Citi also had revenue growth in Global Consumer Banking ( GCB) , as solid performance in Citi-branded cards in North America GCB was partially offset by lower revenues in Asia GCB , reflecting the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on customer behavior. 

&#8226; 

Citi demonstrated good expense discipline, resulting in expenses that were largely unchanged from the prior year, as well as positive operating leverage and 27% improvement in operating margin. 

&#8226; 

Citi maintained credit discipline, while supporting clients. 

&#8226; 

Citi had broad-based loan and deposit growth across GCB and ICG . 

&#8226; 

Citi returned $4.0 billion of capital to its shareholders in the form of common stock repurchases and dividends; Citi repurchased approximately 41 million common shares, contributing to a 10% reduction in average outstanding common shares from the prior year. As previously announced, in March 2020, Citi along with other major U.S. banks took the proactive step to suspend share repurchases to further bolster capital and liquidity positions, in order to allow additional capacity to support clients during this time of uncertainty. 

&#8226; 

Citi continues to support its customers and clients as well as the broader economy during this challenging time, even as roughly 80% of its workforce is working remotely, and maintained strong regulatory capital and liquidity metrics. 

&#160;

For further information on Citi&#8217;s measures to support its employees, customers and clients in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, see &#8220;COVID-19 Overview&#8221; below. 

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the economic outlook for 2020 has been lowered substantially, and continued uncertainties around COVID-19, including, among others, the length and severity of the economic and public health impacts, have created a much more volatile operating environment that could negatively impact Citi&#8217;s businesses and future results during the remainder of 2020. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties related to the pandemic, see &#8220;COVID-19 Overview,&#8221; &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and each respective business&#8217;s results of operations below. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties that could affect Citi, see &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; below and each respective business&#8217;s results of operations and &#8220;Managing Global Risk&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

First Quarter of 2020 Results Summary 

Citigroup 

Citigroup reported net income of $2.5 billion, or $1.05 per share, compared to net income of $4.7 billion, or $1.87 per share, in the prior-year period. Net income declined 46%, primarily driven by higher loan loss reserves, reflecting the impact of changes in Citi&#8217;s economic outlook on estimated lifetime losses under CECL due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Earnings per share decreased 44%, as the decline in net income was partially offset by a 10% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding. 

Citigroup revenues of $20.7 billion in the first quarter of 2020 increased 12% from the prior-year period, primarily reflecting higher revenues in ICG , including higher revenues in fixed income and equity markets as well as the benefit of mark-to-market gains on loan hedges. 

Citigroup&#8217;s end-of-period loans increased 6% to $721 billion. Excluding the impact of FX translation, Citigroup&#8217;s end-of-period loans grew 8%, as 9% aggregate growth in ICG and GCB was partially offset by the continued wind-down of legacy assets in Corporate/Other . Citigroup&#8217;s end-of-period deposits increased 15% to $1.2 trillion. Excluding the impact of FX translation, Citigroup&#8217;s end-of-period deposits increased 17%, primarily driven by 21% growth in ICG and 8% growth in GCB . (Citi&#8217;s results of operations excluding the impact of FX translation are non-GAAP financial measures.) 

Expenses 

Citigroup operating expenses of $10.6 billion were largely unchanged versus the prior-year period, as continued investments in the franchise, higher compensation and volume-related expenses were offset by efficiency savings and the wind-down of legacy assets. Year-over-year, GCB and Corporate/Other operating expenses declined 1% and 24%, respectively, while ICG expenses increased 3%. 

Cost of Credit 

Citi&#8217;s total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims of $7.0 billion compared to $2.0 billion in the prior-year period. The increase reflected the loan loss reserve builds related to the impact of changes in Citi&#8217;s economic outlook on estimated lifetime losses on the March 31, 2020 portfolios under the CECL standard due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Net credit losses of $2.1 billion increased 8%. Consumer net credit losses of $2.0 billion increased 6%, primarily reflecting volume growth and seasoning in the North America cards portfolios. Corporate net credit losses increased to $127 million from $79 million in the prior-year period. 

For additional information on Citi&#8217;s consumer and corporate credit costs and allowance for loan losses, see each respective business&#8217;s results of operations and &#8220;Credit Risk&#8221; below. 

Capital 

Citigroup&#8217;s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio was 11.2% as of March 31, 2020, based on the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework for determining risk-weighted assets, compared to 11.9% as of March 31, 2019, based on the Basel III Standardized Approach for determining risk-weighted assets. The decline in the ratio primarily reflected an increase in risk-weighted assets, as Citi further supported its clients during the quarter, as well as increased market volatility and the widening of credit spreads. Citigroup&#8217;s Supplementary Leverage ratio as of March 31, 2020 was 6.0%, compared to 6.4% as of March 31, 2019. For additional information on Citi&#8217;s capital ratios and related components, see &#8220;Capital Resources&#8221; below. 

Global Consumer Banking 

GCB net loss of $0.8 billion, compared to income of $1.3 billion in the prior-year period, reflected higher cost of credit, partially offset by higher revenues and lower expenses. GCB operating expenses of $4.4 billion decreased 1%. Excluding the impact of FX translation, expenses were largely unchanged, as efficiency savings were offset by continued investments in the franchise and volume-driven growth. 

GCB revenues of $8.2 billion increased 1%. Excluding the impact of FX translation, revenues increased 2%, as growth in North America GCB was partially offset by lower revenues in Asia GCB , reflecting the early impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on customer behavior. North America GCB revenues of $5.2 billion increased 4%, primarily driven by growth in Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services, while retail banking revenues were largely unchanged. In North America GCB , Citi-branded cards revenues of $2.3 billion increased 7%, reflecting volume growth as well as spread expansion. Citi retail services revenues of $1.7 billion increased 4%, reflecting a reduction in partner payments and higher average loans. Retail banking revenues of $1.1 billion were largely unchanged versus the prior-year period, as deposit growth and higher mortgage revenues were offset by lower deposit spreads. 

North America GCB average deposits of $161 billion increased 8% year-over-year, average retail banking loans of $51 billion increased 6% year-over-year and assets under 

&#160;

management of $62 billion declined 6% (including the impact of market movements). Average Citi-branded card loans of $92 billion increased 5%, while Citi-branded card purchase sales of $86 billion increased 3%, including pressure during the latter part of March, driven by reduced client activity related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Average Citi retail services loans of $51 billion increased 1%, while Citi retail services purchase sales of $18 billion decreased 3%, including pressure during the latter part of March, driven by reduced client activity and store closures related to COVID-19. For additional information on the results of operations of North America GCB for the first quarter of 2020, see &#8220; Global Consumer Banking&#8212;North America GCB &#8221; below. 

International GCB revenues (consisting of Latin America GCB and Asia GCB (which includes the results of operations in certain EMEA countries)), of $3.0 billion declined 5% versus the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of FX translation, international GCB revenues declined 1%. On this basis, Latin America GCB revenues were largely unchanged. Excluding the impact of a residual gain in the prior-year period on the sale of an asset management business, revenues increased 3%, driven by deposit growth and improved spreads in cards. Asia GCB revenues decreased 1%, as growth in fees on investments and foreign currency transactions was more than offset by lower revenues in cards, reflecting lower sales volumes due to COVID-19. For additional information on the results of operations of Latin America GCB and Asia GCB for the first quarter of 2020, including the impact of FX translation, see &#8220; Global Consumer Banking&#8212;Latin America GCB &#8221; and &#8220; Global Consumer Banking&#8212;Asia GCB &#8221; below. 

Year-over-year, international GCB average deposits of $129 billion increased 8%, average retail banking loans of $73 billion increased 6%, assets under management of $83 billion decreased 6% (including the impact of market movements), average card loans of $24 billion increased 1% and card purchase sales of $24 billion decreased 4%, all excluding the impact of FX translation. 

Institutional Clients Group 

ICG net income of $3.6 billion increased 7%, primarily driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher cost of credit and expenses. ICG operating expenses increased 3% to $5.8 billion, primarily driven by higher compensation costs, continued investments and volume-driven growth, partially offset by efficiency savings. 

ICG revenues of $12.5 billion increased 25%, reflecting a 13% increase in Banking revenues and a 37% increase in Markets and securities services revenues. The increase in Banking revenues included the impact of $816 million of gains on loan hedges related to corporate lending and the private bank, compared to losses of $231 million related to corporate lending in the prior-year period. 

Banking revenues of $5.2 billion (excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges) decreased 6%, as declines in both corporate lending and treasury and trade solutions were partially offset by higher revenues in the private bank. Investment banking revenues of $1.4 billion were largely unchanged, as growth in advisory and equity underwriting was offset by a decline in debt underwriting. Advisory revenues 

increased 2% to $386 million, equity underwriting revenues increased 5% to $180 million and debt underwriting revenues declined 2% to $784 million. 

Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $2.4 billion declined 5%, and 2% excluding the impact of FX translation, as strong client engagement and growth in deposits were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates. Private bank revenues of $949 million increased 8% (excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges), driven by higher lending and deposit volumes as well as increased capital markets activity, partially offset by lower deposit spreads. Corporate lending revenues of $1.3 billion increased from $518 million in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, corporate lending revenues decreased 40%, primarily reflecting an adjustment to the residual value of a lease financing, as well as other marks on the portfolio. 

Markets and securities services revenues of $6.5 billion increased 37%. Fixed income markets revenues of $4.8 billion increased 39%, reflecting strength in rates and currencies and commodities. Equity markets revenues of $1.2 billion increased 39%, with strong performance in derivatives, including an increase in client activity, due to higher volatility. Securities services revenues of $645 million increased 1%, and 5% excluding the impact of FX translation, reflecting higher client activity and deposit volumes, partially offset by lower spreads. For additional information on the results of operations of ICG for the first quarter of 2020, see &#8220; Institutional Clients Group &#8221; below. 

Corporate/Other 

Corporate/Other net loss was $351 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to a net loss of $11 million in the prior-year period, driven by higher cost of credit, reflecting loan loss reserves on Citi&#8217;s residual legacy portfolio under the CECL standard, and lower revenues, partially offset by a decrease in expenses. Operating expenses of $416 million declined 24%, reflecting the continued wind-down of legacy assets, partially offset by higher infrastructure costs as well as incremental costs associated with COVID-19, including special compensation awarded to 75,000 employees most directly impacted by the pandemic. Corporate/Other revenues of $73 million declined 84%, reflecting the wind-down of legacy assets, the impact of lower interest rates and marks on legacy securities. For additional information on the results of operations of Corporate/Other for the first quarter of 2020, see &#8220; Corporate/Other &#8221; below. 

&#160;

COVID-19 OVERVIEW 

In addition to the widespread public health implications, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has had an extraordinary impact on macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. and around the world. The health and safety of Citi&#8217;s employees and their families, as well as Citi&#8217;s customers, clients and communities it serves, are of the utmost importance. As this health crisis has unfolded, Citi has continued to take proactive measures to preserve their well-being while maintaining its ability to serve customers and clients. 

During the pandemic, Citi remained well positioned from a capital and liquidity perspective, and has maintained strong business operations. At quarter end, Citi had a CET1 Capital ratio of 11.2%, a Supplementary Leverage Ratio of 6.0% and a Liquidity Coverage Ratio of 115%, with $840 billion of available liquidity (see &#8220;Managing Global Risk &#8212; Liquidity Risk&#8221; below). As discussed below and elsewhere throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi's businesses, results of operations and financial condition have been impacted by economic dislocations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments and central banks globally have taken a series of aggressive actions to support the economy and mitigate the systemic impacts of the pandemic, and Citi continues to proactively assess and utilize these measures where appropriate. 

Citi&#8217;s COVID-19 Response &#8212; Supporting Employees, Customers and Communities 

Citi Employees 

&#8226; 

Approximately 80% of Citi employees around the world are working remotely. 

&#8226; 

Citi is providing more than 75,000 employees globally with a special compensation award to help ease the financial burden of the crisis. This includes a $1,000 special payment to eligible colleagues in the U.S. Outside the U.S., the amount of the award is based on local market compensation levels. 

&#8226; 

Employees who cannot work due to COVID-19-related challenges continue to be compensated. 

&#8226; 

Clinical staff have been working to support our employees. 

&#8226; 

Extra cleaning protocols and protective supplies have been put in place at Citi sites, branches and ATMs, and staff have been educated on preventive measures. 

Global Consumer Banking Customers 

North America GCB : In the U.S., Citi was one of the first banks to announce assistance measures for impacted customers and has since expanded its support. These measures include: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Credit Cards: Waivers on late fees and deferral of minimum payments for two payment cycles. 

&#8226; 

Retail Banking / Small Businesses: Waivers on fees including non-Citi ATM fees and monthly service fees. 

&#8226; 

Mortgages: In addition to extending existing treatment options, Citi is suspending foreclosures for 60 days. 

&#8226; 

Small Businesses: Citi is participating in the Small Business Administration&#8217;s (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program (see &#8220;Small Business Administration&#8217;s Paycheck Protection Program&#8221; below). 

Asia GCB : Citi`s assistance measures include a wide array of programs for different types of products, providing short- and medium-term relief to customers in various countries. In certain countries, the local regulators mandated relief programs to counter the economic stress as a result of the 

COVID-19 outbreak. Relief has been provided to credit card, mortgage, margin product and personal loan customers in the form of: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Payment deferrals for revolving products and overdrafts of up to 3 months 

&#8226; 

Payment deferrals for installment loans up to 12 months 

&#8226; 

Interest and fee waivers 

&#8226; 

Reduction in minimum due payments 

Latin America GCB : In Mexico, assistance measures for impacted credit card, mortgage, personal loan, payroll loan and small business banking customers in the form of: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Deferral of minimum payments for up to 6 months 

&#8226; 

Temporary interest rate reductions 

&#8226; 

Waivers on certain fees 

Although some of Citi`s customer relief programs were introduced recently, programs in effect during the first quarter totaled approximately $1 billion of loan balances as of quarter end, excluding troubled debt restructurings (see &#8220;Troubled Debt Restructuring (TDR) Relief&#8221; below). These loan balances are expected to increase in the second quarter of 2020, as many programs were introduced toward the end of the first quarter of 2020 and have subsequently expanded. Loan balances for programs in effect during the first quarter were primarily concentrated in Asia GCB . 

Corporate Clients 

&#8226; 

Citi is prudently extending credit to corporate clients to support their liquidity objectives and business needs. 

&#8226; 

Clients have drawn approximately $25 billion in financing on previously extended credit facilities. 

&#8226; 

More than $21 billion of new credit facilities have been approved. 

&#8226; 

Citi facilitated $292 billion of clients&#8217; new debt issuances in the investment-grade debt markets during the first quarter of 2020. 

&#8226; 

Citi is leveraging digital capabilities to assist clients with supply chain management and liquidity optimization. 

Communities 

Citi, the Citi Foundation and Citi colleagues are supporting those immediately impacted by the crisis through a variety of efforts. Citi is donating its net profits earned through its participation in the Paycheck Protection Program to the Citi Foundation. The Citi Foundation will use the funds to expand 

&#160;

its COVID-19 U.S. Small Business Relief Program to support efforts by Community Development Financial Institutions to serve small, diverse entrepreneurs who may not fully qualify for federal government stimulus funding. To date, Citi and the Citi Foundation have committed over $65 million in support of COVID-19 community relief efforts. Citi has also launched an employee matching campaign to further extend employee contributions in support of COVID-19 relief efforts. Citi has also organized donations of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to healthcare workers and is facilitating other assistance measures such as meals for food banks. 

Citi&#8217;s Management of COVID-19 Risks 

Citi has responded on multiple fronts to the recent challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic to support the ongoing needs of its customers and clients, while concurrently maintaining safety and soundness standards throughout the crisis. 

Citi&#8217;s dedicated continuity of business and crisis management groups are managing Citi&#8217;s protocols in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These protocols provide for the safety and well-being of Citi&#8217;s staff, while continuing to maintain high levels of client servicing across all of the markets in which Citi operates. These protocols address the prioritization of critical processing; ability of staff and third parties to support these processes from remote work locations; deployment of new hardware to support technology needs; and ongoing monitoring to assess controls and service levels. Planning for Citi&#8217;s return-to-office strategy is ongoing. 

Citi&#8217;s organizational response to the COVID-19 pandemic was governed by Citi&#8217;s Executive Management Team and driven through regional task forces that were deployed initially in Asia and subsequently in EMEA , North America and Latin America as the pandemic spread. Led by regional CEOs and their management teams, these groups focused on COVID-19 pandemic responses, the implementation of continuity of business plans, locational and staffing strategies and responses to customer and client needs. 

Throughout the crisis, Citi has also worked closely with U.S. authorities and host governments on implementing immediate policy responses and financial assistance structures to mitigate the systemic impacts of the pandemic. Citi also continues to engage closely with customers and clients, regulators and other relevant stakeholders to assure alignment on all COVID-19 pandemic-related matters. 

Citi expects that overall revenues in the near term, including GCB and ICG revenues, could be adversely impacted by the lower interest rate environment as well as the challenging macroeconomic and market conditions, including the effects related to the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the responses of governments, customers and clients. In particular, Asia GCB experienced some initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on customer behavior in the first quarter of 2020, while North America GCB and Latin America GCB began to experience impacts, such as significant declines in cards purchase sales, only during the second half of March 2020. Citi expects that these impacts to its GCB businesses, including lower purchase sales and loan volumes, will continue at least through the second quarter of 2020. 

In addition, Citi&#8217;s operating expenses may be impacted by uncertainties related to the pandemic, including, among other things, the continued efforts to protect and support Citigroup&#8217;s employees and to support Citi&#8217;s customers and clients digitally. 

Moreover, Citi, including GCB and ICG , expects to experience higher net credit losses given Citi&#8217;s current economic forecasts, and a continued significant impact on its reserves for credit losses, especially if the economic environment continues to, or under the CECL standard is forecasted to, deteriorate. ICG expects net credit loss reserve builds due to further credit downgrades. For additional information about significant risks to Citi from the COVID-19 pandemic, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; below. 

Balance Sheet and Other Impacts Related to COVID-19 

&#160; 

Balance Sheet Trends 

As of March 31, 2020, Citi&#8217;s end-of-period balance sheet grew 13% from the prior-year period (16% excluding the impact of FX translation) and 14% sequentially (16% excluding the 

&#160;

impact of FX translation), as it supported both its consumer 

and institutional clients through the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, while maintaining a strong capital and 

liquidity profile. This included year-over-year loan growth of 6% (8% excluding the impact of FX translation) and deposit growth of 15% (17% excluding the impact of FX translation), both reflecting significant growth in ICG . For additional information, see &#8220;Liquidity Risk&#8221; below. 

Impact of CECL on Citi&#8217;s Allowance for Credit Losses 

On January 1, 2020, Citi adopted the new CECL standard and recorded a $4.1 billion, or an approximate 29%, increase in the allowance for credit losses. As discussed above, during the quarter Citi also built approximately $4.9 billion of net loan loss reserves, reflecting the impact of changes in Citi&#8217;s 

economic outlook on estimated lifetime losses under the CECL standard due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The table below shows the impact of Citi&#8217;s adoption of CECL and the credit reserve builds during the quarter. For additional information on Citi&#8217;s updated accounting policy on accounting for credit losses under CECL, see Notes 1 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) 

In the first quarter of 2020, Citi's AOCI was a net after-tax gain of $3.8 billion, driven primarily by COVID-19-related economic disruptions in financial markets. Citi&#8217;s own credit spreads widened, resulting in a $3.1 billion (after-tax) DVA gain on Citi&#8217;s debt accounted for under the fair value option. Currency fluctuations resulted in a $4.1 billion currency translation adjustment loss, which was driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies. Other significant drivers were a net $3.1 billion increase in unrealized gains on AFS investment securities, which was driven by the reductions in interest rates, and a $1.9 billion gain on cash flow hedges. The DVA gain and cash flow hedge gain do not have an impact on regulatory capital. For 

&#160;

additional information on the components of Citi&#8217;s AOCI , see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Common Stock Repurchases 

As discussed above, on March 15, 2020, Citi joined other major U.S. banks in suspending stock repurchases to further bolster Citi&#8217;s capital and liquidity positions, in order to allow additional capacity to support clients in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. There was no change to Citi&#8217;s dividend policy. For additional information, see &#8220;Equity Security Repurchases&#8221; below. 

Principal Transactions Revenues 

Global trading markets experienced significant increases in volatility, trading volumes and movements. Citi&#8217;s principal transactions revenues, recorded in ICG , were $5.4 billion in the first quarter of 2020, an increase of $2.7 billion from the prior-year period. For additional information on Citi&#8217;s trading results, see &#8220; Institutional Clients Group &#8221; and Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Goodwill and Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets 

Goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets were evaluated for impairment triggers as of March 31, 2020 and it was determined that there was no indication of impairment. For additional information, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Certain Key Government Actions in Support of the Economy 

U.S. Government-Sponsored Liquidity Programs 

During the first quarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) introduced several liquidity facilities in response to the funding market volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Citi has participated in several of the U.S. government-sponsored liquidity programs, including the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF), the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) and Discount Window (DW) in order to facilitate client activity and support the FRB actions to provide additional liquidity into the market. Citi has also participated in the Paycheck Protection Program Lending Facility (PPPLF), which was established to facilitate lending under the SBA&#8217;s Paycheck Protection Program (see &#8220;Small Business Administration&#8217;s Paycheck Protection Program&#8221; below). The amounts Citi sourced from these facilities were not significant to Citi&#8217;s overall liquidity profile, which remains strong and highly liquid. For additional information about Citi&#8217;s liquidity resources, see &#8220;Managing Global Risk&#8212;Liquidity Risk&#8221; below. 

U.S. Banking Agencies Regulatory Capital Relief 

The U.S. banking agencies issued several interim final rules during March and April 2020 to revise the current regulatory capital standards applicable to Citi, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. These interim final rules revised regulatory capital requirements to provide banking organizations with additional flexibility to support households and businesses. These include: 

&#8226;

Troubled Debt Restructuring (TDR) Relief 

Under U.S. GAAP, banks are required to assess modifications to a loan&#8217;s terms for potential classification as a TDR. A loan to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty is classified as a TDR when a lender grants a concession that it would otherwise not consider, such as a payment deferral or interest concession. In order to encourage banks to work with impacted borrowers, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) and U.S. banking agencies have provided relief from TDR accounting. The main benefits of TDR relief include a capital benefit in the form of reduced risk-weighted assets, as TDRs are more heavily risk-weighted for capital purposes; aging of the loans is frozen, i.e., they will continue to be reported in the same delinquency bucket they were in at the time of modification; and the loans are generally not reported as non-accrual during the modification period.
