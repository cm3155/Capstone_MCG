MANAGING GLOBAL RISK

Overview
For Citi, effective risk management is of primary importance 
to its overall operations. Accordingly, Citi’s risk management 
process has been designed to monitor, evaluate and manage 
the principal risks it assumes in conducting its activities. 
Specifically, the activities that Citi engages in, and the risks 
those activities generate, must be consistent with Citi’s 
Mission and Value Proposition and the key principles that 
guide it, as well as Citi's risk appetite. As discussed above, 
Citi is continuing its efforts to comply with the FRB and OCC 
consent orders, relating principally to various aspects of risk 
management, compliance, data quality management and 
governance, and internal controls (see “Citi’s Consent Order 
Compliance” and “Risk Factors—Compliance Risks” above).

Risk management must be built on a foundation of ethical 

culture. Under Citi’s Mission and Value Proposition, which 
was developed by its senior leadership and distributed 
throughout the Company, Citi strives to serve its clients as a 
trusted partner by responsibly providing financial services that 
enable growth and economic progress while earning and 
maintaining the public’s trust by constantly adhering to the 
highest ethical standards. As such, Citi asks all colleagues to 
ensure that their decisions pass three tests: they are in Citi’s 
clients’ interests, create economic value and are always 
systemically responsible. In addition, Citi evaluates 
colleagues’ performance against behavioral expectations set 
out in Citi’s Leadership Principles, which were designed in 
part to effectuate Citi’s Mission and Value Proposition. Other 
culture-related efforts in connection with conduct risk, ethics 
and leadership, escalation and treating customers fairly help 
Citi to execute its Mission and Value Proposition.

Citi has established an Enterprise Risk Management 

(ERM) Framework to ensure that all of Citi’s risks are 
managed appropriately and consistently across Citi and at an 
aggregate, enterprise-wide level. The ERM Framework details 
the principles used to support effective enterprise-wide risk 
management across the end-to-end risk management lifecycle. 
The ERM Framework also provides clarity on the expected 
activities in relation to risk management of the Citigroup 
Board of Directors (the Board), Citi’s Executive Management 
Team (See “Risk Governance—Executive Management 
Team” below) and employees across the lines of defense. The 
underlying pillars of the framework encompass:

•

•

•

Culture—the core principles and behaviors that underpin 
a strong culture of risk awareness, in line with Citi’s 
Mission and Value Proposition, and Leadership 
Principles;
Governance—the committee structure and reporting 
arrangements that support the appropriate oversight of 
risk management activities at the Board and Executive 
Management Team levels;
Risk Management—the end-to-end risk management 
cycle including the identification, measurement, 
monitoring, controlling and reporting of all risks 
including emerging, growing, idiosyncratic or otherwise 
material risks, and aggregated to an enterprise-wide level; 
and

66

•

Enterprise Programs—the key risk management 
programs performed across the risk management lifecycle 
for all risk categories; these programs also outline the 
specific roles played by each of the lines of defense in 
these processes.

Each of these pillars is underpinned by Supporting 
Capabilities, which are the infrastructure, people, technology 
and data, and modelling and analytical capabilities that are in 
place to enable the execution of the ERM Framework.

Citi’s approach to risk management requires that its risk-
taking be consistent with its risk appetite. Risk appetite is the 
aggregate type and level of risk Citi is willing to take in order 
to meet its strategic objectives and business plan. Citi’s Risk 
Appetite Framework sets boundaries for risk-taking and 
consists of a set of risk appetite statements as well as the 
governance processes through which the risk appetite is 
established, communicated, cascaded and monitored.

Citi’s risks are generally categorized and summarized as 

follows:

•

•

Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the decline in 
credit quality (or downgrade risk) or failure of a borrower, 
counterparty, third party or issuer to honor its financial or 
contractual obligations.
Liquidity risk is the risk that Citi will not be able to 
efficiently meet both expected and unexpected current and 
future cash flow and collateral needs without adversely 
affecting either daily operations or financial conditions of 
Citi. 

•

• Market risk (Trading and Non-Trading): Market risk of 
trading portfolios is the risk of loss arising from changes 
in the value of Citi’s assets and liabilities resulting from 
changes in market variables, such as equity and 
commodity prices or credit spreads. Market risk of non-
trading portfolios is the risk to current or projected 
financial condition and resilience arising from movements 
in interest rates and resulting from repricing risk, basis 
risk, yield curve risk and options risk.
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from 
inadequate or failed internal processes, people and 
systems, or from external events. It includes legal risk, 
which is the risk of loss (including litigation costs, 
settlements and regulatory fines) resulting from the failure 
of Citi to comply with laws, regulations, prudent ethical 
standards and contractual obligations in any aspect of 
Citi’s business, but excludes strategic and reputation risks 
(see below).
Compliance risk is the risk to current or projected 
financial condition and resilience arising from violations 
of laws, rules or regulations, or from non-conformance 
with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures 
or ethical standards. 
Reputation risk is the risk to current or projected financial 
conditions and resilience arising from negative public 
opinion. 
Strategic risk is the risk of a sustained impact (not 
episodic impact) to Citi’s core strategic objectives as 
measured by impacts on anticipated earnings, market 
capitalization, or capital, arising from the external factors

as the risks associated with defining the strategy and 
executing the strategy, which are identified, measured and 
managed as part of the Strategic Risk Framework at the 
Enterprise Level.

and Chief Compliance Officer (CCO)) who have unrestricted 
access to the Citigroup Board of Directors and its Risk 
Management Committee to facilitate the ability to execute 
their specific responsibilities pertaining to escalation to the 
Citigroup Board of Directors.

Citi uses a lines of defense model as a key component of 
its ERM Framework to manage its risks. The lines of defense 
model brings together risk-taking, risk oversight and risk 
assurance under one umbrella and provides an avenue for risk 
accountability of first line of defense, a construct for effective 
challenge by the second line of defense (Independent Risk 
Management and Independent Compliance Risk 
Management), and empowers independent risk assurance by 
the third line of defense (Internal Audit). In addition, Citi has 
enterprise support functions that support safety and soundness 
across Citi. Each of the lines of defense and enterprise support 
functions, along with the Board, are empowered to perform 
relevant risk management processes and responsibilities in 
order to manage Citi’s risks in a consistent and effective 
manner.

First Line of Defense: Front Line Units and Front Line 
Unit Activities
Citi’s first line of defense owns the risks inherent in or arising 
from their business and is responsible for identifying, 
measuring, monitoring, controlling and reporting those risks 
consistent with Citi’s strategy, Mission and Value Proposition, 
Leadership Principles and risk appetite. 

Front line units are responsible and held accountable for 
managing the risks associated with their activities within the 
boundaries set by independent risk management. They are also 
responsible for designing and implementing effective internal 
controls and maintaining processes for managing their risk 
profile, including through risk mitigation, so that it remains 
consistent with Citi’s established risk appetite.

Front line unit activities are considered part of the first 

line of defense and are subject to the oversight and challenge 
of independent risk management. 

The first line of defense is composed of Citi’s Business 

Management, Regional and Country Management, certain 
Corporate Functions (Enterprise Operations and Technology, 
Chief Administrative Office, Global Public Affairs, Office of 
the Citibank Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Finance), as 
well as other front line unit activities. Front line units may also 
include enterprise support units and activities—see “Enterprise 
Support Functions” below.

Second Line of Defense: Independent Risk Management 
Independent risk management units are independent of front 
line units. They are responsible for overseeing the risk-taking 
activities of the first line of defense and challenging the first 
line of defense in the execution of their risk management 
responsibilities. They are also responsible for independently 
identifying, measuring, monitoring, controlling and reporting 
aggregate risks and for setting standards for the management 
and oversight of risk. Independent risk management is 
comprised of Independent Risk Management (IRM) and 
Independent Compliance Risk Management (ICRM) and are 
led by chief risk executives (i.e., Chief Risk Officer (CRO) 

67

Independent Risk Management
The IRM organization sets risk and control standards for the 
first line of defense and actively manages and oversees 
aggregate credit, market (trading and non-trading), liquidity, 
strategic, operational and reputation risks across Citi, 
including risks that span categories, such as concentration risk, 
country risk and climate risk. 

IRM is organized to align to risk categories, legal entities/
regions and Company-wide, cross-risk functions or processes 
(i.e., foundational areas). There are teams that report to an 
independent CRO for various risk categories and legal entities/
regions. In addition, there are foundational teams that report to 
Foundational Risk Management heads. The Risk Category, 
Legal Entity/Regional CROs and Foundational Risk 
Management Heads report to the Citigroup CRO.

Independent Compliance Risk Management 
The ICRM organization actively oversees compliance risk 
across Citi, sets compliance risk and control standards for the 
first line of defense to manage compliance risk and promotes 
business conduct and activity that is consistent with Citi’s 
Mission and Value Proposition and the compliance risk 
appetite. Citi’s objective is to embed an enterprise-wide 
compliance risk management framework and culture that 
identifies, measures, monitors, controls and escalates 
compliance risk across Citi. 

ICRM is aligned by product line, function and geography 

to provide compliance risk management advice and credible 
challenge on day-to-day matters and strategic decision-making 
for key initiatives. ICRM also has program-level Enterprise 
Compliance units responsible for setting standards and 
establishing priorities for program-related compliance efforts. 
These Compliance Risk Management heads report directly to 
the CCO.

Third Line of Defense: Internal Audit
Internal Audit is independent of front line units and 
independent risk management units. The role of Internal Audit 
is to provide independent, objective, reliable, valued and 
timely assurance to the Citigroup Board of Directors, its Audit 
Committee, Citi senior management and regulators over the 
effectiveness of governance, risk management and controls 
that mitigate current and evolving risks and enhance the 
control culture within Citi. Internal Audit reports to a chief 
audit executive (i.e., Citi’s Chief Auditor) who has 
unrestricted access to the Board and the board of directors of 
certain subsidiaries or their respective audit committees to 
facilitate the ability to execute specific responsibilities 
pertaining to escalation of risks and issues. The Internal Audit 
function has designated Chief Auditors responsible for 
assessing the design and effectiveness of controls within the 
various business units, functions, geographies and legal 
entities in which Citi operates.

•

•

Ethics, Conduct and Culture Committee: provides 
oversight of Citi’s Conduct Risk Management Program.
Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee: 
provides oversight of reputational issues, Environmental, 
Social and Governance (ESG) and sustainability matters, 
and legal and regulatory compliance risks as they relate to 
corporate governance matters.

In addition to the above, the Board has established the 
following ad hoc committee: 

•

Transformation Oversight Committee: provides oversight 
of the actions of Citi’s management to develop and 
execute a transformation of Citi’s risk and control 
environment pursuant to the recent regulatory consent 
orders (for additional information see “Citi’s Consent 
Order Compliance” above).

The Executive Management Team has established five 
standing committees that cover the primary risks to which Citi 
(i.e., Group) is exposed. These consist of:

•

•

•

•

•

Group Strategic Risk Committee (GSRC): provides 
governance oversight of Citi’s management actions to 
adequately identify, monitor, report, manage and escalate 
all material strategic risks facing Citi. 
Citigroup Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO): 
responsible for governance over management’s Liquidity 
Risk and Market Risk (non-trading) management and for 
monitoring and influencing the balance sheet, investment 
securities and capital management activities of Citigroup.
Group Risk Management Committee (GRMC): provides 
governance oversight of Credit Risk and Market Risk 
(trading) management in the Trading Book.
Group Business Risk and Control Committee (GBRCC): 
provides governance oversight of Citi’s Compliance and 
Operational Risks. 
Group Reputation Risk Committee (GRRC): provides 
governance oversight for Reputation Risk management 
across Citi.

In addition to the Executive Management committees listed 
above, the Board may establish ad-hoc committees in response 
to regulatory feedback or to manage additional activities 
where deemed necessary.

Enterprise Support Functions
Enterprise support functions engage in activities that support 
safety and soundness across Citi. These functions provide 
advisory services and/or design, implement, maintain and 
oversee Company-wide programs that support Citi in 
maintaining an effective control environment. 

Enterprise support functions are comprised of Human 

Resources, International Franchise Management, Legal 
(including Citi Security and Investigative Services). 

Enterprise support functions, units and activities are 
subject to the relevant Company-wide independent oversight 
processes specific to the risk category that they generate (e.g., 
operational risk, compliance risk, reputation risk).

Risk Governance
Citi’s ERM Framework encompasses risk management 
processes to address risks undertaken by Citi through 
identification, measurement, monitoring, controlling and 
reporting of all risks. The ERM Framework integrates these 
processes with appropriate governance to complement Citi’s 
commitment to maintaining strong and consistent risk 
management practices.

Board Oversight
The Board is responsible for oversight of risk management 
and holds the Executive Management Team accountable for 
implementing the ERM Framework and meeting strategic 
objectives within Citi’s risk appetite.

Executive Management Team
The Board delegates authority to an Executive Management 
Team for directing and overseeing day-to-day management of 
Citi. The Executive Management Team is led by the Citigroup 
CEO and provides oversight of group activities, both directly 
and through authority delegated to committees it has 
established to oversee the management of risk, to ensure 
continued alignment with Citi’s strategy and risk appetite.

Board and Executive Management Committees
The Board executes its responsibilities either directly or 
through its committees. The Board has delegated authorities to 
the following Board standing committees to help fulfill its 
oversight and risk management responsibilities:

•

•

•

Risk Management Committee (RMC): assists the Board in 
fulfilling its responsibility with respect to (i) oversight of 
Citi’s risk management framework, including the 
significant policies and practices used in managing credit, 
market, liquidity, strategic, operational, compliance, 
reputation and certain other risks, including those 
pertaining to capital management, and (ii) performance 
oversight of the Global Risk Review—credit, capital and 
collateral review functions.
Audit Committee: provides oversight of Citi’s financial 
reporting and internal control risk, as well as Internal 
Audit and Citi’s external independent accountants.
Personnel and Compensation Committee: provides 
oversight of incentive compensation plans and risk related 
to compensation.

68

The figure below illustrates the reporting lines between the Board and Executive Management committees:

idiosyncratic framework consisting of single name 
concentrations for each business and across Citigroup and a 
specialized framework consisting of product limits.

Credit exposures are generally reported in notional terms 

for accrual loans, reflecting the value at which the loans as 
well as other off-balance sheet commitments are carried on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Credit exposure arising from 
capital markets activities is generally expressed as the current 
mark-to-market, net of margin, reflecting the net value owed 
to Citi by a given counterparty. 

The credit risk associated with these credit exposures is a 

function of the idiosyncratic creditworthiness of the obligor, as 
well as the terms and conditions of the specific obligation. Citi 
assesses the credit risk associated with its credit exposures on 
a regular basis through its Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) 
process (see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant 
Estimates—Allowance for Credit Losses” below and Notes 1 
and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), as well as 
through regular stress testing at the company, business, 
geography and product levels. These stress-testing processes 
typically estimate potential incremental credit costs that would 
occur as a result of either downgrades in the credit quality or 
defaults of the obligors or counterparties. For additional 
information on Citi’s credit risk management, see Note 14 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

CREDIT RISK

Overview
Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the decline in 
credit quality of a client, customer or counterparty (or 
downgrade risk) or the failure of a borrower, counterparty, 
third party or issuer to honor its financial or contractual 
obligations. Credit risk arises in many of Citigroup’s business 
activities, including:

•
•
•
•

consumer, commercial and corporate lending; 
capital markets derivative transactions; 
structured finance; and 
securities financing transactions (repurchase and reverse 
repurchase agreements, and securities loaned and 
borrowed).

Credit risk also arises from clearing and settlement 
activities, when Citi transfers an asset in advance of receiving 
its counter-value or advances funds to settle a transaction on 
behalf of a client. Concentration risk, within credit risk, is the 
risk associated with having credit exposure concentrated 
within a specific client, industry, region or other category.

Credit risk is one of the most significant risks Citi faces as 
an institution. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—
Credit Risk” above. As a result, Citi has an established 
framework in place for managing credit risk across all 
businesses that includes a defined risk appetite, credit limits 
and credit policies. Citi’s credit risk management also includes 
processes and policies with respect to problem recognition, 
including “watch lists,” portfolio reviews, stress tests, updated 
risk ratings and classification triggers. 

With respect to Citi’s clearing and settlement activities, 

intraday client usage of clearing lines is monitored against 
limits, as well as against usage patterns with settlement 
activity monitored daily and intraday for select products. To 
the extent that a problem develops, Citi typically moves the 
client to a secured (collateralized) operating model. Generally, 
Citi’s intraday clearing and settlement lines are uncommitted 
and cancelable at any time.

To manage concentration of risk within credit risk, Citi 

has in place a framework consisting of industry limits, an

CONSUMER CREDIT
Citi fulfills a broad spectrum of customers’ financial needs 
with activities spanning retail banking, wealth management, 
credit card, personal loan, mortgage and small business 
banking through North America GCB. During 2021, Citi also 
provided such activities in 18 countries in Latin America GCB 
and Asia GCB (for information on Citi’s consumer market 
exits in Latin America GCB and Asia GCB, see “Strategic 
Refresh—Market Exits and Planned Revision to Reporting 
Structure” above). The retail banking products include 
consumer mortgages, home equity, personal and small 
business loans and lines of credit and similar related products 
building a generally prime portfolio through well-defined 
lending parameters. Citi uses its risk appetite framework to 
define its lending parameters.

Overall Consumer Credit Trends

Global Consumer Banking

As shown in the chart above, GCB’s net credit loss rate 

decreased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year for the 
fourth quarter of 2021, primarily reflecting the continued 
impact of government stimulus, unemployment benefits and 
consumer relief programs in North America GCB, and a 
decline following the peak charge-offs in Asia GCB and Latin 
America GCB in recent quarters. 

GCB’s 90+ days past due delinquency rate remained 

unchanged quarter-over-quarter. The 90+days past due 
delinquency rate decreased year-over-year, primarily due to 
the continued impacts of government stimulus, unemployment 
benefits and consumer relief programs in North America GCB, 
as well as lower delinquencies in Asia GCB and Latin America 
GCB, following the charge-off of peak delinquencies in recent 
quarters.

North America GCB

North America GCB provides mortgage, home equity, 
small business and personal loans through Citi’s retail banking 
network and card products through branded cards and retail 
services businesses. The retail bank is concentrated in six 
major metropolitan cities in the U.S. (for additional 
information on the U.S. retail bank, see “North America GCB” 
above).

As of December 31, 2021, approximately 74% of North 

America GCB consumer loans consisted of branded and retail 
services cards, which generally drives the overall credit 
performance of North America GCB (for additional 
information on North America GCB’s cards portfolios, 
including delinquency and net credit loss rates, see “Credit 
Card Trends” below).

71

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 
North America GCB for the fourth quarter of 2021 decreased 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily reflecting 
the continued impact of high payment rates in cards, driven by 
government stimulus. 

Year-over-year, the payment rates were also impacted by 

unemployment benefits and consumer relief programs.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate in North America 

GCB increased modestly quarter-over-quarter, primarily due 
to seasonality in cards, while the 90+ days past due 
delinquency rate decreased year-over-year, primarily 
reflecting the continued impact of high payment rates in cards, 
driven by government stimulus.

Latin America GCB

Latin America GCB operates in Mexico through 

Citibanamex and provides credit cards, consumer mortgages 
and small business and personal loans. Latin America GCB 
serves a more mass-market segment in Mexico and focuses on 
developing multiproduct relationships with customers.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 

Latin America GCB for the fourth quarter of 2021 decreased 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. The impact of 
charge-offs of delinquent loans in prior quarters resulted in 
lower delinquencies that led to lower net credit losses in the 
current quarter. 

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. The impact of 
charge-offs of delinquent loans in prior quarters and higher 
payment rates resulted in a lower 90+ days past due 
delinquency rate in the current quarter.

Asia(1) GCB 

(1)  Asia includes GCB activities in certain EMEA countries for all periods 

presented.

North America GCB’s branded cards portfolio includes 

proprietary and co-branded cards. 

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 
North America branded cards for the fourth quarter of 2021 
decreased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily 
reflecting the continued impact of high payment rates, driven 
by government stimulus. Year-over-year, the payment rates 
were also impacted by unemployment benefits and consumer 
relief programs.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate remained 

unchanged quarter-over-quarter and decreased year-over-year, 
primarily reflecting the continued impact of high payment 
rates, driven by government stimulus. Year-over-year, the 
payment rates were also impacted by unemployment benefits 
and consumer relief programs.

North America Retail Services

Retail services partners directly with more than 20 
retailers and dealers to offer private label and co-branded 
cards. Retail services’ target market focuses on select industry 
segments such as home improvement, specialty retail, 
consumer electronics and fuel.

Retail services continually evaluates opportunities to add 

partners within target industries that have strong loyalty, 
lending or payment programs and growth potential.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 
retail services for the fourth quarter of 2021 decreased quarter-
over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily reflecting the 
continued impact of high payment rates, driven by government 
stimulus. Year-over-year, the payment rates were also 
impacted by unemployment benefits and consumer relief 
programs.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-
over-quarter due to seasonality, and decreased year-over-year, 
primarily reflecting the continued impact of high payment 
rates, driven by government stimulus. Year-over-year, the 
payment rates were also impacted by unemployment benefits 
and consumer relief programs.

During 2021, Asia GCB operated in 17 countries and 
jurisdictions in Asia and EMEA and provided credit cards, 
consumer mortgages and small business and personal loans.
As shown in the chart above, the fourth quarter of 2021 

net credit loss rate in Asia GCB decreased quarter-over-
quarter, driven by the charge-off of peak delinquencies in 
recent quarters. Year-over-year, the net credit loss rate 
decreased, as elevated losses during the prior year returned to 
pre-pandemic levels. The decrease was also driven by the 
reclassification of approximately $10 billion of loans to held-
for-sale as a result of Citi’s entry into agreements to sell its 
consumer banking businesses in Australia and the Philippines 
(Asia HFS reclass).

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased 

quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, driven by the charge-
off of peak delinquencies in recent quarters, as elevated losses 
returned to pre-pandemic levels, as well as the impact of the 
Asia HFS reclass.

The performance of Asia GCB’s portfolios continues to 
reflect the strong credit profiles in the region’s target customer 
segments. Regulatory changes in many markets in Asia over 
the past few years have also resulted in improved credit 
quality.

For additional information on cost of credit, loan 
delinquency and other information for Citi’s consumer loan 
portfolios, see each respective business’s results of operations

(1) The FICO bands in the tables are consistent with general industry peer 

presentations. 

The FICO distribution of both cards portfolios remained 

largely stable compared to the prior quarter and improved 
compared to the prior year, demonstrating strong underlying 
credit quality and a benefit from the impacts of government 
stimulus, unemployment benefits and customer relief 
programs, as well as lower credit utilization. For additional 
information on FICO scores, see Note 14 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.

(1) Asia includes loans and leases in certain EMEA countries for all periods 

presented.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 
Asia branded cards for the fourth quarter of 2021 decreased 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, driven by the charge-
off of peak delinquencies in recent quarters, as elevated losses 
returned to pre-pandemic levels, as well as the impact of the 
Asia HFS reclass.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased 

quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, driven by the charge-
off of peak delinquencies in recent quarters, as elevated losses  
returned to pre-pandemic levels, as well as the Asia HFS 
reclass.

For additional information on cost of credit, delinquency 

and other information for Citi’s cards portfolios, see each 
respective business’s results of operations above and Note 14 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(1) End-of-period (EOP) loans include interest and fees on credit cards.
(2) The ratios of 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due are calculated based on EOP loans, net of unearned income.
(3) The 90+ days past due balances for North America—branded and North America—retail services are generally still accruing interest. Citigroup’s policy is 

generally to accrue interest on credit card loans until 180 days past due, unless notification of bankruptcy filing has been received earlier.

(4) The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios for North America GCB exclude loans guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies since 

the potential loss predominantly resides with the U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) were 
$185 million ($1.1 billion), $171 million ($0.7 billion) and $135 million ($0.5 billion) at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The amounts excluded 
for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans) were $74 million, $98 million 
and $72 million at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

(5) Asia includes delinquencies and loans in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.
(6) During 2021, Citi’s Australia and the Philippines consumer banking businesses were reclassified as HFS, due to Citi’s entry into agreements to sell the businesses. 
Accordingly, Australia and the Philippines consumer loans are recorded in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and hence the loans and related 
delinquencies and ratios are not included in this table. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

(7) The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are primarily related to U.S. mortgages guaranteed by U.S. 
government-sponsored agencies since the potential loss predominantly resides with the U.S. agencies. The amounts excluded for 90+ days past due EOP loans 
were $138 million ($0.4 billion), $183 million ($0.5 billion) and $172 million ($0.4 billion) at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The amounts 
excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans) were $35 million, 
$73 million and $55 million at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

(4) As a result of Citi’s entry into agreements to sell its consumer banking businesses in Australia and the Philippines during 2021, these businesses were reclassified 
as HFS beginning in 2021. As a result of HFS accounting treatment, approximately $6 million of net credit losses (NCLs) was recorded as a reduction in revenue 
(Other revenue) in 2021. Accordingly, these NCLs are not included in this table, as well as Loans HFS that are recorded in Other assets on the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

CORPORATE CREDIT
Consistent with its overall strategy, Citi’s corporate clients are 
typically corporations that value the depth and breadth of 
Citi’s global network. Citi aims to establish relationships with 
these clients that, consistent with client needs, encompass 
multiple products, including cash management and trade 
services, foreign exchange, lending, capital markets and M&A 
advisory. During 2021, Citi’s corporate credit exposures also 
included exposures in the private bank, excluding certain loans 
managed on a delinquency basis. For information on Citi’s 
planned revision to its reporting structure effective for the first 
quarter of 2022, including the reporting of the private bank as 
part of a new reporting segment, Personal Banking and 
Wealth Management, see “Strategic Refresh—Market Exits 
and Planned Revision to Reporting Structure” above.

Corporate Credit Portfolio
The following table details Citi’s corporate credit portfolio 
within ICG (excluding certain loans in the private bank, which 
are managed on a delinquency basis, as well as loans carried at 
fair value and held-for-sale), and before consideration of 
collateral or hedges, by remaining tenor for the periods

The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings 
across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison 
of credit exposure across all lines of business, geographic 
regions and products. Counterparty risk ratings reflect an 
estimated probability of default for a counterparty and are 
derived by leveraging validated statistical models, scorecard 
models and external agency ratings (under defined 
circumstances), in combination with consideration of factors 
specific to the obligor or market, such as management 
experience, competitive position, regulatory environment and 
commodity prices. Facility risk ratings are assigned that reflect 
the probability of default of the obligor and factors that affect 
the loss given default of the facility, such as support or 
collateral. Internal obligor ratings that generally correspond to 
BBB and above are considered investment grade, while those 
below are considered non-investment grade.

Note: Total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending 
commitments. 

In addition to the obligor and facility risk ratings assigned 

to all exposures, Citi may classify exposures in the corporate 
credit portfolio. These classifications are consistent with Citi’s 
interpretation of the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of 
criticized exposures, which may categorize exposures as 
special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss.

Risk ratings and classifications are reviewed regularly, 

and adjusted as appropriate. The credit review process 
incorporates quantitative and qualitative factors, including 
financial and non-financial disclosures or metrics, 
idiosyncratic events or changes to the competitive, regulatory 
or macroeconomic environment. This includes but is not 
limited to exposures in those sectors significantly impacted by 
the pandemic (including consumer retail, commercial real 
estate and transportation). 

Citi believes the corporate credit portfolio to be 

appropriately rated and classified as of December 31, 2021. 
Since the onset of the pandemic, Citi has taken action to adjust 
internal ratings and classifications of exposures as both the 
macroeconomic environment and obligor-specific factors have 
changed, particularly where additional stress has been seen. 

As obligor risk ratings are downgraded, the probability of 

default increases. Downgrades of obligor risk ratings tend to 
result in a higher provision for credit losses. In addition, 
downgrades may result in the purchase of additional credit 
derivatives or other risk mitigants to hedge the incremental 
credit risk, or may result in Citi’s seeking to reduce exposure 
to an obligor or an industry sector. Citi will continue to review 
exposures to ensure that the appropriate probability of default 
is incorporated into all risk assessments.

For additional information on Citi’s corporate credit 

portfolio, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.

Exposure to Commercial Real Estate
As of December 31, 2021, ICG’s total corporate credit 
exposure to commercial real estate (CRE) was $66 billion, 
with $44 billion consisting of direct outstanding funded loans 
(mainly included in the real estate and private bank categories 
in the above table), or 7% of Citi’s total outstanding loans. In 
addition, as of December 31, 2021, more than 70% of ICG’s 
total corporate CRE exposure was to borrowers in the U.S. 
Also as of December 31, 2021, approximately 77% of ICG’s 
total corporate CRE exposure was rated investment grade.

As of December 31, 2021, the ACLL was 0.9% of funded 

CRE exposure, including 2.4% of funded non-investment-
grade exposure.

Of the total CRE exposure:

•

•

•

•

$20 billion ($12 billion of direct outstanding funded 
loans) relates to Community Reinvestment Act-related 
lending provided pursuant to Citi’s regulatory 
requirements to meet the credit needs of borrowers in low 
and moderate income neighborhoods.
$20 billion ($16 billion of direct outstanding funded 
loans) relates to exposure secured by mortgages on 
underlying properties or in well-rated securitization 
exposures.
$15 billion ($5 billion of direct outstanding funded loans) 
relates to unsecured loans to large REITs, with nearly 
74% of the exposure rated investment grade.
$11 billion ($11 billion of direct outstanding funded 
loans) relates to CRE exposure in the private bank, of 
which 100% is secured by mortgages. In addition, 48% of 
the exposure is also full recourse to the client. As of 
December 31, 2021, 82% of the exposure was rated 
investment grade.

Credit Risk Mitigation
As part of its overall risk management activities, Citi uses 
credit derivatives and other risk mitigants to hedge portions of 
the credit risk in its corporate credit portfolio, in addition to 
outright asset sales. Citi may enter into partial-term hedges as 
well as full-term hedges. In advance of the expiration of 
partial-term hedges, Citi will determine, among other factors, 
the economic feasibility of hedging the remaining life of the 
instrument. The results of the mark-to-market and any realized 
gains or losses on credit derivatives are reflected primarily in 
Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of 
Income.

At December 31, 2021, September 30, 2021 and 

December 31, 2020, ICG (excluding the delinquency-managed 
private bank portfolio) had economic hedges on the corporate 
credit portfolio of $39.6 billion, $38.1 billion and 
$38.8 billion, respectively. Citi’s expected credit loss model 
used in the calculation of its ACL does not include the 
favorable impact of credit derivatives and other mitigants that 
are marked to market. In addition, the reported amounts of 
direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments in the 
tables above do not reflect the impact of these hedging 
transactions. The credit protection was economically hedging 
underlying ICG (excluding the delinquency-managed private 
bank portfolio) corporate credit portfolio exposures with the 
following risk rating distribution:

(1) North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Mexico is included in offices outside North America. The classification of corporate loans between 

offices in North America and outside North America is based on the domicile of the booking unit. The difference between the domicile of the booking unit and the 
domicile of the managing unit is not material.

(2) Loans secured primarily by real estate.
(3) Consumer loans are net of unearned income of $659 million, $749 million, $783 million, $742 million and $768 million at December 31, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018 

and 2017, respectively. Unearned income on consumer loans primarily represents unamortized origination fees and costs, premiums and discounts. 

(4) Corporate loans include private bank loans and are net of unearned income of $(799) million, $(844) million, $(814) million, $(855) million and $(794) million at 
December 31, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Unearned income on corporate loans primarily represents interest received in advance, but not yet 
earned, on loans originated on a discounted basis.

(5) Because loans carried at fair value do not have an ACLL, they are excluded from the ACLL ratio calculation.

(1) On January 1, 2020, Citi adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 326, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (CECL). The ASC introduces a new credit 
loss methodology requiring earlier recognition of credit losses while also providing additional disclosure about credit risk. On January 1, 2020, Citi recorded a 
$4.1 billion, or an approximate 29%, pretax increase in the Allowance for credit losses, along with a $3.1 billion after-tax decrease in Retained earnings and a 
deferred tax asset increase of $1.0 billion. This transition impact reflects (i) a $4.9 billion build to the consumer ACL due to longer estimated tenors than under the 
incurred loss methodology under prior U.S. GAAP, net of recoveries; and (ii) a $0.8 billion decrease to the corporate ACL due to shorter remaining tenors, 
incorporation of recoveries and use of more specific historical loss data based on an increase in portfolio segmentation across industries and geographies. See Note 
1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the impact of Citi’s adoption of CECL.

(2) Citi had a change in accounting related to its variable post-charge-off third-party collection costs that was recorded as an adjustment to its January 1, 2020 opening 

(3)

allowance for credit losses on loans of $443 million. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Includes all adjustments to the allowance for credit losses, such as changes in the allowance from acquisitions, dispositions, securitizations, FX translation, 
purchase accounting adjustments, etc.
2021 includes an approximate $280 million reclass related to Citi’s agreement to sell its consumer banking business in Australia and an approximate $90 million 
reclass related to Citi’s agreement to sell its consumer banking business in the Philippines. Those ACLL were reclassified to Other assets during 2021. 2021 also 
includes a decrease of approximately $134 million related to FX translation.
2020 includes reductions of approximately $4 million related to the transfer to HFS of various real estate loan portfolios. In addition, 2020 includes an increase of 
approximately $97 million related to FX translation.
2019 includes reductions of approximately $42 million related to the sale or transfer to HFS of various loan portfolios. In addition, 2019 includes a reduction of 
approximately $60 million related to FX translation.
2018 includes reductions of approximately $201 million related to the sale or transfer to HFS of various loan portfolios, which include approximately $106 million 
related to the transfer of various real estate loan portfolios to HFS. In addition, 2017 includes an increase of approximately $115 million related to FX translation.
2017 includes reductions of approximately $261 million related to the sale or transfer to HFS of various loan portfolios, which include approximately $106 million 
related to the transfer of various real estate loan portfolios to HFS. In addition, 2017 includes an increase of approximately $115 million related to FX translation.

(9) December 31, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017 exclude $6.1 billion, $6.9 billion, $4.1 billion, $3.2 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, of loans which are 

carried at fair value.

(10) 2020 corporate ACLUC includes a non-provision transfer of $68 million, representing reserves on performance guarantees. The reserves on these contracts were 

reclassified out of the ACL on unfunded lending commitments and into other liabilities.

(11) Represents additional credit reserves recorded as Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
(12) Beginning in 2020, under CECL, the ACLL represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio and troubled debt restructurings. See 
“Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements below. Attribution of the ACLL is made for 
analytical purposes only and the entire ACLL is available to absorb credit losses in the overall portfolio. Prior to 2020, the ACLL represented management’s 
estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio, as well as probable losses related to large individually evaluated impaired loans and TDRs. See “Superseded 
Accounting Principles” in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets and Renegotiated Loans
There is a certain amount of overlap among non-accrual loans 
and assets and renegotiated loans. The following summary 
provides a general description of each category.

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets:

•

•

•

•

•

Corporate and consumer (including commercial banking) 
non-accrual status is based on the determination that 
payment of interest or principal is doubtful.
A corporate loan may be classified as non-accrual and still 
be performing under the terms of the loan structure. Non-
accrual loans may still be current on interest payments. 
Citi’s corporate non-accrual loans were $1.9 billion, $2.4 
billion and $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2021, 
September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 
Of these, approximately 54%, 56% and 59% were 
performing at December 31, 2021, September 30, 2021 
and December 31, 2020, respectively.
Consumer non-accrual status is generally based on aging, 
i.e., the borrower has fallen behind on payments.
Consumer mortgage loans, other than Federal Housing 
Administration (FHA) insured loans, are classified as 
non-accrual within 60 days of notification that the 
borrower has filed for bankruptcy. In addition, home 
equity loans are classified as non-accrual if the related 
residential first mortgage loan is 90 days or more past 
due.
North America branded cards and retail services are not 
included because, under industry standards, credit card 
loans accrue interest until such loans are charged off, 
which typically occurs at 180 days of contractual 
delinquency.

Renegotiated Loans:

•

•

Includes both corporate and consumer loans whose terms 
have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring 
(TDR).
Includes both accrual and non-accrual TDRs.

88

Non-Accrual Loans
The table below summarizes Citigroup’s non-accrual loans as 
of the periods indicated. Non-accrual loans may still be current 
on interest payments. In situations where Citi reasonably 
expects that only a portion of the principal owed will 
ultimately be collected, all payments received are reflected as 
a reduction of principal and not as interest income. For all 
other non-accrual loans, cash interest receipts are generally 
recorded as revenue.

In addition to modifications reflected as TDRs at December 31, 2021 
and 2020, Citi also modified none and $47 million, respectively, of 
commercial loans risk rated “Substandard Non-Performing” or worse 
(asset category defined by banking regulators) in offices outside the U.S. 
These modifications were not considered TDRs because the 
modifications did not involve a concession or because the modifications

LIQUIDITY RISK

Overview
Adequate and diverse sources of funding and liquidity are 
essential to Citi’s businesses. Funding and liquidity risks arise 
from several factors, many of which are mostly or entirely 
outside Citi’s control, such as disruptions in the financial 
markets, changes in key funding sources, credit spreads, 
changes in Citi’s credit ratings and macroeconomic, 
geopolitical and other conditions. For additional information, 
see “Risk Factors—Liquidity Risks” above.

Citi’s funding and liquidity management objectives are 

aimed at (i) funding its existing asset base, (ii) growing its 
core businesses, (iii) maintaining sufficient liquidity, 
structured appropriately, so that Citi can operate under a 
variety of adverse circumstances, including potential 
Company-specific and/or market liquidity events in varying 
durations and severity, and (iv) satisfying regulatory 
requirements, including, among other things, those related to 
resolution planning (for additional information, see 
“Resolution Plan” and “Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity 
(TLAC)” below). Citigroup’s primary liquidity objectives are 
established by entity, and in aggregate, across two major 
categories:

•

•

Citibank (including Citibank Europe plc, Citibank 
Singapore Ltd. and Citibank (Hong Kong) Ltd.); and
Citi’s non-bank and other entities, including the parent 
holding company (Citigroup Inc.), Citi’s primary 
intermediate holding company (Citicorp LLC), Citi’s 
broker-dealer subsidiaries (including Citigroup Global 
Markets Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Limited. and 
Citigroup Global Markets Japan Inc.) and other bank and 
non-bank subsidiaries that are consolidated into Citigroup 
(including Citibanamex).

At an aggregate Citigroup level, Citi’s goal is to maintain 
sufficient funding in amount and tenor to fully fund customer 
assets and to provide an appropriate amount of cash and high-
quality liquid assets (as discussed below), even in times of 
stress, in order to meet its payment obligations as they come 
due. The liquidity risk management framework provides that 
in addition to the aggregate requirements, certain entities be 
self-sufficient or net providers of liquidity, including in 
conditions established under their designated stress tests.

Citi’s primary funding sources include (i) corporate and 

consumer deposits via Citi’s bank subsidiaries, including 
Citibank, N.A. (Citibank), (ii) long-term debt (primarily senior 
and subordinated debt) mainly issued by Citigroup Inc., as the 
parent, and Citibank, and (iii) stockholders’ equity. These 
sources may be supplemented by short-term borrowings, 
primarily in the form of secured funding transactions.
As referenced above, Citi’s funding and liquidity 

framework ensures that the tenor of these funding sources is of 
sufficient term in relation to the tenor of its asset base. The 
goal of Citi’s asset/liability management is to ensure that there 
is sufficient liquidity and tenor in the liability structure relative 
to the liquidity profile of the assets. This reduces the risk that 
liabilities will become due before assets mature or are 

92

monetized. This excess liquidity is held primarily in the form 
of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA), as set forth in the table 
below. 

Citi’s liquidity is managed via a centralized treasury 

model by Treasury, in conjunction with regional and in-
country treasurers with oversight provided by Independent 
Risk Management and various Asset & Liability Committees 
(ALCOs) at the Citigroup, region, country and business levels. 
Pursuant to this approach, Citi’s HQLA is managed with 
emphasis on asset-liability management and entity-level 
liquidity adequacy throughout Citi.

Citi’s CRO and Chief Financial Officer co-chair 

Citigroup’s ALCO, which includes Citi’s Treasurer and other 
senior executives. The ALCO sets the strategy of the liquidity 
portfolio and monitors portfolio performance (for additional 
information about the ALCO, see “Risk Governance—Board 
and Executive Management Committees” above). Significant 
changes to portfolio asset allocations are approved by the 
ALCO. Citi also has other ALCOs, which are established at 
various organizational levels to ensure appropriate oversight 
for countries, franchise businesses and regions, serving as the 
primary governance committees for managing Citi’s balance 
sheet and liquidity.

As a supplement to ALCO, Citi’s Funding and Liquidity 

Risk Committee (FLRC) is a more focused assembly for 
funding and liquidity risk matters. The FLRC reviews and 
discusses the funding and liquidity risk profile of, as well as 
risk management practices for Citigroup and Citibank and 
reports its findings and recommendations to each relevant 
ALCO as appropriate.

Liquidity Monitoring and Measurement

Stress Testing 
Liquidity stress testing is performed for each of Citi’s major 
entities, operating subsidiaries and/or countries. Stress testing 
and scenario analyses are intended to quantify the potential 
impact of an adverse liquidity event on the balance sheet and 
liquidity position, and to identify viable funding alternatives 
that can be utilized. These scenarios include assumptions 
about significant changes in key funding sources, market 
triggers (such as credit ratings), potential uses of funding and 
macroeconomic, geopolitical and other conditions. These 
conditions include expected and stressed market conditions as 
well as Company-specific events.

Liquidity stress tests are performed to ascertain potential 
mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety 
of time horizons and over different stressed conditions. To 
monitor the liquidity of an entity, these stress tests and 
potential mismatches are calculated with varying frequencies, 
with several tests performed daily.

Given the range of potential stresses, Citi maintains 

contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for 
individual entities. These plans specify a wide range of readily 
available actions for a variety of adverse market conditions or 
idiosyncratic stresses.

the calculation of Citigroup’s consolidated Liquidity Coverage 
ratio (LCR), pursuant to the U.S. LCR rules. These amounts 
include the HQLA needed to meet the minimum requirements 
at these entities and any amounts in excess of these minimums 
that are assumed to be transferable to other entities within 
Citigroup. Citigroup’s HQLA increased quarter-over-quarter 
as of the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily reflecting an 
increase in deposits. 

As of December 31, 2021, Citigroup had $961 billion of 

available liquidity resources to support client and business 
needs, including end-of-period HQLA assets; additional 
unencumbered securities, including excess liquidity held at 
bank entities that is non-transferable to other entities within 
Citigroup; and available assets not already accounted for 
within Citi’s HQLA to support Federal Home Loan Bank 
(FHLB) and Federal Reserve Bank discount window 
borrowing capacity.

Short-Term Liquidity Measurement: Liquidity Coverage 
Ratio (LCR)
In addition to internal 30-day liquidity stress testing performed 
for Citi’s major entities, operating subsidiaries and countries, 
Citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the LCR.

The  LCR  is  calculated  by  dividing  HQLA  by  estimated 
net  outflows  assuming  a  stressed  30-day  period,  with  the  net 
outflows determined by standardized stress outflow and inflow 
rates  prescribed  in  the  LCR  rule.  The  outflows  are  partially 
offset  by  contractual  inflows  from  assets  maturing  within  30 
days. Similar to outflows, the inflows are calculated based on 
prescribed  factors  to  various  assets  categories,  such  as  retail 
loans as well as unsecured and secured wholesale lending. The 
minimum LCR requirement is 100%.

 The table below details the components of Citi’s LCR 

calculation and HQLA in excess of net outflows for the 
periods indicated:

Long-Term Liquidity Measurement: Net Stable Funding 
Ratio (NSFR)
As previously disclosed, in October 2020, the U.S. banking 
agencies adopted a final rule to assess the availability of a 
bank’s stable funding against a required level. 

In general, a bank’s available stable funding includes 
portions of equity, deposits and long-term debt, while its 
required stable funding will be based on the liquidity 
characteristics of its assets, derivatives and commitments. 
Standardized weightings are required to be applied to the 
various asset and liabilities classes. The ratio of available 
stable funding to required stable funding is required to be 
greater than 100%. 

The final rule became effective beginning July 1, 2021, 
while public disclosure requirements to report the ratio will 
occur on a semiannual basis beginning June 30, 2023. Citi was 
in compliance with the final rule as of December 31, 2021.

Loans
As part of its funding and liquidity objectives, Citi seeks to 
fund its existing asset base appropriately as well as maintain 
sufficient liquidity to grow its GCB and ICG businesses, 
including its loan portfolio. Citi maintains a diversified 
portfolio of loans to its consumer and institutional clients. The 
table below details the average loans, by business and/or 
segment, and the total end-of-period loans for each of the

quarter-over-quarter. 

On an average basis, loans were largely unchanged both 
year-over-year and sequentially. Excluding the impact of FX 
translation, average loans increased 1% year-over-year and 
were largely unchanged sequentially. On this basis, average 
GCB loans declined 4% year-over-year, primarily reflecting 
the reclassification of loans to held-for-sale as a result of Citi’s

entry into agreements to sell its consumer banking businesses 
in Australia and the Philippines.

Excluding the impact of FX translation, average ICG 
loans increased 5% year-over-year. Loans in corporate lending 
declined 12% on an average basis, reflecting net repayments 
as Citi continued to assist its clients in accessing the capital 
markets, as well as lower demand. Private bank loans 
increased 10%, largely driven by increased secured lending to 
high-net-worth clients. Markets and securities services loans 
increased 29%, reflecting an increase in securitization 
financing. TTS loans increased 15%, reflecting an increase in 
trade flows and originations. 

Average Corporate/Other loans continued to decline 

(down 46%), driven by the wind-down of legacy assets.

Long-Term Debt 
Long-term debt (generally defined as debt with original 
maturities of one year or more) represents the most significant 
component of Citi’s funding for the Citigroup parent company 
and Citi’s non-bank subsidiaries and is a supplementary source 
of funding for the bank entities. 

Long-term debt is an important funding source due in part 

to its multiyear contractual maturity structure. The weighted-
average maturity of unsecured long-term debt issued by 
Citigroup and its affiliates (including Citibank) with a 
remaining life greater than one year was approximately 
8.6 years as of December 31, 2021, unchanged from the prior 
quarter and the prior year. The weighted-average maturity is 
calculated based on the contractual maturity of each security. 
For securities that are redeemable prior to maturity at the 
option of the holder, the weighted-average maturity is 
calculated based on the earliest date an option becomes 
exercisable.

Citi’s long-term debt outstanding at the Citigroup parent 

company includes benchmark senior and subordinated debt 
and what Citi refers to as customer-related debt, consisting of 
structured notes, such as equity- and credit-linked notes, as 
well as non-structured notes. Citi’s issuance of customer-
related debt is generally driven by customer demand and 
complements benchmark debt issuance as a source of funding 
for Citi’s non-bank entities. Citi’s long-term debt at the bank 
includes Citibank benchmark senior debt, FHLB borrowings 
and securitizations.

Note: Amounts represent the current value of long-term debt on Citi’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet that, for certain debt instruments, includes 
consideration of fair value, hedging impacts and unamortized discounts and 
premiums.
(1) Non-bank includes long-term debt issued to third parties by the parent 

holding company (Citigroup) and Citi’s non-bank subsidiaries (including 
broker-dealer subsidiaries) that are consolidated into Citigroup. As of 
December 31, 2021, non-bank included $65.9 billion of long-term debt 
issued by Citi’s broker-dealer and other subsidiaries, as well as certain 
Citigroup consolidated hedging activities.

(2) Local country and other includes debt issued by Citi’s affiliates in 
support of their local operations. Within non-bank, certain secured 
financing is also included. Within bank, borrowings under certain U.S. 
government-sponsored liquidity programs are also included. 

(3) Predominantly credit card securitizations, primarily backed by branded 

credit card receivables.

As of the fourth quarter of 2021, Citi’s total long-term 
debt outstanding decreased year-over-year, primarily driven 
by declines in unsecured benchmark senior debt at the non-
bank entities and the bank, as well as securitizations and 
FHLB borrowings at the bank. The decrease in total long-term 
debt was partially offset by the issuance of customer-related 
debt at the non-bank entities. Sequentially, long-term debt 
outstanding decreased, driven primarily by decreases in 
unsecured benchmark senior debt at the non-bank entities and 
securitizations at the bank, partially offset by the issuance of 
customer-related debt at the non-bank entities.

As part of its liability management, Citi also has 
considered, and may continue to consider, opportunities to 
redeem or repurchase its long-term debt pursuant to open 
market purchases, tender offers or other means. Such 
redemptions and repurchases help reduce Citi’s overall 
funding costs. During 2021, Citi redeemed or repurchased an 
aggregate of approximately $33.8 billion of its outstanding 
long-term debt.

Citigroup executed an inter-affiliate agreement with 
Citicorp, Citigroup’s operating material legal entities 
and certain other affiliated entities pursuant to which 
Citicorp is required to provide liquidity and capital 
support to Citigroup’s operating material legal entities 
in the event Citigroup were to enter bankruptcy 
proceedings (Citi Support Agreement); 
pursuant to the Citi Support Agreement:

•

•

•

Citigroup made an initial contribution of assets, 
including certain high-quality liquid assets and 
inter-affiliate loans (Contributable Assets), to 
Citicorp, and Citicorp became the business-as-
usual funding vehicle for Citigroup’s operating 
material legal entities;
Citigroup will be obligated to continue to transfer 
Contributable Assets to Citicorp over time, subject 
to certain amounts retained by Citigroup to, among 
other things, meet Citigroup’s near-term cash 
needs; 
in the event of a Citigroup bankruptcy, Citigroup 
will be required to contribute most of its remaining 
assets to Citicorp; and

(iv)

the obligations of both Citigroup and Citicorp under the 
Citi Support Agreement, as well as the Contributable 
Assets, are secured pursuant to a security agreement.

The Citi Support Agreement provides two mechanisms, 
besides Citicorp’s issuing of dividends to Citigroup, pursuant 
to which Citicorp will be required to transfer cash to Citigroup 
during business as usual so that Citigroup can fund its debt 
service as well as other operating needs: (i) one or more 
funding notes issued by Citicorp to Citigroup and (ii) a 
committed line of credit under which Citicorp may make loans 
to Citigroup. 

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)
U.S. GSIBs are required to maintain minimum levels of TLAC 
and eligible LTD, each set by reference to the GSIB’s 
consolidated risk-weighted assets (RWA) and total leverage 
exposure. The intended purpose of the requirements is to 
facilitate the orderly resolution of U.S. GSIBs under the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act. For 
additional information, including Citi’s TLAC and LTD 
amounts and ratios, see “Capital Resources—Current 
Regulatory Capital Standards” and “Risk Factors—
Compliance Risks” above. 

Resolution Plan
Citi is required under Title I of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 
Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank 
Act) and the rules promulgated by the FDIC and Federal 
Reserve Board to periodically submit a plan for Citi’s rapid 
and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the 
event of material financial distress or failure. 

(ii)

On December 17, 2019, the Federal Reserve Board and 

(iii)

FDIC issued feedback on the resolution plans filed on July 1, 
2019 by the eight U.S. Global Systemically Important Banks, 
including Citigroup. The Federal Reserve Board and FDIC 
identified one shortcoming, but no deficiencies, in Citigroup's 
resolution plan relating to governance mechanisms. Based on 
regulatory changes effective December 31, 2019, Citigroup's 
2021 resolution plan submission, which was filed on July 1, 
2021 was a targeted resolution plan, only including a subset of 
the information of a full resolution plan and additional 
information, identified by the Federal Reserve Board and 
FDIC on July 1, 2020. Citigroup will alternate between 
submitting a full resolution plan and a targeted resolution plan 
on a biennial cycle. For additional information on Citi’s 
resolution plan submissions, see “Risk Factors—Strategic 
Risks” above. Citigroup’s preferred resolution strategy is 
“single point of entry” under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 

Under Citi’s preferred “single point of entry” resolution 

plan strategy, only Citigroup, the parent holding company, 
would enter into bankruptcy, while Citigroup’s material legal 
entities (as defined in the public section of its 2021 resolution 
plan, which can be found on the Federal Reserve Board’s and 
FDIC’s websites) would remain operational outside of any 
resolution or insolvency proceedings. Citigroup’s resolution 
plan has been designed to minimize the risk of systemic 
impact to the U.S. and global financial systems, while 
maximizing the value of the bankruptcy estate for the benefit 
of Citigroup’s creditors, including its unsecured long-term 
debt holders. 

In addition, in line with the Federal Reserve Board’s final 
total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) rule, Citigroup believes 
it has developed the resolution plan so that Citigroup’s 
shareholders and unsecured creditors—including its unsecured 
long-term debt holders—bear any losses resulting from 
Citigroup’s bankruptcy. Accordingly, any value realized by 
holders of its unsecured long-term debt may not be sufficient 
to repay the amounts owed to such debt holders in the event of 
a bankruptcy or other resolution proceeding of Citigroup.
The FDIC has also indicated that it was developing a 

single point of entry strategy to implement the Orderly 
Liquidation Authority under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act, 
which provides the FDIC with the ability to resolve a firm 
when it is determined that bankruptcy would have serious 
adverse effects on financial stability in the U.S.

As previously disclosed, in response to feedback received 
from the Federal Reserve Board and FDIC, Citigroup took the 
following actions:

(i)

Citicorp LLC (Citicorp), an existing wholly owned 
subsidiary of Citigroup, was established as an 
intermediate holding company (an IHC) for certain of 
Citigroup’s operating material legal entities;

SECURED FUNDING TRANSACTIONS AND SHORT-
TERM BORROWINGS
Citi supplements its primary sources of funding with short-
term financings that generally include (i) secured funding 
transactions consisting of securities loaned or sold under 
agreements to repurchase, i.e., repos, and (ii) to a lesser extent, 
short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper and 
borrowings from the FHLB and other market participants. 

Secured Funding Transactions
Secured funding is primarily accessed through Citi’s broker-
dealer subsidiaries to fund efficiently both (i) secured lending 
activity and (ii) a portion of the securities inventory held in the 
context of market-making and customer activities. Citi also 
executes a smaller portion of its secured funding transactions 
through its bank entities, which are typically collateralized by 
government debt securities. Generally, daily changes in the 
level of Citi’s secured funding are primarily due to 
fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book 
(as described below) and securities inventory. 

Secured funding of $191 billion as of December 31, 2021 
decreased 3% from the prior-year period and 9% sequentially. 
Excluding the impact of FX translation, secured funding 
decreased 1% from the prior-year period and 8% sequentially, 
driven by normal business activity. The average balance for 
secured funding was approximately $222 billion for the 
quarter ended December 31, 2021.

The portion of secured funding in the broker-dealer 
subsidiaries that funds secured lending is commonly referred 
to as “matched book” activity. The majority of this activity is 
secured by high-quality liquid securities such as U.S. Treasury 

securities, U.S. agency securities and foreign government debt 
securities. Other secured funding is secured by less liquid 
securities, including equity securities, corporate bonds and 
asset-backed securities, the tenor of which is generally equal 
to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding matched book 
assets.

The remainder of the secured funding activity in the 
broker-dealer subsidiaries serves to fund securities inventory 
held in the context of market-making and customer activities. 
To maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market 
conditions, including under periods of stress, Citi manages 
these activities by taking into consideration the quality of the 
underlying collateral and establishing minimum required 
funding tenors. The weighted average maturity of Citi’s 
secured funding of less liquid securities inventory was greater 
than 110 days as of December 31, 2021.

Citi manages the risks in its secured funding by 

conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in 
capacity, tenor, haircut, collateral profile and client actions. In 
addition, Citi maintains counterparty diversification by 
establishing concentration triggers and assessing counterparty 
reliability and stability under stress. Citi generally sources 
secured funding from more than 150 counterparties.

Short-Term Borrowings
Citi’s short-term borrowings of $28 billion as of the fourth 
quarter of 2021 decreased 5% year-over-year, reflecting a 
decline in FHLB advances, and 6% sequentially, primarily 
driven by a decline in structured notes (see Note 17 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on 
Citigroup’s and its affiliates’ outstanding short-term 
borrowings).

CREDIT RATINGS
Citigroup’s funding and liquidity, funding capacity, ability to 
access capital markets and other sources of funds, the cost of 
these funds and its ability to maintain certain deposits are 
partially dependent on its credit ratings. 

The table below shows the ratings for Citigroup and 
Citibank as of December 31, 2021. While not included in the 
table below, the long-term and short-term ratings of Citigroup 
Global Markets Holding Inc. (CGMHI) were BBB+/A-2 at 
S&P Global Ratings and A+/F1 at Fitch as of December 31, 
2021.

Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades
Ratings downgrades by Moody’s, Fitch or S&P Global 
Ratings could negatively impact Citigroup’s and/or Citibank’s 
funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity, 
including derivative triggers, which could take the form of 
cash obligations and collateral requirements.

The following information is provided for the purpose of 

analyzing the potential funding and liquidity impact to 
Citigroup and Citibank of a hypothetical simultaneous 
ratings downgrade across all three major rating agencies. This 
analysis is subject to certain estimates, estimation 
methodologies, judgments and uncertainties. Uncertainties 
include potential ratings limitations that certain entities may 
have with respect to permissible counterparties, as well as 
general subjective counterparty behavior. For example, certain 
corporate customers and markets counterparties could re-
evaluate their business relationships with Citi and limit 
transactions in certain contracts or market instruments with 
Citi. Changes in counterparty behavior could impact Citi’s 
funding and liquidity, as well as the results of operations of 
certain of its businesses. The actual impact to Citigroup or 
Citibank is unpredictable and may differ materially from the 
potential funding and liquidity impacts described below. For 
additional information on the impact of credit rating changes 
on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see “Risk Factors—
Liquidity Risks” above.

Citigroup Inc. and Citibank—Potential Derivative Triggers
As of December 31, 2021, Citi estimates that a hypothetical 
one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of 
Citigroup Inc. across all three major rating agencies could 
impact Citigroup’s funding and liquidity due to derivative 
triggers by approximately $0.8 billion, compared to $1.1 
billion as of September 30, 2021. Other funding sources, such 
as secured financing transactions and other margin 
requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could 
also be adversely affected.

As of December 31, 2021, Citi estimates that a 
hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-
term rating of Citibank across all three major rating agencies 
could impact Citibank’s funding and liquidity due to 
derivative triggers by approximately $0.6 billion, compared to 
$0.5 billion as of September 30, 2021. Other funding sources, 
such as secured financing transactions and other margin 
requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could 
also be adversely affected.

In total, as of December 31, 2021, Citi estimates that a 
one-notch downgrade of Citigroup and Citibank across all 
three major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate 
cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately 
$1.4 billion, compared to $1.6 billion as of September 30, 
2021 (see also Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements). As detailed under “High-Quality Liquid Assets” 
above, Citigroup has various liquidity resources available to 
its bank and non-bank entities in part as a contingency for the 
potential events described above.

In addition, a broad range of mitigating actions are 
currently included in Citigroup’s and Citibank’s contingency 
funding plans. For Citigroup, these mitigating factors include, 
but are not limited to, accessing surplus funding capacity from 
existing clients, tailoring levels of secured lending and 
adjusting the size of select trading books and collateralized 
borrowings at certain Citibank subsidiaries. Mitigating actions 
available to Citibank include, but are not limited to, selling or 
financing highly liquid government securities, tailoring levels 
of secured lending, adjusting the size of select trading assets, 
reducing loan originations and renewals, raising additional 
deposits or borrowing from the FHLB or central banks. Citi 
believes these mitigating actions could substantially reduce the 
funding and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades 
described above.

Citibank—Additional Potential Impacts
In addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a 
potential downgrade of Citibank’s senior debt/long-term rating 
across any of the three major rating agencies could also have 
an adverse impact on the commercial paper/short-term rating 
of Citibank. Citibank has provided liquidity commitments to 
consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits, 
primarily in the form of asset purchase agreements. As of 
December 31, 2021, Citibank had liquidity commitments of 
approximately $9.0 billion to consolidated asset-backed 
commercial paper conduits, compared to $10.0 billion as of 
September 30, 2021 (for additional information, see Note 21 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

In addition to the above-referenced liquidity resources of 

certain Citibank entities, Citibank could reduce the funding 
and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades 
described above through mitigating actions, including 
repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial 
paper conduits. In the event of the potential downgrades 
described above, Citi believes that certain corporate customers 
could re-evaluate their deposit relationships with Citibank. 
This re-evaluation could result in clients adjusting their 
discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository 
institution, which could potentially reduce certain deposit 
levels at Citibank. However, Citi could choose to adjust 
pricing, offer alternative deposit products to its existing 
customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers, in 
addition to the mitigating actions referenced above.

100

assumptions. The changes include, among other things, 
assumptions around the projected balance sheet (being more 
static), coupled with revisions to the treatment of certain 
business contributions to IRE, mainly accrual positions in 
ICG’s Markets businesses. These changes are planned for 
2022, and will result in a higher impact to Citi’s NII and AOCI 
and a better reflection of the nature of the portfolios. 

In order to manage changes in interest rates effectively, 

Citi may modify pricing on new customer loans and deposits, 
purchase fixed-rate securities, issue debt that is either fixed or 
floating or enter into derivative transactions that have the 
opposite risk exposures. Citi regularly assesses the viability of 
these and other strategies to reduce its interest rate risks and 
implements such strategies when it believes those actions are 
prudent. 

Citi manages interest rate risk as a consolidated 

Company-wide position. Citi’s client-facing businesses create 
interest rate-sensitive positions, including loans and deposits, 
as part of their ongoing activities. Citi Treasury aggregates 
these risk positions and manages them centrally. Operating 
within established limits, Citi Treasury makes positioning 
decisions and uses tools, such as Citi’s investment securities 
portfolio, company-issued debt and interest rate derivatives, to 
target the desired risk profile. Changes in Citi’s interest rate 
risk position reflect the accumulated changes in all non-trading 
assets and liabilities, with potentially large and offsetting 
impacts, as well as in Citi Treasury’s positioning decisions.
Citigroup employs additional measurements, including 
stress testing the impact of non-linear interest rate movements 
on the value of the balance sheet, and the analysis of portfolio 
duration and volatility, particularly as they relate to mortgage 
loans and mortgage-backed securities and the potential impact 
of the change in the spread between different market indices.

Interest Rate Risk of Investment Portfolios—Impact 
on AOCI
Citi also measures the potential impacts of changes in interest 
rates on the value of its AOCI, which can in turn impact Citi’s 
common equity and tangible common equity. This will impact 
Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 and other regulatory capital 
ratios. Citi’s goal is to benefit from an increase in the market 
level of interest rates, while limiting the impact of changes in 
AOCI on its regulatory capital position.

AOCI at risk is managed as part of the Company-wide 
interest rate risk position. AOCI at risk considers potential 
changes in AOCI (and the corresponding impact on the 
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio) relative to Citi’s capital 
generation capacity.

MARKET RISK

OVERVIEW
Market risk is the potential for losses arising from changes in 
the value of Citi’s assets and liabilities resulting from changes 
in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange 
rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as 
well as their implied volatilities. Market risk emanates from 
both Citi’s trading and non-trading portfolios. For additional 
information on market risk and market risk management, see 
“Risk Factors” above.

Each business is required to establish, with approval from 
Citi’s market risk management, a market risk limit framework 
for identified risk factors that clearly defines approved risk 
profiles and is within the parameters of Citi’s overall risk 
appetite. These limits are monitored by the Risk organization, 
including various regional, legal entity and business Risk 
Management committees, Citi’s country and business Asset & 
Liability Committees and the Citigroup Risk Management and 
Asset & Liability Committees. In all cases, the businesses are 
ultimately responsible for the market risks taken and for 
remaining within their defined limits.

MARKET RISK OF NON-TRADING PORTFOLIOS 
Market risk from non-trading portfolios stems from the 
potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign 
exchange rates on Citi’s net interest income, and on Citi’s 
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) from 
its debt securities portfolios. Market risk from non-trading 
portfolios also includes the potential impact of changes in 
foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital invested in foreign 
currencies. 

Net Interest Income at Risk
Net interest income, for interest rate exposure purposes, is the 
difference between the yield earned on the non-trading 
portfolio assets (including customer loans) and the rate paid on 
the liabilities (including customer deposits or company 
borrowings). Net interest income is affected by changes in the 
level of interest rates, as well as the amounts and mix of assets 
and liabilities, and the timing of contractual and assumed 
repricing of assets and liabilities to reflect market rates.

Citi’s principal measure of risk to net interest income is 

interest rate exposure (IRE). IRE measures the change in 
expected net interest income in each currency resulting solely 
from unanticipated changes in forward interest rates. 

Citi’s estimated IRE incorporates various assumptions 

including prepayment rates on loans, customer behavior and 
the impact of pricing decisions. For example, in rising interest 
rate scenarios, portions of the deposit portfolio may be 
assumed to experience rate increases that are less than the 
change in market interest rates. In declining interest rate 
scenarios, it is assumed that mortgage portfolios experience 
higher prepayment rates. Citi’s estimated IRE below assumes 
that its businesses and/or Citi Treasury make no additional 
changes in balances or positioning in response to the 
unanticipated rate changes.

Citi is planning to transition the sensitivity analysis for its 

IRE (see the current IRE sensitivity impacts below), 
employing enhanced methodologies and changes to certain

(1) Certain trading-oriented businesses within Citi have accrual-accounted positions that are excluded from the estimated impact to net interest income in the table, 
since these exposures are managed economically in combination with mark-to-market positions. The U.S. dollar interest rate exposure associated with these 
businesses was $(179) million for a 100 bps instantaneous increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2021.
Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.

(2)

The year-over-year increase in the estimated impact to net 

interest income primarily reflected changes in Citi’s balance 
sheet composition and Citi Treasury positioning. The year-
over-year changes in the estimated impact to AOCI and the 
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio primarily reflected the 
impact of the composition of Citi Treasury’s investment and 
derivatives portfolio.

In the event of a parallel instantaneous 100 bps increase in 

interest rates, Citi expects that the negative impact to AOCI 
would be offset in shareholders’ equity through the expected 
recovery of the impact on AOCI through accretion of Citi’s 
investment portfolio over a period of time. As of 
December 31, 2021, Citi expects that the $4.6 billion negative 

impact to AOCI in such a scenario could potentially be offset 
over approximately 27 months.

The following table sets forth the estimated impact to 
Citi’s net interest income, AOCI and the Common Equity 
Tier 1 Capital ratio (on a fully implemented basis) under five 
different changes in interest rate scenarios for the U.S. dollar 
and Citi’s other currencies. The 100 bps downward rate 
scenarios are impacted by the low level of interest rates in 
several countries and the assumption that market interest rates, 
as well as rates paid to depositors and charged to borrowers, 
do not fall below zero (i.e., the “flooring assumption”). The 
rate scenarios are also impacted by convexity related to 
mortgage products.

Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.

As shown in the table above, the magnitude of the impact 

to Citi’s net interest income and AOCI is greater under 
Scenario 2 as compared to Scenario 3. This is because the 
combination of changes to Citi’s investment portfolio, 
partially offset by changes related to Citi’s pension liabilities, 
results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at 
shorter- and intermediate-term maturities.

Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates—Impacts on AOCI 
and Capital
As of December 31, 2021, Citi estimates that an unanticipated 
parallel instantaneous 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar 
against all of the other currencies in which Citi has invested 
capital could reduce Citi’s tangible common equity (TCE) by 
approximately $1.5 billion, or 0.9%, as a result of changes to 
Citi’s FX translation adjustment in AOCI, net of hedges. This 
impact would be primarily due to changes in the value of the 
Mexican peso, Euro, Singapore dollar and Indian rupee.

This impact is also before any mitigating actions Citi may 

take, including ongoing management of its FX translation 
exposure. Specifically, as currency movements change the 
value of Citi’s net investments in foreign currency-
denominated capital, these movements also change the value 
of Citi’s risk-weighted assets denominated in those currencies. 
This, coupled with Citi’s foreign currency hedging strategies, 
such as foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency 
forwards and other currency hedging instruments, lessens the 
impact of foreign currency movements on Citi’s Common 
Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio. Changes in these hedging 
strategies, as well as hedging costs, divestitures and tax 
impacts, can further affect the actual impact of changes in 
foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital as compared to an 
unanticipated parallel shock, as described above.

In addition, the effect of Citi’s ongoing management 

strategies with respect to quarterly changes in foreign 
exchange rates, and the quarterly impact of these changes on 
Citi’s TCE and Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio, are 
shown in the table below. For additional information on the 
changes in AOCI, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.

Note: Revenue previously referred to as net interest revenue is now referred to as net interest income. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2021, Citi reclassified 
deposit insurance expenses (FDIC and other similar insurance assessments outside of the U.S.) from Interest expense to Other operating expenses for all periods 
presented. Amounts reclassified for each year were $1,207 million for 2021, $1,203 million for 2020 and $781 million for 2019. 
(1)

Interest revenue and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments related to the tax-exempt bond portfolio and certain tax-advantaged loan 
programs (based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%) of $192 million, $196 million and $208 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
Interest expense associated with certain hybrid financial instruments, which are classified as Long-term debt and accounted for at fair value, is reported together
with any changes in fair value as part of Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income and is therefore not reflected in Interest expense in the 
table above.

(2)

(3)  The average rate on interest revenue and net interest margin reflects the taxable equivalent gross-up adjustment. See footnote 1 above.
(4)  Citi’s net interest margin (NIM) is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets.

Interest revenue and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments discussed in the table above.

Citi’s net interest income (NII) in the fourth quarter of 
2021 was $10.8 billion ($10.9 billion on a taxable equivalent 
basis), largely unchanged versus the prior year, as a modest 
increase in non-ICG Markets NII (approximately $60 million) 
offset an equivalent decline in ICG Markets (fixed income 
markets and equity markets). Citi’s NIM was 1.98% on a 
taxable equivalent basis in the fourth quarter of 2021, a 
decrease of one basis point from the prior quarter, largely 
reflecting deposit growth. 

Citi’s NII for 2021 decreased 5%, or approximately $2.3 
billion, to $42.5 billion ($42.7 billion on a taxable equivalent 
basis) versus the prior year. The decrease was primarily 
related to a decline in non-ICG Markets NII, largely reflecting 
lower interest rates and lower loan balances. In 2021, Citi’s
NIM was 1.99% on a taxable equivalent basis, compared to 
2.22% in 2020, primarily driven by lower rates and a mix-shift 
in balances.

Market Risk of Trading Portfolios
Trading portfolios include positions resulting from market-
making activities, hedges of certain available-for-sale (AFS) 
debt securities, the CVA relating to derivative counterparties 
and all associated hedges, fair value option loans and hedges 
of the loan portfolio within capital markets origination within 
ICG.

The market risk of Citi’s trading portfolios is monitored 
using a combination of quantitative and qualitative measures, 
including, but not limited to:

•
•
•

factor sensitivities; 
value at risk (VAR); and 
stress testing.

Each trading portfolio across Citi’s businesses has its own 
market risk limit framework encompassing these measures and 
other controls, including trading mandates, new product 
approval, permitted product lists and pre-trade approval for 
larger, more complex and less liquid transactions.

The following chart of total daily trading-related revenue 
(loss) captures trading volatility and shows the number of days 
in which revenues for Citi’s trading businesses fell within 
particular ranges. Trading-related revenue includes trading, net 
interest and other revenue associated with Citi’s trading 
businesses. It excludes DVA, FVA and CVA adjustments 
incurred due to changes in the credit quality of counterparties, 
as well as any associated hedges of that CVA. In addition, it 
excludes fees and other revenue associated with capital 
markets origination activities. Trading-related revenues are 
driven by both customer flows and the changes in valuation of 
the trading inventory. As shown in the chart below, positive 
trading-related revenue was achieved for 95.8% of the trading 
days in 2021.

Daily Trading-Related Revenue (Loss)(1)—Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2021
In millions of dollars

(1)  Reflects the effects of asymmetrical accounting for economic hedges of certain AFS debt securities. Specifically, the change in the fair value of hedging 

derivatives is included in trading-related revenue, while the offsetting change in the fair value of hedged AFS debt securities is included in AOCI and not reflected 
above.

110

Factor Sensitivities
Factor sensitivities are expressed as the change in the value of 
a position for a defined change in a market risk factor, such as 
a change in the value of a U.S. Treasury Bond for a one-basis-
point change in interest rates. Citi’s Global Market Risk 
function, within the Independent Risk Management 
organization, works to ensure that factor sensitivities are 
calculated, monitored and limited for all material risks taken in 
the trading portfolios.

Value at Risk (VAR)
VAR estimates, at a 99% confidence level, the potential 
decline in the value of a position or a portfolio under normal 
market conditions assuming a one-day holding period. VAR 
statistics, which are based on historical data, can be materially 
different across firms due to differences in portfolio 
composition, differences in VAR methodologies and 
differences in model parameters. As a result, Citi believes 
VAR statistics can be used more effectively as indicators of 
trends in risk-taking within a firm, rather than as a basis for 
inferring differences in risk-taking across firms.

Citi uses a single, independently approved Monte Carlo 

simulation VAR model (see “VAR Model Review and 
Validation” below), which has been designed to capture 
material risk sensitivities (such as first- and second-order 
sensitivities of positions to changes in market prices) of 

various asset classes/risk types (such as interest rate, credit 
spread, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks). Citi’s 
VAR includes positions that are measured at fair value; it does 
not include investment securities classified as AFS or HTM. 
For information on these securities, see Note 13 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Citi believes its VAR model is conservatively calibrated 

to incorporate fat-tail scaling and the greater of short-term 
(approximately the most recent month) and long-term (three 
years) market volatility. The Monte Carlo simulation involves 
approximately 450,000 market factors, making use of 
approximately 350,000 time series, with sensitivities updated 
daily, volatility parameters updated intra-monthly and 
correlation parameters updated monthly. The conservative 
features of the VAR calibration contribute an approximate 
33% add-on to what would be a VAR estimated under the 
assumption of stable and perfectly, normally distributed 
markets. 

As set forth in the table below, Citi’s average trading 
VAR decreased $5 million from 2020 to 2021, mainly due to a 
reduction of market volatility, given improved macroeconomic 
conditions, compared to 2020. Citi’s average trading and 
credit portfolio VAR decreased $24 million from 2020 to 2021 
due to VAR volatility recalibration.

(1) Covariance adjustment (also known as diversification benefit) equals the difference between the total VAR and the sum of the VARs tied to each risk type. The 
benefit reflects the fact that the risks within individual and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VAR on a given day will be 
lower than the sum of the VARs relating to each risk type. The determination of the primary drivers of changes to the covariance adjustment is made by an 
examination of the impact of both model parameter and position changes. 

(2)  The total trading VAR includes mark-to-market and certain fair value option trading positions in ICG, with the exception of hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value 

option loans and all CVA exposures. Available-for-sale and accrual exposures are not included.

(3)   The specific risk-only component represents the level of equity and fixed income issuer-specific risk embedded in VAR. 
(4)   The credit portfolio is composed of mark-to-market positions associated with non-trading business units including Citi Treasury, the CVA relating to derivative 
counterparties and all associated CVA hedges. FVA and DVA are not included. The credit portfolio also includes hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value option 
loans and hedges to the leveraged finance pipeline within capital markets origination in ICG.

VAR Model Review and Validation
Generally, Citi’s VAR review and model validation process 
entails reviewing the model framework, major assumptions 
and implementation of the mathematical algorithm. In 
addition, product specific back-testing on portfolios is
periodically completed as part of the ongoing model 
performance monitoring process and reviewed with Citi’s U.S. 
banking regulators. Furthermore, Regulatory VAR back-
testing (as described below) is performed against buy-and-
hold profit and loss on a monthly basis for multiple sub-
portfolios across the organization (trading desk level, ICG 
business segment and Citigroup) and the results are shared 
with U.S. banking regulators.

Material VAR model and assumption changes must be 

independently validated within Citi’s Independent Risk 
Management organization. All model changes, including those 
for the VAR model, are validated by the model validation 
group within Citi’s Model Risk Management. In the event of 
significant model changes, parallel model runs are undertaken 
prior to implementation. In addition, significant model and 
assumption changes are subject to the periodic reviews and 
approval by Citi’s U.S. banking regulators.

Citi uses the same independently validated VAR model 
for both Regulatory VAR and Risk Management VAR (i.e., 
total trading and total trading and credit portfolios VARs) and, 
as such, the model review and validation process for both 
purposes is as described above.

Regulatory VAR, which is calculated in accordance with 
Basel III, differs from Risk Management VAR due to the fact 
that certain positions included in Risk Management VAR are 
not eligible for market risk treatment in Regulatory VAR. The 

112

composition of Risk Management VAR is discussed under 
“Value at Risk” above. The applicability of the VAR model 
for positions eligible for market risk treatment under U.S. 
regulatory capital rules is periodically reviewed and approved 
by Citi’s U.S. banking regulators.

In accordance with Basel III, Regulatory VAR includes 
all trading book-covered positions and all foreign exchange 
and commodity exposures. Pursuant to Basel III, Regulatory 
VAR excludes positions that fail to meet the intent and ability 
to trade requirements and are therefore classified as non-
trading book and categories of exposures that are specifically 
excluded as covered positions. Regulatory VAR excludes 
CVA on derivative instruments and DVA on Citi’s own fair 
value option liabilities. CVA hedges are excluded from 
Regulatory VAR and included in credit risk-weighted assets as 
computed under the Advanced Approaches for determining 
risk-weighted assets.

Regulatory VAR Back-Testing
In accordance with Basel III, Citi is required to perform back-
testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR 
model. Regulatory VAR back-testing is the process in which 
the daily one-day VAR, at a 99% confidence interval, is 
compared to the buy-and-hold profit and loss (i.e., the profit 
and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of 
the day and re-priced the following day). Buy-and-hold profit 
and loss represents the daily mark-to-market profit and loss 
attributable to price movements in covered positions from the 
close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and 
loss excludes realized trading revenue, net interest, fees and 
commissions, intra-day trading profit and loss and changes in 
reserves.

Based on a 99% confidence level, Citi would expect two 

to three days in any one year where buy-and-hold losses 
exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the conservative 
calibration of Citi’s VAR model (as a result of taking the 
greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-tail scaling 
of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer exceptions under 
normal and stable market conditions. Periods of unstable 
market conditions could increase the number of back-testing 
exceptions.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The following graph shows the daily buy-and-hold profit 
and loss associated with Citi’s covered positions compared to 
Citi’s one-day Regulatory VAR during 2021. As of December 
31, 2021, one back-testing exception was observed at the 
Citigroup level.

The difference between the 54.4% of days with buy-and-
hold gains for Regulatory VAR back-testing and the 95.8% of 
days with trading, net interest and other revenue associated 
with Citi’s trading businesses, shown in the histogram of daily 
trading-related revenue below, reflects, among other things, 
that a significant portion of Citi’s trading-related revenue is 
not generated from daily price movements on these positions 
and exposures, as well as differences in the portfolio 
composition of Regulatory VAR and Risk Management VAR.

Regulatory Trading VAR and Associated Buy-and-Hold Profit and Loss(1)—12 Months ended December 31, 2021
In millions of dollars

(1)   Buy-and-hold profit and loss, as defined by the banking regulators under Basel III, represents the daily mark-to-market revenue movement attributable to the 
trading position from the close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue and net interest intra-day trading 
profit and loss on new and terminated trades, as well as changes in reserves. Therefore, it is not comparable to the trading-related revenue presented in the chart of 
daily trading-related revenue above.

113

Stress Testing
Citi performs market risk stress testing on a regular basis to 
estimate the impact of extreme market movements. It is 
performed on individual positions and trading portfolios, as 
well as in aggregate, inclusive of multiple trading portfolios. 
Citi’s market risk management, after consultations with the 
businesses, develops both systemic and specific stress 
scenarios, reviews the output of periodic stress testing 
exercises and uses the information to assess the ongoing 
appropriateness of exposure levels and limits. Citi uses two 
complementary approaches to market risk stress testing across 
all major risk factors (i.e., equity, foreign exchange, 
commodity, interest rate and credit spreads): top-down 
systemic stresses and bottom-up business-specific stresses. 
Systemic stresses are designed to quantify the potential impact 
of extreme market movements on an institution-wide basis, 
and are constructed using both historical periods of market 
stress and projections of adverse economic scenarios. 
Business-specific stresses are designed to probe the risks of 
particular portfolios and market segments, especially those 
risks that are not fully captured in VAR and systemic stresses.
The systemic stress scenarios and business-specific stress 
scenarios at Citi are used in several reports reviewed by senior 
management and also to calculate internal risk capital for 
trading market risk. In general, changes in market values are 
defined over a one-year horizon. For the most liquid positions 
and market factors, changes in market values are defined over 
a shorter two-month horizon. The limited set of positions and 
market factors whose market value changes are defined over a 
two-month horizon are those that in management’s judgment 
have historically remained very liquid during financial crises, 
even as the trading liquidity of most other positions and 
market factors materially declined.

114

OPERATIONAL RISK

Overview
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or 
failed internal processes, people and systems or from external 
events. This includes legal risk, which is the risk of loss 
(including litigation costs, settlements, and regulatory fines) 
resulting from the failure of Citi to comply with laws, 
regulations, prudent ethical standards, and contractual 
obligations in any aspect of its businesses, but excludes 
strategic and reputation risks. Citi also recognizes the impact 
of operational risk on the reputation risk associated with Citi’s 
business activities. 

Operational risk is inherent in Citi’s global business 
activities, as well as related support functions, and can result 
in losses. Citi maintains a comprehensive Citi-wide risk 
taxonomy to classify operational risks that it faces using 
standardized definitions across Citi’s Operational Risk 
Management Framework (see discussion below). This 
taxonomy also supports regulatory requirements and 
expectations inclusive of those related to U.S. Basel III, 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), 
Heightened Standards for Large Financial Institutions and 
Dodd Frank Annual Stress Testing (DFAST). 

Citi manages operational risk consistent with the overall 
framework described in “Managing Global Risk—Overview” 
above. Citi’s goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate 
levels relative to the characteristics of its businesses, the 
markets in which it operates, its capital and liquidity and the 
competitive, economic and regulatory environment. This 
includes effectively managing operational risk and 
maintaining or reducing operational risk exposures within 
Citi’s operational risk appetite.

Citi’s Independent Operational Risk Management group 

has established a global-Operational Risk Management 
Framework with policies and practices for identification, 
measurement, monitoring, managing and reporting operational 
risks and the overall operating effectiveness of the internal 
control environment. As part of this framework, Citi has 
defined its operational risk appetite and established a 
manager’s control assessment (MCA) process for self-
identification of significant operational risks, assessment of 
the performance of key controls and mitigation of residual risk 
above acceptable levels. 

Each major business segment must implement operational 

risk processes consistent with the requirements of this 
framework. This includes:

understanding the operational risks they are exposed to;
designing controls to mitigate identified risks;
establishing key indicators;

•
•
•
• monitoring and reporting whether the operational risk 

•

•

•

exposures are in or out of their operational risk appetite;
having processes in place to bring operational risk 
exposures within acceptable levels; 
periodically estimate and aggregate the operational risks 
they are exposed to; and
ensuring that sufficient resources are available to 
actively improve the operational risk environment and 
mitigate emerging risks.

115

Citi considers operational risks that result from the 
introduction of new or changes to existing products, or result 
from significant changes in its organizational structures, 
systems, processes and personnel. 

Citi has a governance structure for the oversight of 

operational risk exposures through Business Risk and Controls 
Committees (BRCCs), which include a Citigroup BRCC as 
well as business, functions, regional and country BRCCs. 
BRCCs are chaired by the individuals in the first line of 
defense and provide escalation channels for senior 
management to review operational risk exposures including 
breaches of operational risk appetite, key indicators, 
operational risk events, and control issues. Membership 
includes senior business and functions leadership as well as 
members of the second line of defense.

In addition, Independent Risk Management, including the 
Operational Risk Management group, works proactively with 
Citi’s businesses and functions to drive a strong and embedded 
operational risk management culture and framework across 
Citi. The Operational Risk Management group actively 
challenges business and functions implementation of the 
Operational Risk Management Framework requirements and 
the quality of operational risk management practices and 
outcomes.

Information about businesses’ key operational risks, 
historical operational risk losses and the control environment 
is reported by each major business segment and functional 
area. Citi’s operational risk profile and related information is 
summarized and reported to senior management, as well as to 
the Audit and Risk Committees of Citi’s Board of Directors by 
the Head of Operational Risk Management.

Operational risk is measured through Operational Risk 

Capital and Operational Risk Regulatory Capital for the 
Advanced Approaches under Basel III. Projected operational 
risk losses under stress scenarios are estimated as a required 
part of the FRB’s CCAR process. 

For additional information on Citi’s operational risks, see 

“Risk Factors—Operational Risk” above.

Cybersecurity Risk

Overview
Cybersecurity risk is the business risk associated with the 
threat posed by a cyber attack, cyber breach or the failure to 
protect Citi’s most vital business information assets or 
operations, resulting in a financial or reputational loss	(for 
additional information, see the operational processes and 
systems and cybersecurity risk factors in “Risk Factors—
Operational Risks” above). With an evolving threat landscape, 
ever-increasing sophistication of threat actor tactics, 
techniques and procedures, and use of new technologies to 
conduct financial transactions, Citi and its clients, customers 
and third parties are and will continue to be at risk from cyber 
attacks and information security incidents. Citi recognizes the 
significance of these risks and, therefore, leverages an 
intelligence-led strategy to protect against, detect and respond 
to, and recover from cyber attacks. Further, Citi actively 
participates in financial industry, government and cross-sector 
knowledge-sharing groups to enhance individual and 
collective cybersecurity preparedness and resilience. 

Risk Management
Citi’s technology and cybersecurity risk management program 
is built on three lines of defense. Citi’s first line of defense 
under the Office of the Chief Information Security Officer 
provides frontline business, operational and technical controls 
and capabilities to protect against cybersecurity risks, and to 
respond to cyber incidents and data breaches. Citi manages 
these threats through state-of-the-art Fusion Centers, which 
serve as central commands for monitoring and coordinating 
responses to cyber threats. The enterprise information security 
team is responsible for infrastructure defense and security 
controls, performing vulnerability assessments and third-party 
information security assessments, employee awareness and 
training programs and security incident management. In each 
case the team works in coordination with a network of 
information security officers who are embedded within the 
businesses and functions globally. 

Citi’s Operational Risk Management-Technology and 

Cyber (ORM-T/C) and Independent Compliance Risk 
Management-Technology and Information Security (ICRM-T) 
groups serve as the second line of defense, and actively 
evaluate, anticipate and challenge Citi’s risk mitigation 
practices and capabilities. Citi seeks to proactively identify
and remediate technology and cybersecurity risks before they 
materialize as incidents that negatively affect business 
operations. Accordingly, the ORM-T/C team independently 
challenges and monitors capabilities in accordance with Citi’s 
defined Technology and Cyber Risk Appetite statements. To 
address evolving cybersecurity risks and corresponding 
regulations, ORM-T/C and ICRM-T teams collectively also 
monitor cyber legal and regulatory requirements, identify and 
define emerging risks, execute strategic cyber threat 
assessments, perform new products and initiative reviews, 
perform data management risk oversight and conduct cyber 
risk assurance reviews (inclusive of third-party assessments). 
In addition, ORM-T/C employs tools and oversees and 
challenges metrics that are both tailored to cybersecurity 
and technology and aligned with Citi’s overall operational risk 
management framework to effectively track, identify and
manage risk.

Internal audit serves as the third line of defense and 
independently provides assurance on how effectively the 
organization as a whole manages cybersecurity risk. Citi also 
has multiple senior committees such as the Information 
Security Risk Committee (ISRC), which governs enterprise-
level risk tolerance inclusive of cybersecurity risk.

Board Oversight
Citi’s Board of Directors provides oversight of management’s 
efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risk and respond to cyber 
incidents. The Board receives regular reports on cybersecurity 
and engages in discussions throughout the year with 
management and subject-matter experts on the effectiveness of 
Citi’s overall cybersecurity program. The Board also obtains 
updates on Citi’s inherent cybersecurity risks and Citi’s road 
map and progress for addressing these risks. 

Moreover, Citi’s Board and its committee members 
receive contemporaneous reporting on significant cyber events 
including response, legal obligations, and outreach and 
notification to regulators, and customers when needed, as well 

116

as guidance to management as appropriate. In 2021, the Board 
of Directors underwent a cyber incident tabletop exercise. 
Also in 2021, the Board’s Risk Management Committee 
approved a standalone Cybersecurity Risk Appetite Statement 
against which Citi’s performance is measured quarterly. For 
additional information on the Board’s oversight of 
cybersecurity risk management, see Citi’s 2022 proxy 
statement to be filed with the SEC in March 2022.

COMPLIANCE RISK
Compliance risk is the risk to current or projected financial 
condition and resilience arising from violations of laws, rules, 
or regulations, or from non-conformance with prescribed 
practices, internal policies and procedures or ethical standards. 
Compliance risk exposes Citi to fines, civil money penalties, 
payment of damages and the voiding of contracts. Compliance 
risk can result in diminished reputation, harm to Citi’s 
customers, limited business opportunities and lessened 
expansion potential. It encompasses the risk of noncompliance 
with all laws and regulations, as well as prudent ethical 
standards and some contractual obligations. It could also 
include exposure to litigation (known as legal risk) from all 
aspects of traditional and non-traditional banking.

Citi seeks to operate with integrity, maintain strong 

ethical standards and adhere to applicable policies and 
regulatory and legal requirements. Citi must maintain and 
execute a proactive Compliance Risk Management (CRM) 
Policy that is designed to manage compliance risk effectively 
across Citi, with a view to fundamentally strengthen the 
compliance risk management culture across the lines of 
defense taking into account Citi’s risk governance framework 
and regulatory requirements. Independent Compliance Risk 
Management’s (ICRM) primary objectives are to:

•

Drive and embed a culture of compliance and control 
throughout Citi;

• Maintain and oversee an integrated CRM Policy and 

Compliance Risk Framework that facilitates enterprise-
wide compliance with local, national or cross-border laws, 
rules or regulations, Citi’s internal policies, standards and 
procedures and relevant standards of conduct;
Assess compliance risks and issues across product lines, 
functions and geographies, supported by globally 
consistent systems and compliance risk management 
processes; and
Provide compliance risk data aggregation and reporting 
capabilities.

•

•

To anticipate, control and mitigate compliance risk, Citi 
has established the CRM Policy to achieve standardization and 
centralization of methodologies and processes, and to enable 
more consistent and comprehensive execution of compliance 
risk management. 

Citi has a commitment, as well as an obligation, to 
identify, assess and mitigate compliance risks associated with 
its businesses and functions. ICRM is responsible for 
oversight of Citi’s CRM Policy, while all businesses and 
global control functions are responsible for managing their 
compliance risks and operating within the Compliance Risk 
Appetite. 

Citi carries out its objectives and fulfills its 

responsibilities through the Compliance Risk Framework, 

which is composed of the following integrated key activities, 
to holistically manage compliance risk:

• Management of Citi’s compliance with laws, rules and 
regulations by identifying and analyzing changes, 
assessing the impact, and implementing appropriate 
policies, processes and controls;
Developing and providing compliance training to ensure 
colleagues are aware of and understand the key laws, 
rules and regulations;

•

• Monitoring the Compliance Risk Appetite, which is 

articulated through qualitative compliance risk statements 
describing Citi’s appetite for certain types of risk and 
quantitative measures to monitor the Company’s 
compliance risk exposure;

• Monitoring and testing of compliance risks and controls 

•

in assessing conformance with laws, rules, regulations and 
internal policies; and
Issue identification, escalation and remediation to drive 
accountability, including measurement and reporting of 
compliance risk metrics against established thresholds in 
support of the CRM Policy and Compliance Risk 
Appetite.

As discussed above, Citi is working to address the FRB 

and OCC consent orders, which include improvements to 
Citi’s Compliance Risk Framework and its Enterprise-wide 
application (for additional information regarding the consent 
orders, see “Citi’s Consent Order Compliance” above).

REPUTATION RISK
Citi’s reputation is a vital asset in building trust with its 
stakeholders and Citi is diligent in enhancing and protecting 
its reputation with its colleagues, customers, investors and 
regulators. To support this, Citi has developed a reputation 
risk framework. Under this framework, Citigroup and Citibank 
have implemented a risk appetite statement and related key 
indicators to monitor corporate activities and operations 
relative to our risk appetite. The framework also requires that 
business segments and regions escalate significant reputation 
risks that require review or mitigation through a Reputation 
Risk Committee or equivalent.

The Reputation Risk Committees, which are composed of 

Citi’s most senior executives, govern the process by which 
material reputation risks are identified, monitored, reported, 
managed, and escalated. The Reputation Risk Committees 
determine the appropriate actions to be taken in line with risk 
appetite and regulatory expectations, while promoting a 
culture of risk awareness and high standards of integrity and 
ethical behavior across the Company, consistent with Citi’s 
mission and value proposition. The Reputation Risk 
Committees in the business segments and regions are part of 
the governance infrastructure that Citi has in place to review 
the reputation risk posed by business activities, sales practices, 
product design, or perceived conflicts of interest. These 
committees may also raise potential reputation risks for due 
consideration by the Reputation Risk Committee at the 
corporate level. The Citigroup Reputation Risk Committee 
may escalate reputation risks to the Nomination, Governance 
and Public Affairs Committee or other appropriate committee 
of the Citigroup Board of Directors. 

The responsibility for enhancing and protecting Citi’s 
reputation is shared by all colleagues, who are guided by Citi’s 
Code of Conduct. Colleagues are expected to exercise sound 
judgment and common sense in decisions and actions. They 
are also expected to promptly escalate all issues that present 
potential reputation risk in line with policy.

STRATEGIC RISK
As discussed above, strategic risk is the risk of a sustained 
impact (not episodic impact) to Citi’s core strategic objectives 
as measured by impacts on anticipated earnings, market 
capitalization, or capital, arising from the external factors 
affecting the Company’s operating environment; as well as the 
risks associated with defining the strategy and executing the 
strategy, which are identified, measured and managed as part 
of the Strategic Risk Framework at the Enterprise Level. 

In this context, external factors affecting Citi’s operating 

environment are the economic environment, geopolitical/
political landscape, industry/competitive landscape, societal 
trends, customer/client behavior, regulatory/legislative 
environment and trends related to investors/shareholders.

Citi’s Executive Management Team is responsible for the 
development and execution of Citi’s strategy. This strategy is 
translated into forward-looking plans (collectively Citi’s 
Strategic Plan) that are then cascaded across the organization. 
Citi’s Strategic Plan is presented to the board on an annual 
basis and is aligned with Risk Appetite thresholds and 
includes Top Risk identification as required by internal 
frameworks. It is also aligned with limit requirements for 
capital allocation. Governance and oversight of strategic risk 
is facilitated by internal committees on a group-wide basis as 
well as strategic committees at the ICG, GCB and regional 
levels.

Citi works to ensure that strategic risks are adequately 
considered and addressed across its various risk management 
activities, and that strategic risks are assessed in the context of 
Citi’s risk appetite. Citi conducts a top-down, bottom-up risk 
identification process to identify risks, including strategic 
risks. Business segments undertake a quarterly risk 
identification process to systematically identify and document 
all material risks faced by Citi. Independent Risk Management 
oversees the Risk Identification process through regular 
reviews and coordinates identification and monitoring of Top 
Risks. Independent Risk Management also manages strategic 
risk by monitoring risk appetite thresholds in conjunction with 
various strategic risk committees, which are part of the 
governance structure that Citi has in place to manage its 
strategic risks. 

For additional information on Citi’s strategic risks, see 

“Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” above.

OTHER RISKS

LIBOR Transition Risk
The LIBOR administrator ceased publication of non-USD 
LIBOR and one week and two-month USD LIBOR on a 
representative basis on December 31, 2021, with plans to 
cease publication of all other USD LIBOR tenors on June 30, 
2023. Regulators expect banks, including Citi, to have ceased 
entering into new contracts that reference USD LIBOR as a 

117

benchmark by December 31, 2021, except for limited 
circumstances as set out in regulatory guidance. 

Citi recognizes that a transition away from and 
discontinuance of LIBOR presents various risks and 
challenges that could significantly impact financial markets 
and market participants, including Citi (for information about 
Citi’s risks from a transition away from and discontinuation of 
LIBOR or any other benchmark rates, see “Risk Factors—
Other Risks” above). Accordingly, Citi has continued its 
efforts to identify and manage its LIBOR transition risks. 

For example, Citi continues to closely monitor legislative, 
regulatory and other developments related to LIBOR transition 
matters and legislative relief. The International Swaps and 
Derivatives Association (ISDA) published the Interbank 
Offered Rate (IBOR) Fallbacks Protocol for existing IBOR 
derivatives transactions, which became effective in January 
2021. The IBOR Fallbacks Protocol provides derivatives 
market participants with new fallbacks for legacy and new 
derivatives contracts if both counterparties adhere to the 
protocol or engage in bilateral amendments (see discussion 
below regarding Citi’s adherence to the protocol). In April 
2021, legislation was adopted in New York State that provides 
for the use of a statutory replacement for USD LIBOR in 
certain New York law legacy contracts. Similar federal 
legislation was passed in the House of Representatives in 
December 2021 and is pending passage by the Senate, 
although there is no guarantee that the federal legislative 
proposal will become law. 

In addition, Citi has established a LIBOR governance and 

implementation program focused on identifying and 
addressing the impact of LIBOR transition on Citi’s clients, 
operational capabilities and financial contracts. The program 
operates globally across Citi’s businesses and functions and 
includes active involvement of senior management, oversight 
by Citi’s Asset and Liability Committee and reporting to the 
Risk Management Committee of Citigroup’s Board of 
Directors. As part of the program, Citi has continued to 
implement its LIBOR transition action plans and associated 
roadmaps under the following key workstreams: program 
management; transition strategy and risk management; 
customer management, including internal communications and 
training, legal/contract management and product management; 
financial exposures and risk management; regulatory and 
industry engagement; operations and technology; and finance, 
risk, tax and treasury. 

During 2021, Citi continued to participate in a number of 

working groups formed by global regulators, including the 
Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) convened by 
the FRB. These working groups promote and advance 
development of alternative reference rates and seek to identify 
and address potential challenges from any transition to such 
rates. Citi’s LIBOR transition action plans and associated 
roadmaps are intended to be consistent with the timelines 
recommended by these working groups. This includes the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s SOFR First 
Initiative, which is designed to promote derivatives trading in 
SOFR. Citi also continued to engage with regulators, financial 
accounting bodies and others on LIBOR transition matters. 

Citi’s LIBOR transition efforts include, among other 

things, reducing its overall exposure to LIBOR, increasing 

118

Citi’s virtual client communication efforts and client transition 
facilitation, including outreach regarding new industry-led 
protocols and solutions, and using alternative reference rates 
in certain newly issued financial instruments and products. In 
the past several years, Citi has issued preferred stock and 
benchmark debt referencing the Secured Overnight Financing 
Rate (SOFR) and issued customer-related debt referencing 
SOFR and the Sterling Overnight Interbank Average Rate 
(SONIA), the recommended replacement rate for Sterling 
LIBOR. Citi has also originated and arranged loans 
referencing SOFR and SONIA and executed SOFR and 
SONIA-based derivatives contracts. Further, Citi has also been 
investing in its systems and infrastructure, as client activity 
moves away from LIBOR to alternative reference rates. Since 
the ARRC’s recommendation of CME Group’s Term SOFR in 
July 2021, Citi has focused on systems’ readiness to provide 
Term SOFR loan and derivatives to clients, where permitted. 

In 2021, Citi also focused on remediating existing LIBOR 

contracts for which	publication ceased on a representative 
basis on December 31, 2021. Substantially all of these 
contracts were remediated by December 31, 2021, and Citi 
continues to actively engage in and track the remediation of 
any remaining contracts after December 31, 2021. As of 
December 31, 2021, Citi’s overall USD LIBOR gross notional 
exposure for contracts maturing after the LIBOR cessation 
date of June 30, 2023 was approximately $7.1 trillion, which 
includes approximately $4 trillion of cleared derivatives that 
are covered by planned Central Counterparty Clearing House 
(CCP) conversions, and approximately $2.4 trillion of bilateral 
derivatives that are covered by robust contract fallback 
language. The remaining exposure of approximately $0.7 
trillion includes bilateral derivatives and cash products that 
will be addressed by 2022 contract remediation plans. 

In addition, for LIBOR contracts that have not yet been 

remediated, Citi continues to review the effect of relevant 
legislative solutions, which are expected to facilitate the 
transition to replacement rates. 

Climate Risk
Climate change presents immediate and long-term risks to Citi 
and its clients and customers, with the risks expected to 
increase over time. Climate risk refers to the risk of loss 
arising from climate change and is comprised of both physical 
risk and transition risk. Physical risk considers how chronic 
and acute climate change (e.g., increased storms, drought, 
fires, floods) can directly damage physical assets (e.g., real 
estate, crops) or otherwise impact their value or productivity. 
Transition risk considers how changes in policy, technology, 
business practices and market preferences to address climate 
change (e.g., carbon pricing policies, power generation shifts 
from fossil fuels to renewable energy) can lead to changes in 
the value of assets, commodities and companies.

Climate risk is an overarching risk that can act as a driver 

of other categories of risk, such as credit risk from obligors 
exposed to high climate risk, reputational risk from increased 
stakeholder concerns about financing high-carbon industries 
and operational risk from physical risks to Citi’s facilities and 
personnel.

Citi currently identifies climate risk as an “emerging risk” 

within its enterprise risk management framework. Emerging 

risks are risks or thematic issues that are either new to the 
landscape, or in the case of climate risk, existing risks that are 
rapidly changing or evolving in an escalating fashion, which 
are difficult to assess due to limited data or other uncertainties. 
For additional information on climate risk, see “Risk Factors
—Other Risks” above.

Citi reviews factors related to climate risk under its 
longstanding Environmental and Social Risk Management 
(ESRM) Policy, which includes a focus on climate risk related 
to financed projects and clients in high-carbon sectors. 
Cautious of the credit risk of stranded assets, as well as the 
reputational risks associated with the coal sector due to its 
high carbon emissions, Citi began a phase-down of its 
financing of thermal coal mining companies in 2015 and of 
new coal-fired power plants in 2018. As Citi’s phase-down 
has continued, Citi’s ESRM Policy was updated to include a 
prohibition on all project-related financing of new coal-fired 
power plants and new or expanding thermal coal mines as well 
as clear timetables to reduce financing of companies with high 
exposure to coal fired power and coal mining who do not 
pursue low-carbon transition in the coming years. These sector 
approaches allow Citi to set a comprehensive and industry-
wide approach to clarify its positions, set clear expectations 
for its clients and help address certain climate risk driven 
credit risk concerns while reducing reputation risk.

Citi continues to explore and test methodologies for 

quantifying how climate risks could impact the individual 
credit profiles of its clients across various sectors. To assist in 
embedding climate risk assessments in its credit assessment 
process, Citi is developing sector-specific climate risk 
assessments. Such climate risk assessments are designed to 
supplement publicly available client disclosures and data 
provided from third-party vendors and facilitate conversations 
with clients on their most material climate risks and 
management plans for adaptation and mitigation. In the near 
term, Citi’s assessments will consider sectors that have been 
identified as higher climate risk by Citi’s risk identification 
process. This will not only help Citi better understand its  
clients’ businesses and climate-related risks, but will also 
provide a source of climate data. Citi’s net zero plan is leading 
to the further integration of climate risk discussions into client 
engagement and client selection.

Furthermore, Citi is developing globally consistent 
principles and approaches for managing climate risk across 
Citi. Climate risk will be embedded into relevant policies and 
processes over time.

In addition, Citi continues to participate in financial 

industry collaborations to develop and pilot new 
methodologies and approaches for measuring and assessing 
the potential financial risks of climate change. Citi is also 
closely monitoring regulatory developments on climate risk 
and sustainable finance, and actively engaging with regulators 
on these topics.

ESG matters at Citi, see “Sustainability and Other ESG 
Matters” above.

Country Risk

Top 25 Country Exposures 
The following table presents Citi’s top 25 exposures by 
country (excluding the U.S.) as of December 31, 2021. 
(Including the U.S., the total exposure as of December 31, 
2021 to the top 25 countries would represent approximately 
98% of Citi’s exposure to all countries.) 

For purposes of the table, loan amounts are reflected in 
the country where the loan is booked, which is generally based 
on the domicile of the borrower. For example, a loan to a 
Chinese subsidiary of a Switzerland-based corporation will 
generally be categorized as a loan in China. In addition, Citi 
has developed regional booking centers in certain countries, 

most significantly in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland, 
in order to more efficiently serve its corporate customers. As 
an example, with respect to the U.K., only 33% of corporate 
loans presented in the table below are to U.K. domiciled 
entities (36% for unfunded commitments), with the balance of 
the loans predominately to European domiciled counterparties. 
Approximately 87% of the total U.K. funded loans and 88% of 
the total U.K. unfunded commitments were investment grade 
as of December 31, 2021. 

Trading account assets and investment securities are 
generally categorized based on the domicile of the issuer of 
the security of the underlying reference entity. For additional 
information on the assets included in the table, see the 
footnotes to the table below.

Russia
Citi operates both its ICG and GCB businesses in Russia, 
although the Company is currently pursuing the exit of its 
GCB business in the country. All of Citi’s domestic operations 
in Russia are conducted through a subsidiary of Citibank, 
which uses the Russian ruble as its functional currency. Citi’s 
net investment in Russia was approximately $1 billion as of 
December 31, 2021. The majority of Citi’s net investment was 
hedged for foreign currency depreciation as of December 31, 
2021, using forward foreign exchange contracts. Citi’s total 
third-party exposure was approximately $8.2 billion as of 
December 31, 2021. These assets primarily consisted of 
corporate and consumer loans, local government debt 
securities, reverse repurchase agreements, and cash on deposit 
and placements with the Bank of Russia and other financial 
institutions. A significant portion of Citi’s third-party 
exposures were funded with domestic deposit liabilities from 
both ICG and GCB clients. Further, Citi has approximately 
$1.6 billion of additional exposures to Russian counterparties 
that are not held on the Russian subsidiary and are not 
included in the $8.2 billion above.

The $5.4 billion in Russia credit and other exposures in 
the “Top 25 Country Exposures” table above does not include 
approximately $1.0 billion of cash and placements with the 
Bank of Russia and other financial institutions and $1.8 billion 
of reverse repurchase agreements with various counterparties.
Citi continues to monitor the current Russia–Ukraine 

geopolitical situation and economic conditions and will 
mitigate its exposures and risks as appropriate. For additional 
information, see “Risk Factors—Market-Related Risk,” “—
Operational Risks” and “—Other Risks” above.

located in that country.

Argentina
Citi operates in Argentina through its ICG businesses. As of 
December 31, 2021, Citi’s net investment in its Argentine 
operations was approximately $1.5 billion. Citi uses the U.S. 
dollar as the functional currency for its operations in highly 
inflationary countries under U.S. GAAP. Citi uses Argentina’s 
official market exchange rate to remeasure its net Argentine 
peso-denominated assets into the U.S. dollar. As of 
December 31, 2021, the official Argentine peso exchange rate 
against the U.S. dollar was 102.73.

The Central Bank of Argentina maintains certain capital 

and currency controls that generally restrict Citi’s ability to 
access U.S. dollars in Argentina and remit substantially all of 
its earnings from its Argentine operations. Citi’s net 
investment in its Argentine operations is likely to increase as 
Citi continues to generate net income from its Argentine 
franchise and the majority of its earnings cannot be remitted.
Due to the currency controls implemented by the Central 

Bank of Argentina, certain indirect foreign exchange 
mechanisms have developed that some Argentine entities may 
use to obtain U.S. dollars, generally at rates that are 
significantly higher than Argentina’s official exchange rate. 
Citibank Argentina is precluded from accessing these 
alternative mechanisms, and these exchange mechanisms 
cannot be used to remeasure Citi’s net monetary assets into the 
U.S. dollar under U.S. GAAP. Citi cannot predict future 
fluctuations in Argentina’s official market exchange rate or to 
what extent Citi may be able to access U.S. dollars at the 
official exchange rate in the future.

Citi economically hedges the foreign currency risk in its 
net Argentine peso-denominated assets to the extent possible 
and prudent using non-deliverable forward (NDF) derivative 
instruments that are primarily executed outside of Argentina. 
As of December 31, 2021, the international NDF market had 
very limited liquidity, resulting in Citi being unable to 
economically hedge nearly all of its Argentine peso exposure. 
As a result, and to the extent that Citi does not execute NDF 
contracts for this unhedged exposure in the future, Citi would 
record devaluations on its net Argentine peso‑denominated 
assets in earnings, without any benefit from a change in the 
fair value of derivative positions used to economically hedge 
the exposure. 

Citi continually evaluates its economic exposure to its 
Argentine counterparties and reserves for changes in credit 
risk and sovereign risk associated with its Argentine assets. 
Citi believes it has established appropriate allowances for 
credit losses on its Argentine loans, and appropriate fair value 
adjustments on Argentine assets and liabilities measured at fair 
value, for such risks under U.S. GAAP as of December 31, 
2021. However, U.S. regulatory agencies may require Citi to 
record additional reserves in the future, increasing ICG’s cost 
of credit, based on the perceived country risk associated with 
its Argentine exposures.

FFIEC—Cross-Border Claims on Third Parties and Local 
Country Assets
Citi’s cross-border disclosures are set forth below, based on 
the country exposure bank regulatory reporting guidelines of 
the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council 
(FFIEC). The following summarizes some of the FFIEC key 
reporting guidelines:

•

•

•

•

•

Amounts are based on the domicile of the ultimate 
obligor, counterparty, collateral (only including qualifying 
liquid collateral), issuer or guarantor, as applicable (e.g., a 
security recorded by a Citi U.S. entity but issued by the 
U.K. government is considered U.K. exposure; a loan 
recorded by a Citi Mexico entity to a customer domiciled 
in Mexico where the underlying collateral is held in 
Germany is considered German exposure). 
Amounts do not consider the benefit of collateral received 
for secured financing transactions (i.e., repurchase 
agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and securities 
loaned and borrowed) and are reported based on notional 
amounts. 
Netting of derivative receivables and payables, reported at 
fair value, is permitted, but only under a legally binding 
netting agreement with the same specific counterparty, 
and does not include the benefit of margin received or 
hedges.
Credit default swaps (CDS) are included based on the 
gross notional amount sold and purchased and do not 
include any offsetting CDS on the same underlying entity. 
Loans are reported without the benefit of hedges.

Given the requirements noted above, Citi’s FFIEC cross-
border exposures and total outstandings tend to fluctuate, in 
some cases significantly, from period to period. As an 
example, because total outstandings under FFIEC guidelines 
do not include the benefit of margin or hedges, market 
volatility in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and credit 
spreads may cause significant fluctuations in the level of total 
outstandings, all else being equal.

(1) During 2021, Citi reclassified deposit insurance expenses from Interest expense to Other operating expenses for all periods presented. Amounts reclassified for 

each year were $1,207 million for 2021, $1,203 million for 2020 and $781 million for 2019. For additional information, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.
Interest expense on Trading account liabilities of ICG is reported as a reduction of Interest revenue. Interest revenue and Interest expense on cash collateral 
positions are reported in interest on Trading account assets and Trading account liabilities, respectively.

generally calculated based on predefined program revenues 
less predefined program expenses. In most of Citi’s partner 
sharing agreements, program expenses include net credit 
losses and, to the extent that the increase in net credit losses 
reduces Citi’s liability for the partners’ share for a given 
program year, it would generally result in lower payments to 
partners in total for that year and vice versa. Further, in some 
instances, other partner payments are based on program sales 
and new account acquisitions. Interchange revenues are 
recognized as earned on a daily basis when Citi’s performance 
obligation to transmit funds to the payment networks has been 
satisfied. Annual card fees, net of origination costs, are 
deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over a 12-
month period. Costs related to card reward programs are 
recognized when the rewards are earned by the cardholders. 
Payments to partners are recognized when incurred.

Deposit-related fees consist of service charges on deposit 
accounts and fees earned from performing cash management 
activities and other deposit account services. Such fees are 
recognized in the period in which the related service is 
provided.

Transactional service fees primarily consist of fees 
charged for processing services such as cash management, 
global payments, clearing, international funds transfer and 
other trade services. Such fees are recognized as/when the 
associated service is satisfied, which normally occurs at the 
point in time the service is requested by the customer and 
provided by Citi.

Insurance distribution revenue consists of commissions 
earned from third-party insurance companies for marketing 
and selling insurance policies on behalf of such entities. Such 
commissions are recognized in Commissions and fees at the 
point in time the associated service is fulfilled, generally when 
the insurance policy is sold to the policyholder. Sales of 
certain insurance products include a portion of variable 
consideration associated with the underlying product. In these 
instances, a portion of the revenue associated with the sale of 
the policy is not recognized until the variable consideration 
becomes determinable. The Company recognized 
$260 million, $290 million and $322 million of revenue 
related to such variable consideration for the years ended 
December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These 
amounts primarily relate to performance obligations satisfied 
in prior periods.

Insurance premiums consist of premium income from 

insurance policies that Citi has underwritten and sold to 
policyholders.

5.  COMMISSIONS AND FEES; ADMINISTRATION 
AND OTHER FIDUCIARY FEES

Commissions and Fees
The primary components of Commissions and fees revenue are 
investment banking fees, brokerage commissions, credit card 
and bank card income and deposit-related fees. 

Investment banking fees are substantially composed of 
underwriting and advisory revenues. Such fees are recognized 
at the point in time when Citigroup’s performance under the 
terms of a contractual arrangement is completed, which is 
typically at the closing of a transaction. Reimbursed expenses 
related to these transactions are recorded as revenue and are 
included within investment banking fees. In certain instances 
for advisory contracts, Citi will receive amounts in advance of 
the deal’s closing. In these instances, the amounts received 
will be recognized as a liability and not recognized in revenue 
until the transaction closes. For the periods presented, the 
contract liability amount was negligible. 

Out-of-pocket expenses associated with underwriting 
activity are deferred and recognized at the time the related 
revenue is recognized, while out-of-pocket expenses 
associated with advisory arrangements are expensed as 
incurred. In general, expenses incurred related to investment 
banking transactions, whether consummated or not, are 
recorded in Other operating expenses. The Company has 
determined that it acts as principal in the majority of these 
transactions and therefore presents expenses gross within 
Other operating expenses.

Brokerage commissions primarily include commissions 

and fees from the following: executing transactions for clients 
on exchanges and over-the-counter markets; sales of mutual 
funds and other annuity products; and assisting clients in 
clearing transactions, providing brokerage services and other 
such activities. Brokerage commissions are recognized in 
Commissions and fees at the point in time the associated 
service is fulfilled, generally on the trade execution date. Sales 
of certain investment products include a portion of variable 
consideration associated with the underlying product. In these 
instances, a portion of the revenue associated with the sale of 
the product is not recognized until the variable consideration 
becomes fixed. The Company recognized $639 million, $495 
million and $485 million of revenue related to such variable 
consideration for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 
and 2019, respectively. These amounts primarily relate to 
performance obligations satisfied in prior periods.

Credit card and bank card income is primarily composed 
of interchange fees, which are earned by card issuers based on 
purchase sales, and certain card fees, including annual fees. 
Costs related to customer reward programs and certain 
payments to partners (primarily based on program sales, 
profitability and customer acquisitions) are recorded as a 
reduction of credit card and bank card income. Citi’s credit 
card programs have certain partner sharing agreements that 
vary by partner. These partner sharing agreements are subject 
to contractually based performance thresholds that, if met, 
would require Citi to make ongoing payments to the partner. 
The threshold is based on the profitability of a program and is

(1) Citi’s consumer credit card programs have certain partner-sharing agreements that vary by partner. These agreements are subject to contractually based 

performance thresholds that, if met, would require Citi to make ongoing payments to the partner. The threshold is based on the profitability of a program and is 
generally calculated based on predefined program revenues less predefined program expenses. In most of Citi’s partner-sharing agreements, program expenses 
include net credit losses and, to the extent that the increase in net credit losses reduces Citi’s liability for the partners’ share for a given program year, would 
generally result in lower payments to partners in total for that year and vice versa. Further, in some instances, other partner payments are based on program sales 
and new account acquisitions.
Includes overdraft fees of $107 million, $100 million and $127 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Overdraft fees are 
accounted for under ASC 310.

(3) Consists primarily of fees earned from structuring and underwriting loan syndications or related financing activity. This activity is accounted for under ASC 310.
(4) Commissions and fees include $(8,516) million, $(7,160) million and $(7,695) million not accounted for under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, 
for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amounts reported in Commissions and fees accounted for under other guidance primarily 
include card-related loan fees, card reward programs and certain partner payments, corporate finance fees, insurance premiums and loan servicing fees.

Administration and Other Fiduciary Fees
Administration and other fiduciary fees revenue is primarily 
composed of custody fees and fiduciary fees.

The custody product is composed of numerous services 
related to the administration, safekeeping and reporting for 
both U.S. and non-U.S. denominated securities. The services 
offered to clients include trade settlement, safekeeping, 
income collection, corporate action notification, record-
keeping and reporting, tax reporting and cash management. 
These services are provided for a wide range of securities, 
including but not limited to equities, municipal and corporate 
bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, money market 
instruments, U.S. Treasuries and agencies, derivative 
instruments, mutual funds, alternative investments and 
precious metals. Custody fees are recognized as or when the 
associated promised service is satisfied, which normally 
occurs at the point in time the service is requested by the 
customer and provided by Citi.

Fiduciary fees consist of trust services and investment 
management services. As an escrow agent, Citi receives, safe-
keeps, services and manages clients’ escrowed assets, such as 
cash, securities, property (including intellectual property), 
contracts or other collateral. Citi performs its escrow agent 
duties by safekeeping the assets during the specified time 
period agreed upon by all parties and therefore earns its 
revenue evenly during the contract duration. 

Investment management services consist of managing 

assets on behalf of Citi’s retail and institutional clients. 
Revenue from these services primarily consists of asset-based 
fees for advisory accounts, which are based on the market 
value of the client’s assets and recognized monthly, when the 
market value is fixed. In some instances, the Company 
contracts with third-party advisors and with third-party 
custodians. The Company has determined that it acts as 
principal in the majority of these transactions and therefore 
presents the amounts paid to third parties gross within Other 
operating expenses.

6.  PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS

Principal transactions revenue consists of realized and 
unrealized gains and losses from trading activities. Trading 
activities include revenues from fixed income, equities, credit 
and commodities products and foreign exchange transactions 
that are managed on a portfolio basis and characterized below 
based on the primary risk managed by each trading desk. Not 
included in the table below is the impact of net interest income 
related to trading activities, which is an integral part of trading 
activities’ profitability. See Note 4 to the Consolidated 

Financial Statements for information about net interest income 
related to trading activities. Principal transactions include 
CVA (credit valuation adjustments) and FVA (funding 
valuation adjustments) on over-the-counter derivatives, and 
gains (losses) on certain economic hedges on loans in ICG. 
These adjustments are discussed further in Note 24 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. 

In certain transactions, Citi incurs fees and presents these 

fees paid to third parties in operating expenses.

(1)   The above tables do not include securities-for-securities lending 

transactions of $3.6 billion and $6.8 billion at December 31, 2021 and 
2020, respectively, where the Company acts as lender and receives 
securities that can be sold or pledged as collateral. In these transactions, 
the Company recognizes the securities received at fair value within 
Other assets and the obligation to return those securities as a liability 
within Brokerage payables. 

(2)  See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further 

information.

The resale and repurchase agreements represent 
collateralized financing transactions. Citi executes these 
transactions primarily through its broker-dealer subsidiaries to 
facilitate customer matched-book activity and to efficiently 
fund a portion of Citi’s trading inventory. Transactions 
executed by Citi’s bank subsidiaries primarily facilitate 
customer financing activity.

To maintain reliable funding under a wide range of 

market conditions, including under periods of stress, Citi 
manages these activities by taking into consideration the 
quality of the underlying collateral and stipulating financing 
tenor. Citi manages the risks in its collateralized financing 
transactions by conducting daily stress tests to account for 
changes in capacity, tenors, haircut, collateral profile and 
client actions. In addition, Citi maintains counterparty 
diversification by establishing concentration triggers and 
assessing counterparty reliability and stability under stress.
It is the Company’s policy to take possession of the 
underlying collateral, monitor its market value relative to the 
amounts due under the agreements and, when necessary, 

188

require prompt transfer of additional collateral in order to 
maintain contractual margin protection. For resale and 
repurchase agreements, when necessary, the Company posts 
additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin 
protection. 

Collateral typically consists of government and 

government-agency securities, corporate and municipal bonds, 
equities and mortgage- and other asset-backed securities.
The resale and repurchase agreements are generally 
documented under industry standard agreements that allow the 
prompt close-out of all transactions (including the liquidation 
of securities held) and the offsetting of obligations to return 
cash or securities by the non-defaulting party, following a 
payment default or other type of default under the relevant 
master agreement. Events of default generally include 
(i) failure to deliver cash or securities as required under the 
transaction, (ii) failure to provide or return cash or securities 
as used for margining purposes, (iii) breach of representation, 
(iv) cross-default to another transaction entered into among the 
parties, or, in some cases, their affiliates and (v) a repudiation 
of obligations under the agreement. The counterparty that 
receives the securities in these transactions is generally 
unrestricted in its use of the securities, with the exception of 
transactions executed on a tri-party basis, where the collateral 
is maintained by a custodian and operational limitations may 
restrict its use of the securities.

A substantial portion of the resale and repurchase 

agreements is recorded at fair value, as described in Notes 24 
and 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The 
remaining portion is carried at the amount of cash initially 
advanced or received, plus accrued interest, as specified in the 
respective agreements.

The securities borrowing and lending agreements also 
represent collateralized financing transactions similar to the 
resale and repurchase agreements. Collateral typically consists 
of government and government-agency securities and 
corporate debt and equity securities.

Similar to the resale and repurchase agreements, securities 

borrowing and lending agreements are generally documented 
under industry standard agreements that allow the prompt 
close-out of all transactions (including the liquidation of 
securities held) and the offsetting of obligations to return cash 
or securities by the non-defaulting party, following a payment 
default or other default by the other party under the relevant 
master agreement. Events of default and rights to use 
securities under the securities borrowing and lending 
agreements are similar to the resale and repurchase agreements 
referenced above.

A substantial portion of securities borrowing and lending 

agreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or 
received. The remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the 
Company elected the fair value option for certain securities 
borrowed and loaned portfolios, as described in Note 25 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. With respect to securities 
loaned, the Company receives cash collateral in an amount 
generally in excess of the market value of the securities 
loaned. The Company monitors the market value of securities 
borrowed and securities loaned on a daily basis and obtains or 
posts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual 
margin protection.

 
 
 
 
The enforceability of offsetting rights incorporated in the 

master netting agreements for resale and repurchase 
agreements, and securities borrowing and lending agreements, 
is evidenced to the extent that (i) a supportive legal opinion 
has been obtained from counsel of recognized standing that 
provides the requisite level of certainty regarding the 
enforceability of these agreements and (ii) the exercise of 
rights by the non-defaulting party to terminate and close out 
transactions on a net basis under these agreements will not be 
stayed or avoided under applicable law upon an event of 
default including bankruptcy, insolvency or similar 
proceeding.

A legal opinion may not have been sought or obtained for 

certain jurisdictions where local law is silent or sufficiently 
ambiguous to determine the enforceability of offsetting rights 
or where adverse case law or conflicting regulation may cast 
doubt on the enforceability of such rights. In some 
jurisdictions and for some counterparty types, the insolvency 

law for a particular counterparty type may be nonexistent or 
unclear as overlapping regimes may exist. For example, this 
may be the case for certain sovereigns, municipalities, central 
banks and U.S. pension plans.

The following tables present the gross and net resale and 
repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending 
agreements and the related offsetting amounts permitted under 
ASC 210-20-45. The tables also include amounts related to 
financial instruments that are not permitted to be offset under 
ASC 210-20-45, but would be eligible for offsetting to the 
extent that an event of default has occurred and a legal opinion 
supporting enforceability of the offsetting rights has been 
obtained. Remaining exposures continue to be secured by 
financial collateral, but the Company may not have sought or 
been able to obtain a legal opinion evidencing enforceability 
of the offsetting right.

12.  BROKERAGE RECEIVABLES AND BROKERAGE 
PAYABLES

The Company has receivables and payables for financial 
instruments sold to and purchased from brokers, dealers and 
customers, which arise in the ordinary course of business. Citi 
is exposed to risk of loss from the inability of brokers, dealers 
or customers to pay for purchases or to deliver the financial 
instruments sold, in which case Citi would have to sell or 
purchase the financial instruments at prevailing market prices. 
Credit risk is reduced to the extent that an exchange or 
clearing organization acts as a counterparty to the transaction 
and replaces the broker, dealer or customer in question.

Citi seeks to protect itself from the risks associated with 

customer activities by requiring customers to maintain margin 
collateral in compliance with regulatory and internal 
guidelines. Margin levels are monitored daily, and customers 
deposit additional collateral as required. Where customers 
cannot meet collateral requirements, Citi may liquidate 
sufficient underlying financial instruments to bring the 
customer into compliance with the required margin level.

Exposure to credit risk is impacted by market volatility, 

which may impair the ability of clients to satisfy their 
obligations to Citi. Credit limits are established and closely 
monitored for customers and for brokers and dealers engaged 
in forwards, futures and other transactions deemed to be credit 
sensitive.

(1) The Company invests in mortgage- and asset-backed securities, which are typically issued by VIEs through securitization transactions. The Company’s maximum 

exposure to loss from these VIEs is equal to the carrying amount of the securities, which is reflected in the table above. For mortgage- and asset-backed 
securitizations in which the Company has other involvement, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

At December 31, 2021, the amortized cost of fixed 
income securities exceeded their fair value by $2,352 million. 
Of the $2,352 million, $1,895 million represented unrealized 
losses on fixed income investments that have been in a gross-
unrealized-loss position for less than a year and, of these, 77% 
were rated investment grade; and $457 million represented 
unrealized losses on fixed income investments that have been 
in a gross-unrealized-loss position for a year or more and, of 
these, 99% were rated investment grade. Of the $457 million, 
$197 million represents foreign government securities.

from these VIEs is equal to the carrying amount of the securities, which is reflected in the table above. For mortgage- and asset-backed securitizations in which the

In February 2021, the Company transferred $237 million of state and municipal bonds from AFS classification to HTM classification in accordance with ASC 
320. At the time of transfer, the securities were in an unrealized gain position of $14 million. The gain amounts will remain in AOCI and will be amortized over 
the remaining life of the securities.
In August 2020, Citibank transferred $13.1 billion of investments in U.S. Treasury securities from AFS classification to HTM classification in accordance with 
ASC 320. At the time of transfer, the securities were in an unrealized gain position of $144 million. The gain amounts will remain in AOCI and will be amortized

date and par value of the same debt securities. 

The Company has the positive intent and ability to hold 

these securities to maturity or, where applicable, until the 
exercise of any issuer call option, absent any unforeseen 
significant changes in circumstances, including deterioration 
in credit or changes in regulatory capital requirements.

The net unrealized losses classified in AOCI for HTM 
debt securities primarily relate to debt securities previously 
classified as AFS that were transferred to HTM, and include 
any cumulative fair value hedge adjustments. The net 
unrealized loss amount also includes any non-credit-related 
changes in fair value of HTM debt securities that have 
suffered credit impairment recorded in earnings. The AOCI 
balance related to HTM debt securities is amortized as an 
adjustment of yield, in a manner consistent with the accretion

Evaluating Investments for Impairment

AFS Debt Securities

Overview—AFS Debt Securities
The Company conducts periodic reviews of all AFS debt 
securities with unrealized losses to evaluate whether the 
impairment resulted from expected credit losses or from other 
factors and to evaluate the Company’s intent to sell such 
securities.

An AFS debt security is impaired when the current fair 

value of an individual AFS debt security is less than its 
amortized cost basis.

The Company recognizes the entire difference between 
amortized cost basis and fair value in earnings for impaired 
AFS debt securities that Citi has an intent to sell or for which 
Citi believes it will more-likely-than-not be required to sell 
prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis. However, for 
those AFS debt securities that the Company does not intend to 
sell and is not likely to be required to sell, only the credit-
related impairment is recognized in earnings by recording an 
allowance for credit losses. Any remaining fair value decline 
for such securities is recorded in AOCI. The Company does 
not consider the length of time that the fair value of a security 
is below its amortized cost when determining if a credit loss 
exists.

For AFS debt securities, credit losses exist where Citi 
does not expect to receive contractual principal and interest 
cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis 
of a security. The allowance for credit losses is limited to the 
amount by which the AFS debt security’s amortized cost basis 
exceeds its fair value. The allowance is increased or decreased 
if credit conditions subsequently worsen or improve. Reversals 
of credit losses are recognized in earnings.

The Company’s review for impairment of AFS debt 

securities generally entails:

•
•

•

identification and evaluation of impaired investments;
consideration of evidential matter, including an evaluation 
of factors or triggers that could cause individual positions 
to qualify as credit impaired and those that would not 
support credit impairment; and
documentation of the results of these analyses, as required 
under business policies.

The sections below describe the Company’s process for 
identifying expected credit impairments for debt security types 
that have the most significant unrealized losses as of 
December 31, 2021.

Mortgage-Backed Securities
Citi records no allowances for credit losses on U.S. 
government-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities, 
because the Company expects to incur no credit losses in the 
event of default due to a history of incurring no credit losses 
and due to the nature of the counterparties.

State and Municipal Securities
The process for estimating credit losses in Citigroup’s AFS 
state and municipal bonds is primarily based on a credit 
analysis that incorporates third-party credit ratings. Citi 
monitors the bond issuers and any insurers providing default 
protection in the form of financial guarantee insurance. The 
average external credit rating, disregarding any insurance, is 
Aa2/AA. In the event of an external rating downgrade or other 
indicator of credit impairment (i.e., based on instrument-
specific estimates of cash flows or probability of issuer 
default), the subject bond is specifically reviewed for adverse 
changes in the amount or timing of expected contractual 
principal and interest payments.

For AFS state and municipal bonds with unrealized losses 

that Citi plans to sell or would more-likely-than-not be 
required to sell, the full impairment is recognized in earnings. 
For AFS state and municipal bonds where Citi has no intent to 
sell and it is more-likely-than-not that the Company will not 
be required to sell, Citi records an allowance for expected 
credit losses for the amount it expects not to collect, capped at 
the difference between the bond’s amortized cost basis and 
fair value.

Equity Method Investments
Management assesses equity method investments that have 
fair values that are less than their respective carrying values 
for other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). Fair value is 
measured as price multiplied by quantity if the investee has 
publicly listed securities. If the investee is not publicly listed, 
other methods are used (see Note 24 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements).

For impaired equity method investments that Citi plans to 

sell prior to recovery of value or would more-likely-than-not 
be required to sell, with no expectation that the fair value will 
recover prior to the expected sale date, the full impairment is 
recognized as OTTI in Other revenue regardless of severity 
and duration. The measurement of the OTTI does not include 
partial projected recoveries subsequent to the balance sheet 
date.

For impaired equity method investments that management 

does not plan to sell and is not more-likely-than-not to be 
required to sell prior to recovery of value, the evaluation of 
whether an impairment is other-than-temporary is based on 
(i) whether and when an equity method investment will 
recover in value and (ii) whether the investor has the intent 
and ability to hold that investment for a period of time 
sufficient to recover the value. The determination of whether 
the impairment is considered other-than-temporary considers 
the following indicators:

•

•

•

the cause of the impairment and the financial condition 
and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any 
specific events that may influence the operations of the 
issuer;
the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of 
time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in 
market value; and
the length of time and extent to which fair value has been 
less than the carrying value.

Non-Marketable Equity Securities Not Carried at 
Fair Value
Non-marketable equity securities are required to be measured 
at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
unless (i) the measurement alternative is elected or (ii) the 
investment represents Federal Reserve Bank and Federal 
Home Loan Bank stock or certain exchange seats that continue 
to be carried at cost. 

The election to measure a non-marketable equity security 

using the measurement alternative is made on an instrument-
by-instrument basis. Under the measurement alternative, an 
equity security is carried at cost plus or minus changes 
resulting from observable prices in orderly transactions for the 
identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The 
carrying value of the equity security is adjusted to fair value 
on the date of an observed transaction. Fair value may differ 
from the observed transaction price due to a number of factors, 
including marketability adjustments and differences in rights 
and obligations when the observed transaction is not for the 
identical investment held by Citi.

Equity securities under the measurement alternative are 

also assessed for impairment. On a quarterly basis, 
management qualitatively assesses whether each equity 
security under the measurement alternative is impaired. 
Impairment indicators that are considered include, but are not 
limited to, the following:

•

•

•

•

•

a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, 
credit rating, asset quality or business prospects of the 
investee;
a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic 
or technological environment of the investee;
a significant adverse change in the general market 
condition of either the geographical area or the industry in 
which the investee operates;
a bona fide offer to purchase, an offer by the investee to 
sell or a completed auction process for the same or similar 
investment for an amount less than the carrying amount of 
that investment; and
factors that raise significant concerns about the investee’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, such as negative 
cash flows from operations, working capital deficiencies 
or noncompliance with statutory capital requirements or 
debt covenants.

When the qualitative assessment indicates that 
impairment exists, the investment is written down to fair 
value, with the full difference between the fair value of the 
investment and its carrying amount recognized in earnings.
Below is the carrying value of non-marketable equity 
securities measured using the measurement alternative at 
December 31, 2021 and 2020:

Investments in Alternative Investment Funds That 
Calculate Net Asset Value
The Company holds investments in certain alternative 
investment funds that calculate net asset value (NAV), or its 
equivalent, including private equity funds, funds of funds and 
real estate funds, as provided by third-party asset managers. 
Investments in such funds are generally classified as non-
marketable equity securities carried at fair value. The fair 
values of these investments are estimated using the NAV of 
the Company’s ownership interest in the funds. Some of these 
investments are in “covered funds” for purposes of the 

Volcker Rule, which prohibits certain proprietary investment 
activities and limits the ownership of, and relationships with, 
covered funds. On April 21, 2017, Citi’s request for extension 
of the permitted holding period under the Volcker Rule for 
certain of its investments in illiquid funds was approved, 
allowing the Company to hold such investments until the 
earlier of five years from the July 21, 2017 expiration date of 
the general conformance period or the date such investments 
mature or are otherwise conformed with the Volcker Rule.

(1) Private equity funds include funds that invest in infrastructure, emerging markets and venture capital.
(2) With respect to the Company’s investments in private equity funds and real estate funds, distributions from each fund will be received as the underlying assets 
held by these funds are liquidated. It is estimated that the underlying assets of these funds will be liquidated over a period of several years as market conditions 
allow. Private equity and real estate funds do not allow redemption of investments by their investors. Investors are permitted to sell or transfer their investments, 
subject to the approval of the general partner or investment manager of these funds, which generally may not be unreasonably withheld.
Includes several real estate funds that invest primarily in commercial real estate in the U.S., Europe and Asia.

The policy for re-aging modified U.S. consumer loans to 

current status varies by product. Generally, one of the 
conditions to qualify for these modifications is that a 
minimum number of payments (typically ranging from one to 
three) be made. Upon modification, the loan is re-aged to 
current status. However, re-aging practices for certain open-
ended consumer loans, such as credit cards, are governed by 
Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) 
guidelines. For open-ended consumer loans subject to FFIEC 
guidelines, one of the conditions for a loan to be re-aged to 
current status is that at least three consecutive minimum 
monthly payments, or the equivalent amount, must be 
received. In addition, under FFIEC guidelines, the number of 
times that such a loan can be re-aged is subject to limitations 
(generally once in 12 months and twice in five years). 

Furthermore, FHA and Department of Veterans Affairs 

(VA) loans are modified under those respective agencies’ 
guidelines and payments are not always required in order to 
re-age a modified loan to current.

14.  LOANS

Citigroup loans are reported in two categories: consumer and 
corporate. These categories are classified primarily according 
to the operating segment and business that manage the loans.

Consumer Loans
Consumer loans represent loans and leases managed primarily 
by GCB and Corporate/Other. 

Citigroup has established a risk management process to 
monitor, evaluate and manage the principal risks associated 
with its consumer loan portfolio. Credit quality indicators that 
are actively monitored include delinquency status, consumer 
credit scores under Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) and loan to 
value (LTV) ratios, each as discussed in more detail below.

Delinquency Status
Delinquency status is monitored and considered a key 
indicator of credit quality of consumer loans. Principally, the 
U.S. residential first mortgage loans use the Mortgage Bankers 
Association (MBA) method of reporting delinquencies, which 
considers a loan delinquent if a monthly payment has not been 
received by the end of the day immediately preceding the 
loan’s next due date. All other loans use a method of reporting 
delinquencies that considers a loan delinquent if a monthly 
payment has not been received by the close of business on the 
loan’s next due date.

As a general policy, residential first mortgages, home 
equity loans and installment loans are classified as non-accrual 
when loan payments are 90 days contractually past due. Credit 
cards and unsecured revolving loans generally accrue interest 
until payments are 180 days past due. Home equity loans in 
regulated bank entities are classified as non-accrual if the 
related residential first mortgage is 90 days or more past due. 
Mortgage loans, other than Federal Housing Administration 
(FHA)-insured loans, are classified as non-accrual within 60 
days of notification that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy.

Includes $12 million and $14 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, of residential first mortgages recorded at fair value.

(1) Loans less than 30 days past due are presented as current.
(2)
(3) Excludes loans guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies.
(4) Loans modified under Citi’s consumer relief programs continue to be reported in the same delinquency bucket they were in at the time of modification. Most 

modified loans in North America would not be reported as 30–89 or 90+ days past due for the duration of the programs (which have various durations, and certain 
of which may be renewed by the customer). Consumer relief programs in Asia and Mexico largely expired during the fourth quarter of 2020 and began to age at 
that time.

(5) Consists of loans that are guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies that are 30–89 days past due of $0.1 billion and $0.2 billion and 90 days or more 

past due of $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Includes approximately $0.1 billion and $0.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, of residential first mortgage loans in process of foreclosure.
Includes approximately $0.1 billion and $0.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, of home equity loans in process of foreclosure.

(6) North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Mexico is included in offices outside North America.
(7)
(8)
(9) Fixed-rate home equity loans and loans extended under home equity lines of credit, which are typically in junior lien positions.
(10) Consumer loans are net of unearned income of $659 million and $749 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Unearned income on consumer loans 

primarily represents unamortized origination fees and costs, premiums and discounts.

Consumer Credit Scores (FICO)
In the U.S., independent credit agencies rate an individual’s 
risk for assuming debt based on the individual’s credit history 
and assign every consumer a Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) 
credit score. These scores are continually updated by the 
agencies based upon an individual’s credit actions (e.g., taking 
out a loan or missed or late payments).

The following tables provide details on the FICO scores 
for Citi’s U.S. consumer loan portfolio based on end-of-period 
receivables by year of origination. FICO scores are updated 
monthly for substantially all of the portfolio or, otherwise, on 
a quarterly basis for the remaining portfolio.

(1) The FICO bands in the tables are consistent with general industry peer presentations.
(2) FICO scores are updated on either a monthly or quarterly basis. For updates that are made only quarterly, certain current-period loans by year of origination are 
greater than those disclosed in the prior periods. Loans that did not have FICO scores as of the prior period have been updated with FICO scores as they become 
available.

(3) Excludes $517 million and $572 million of balances related to Canada for December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

Loan to Value (LTV) Ratios
LTV ratios (loan balance divided by appraised value) are 
calculated at origination and updated by applying market price 
data.

The following tables provide details on the LTV ratios for 

Citi’s U.S. consumer mortgage portfolios by year of 
origination. LTV ratios are updated monthly using the most 
recent Core Logic Home Price Index data available for 
substantially all of the portfolio applied at the Metropolitan 
Statistical Area level, if available, or the state level if not. The 
remainder of the portfolio is updated in a similar manner using 
the Federal Housing Finance Agency indices.

Impaired Consumer Loans
A loan is considered impaired when Citi believes it is probable 
that all amounts due according to the original contractual 
terms of the loan will not be collected. Impaired consumer 
loans include non-accrual loans, as well as smaller-balance 
homogeneous loans whose terms have been modified due to 
the borrower’s financial difficulties and where Citi has granted 
a concession to the borrower. These modifications may 

include interest rate reductions and/or principal forgiveness. 
Impaired consumer loans exclude smaller-balance 
homogeneous loans that have not been modified and are 
carried on a non-accrual basis.

The following tables present information about impaired 
consumer loans and interest income recognized on impaired 
consumer loans:

(1) The above tables do not include loan modifications that meet the TDR relief criteria in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) or 

the interagency guidance.

(2) Post-modification balances include past-due amounts that are capitalized at the modification date.
(3) Post-modification balances in North America include $15 million of residential first mortgages to borrowers who have gone through Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the 
year ended December 31, 2021. These amounts include $5 million of residential first mortgages that were newly classified as TDRs during 2021, based on 
previously received OCC guidance.

(4) Represents the portion of contractual loan principal that is non-interest bearing, but still due from the borrower. Such deferred principal is charged off at the time 

of permanent modification to the extent that the related loan balance exceeds the underlying collateral value.

(5) Represents the portion of contractual loan principal that is non-interest bearing and, depending upon borrower performance, eligible for forgiveness.
(6) Represents the portion of contractual loan principal that was forgiven at the time of permanent modification.
(7)  The above tables reflect activity for restructured loans that were considered TDRs during the year.
(8)  Post-modification balances in North America include $13 million of residential first mortgages to borrowers who have gone through Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the 
year ended December 31, 2020. These amounts include $9 million of residential first mortgages that were newly classified as TDRs during 2020, based on

Lease financing 
Citi is a lessor in the power, railcars, shipping and aircraft 
sectors, where the Company has executed operating, direct 
financing and leveraged leases. Citi’s $0.5 billion of lease 
financing receivables, as of December 31, 2021, is composed 
of approximately equal balances of direct financing lease 
receivables and net investments in leveraged leases. Citi uses 
the interest rate implicit in the lease to determine the present 
value of its lease financing receivables. Interest income on 
direct financing and leveraged leases during the year ended 
December 31, 2021 was not material.

The Company’s leases have an average remaining 
maturity of approximately three and a half years. In certain 
cases, Citi obtains residual value insurance from third parties 
and/or the lessee to manage the risk associated with the 
residual value of the leased assets. The receivable related to 
the residual value of the leased assets is $0.2 billion as of 
December 31, 2021, while the amount covered by residual 
value guarantees is nil.

The Company’s operating leases, where Citi is a lessor,

Citi generally does not manage corporate loans on a 
delinquency basis. Corporate loans are identified as impaired 
and placed on a cash (non-accrual) basis when it is 
determined, based on actual experience and a forward-looking 
assessment of the collectability of the loan in full, that the 
payment of interest or principal is doubtful or when interest or 
principal is 90 days past due, except when the loan is well 
collateralized and in the process of collection. Any interest 
accrued on impaired corporate loans and leases is reversed at 
90 days and charged against current earnings, and interest is 
thereafter included in earnings only to the extent actually 
received in cash. When there is doubt regarding the ultimate 
collectability of principal, all cash receipts are thereafter 
applied to reduce the recorded investment in the loan. While 
corporate loans are generally managed based on their 
internally assigned risk rating (see further discussion below), 
the following tables present delinquency information by 
corporate loan type. 

Corporate Loans
Corporate loans represent loans and leases managed by ICG.

(1) North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Mexico is 
included in offices outside North America. The classification between 
offices in North America and outside North America is based on the 
domicile of the booking unit. The difference between the domicile of the 
booking unit and the domicile of the managing unit is not material.

(2) Loans secured primarily by real estate.
(3) Corporate loans are net of unearned income of ($799) million and ($844) 
million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Unearned income 
on corporate loans primarily represents interest received in advance, but 
not yet earned, on loans originated on a discounted basis.

The Company sold and/or reclassified to held-for-sale 
$5.9 billion and $2.2 billion of corporate loans during the 
years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The 
Company did not have significant purchases of corporate loans 
classified as held-for-investment for the years ended 
December 31, 2021 or 2020.

(1) Corporate loans that are 90 days past due are generally classified as non-accrual. Corporate loans are considered past due when principal or interest is 

contractually due but unpaid.

(2) Non-accrual loans generally include those loans that are 90 days or more past due or those loans for which Citi believes, based on actual experience and a forward-

looking assessment of the collectability of the loan in full, that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful.

(3) Loans less than 30 days past due are presented as current.
(4) Total loans include loans at fair value, which are not included in the various delinquency columns. 

Citigroup has a risk management process to monitor, 
evaluate and manage the principal risks associated with its 
corporate loan portfolio. As part of its risk management 
process, Citi assigns numeric risk ratings to its corporate loan 
facilities based on quantitative and qualitative assessments of 
the obligor and facility. These risk ratings are reviewed at least 
annually or more often if material events related to the obligor 
or facility warrant. Factors considered in assigning the risk 
ratings include financial condition of the obligor, qualitative 
assessment of management and strategy, amount and sources 
of repayment, amount and type of collateral and guarantee 
arrangements, amount and type of any contingencies 
associated with the obligor and the obligor’s industry and 
geography.

The obligor risk ratings are defined by ranges of default 

probabilities. The facility risk ratings are defined by ranges of 
loss norms, which are the product of the probability of default 
and the loss given default. The investment-grade rating 
categories are similar to the category BBB-/Baa3 and above as 
defined by S&P and Moody’s. Loans classified according to 
the bank regulatory definitions as special mention, 
substandard, doubtful and loss will have risk ratings within the 
non-investment-grade categories.

(1) Recorded investment in a loan includes net deferred loan fees and costs, unamortized premium or discount, less any direct write-downs.
(2) There were no significant revolving line of credit arrangements that converted to term loans during the year.
(3) Held-for-investment loans are accounted for on an amortized cost basis.
(4)
Includes certain short-term loans with less than one year in tenor.
(5) Other includes installment and other, lease financing and loans to government and official institutions. 
(6) Non-rated private bank loans mainly include mortgage and real estate loans to private banking clients. 
(7) Loans at fair value include loans to commercial and industrial, financial institutions, mortgage and real estate and other.

Impaired collateral-dependent loans and leases, where 
repayment is expected to be provided solely by the sale of the 
underlying collateral with no other available and reliable 
sources of repayment, are written down to the lower of 
carrying value or collateral value, less cost to sell. Cash-basis 
loans are returned to an accrual status when all contractual 
principal and interest amounts are reasonably assured of 
repayment and there is a sustained period of repayment 
performance, generally six months, in accordance with the 
contractual terms of the loan.

(1) The above tables do not include loan modifications that meet the TDR relief criteria in the CARES Act or the interagency guidance.
(2) TDRs involving changes in the amount or timing of principal payments may involve principal forgiveness or deferral of periodic and/or final principal payments. 
Because forgiveness of principal is rare for corporate loans, modifications typically have little to no impact on the loans’ projected cash flows and thus little to no 
impact on the allowance established for the loans. Charge-offs for amounts deemed uncollectible may be recorded at the time of the restructuring or may have 
already been recorded in prior periods such that no charge-off is required at the time of the modification.
(3) TDRs involving changes in the amount or timing of interest payments may involve a below-market interest rate.

The following table presents total corporate loans modified in a TDR as well as those TDRs that defaulted and for which the payment 
default occurred within one year of a permanent modification. Default is defined as 60 days past due, except for classifiably managed

(1)  Goodwill allocated primarily to the Australia and the Philippines consumer banking businesses, which were reclassified as HFS during 2021. See Note 2 to the 

Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment 

test using data as of July 1, 2021, at the level below each 
operating segment (referred to as a reporting unit). The fair 
values of the Company’s reporting units as a percentage of 
their carrying values ranged from approximately 125% to 
153%, resulting in no impairment. While the inherent risk 
related to uncertainty is embedded in the key assumptions 
used in the valuations, the economic and business 
environments continue to evolve as management implements 
its strategic refresh, which includes, among others, the exits of 
consumer businesses in 13 markets in Asia and EMEA, as well 
as the exit of the Mexico consumer, small business and 
middle-market banking operations, and Citi’s implementation 
of its new operating segment and reporting unit structure in the 
first quarter of 2022. If management’s future estimate of key 
economic and market assumptions were to differ from its 
current assumptions, Citi could potentially experience material 
goodwill impairment charges in the future. Citi expects that 
the implementation of its new operating segments and 
reporting units in the first quarter of 2022, as well as the 
timing and sequencing of the sales of its Asia consumer 
banking businesses, may result in goodwill impairment. 
For additional information regarding Citi’s goodwill 
impairment testing process, see the following Notes to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements: Note 1 for Citi’s 
accounting policy for goodwill, and Note 3 for a description of 
Citi’s operating segments.

Borrowings under bank lines of credit may be at interest rates 
based on LIBOR, CD rates, the prime rate or bids submitted 
by the banks. Citigroup pays commitment fees for its lines of 
credit.

Some of Citigroup’s non-bank subsidiaries have credit 
facilities with Citigroup’s subsidiary depository institutions, 
including Citibank. Borrowings under these facilities are 
secured in accordance with Section 23A of the Federal 
Reserve Act.

Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. (CGMHI) has 
borrowing agreements consisting of facilities that CGMHI has 
been advised are available, but where no contractual lending 
obligation exists. These arrangements are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis to ensure flexibility in meeting CGMHI’s short-
term requirements.

interest rate swaps, to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-
rate debt to variable-rate debt. The maturity structure of the 
derivatives generally corresponds to the maturity structure of 
the debt being hedged. In addition, the Company uses other 
derivative contracts to manage the foreign exchange impact of 
certain debt issuances. At December 31, 2021, the Company’s 
overall weighted average interest rate for long-term debt, 
excluding structured notes accounted for at fair value, was 
2.94% on a contractual basis and 3.12% including the effects 
of derivative contracts.

21.  SECURITIZATIONS AND VARIABLE INTEREST 
ENTITIES

Uses of Special Purpose Entities
A special purpose entity (SPE) is an entity designed to fulfill a 
specific limited need of the company that organized it. The 
principal uses of SPEs by Citi are to assist clients in 
securitizing their financial assets and to create investment 
products for clients and to obtain liquidity and optimize capital 
efficiency by securitizing certain of Citi’s financial assets. 
SPEs may be organized in various legal forms, including 
trusts, partnerships or corporations. In a securitization, through 
the SPE’s issuance of debt and equity instruments, certificates, 
commercial paper or other notes of indebtedness, the company 
transferring assets to the SPE converts all (or a portion) of 
those assets into cash before they would have been realized in 
the normal course of business. These issuances are recorded 
on the balance sheet of the SPE, which may or may not be 
consolidated onto the balance sheet of the company that 
organized the SPE.

Investors usually have recourse only to the assets in the 
SPE, but may also benefit from other credit enhancements, 
such as a collateral account, a line of credit or a liquidity 
facility, such as a liquidity put option or asset purchase 
agreement. Because of these enhancements, the SPE issuances 
typically obtain a more favorable credit rating than the 
transferor could obtain for its own debt issuances. This results 
in less expensive financing costs than unsecured debt. The 
SPE may also enter into derivative contracts in order to 
convert the yield or currency of the underlying assets to match 
the needs of the SPE investors or to limit or change the credit 
risk of the SPE. Citigroup may be the provider of certain credit 
enhancements as well as the counterparty to any related 
derivative contracts.

Most of Citigroup’s SPEs are variable interest entities 

(VIEs).

Variable Interest Entities
VIEs are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. Investors that finance the VIE through debt or 
equity interests or other counterparties providing other forms 
of support, such as guarantees, certain fee arrangements or 
certain types of derivative contracts, are variable interest 
holders in the entity.

The variable interest holder, if any, that has a controlling 

financial interest in a VIE is deemed to be the primary 
beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE. 

The Company must evaluate each VIE to understand the 
purpose and design of the entity, the role the Company had in 
the entity’s design and its involvement in the VIE’s ongoing 
activities. The Company then must evaluate which activities 
most significantly impact the economic performance of the 
VIE and who has the power to direct such activities.

For those VIEs where the Company determines that it has 
the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact 
the VIE’s economic performance, the Company must then 
evaluate its economic interests, if any, and determine whether 
it could absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially 
be significant to the VIE. When evaluating whether the 
Company has an obligation to absorb losses that could 
potentially be significant, it considers the maximum exposure 
to such loss without consideration of probability. Such 
obligations could be in various forms, including, but not 
limited to, debt and equity investments, guarantees, liquidity 
agreements and certain derivative contracts.

In various other transactions, the Company may (i) act as 

a derivative counterparty (e.g., interest rate swap, cross-
currency swap or purchaser of credit protection under a credit 
default swap or total return swap where the Company pays the 
total return on certain assets to the SPE), (ii) act as underwriter 
or placement agent, (iii) provide administrative, trustee or 
other services or (iv) make a market in debt securities or other 
instruments issued by VIEs. The Company generally considers 
such involvement, by itself, not to be variable interests and 
thus not an indicator of power or potentially significant 
benefits or losses.

certain venture capital investments made by some of the 
Company’s private equity subsidiaries, as the Company 
accounts for these investments in accordance with the 
Investment Company Audit Guide (codified in ASC 946);
certain investment funds for which the Company provides 
investment management services and personal estate 
trusts for which the Company provides administrative, 
trustee and/or investment management services;
certain third-party sponsored private equity funds to 
which the Company provides secured credit facilities. The 
Company has no decision-making power and does not 
consolidate these funds, some of which may meet the 
definition of a VIE. The Company’s maximum exposure 
to loss is generally limited to a loan or lending-related 
commitment. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the 
Company’s maximum exposure to loss related to these 
deals was $55.6 billion and $57.0 billion, respectively (for 
more information on these positions, see Notes 14 and 26 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements);
certain VIEs structured by third parties in which the 
Company holds securities in inventory, as these 
investments are made on arm’s-length terms; 
certain positions in mortgage- and asset-backed securities 
held by the Company, which are classified as Trading 
account assets or Investments, in which the Company has 
no other involvement with the related securitization entity 
deemed to be significant (for more information on these 
positions, see Notes 13 and 24 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements); 
certain representations and warranties exposures in 
Citigroup residential mortgage securitizations, in which 
the original mortgage loan balances are no longer 
outstanding; and
VIEs such as trust preferred securities trusts used in 
connection with the Company’s funding activities. The 
Company does not have a variable interest in these trusts.

The asset balances for consolidated VIEs represent the 
carrying amounts of the assets consolidated by the Company. 
The carrying amount may represent the amortized cost or the 
current fair value of the assets depending on the classification 
of the asset (e.g., loan or security) and the associated 
accounting model ascribed to that classification.

The asset balances for unconsolidated VIEs in which the 

Company has significant involvement represent the most 
current information available to the Company. In most cases, 
the asset balances represent an amortized cost basis without 
regard to impairments, unless fair value information is readily 
available to the Company.

The maximum funded exposure represents the balance 
sheet carrying amount of the Company’s investment in the 
VIE. It reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the VIE, 
adjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal payments 
received. The carrying amount may also be adjusted for 
increases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value 
recognized in earnings. The maximum exposure of unfunded 
positions represents the remaining undrawn committed 
amount, including liquidity and credit facilities provided by 
the Company or the notional amount of a derivative 
instrument considered to be a variable interest. In certain 
transactions, the Company has entered into derivative 
instruments or other arrangements that are not considered 
variable interests in the VIE (e.g., interest rate swaps, cross-
currency swaps or where the Company is the purchaser of 
credit protection under a credit default swap or total return 
swap where the Company pays the total return on certain 
assets to the SPE). Receivables under such arrangements are 
not included in the maximum exposure amounts.

Consolidated VIEs
The Company engages in on-balance sheet securitizations, 
which are securitizations that do not qualify for sales 
treatment; thus, the assets remain on Citi’s Consolidated 
Balance Sheet, and any proceeds received are recognized as 
secured liabilities. In general, the third-party investors in the 
obligations of consolidated VIEs have legal recourse only to 
the assets of the respective VIEs and do not have such 
recourse to the Company, except where Citi has provided a 
guarantee to the investors or is the counterparty to certain 
derivative transactions involving the VIE. Thus, Citigroup’s 

maximum legal exposure to loss related to consolidated VIEs 
is significantly less than the carrying value of the consolidated 
VIE assets due to outstanding third-party financing. 
Intercompany assets and liabilities are excluded from Citi’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. All VIE assets are restricted from 
being sold or pledged as collateral. The cash flows from these 
assets are the only source used to pay down the associated 
liabilities, which are non-recourse to Citi’s general assets. See 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet for more information about 
these Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities.

Credit Card Securitizations
The Company securitizes credit card receivables through trusts 
established to purchase the receivables. Citigroup transfers 
receivables into the trusts on a non-recourse basis. Credit card 
securitizations are revolving securitizations: as customers pay 
their credit card balances, the cash proceeds are used to 
purchase new receivables and replenish the receivables in the 
trust.

Substantially all of the Company’s credit card 

securitization activity is through two trusts—Citibank Credit 
Card Master Trust (Master Trust) and Citibank Omni Trust 
(Omni Trust), with the substantial majority through the Master 
Trust. These trusts are consolidated entities because, as 

servicer, Citigroup has the power to direct the activities that 
most significantly impact the economic performance of the 
trusts. Citigroup holds a seller’s interest and certain securities 
issued by the trusts, which could result in exposure to 
potentially significant losses or benefits from the trusts. 
Accordingly, the transferred credit card receivables remain on 
Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet with no gain or loss 
recognized. The debt issued by the trusts to third parties is 
included on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

Citi utilizes securitizations as one of the sources of 

funding for its business in North America. The following table 
reflects amounts related to the Company’s securitized credit 
card receivables:

Managed Loans
After securitization of credit card receivables, the Company 
continues to maintain credit card customer account 
relationships and provides servicing for receivables transferred 
to the trusts. As a result, the Company considers the 
securitized credit card receivables to be part of the business it 
manages. As Citigroup consolidates the credit card trusts, all 
managed securitized card receivables are on-balance sheet.

Funding, Liquidity Facilities and Subordinated Interests
As noted above, Citigroup securitizes credit card receivables 
through two securitization trusts—Master Trust and Omni 
Trust. The liabilities of the trusts are included on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet, excluding those retained by 
Citigroup.

Mortgage Securitizations
Citigroup provides a wide range of mortgage loan products to 
a diverse customer base. Once originated, the Company often 
securitizes these loans through the use of VIEs. These VIEs 
are funded through the issuance of trust certificates backed 
solely by the transferred assets. These certificates have the 
same life as the transferred assets. In addition to providing a 
source of liquidity and less expensive funding, securitizing 
these assets also reduces Citi’s credit exposure to the 
borrowers. These mortgage loan securitizations are primarily 
non-recourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future 
credit losses to the purchasers of the securities issued by the 
trust.

Citi’s U.S. consumer mortgage business generally retains 
the servicing rights and in certain instances retains investment 
securities, interest-only strips and residual interests in future 
cash flows from the trusts and also provides servicing for a 
limited number of ICG securitizations. Citi’s ICG business 
may hold investment securities pursuant to credit risk retention 
rules or in connection with secondary market-making 
activities. 

The Company securitizes mortgage loans generally 
through either a U.S. government-sponsored agency, such as 
Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (U.S. agency-
sponsored mortgages), or private label (non-agency-sponsored 

mortgages) securitization. Citi is not the primary beneficiary 
of its U.S. agency-sponsored mortgage securitization entities 
because Citigroup does not have the power to direct the 
activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the 
entities’ economic performance. Therefore, Citi does not 
consolidate these U.S. agency-sponsored mortgage 
securitization entities. Substantially all of the consumer loans 
sold or securitized through non-consolidated trusts by 
Citigroup are U.S. prime residential mortgage loans. Retained 
interests in non-consolidated agency-sponsored mortgage 
securitization trusts are classified as Trading account assets, 
except for MSRs, which are included in Other assets on 
Citigroup’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Citigroup does not consolidate certain non-agency-
sponsored mortgage securitization entities because Citi is 
either not the servicer with the power to direct the significant 
activities of the entity or Citi is the servicer, but the servicing 
relationship is deemed to be a fiduciary relationship; therefore, 
Citi is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the entity.
In certain instances, the Company has (i) the power to 
direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ 
economic performance and (ii) the obligation to either absorb 
losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially 
significant to its non-agency-sponsored mortgage 
securitization entities and, therefore, is the primary beneficiary 
and, thus, consolidates the VIE.

For non-consolidated mortgage securitization entities 
where the transfer of loans to the VIE meets the conditions for 
sale accounting, Citi recognizes a gain or loss based on the 
difference between the carrying value of the transferred assets 
and the proceeds received (generally cash but may be 
beneficial interests or servicing rights).

Agency and non-agency securitization gains for the year 

ended December 31, 2021 were $3.9 million and $493.4

Agency and non-agency securitization gains for the year 

ended December 31, 2020 were $88.4 million and $139.4

Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)
In connection with the securitization of mortgage loans, Citi’s 
U.S. consumer mortgage business generally retains the 
servicing rights, which entitle the Company to a future stream 
of cash flows based on the outstanding principal balances of 
the loans and the contractual servicing fee. Failure to service 
the loans in accordance with contractual requirements may 
lead to a termination of the servicing rights and the loss of 
future servicing fees.

These transactions create intangible assets referred to as 

MSRs, which are recorded at fair value on Citi’s Consolidated 
Balance Sheet. The fair value of Citi’s capitalized MSRs was 
$404 million and $336 million at December 31, 2021 and 
2020, respectively. The MSRs correspond to principal loan 
balances of $47 billion and $53 billion as of December 31, 
2021 and 2020, respectively. 

The following table summarizes the changes in 

capitalized MSRs:

(1)  Represents changes due to customer payments and passage of time.

The fair value of the MSRs is primarily affected by 
changes in prepayments of mortgages that result from shifts in 
mortgage interest rates. Specifically, higher interest rates tend 
to lead to declining prepayments, which causes the fair value 
of the MSRs to increase. In managing this risk, Citigroup 
economically hedges a significant portion of the value of its 
MSRs through the use of interest rate derivative contracts, 
forward purchase and sale commitments of mortgage-backed 
securities and purchased securities, all classified as Trading 
account assets. 

The Company receives fees during the course of servicing 

previously securitized mortgages. The amounts of these fees

Re-securitizations
The Company engages in re-securitization transactions in 
which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for 
new beneficial interests. Citi did not transfer non-agency 
(private label) securities to re-securitization entities during the 

242

years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. These securities are 
backed by either residential or commercial mortgages and are 
often structured on behalf of clients. 

As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, Citi 

held no retained interests in private label re-securitization 
transactions structured by Citi. 

The Company also re-securitizes U.S. government-

agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed (agency) securities. 
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Citi 
transferred agency securities with a fair value of 
approximately $46.6 billion and $42.8 billion, respectively, to 
re-securitization entities. 

As of December 31, 2021, the fair value of Citi-retained 
interests in agency re-securitization transactions structured by 
Citi totaled approximately $1.2 billion (including $641 million 
related to re-securitization transactions executed in 2021) 
compared to $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2020 (including 
$916 million related to re-securitization transactions executed 
in 2020), which is recorded in Trading account assets. The 
original fair values of agency re-securitization transactions in 
which Citi holds a retained interest as of December 31, 2021 
and 2020 were approximately $78.4 billion and $83.6 billion, 
respectively.

As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not 

consolidate any private label or agency re-securitization 
entities.

Citi-Administered Asset-Backed Commercial Paper 
Conduits
The Company is active in the asset-backed commercial paper 
conduit business as administrator of several multi-seller 
commercial paper conduits and also as a service provider to 
single-seller and other commercial paper conduits sponsored 
by third parties.

Citi’s multi-seller commercial paper conduits are 

designed to provide the Company’s clients access to low-cost 
funding in the commercial paper markets. The conduits 
purchase assets from or provide financing facilities to clients 
and are funded by issuing commercial paper to third-party 
investors. The conduits generally do not purchase assets 
originated by Citi. The funding of the conduits is facilitated by 
the liquidity support and credit enhancements provided by the 
Company.

As administrator to Citi’s conduits, the Company is 
generally responsible for selecting and structuring assets 
purchased or financed by the conduits, making decisions 
regarding the funding of the conduits, including determining 
the tenor and other features of the commercial paper issued, 
monitoring the quality and performance of the conduits’ assets 
and facilitating the operations and cash flows of the conduits. 
In return, the Company earns structuring fees from customers 
for individual transactions and earns an administration fee 
from the conduit, which is equal to the income from the client 
program and liquidity fees of the conduit after payment of 
conduit expenses. This administration fee is fairly stable, since 
most risks and rewards of the underlying assets are passed 
back to the clients. Once the asset pricing is negotiated, most 
ongoing income, costs and fees are relatively stable as a 
percentage of the conduit’s size.

 
 
 
 
 
 
The conduits administered by Citi do not generally invest 
in liquid securities that are formally rated by third parties. The 
assets are privately negotiated and structured transactions that 
are generally designed to be held by the conduit, rather than 
actively traded and sold. The yield earned by the conduit on 
each asset is generally tied to the rate on the commercial paper 
issued by the conduit, thus passing interest rate risk to the 
client. Each asset purchased by the conduit is structured with 
transaction-specific credit enhancement features provided by 
the third-party client seller, including over-collateralization, 
cash and excess spread collateral accounts, direct recourse or 
third-party guarantees. These credit enhancements are sized 
with the objective of approximating a credit rating of A or 
above, based on Citi’s internal risk ratings. At December 31, 
2021 and 2020, the commercial paper conduits administered 
by Citi had approximately $14.0 billion and $16.7 billion of 
purchased assets outstanding, respectively, and had 
incremental funding commitments with clients of 
approximately $18.3 billion and $17.1 billion, respectively.
Substantially all of the funding of the conduits is in the 

form of short-term commercial paper. At December 31, 2021 
and 2020, the weighted average remaining lives of the 
commercial paper issued by the conduits were approximately 
70 and 54 days, respectively. 

The primary credit enhancement provided to the conduit 

investors is in the form of transaction-specific credit 
enhancements described above. Each asset purchased by the 
conduit is structured with transaction-specific credit 
enhancement features provided by the third-party client seller, 
including over-collateralization, cash and excess spread 
collateral accounts, direct recourse or third-party guarantees. 
These credit enhancements are sized with the objective of 
approximating a credit rating of A or above, based on Citi’s 
internal risk ratings. In addition to the transaction-specific 
credit enhancements, the conduits, other than the government- 
guaranteed loan conduit, have obtained letters of credit from 
the Company, which equal at least 8% to 10% of the conduit’s 
assets with a minimum of $200 million. The letters of credit 
provided by the Company to the conduits total approximately 
$1.3 billion as of December 31, 2021 and $1.5 billion as of 
December 31, 2020. The net result across multi-seller conduits 
administered by the Company is that, in the event that 
defaulted assets exceed the transaction-specific credit 
enhancements described above, any losses in each conduit are 
allocated first to the Company and then to the commercial 
paper investors.

Citigroup also provides the conduits with two forms of 
liquidity agreements that are used to provide funding to the 
conduits in the event of a market disruption, among other 
events. Each asset of the conduits is supported by a 
transaction-specific liquidity facility in the form of an asset 
purchase agreement (APA). Under the APA, the Company has 
generally agreed to purchase non-defaulted eligible 
receivables from the conduit at par. The APA is not designed 
to provide credit support to the conduit, as it generally does 
not permit the purchase of defaulted or impaired assets. Any 
funding under the APA will likely subject the underlying 
conduit clients to increased interest costs. In addition, the 
Company provides the conduits with program-wide liquidity 
in the form of short-term lending commitments. Under these 

243

commitments, the Company has agreed to lend to the conduits 
in the event of a short-term disruption in the commercial paper 
market, subject to specified conditions. The Company receives 
fees for providing both types of liquidity agreements and 
considers these fees to be on fair market terms.

Finally, Citi is one of several named dealers in the 
commercial paper issued by the conduits and earns a market-
based fee for providing such services. Along with third-party 
dealers, the Company makes a market in the commercial paper 
and may from time to time fund commercial paper pending 
sale to a third party. On specific dates with less liquidity in the 
market, the Company may hold in inventory commercial paper 
issued by conduits administered by the Company, as well as 
conduits administered by third parties. Separately, in the 
normal course of business, Citi purchases commercial paper, 
including commercial paper issued by Citigroup's conduits. At 
December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company owned $4.9 
billion and $6.6 billion, respectively, of the commercial paper 
issued by its administered conduits. The Company’s 
investments were not driven by market illiquidity and the 
Company is not obligated under any agreement to purchase 
the commercial paper issued by the conduits.

The asset-backed commercial paper conduits are 
consolidated by Citi. The Company has determined that, 
through its roles as administrator and liquidity provider, it has 
the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact 
the entities’ economic performance. These powers include its 
ability to structure and approve the assets purchased by the 
conduits, its ongoing surveillance and credit mitigation 
activities, its ability to sell or repurchase assets out of the 
conduits and its liability management. In addition, as a result 
of all the Company’s involvement described above, it was 
concluded that Citi has an economic interest that could 
potentially be significant. However, the assets and liabilities of 
the conduits are separate and apart from those of Citigroup. 
No assets of any conduit are available to satisfy the creditors 
of Citigroup or any of its other subsidiaries.

Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs)
A collateralized loan obligation (CLO) is a VIE that purchases 
a portfolio of assets consisting primarily of non-investment 
grade corporate loans. CLOs issue multiple tranches of debt 
and equity to investors to fund the asset purchases and pay 
upfront expenses associated with forming the CLO. A third-
party asset manager is contracted by the CLO to purchase the 
underlying assets from the open market and monitor the credit 
risk associated with those assets. Over the term of a CLO, the 
asset manager directs purchases and sales of assets in a 
manner consistent with the CLO’s asset management 
agreement and indenture. In general, the CLO asset manager 
will have the power to direct the activities of the entity that 
most significantly impact the economic performance of the 
CLO. Investors in a CLO, through their ownership of debt 
and/or equity in it, can also direct certain activities of the 
CLO, including removing its asset manager under limited 
circumstances, optionally redeeming the notes, voting on 
amendments to the CLO’s operating documents and other 
activities. A CLO has a finite life, typically 12 years.

Citi serves as a structuring and placement agent with 
respect to the CLOs. Typically, the debt and equity of the 

CLOs are sold to third-party investors. On occasion, certain 
Citi entities may purchase some portion of a CLO’s liabilities 
for investment purposes. In addition, Citi may purchase, 
typically in the secondary market, certain securities issued by 
the CLOs to support its market-making activities.

The Company generally does not have the power to direct 

the activities that most significantly impact the economic 
performance of the CLOs, as this power is generally held by a 
third-party asset manager of the CLO. As such, those CLOs 
are not consolidated.

Asset-Based Financing
The Company provides loans and other forms of financing to 
VIEs that hold assets. Those loans are subject to the same 
credit approvals as all other loans originated or purchased by 
the Company. Financings in the form of debt securities or 
derivatives are, in most circumstances, reported in Trading 
account assets and accounted for at fair value through 
earnings. The Company generally does not have the power to 
direct the activities that most significantly impact these VIEs’ 
economic performance; thus, it does not consolidate them.

The primary types of Citi’s asset-based financings, total 

assets of the unconsolidated VIEs with significant 
involvement and Citi’s maximum exposure to loss are shown 
below. For Citi to realize the maximum loss, the VIE 
(borrower) would have to default with no recovery from the 
assets held by the VIE.

Municipal Securities Tender Option Bond (TOB) Trusts
Municipal TOB trusts may hold fixed- or floating-rate, taxable 
or tax-exempt securities issued by state and local governments 
and municipalities. TOB trusts are typically structured as 
single-issuer entities whose assets are purchased from either 
the Company or from other investors in the municipal 
securities market. TOB trusts finance the purchase of their 
municipal assets by issuing two classes of certificates: long-
dated, floating rate certificates (“Floaters”) that are putable 
pursuant to a liquidity facility and residual interest certificates 
(“Residuals”). The Floaters are purchased by third-party 
investors, typically tax-exempt money market funds. The 
Residuals are purchased by the original owner of the 
municipal securities that are being financed.

From Citigroup’s perspective, there are two types of TOB 

trusts: customer and non-customer. Customer TOB trusts are 
those trusts utilized by customers of the Company to finance 
their securities, generally municipal securities. The Residuals 
issued by these trusts are purchased by the customer being 
financed. Non-customer TOB trusts are generally used by the 
Company to finance its own municipal securities investments; 
the Residuals issued by non-customer TOB trusts are 
purchased by the Company.

With respect to both customer and non-customer TOB 
trusts, Citi may provide remarketing agent services. If Floaters 
are optionally tendered and the Company, in its role as 
remarketing agent, is unable to find a new investor to purchase 
the optionally tendered Floaters within a specified period of 
time, Citigroup may, but is not obligated to, purchase the 
tendered Floaters into its own inventory. The level of the 
Company’s inventory of such Floaters fluctuates. 

For certain customer TOB trusts, Citi may also serve as a 

voluntary advance provider. In this capacity, the Company 
may, but is not obligated to, make loan advances to customer 
TOB trusts to purchase optionally tendered Floaters that have 
not otherwise been successfully remarketed to new investors. 
Such loans are secured by pledged Floaters. As of 
December 31, 2021, Citi had no outstanding voluntary 
advances to customer TOB trusts.

For certain non-customer trusts, the Company also 

provides credit enhancement. At December 31, 2021 and 
2020, none of the municipal bonds owned by non-customer 
TOB trusts were subject to a credit guarantee provided by the 
Company.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Citigroup also provides liquidity services to many 
customer and non-customer trusts. If a trust is unwound early 
due to an event other than a credit event on the underlying 
municipal bonds, the underlying municipal bonds are sold out 
of the trust and bond sale proceeds are used to redeem the 
outstanding trust certificates. If this results in a shortfall 
between the bond sale proceeds and the redemption price of 
the tendered Floaters, the Company, pursuant to the liquidity 
agreement, would be obligated to make a payment to the trust 
to satisfy that shortfall. For certain customer TOB trusts, 
Citigroup has also executed a reimbursement agreement with 
the holder of the Residual, pursuant to which the Residual 
holder is obligated to reimburse the Company for any payment 
the Company makes under the liquidity arrangement. These 
reimbursement agreements may be subject to daily margining 
based on changes in the market value of the underlying 
municipal bonds. In cases where a third party provides 
liquidity to a non-customer TOB trust, a similar 
reimbursement arrangement may be executed, whereby the 
Company (or a consolidated subsidiary of the Company), as 
Residual holder, would absorb any losses incurred by the 
liquidity provider.

For certain other non-customer TOB trusts, Citi serves as 

tender option provider. The tender option provider 
arrangement allows Floater holders to put their interests 
directly to the Company at any time, subject to the requisite 
notice period requirements, at a price of par.

At December 31, 2021 and 2020, liquidity agreements 
provided with respect to customer TOB trusts totaled $1.5 
billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, of which $0.6 billion and 
$0.8 billion, respectively, were offset by reimbursement 
agreements. For the remaining exposure related to TOB 
transactions, where the residual owned by the customer was at 
least 25% of the bond value at the inception of the transaction, 
no reimbursement agreement was executed. 

Citi considers both customer and non-customer TOB 
trusts to be VIEs. Customer TOB trusts are not consolidated 
by the Company, as the power to direct the activities that most 
significantly impact the trust’s economic performance rests 
with the customer Residual holder, which may unilaterally 
cause the sale of the trust’s bonds.

Non-customer TOB trusts generally are consolidated 
because the Company holds the Residual interest and thus has 
the unilateral power to cause the sale of the trust’s bonds.

The Company also provides other liquidity agreements or 

letters of credit to customer-sponsored municipal investment 
funds, which are not variable interest entities, and 
municipality-related issuers that totaled $2 billion as of 
December 31, 2021 and $3.6 billion as of December 31, 2020. 
These liquidity agreements and letters of credit are offset by 
reimbursement agreements with various term-out provisions.

Municipal Investments
Municipal investment transactions include debt and equity 
interests in partnerships that finance the construction and 
rehabilitation of low-income housing, facilitate lending in new 
or underserved markets or finance the construction or 
operation of renewable municipal energy facilities. Citi 
generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and 
earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits and 

245

grants earned from the investments made by the partnership. 
The Company may also provide construction loans or 
permanent loans for the development or operation of real 
estate properties held by partnerships. These entities are 
generally considered VIEs. The power to direct the activities 
of these entities is typically held by the general partner. 
Accordingly, these entities are not consolidated by Citigroup.

Client Intermediation
Client intermediation transactions represent a range of 
transactions designed to provide investors with specified 
returns based on the returns of an underlying security, 
referenced asset or index. These transactions include credit-
linked notes and equity-linked notes. In these transactions, the 
VIE typically obtains exposure to the underlying security, 
referenced asset or index through a derivative instrument, such 
as a total-return swap or a credit-default swap. In turn, the VIE 
issues notes to investors that pay a return based on the 
specified underlying security, referenced asset or index. The 
VIE invests the proceeds in a financial asset or a guaranteed 
insurance contract that serves as collateral for the derivative 
contract over the term of the transaction. The Company’s 
involvement in these transactions includes being the 
counterparty to the VIE’s derivative instruments and investing 
in a portion of the notes issued by the VIE. In certain 
transactions, the investor’s maximum risk of loss is limited 
and the Company absorbs risk of loss above a specified level. 
Citi does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIEs 
that most significantly impact their economic performance and 
thus it does not consolidate them.

Citi’s maximum risk of loss in these transactions is 
defined as the amount invested in notes issued by the VIE and 
the notional amount of any risk of loss absorbed by Citi 
through a separate instrument issued by the VIE. The 
derivative instrument held by the Company may generate a 
receivable from the VIE (e.g., where the Company purchases 
credit protection from the VIE in connection with the VIE’s 
issuance of a credit-linked note), which is collateralized by the 
assets owned by the VIE. These derivative instruments are not 
considered variable interests and any associated receivables 
are not included in the calculation of maximum exposure to 
the VIE.

Investment Funds
The Company is the investment manager for certain 
investment funds and retirement funds that invest in various 
asset classes including private equity, hedge funds, real estate, 
fixed income and infrastructure. Citigroup earns a 
management fee, which is a percentage of capital under 
management, and may earn performance fees. In addition, for 
some of these funds the Company has an ownership interest in 
the investment funds. Citi has also established a number of 
investment funds as opportunities for qualified colleagues to 
invest in private equity investments. The Company acts as 
investment manager for these funds and may provide 
colleagues with financing on both recourse and non-recourse 
bases for a portion of the colleagues’ investment 
commitments.

22.  DERIVATIVES 

In the ordinary course of business, Citigroup enters into 
various types of derivative transactions, which include: 

•

•

•

Futures and forward contracts, which are commitments 
to buy or sell at a future date a financial instrument, 
commodity or currency at a contracted price that may be 
settled in cash or through delivery of an item readily 
convertible to cash.
Swap contracts, which are commitments to settle in cash 
at a future date or dates that may range from a few days to 
a number of years, based on differentials between 
specified indices or financial instruments, as applied to a 
notional principal amount.
Option contracts, which give the purchaser, for a 
premium, the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell 
within a specified time a financial instrument, commodity 
or currency at a contracted price that may also be settled 
in cash, based on differentials between specified indices 
or prices.

Swaps, forwards and some option contracts are over-the-
counter (OTC) derivatives that are bilaterally negotiated with 
counterparties and settled with those counterparties, except for 
swap contracts that are novated and "cleared" through central 
counterparties (CCPs). Futures contracts and other option 
contracts are standardized contracts that are traded on an 
exchange with a CCP as the counterparty from the inception of 
the transaction. Citigroup enters into derivative contracts 
relating to interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and other 
market/credit risks for the following reasons:

•

•

Trading Purposes: Citigroup trades derivatives as an 
active market maker. Citigroup offers its customers 
derivatives in connection with their risk management 
actions to transfer, modify or reduce their interest rate, 
foreign exchange and other market/credit risks or for their 
own trading purposes. Citigroup also manages its 
derivative risk positions through offsetting trade activities, 
controls focused on price verification and daily reporting 
of positions to senior managers.
Hedging: Citigroup uses derivatives in connection with its 
own risk management activities to hedge certain risks or 
reposition the risk profile of the Company. Hedging may 
be accomplished by applying hedge accounting in 
accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or 
by an economic hedge. For example, Citigroup issues 
fixed-rate long-term debt and then enters into a receive-
fixed, pay-variable-rate interest rate swap with the same 
tenor and notional amount to synthetically convert the 
interest payments to a net variable-rate basis. This 
strategy is the most common form of an interest rate 
hedge, as it minimizes net interest cost in certain yield 
curve environments. Derivatives are also used to manage 
market risks inherent in specific groups of on-balance 
sheet assets and liabilities, including AFS securities, 
commodities and borrowings, as well as other interest-
sensitive assets and liabilities. In addition, foreign 
exchange contracts are used to hedge non-U.S.-dollar-

denominated debt, foreign currency-denominated AFS 
securities and net investment exposures. 

Derivatives may expose Citigroup to market, credit or 

liquidity risks in excess of the amounts recorded on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Market risk on a derivative 
product is the exposure created by potential fluctuations in 
interest rates, market prices, foreign exchange rates and other 
factors and is a function of the type of product, the volume of 
transactions, the tenor and terms of the agreement and the 
underlying volatility. Credit risk is the exposure to loss in the 
event of nonperformance by the other party to satisfy a 
derivative liability where the value of any collateral held by 
Citi is not adequate to cover such losses. The recognition in 
earnings of unrealized gains on derivative transactions is 
subject to management’s assessment of the probability of 
counterparty default. Liquidity risk is the potential exposure 
that arises when the size of a derivative position may affect the 
ability to monetize the position in a reasonable period of time 
and at a reasonable cost in periods of high volatility and 
financial stress. 

Derivative transactions are customarily documented under 

industry standard master netting agreements, which provide 
that following an event of default, the non-defaulting party 
may promptly terminate all transactions between the parties 
and determine the net amount due to be paid to, or by, the 
defaulting party. Events of default include (i) failure to make a 
payment on a derivative transaction that remains uncured 
following applicable notice and grace periods, (ii) breach of 
agreement that remains uncured after applicable notice and 
grace periods, (iii) breach of a representation, (iv) cross 
default, either to third-party debt or to other derivative 
transactions entered into between the parties, or, in some 
cases, their affiliates, (v) the occurrence of a merger or 
consolidation that results in the creditworthiness of a party 
becoming materially weaker and (vi) the cessation or 
repudiation of any applicable guarantee or other credit support 
document. Obligations under master netting agreements are 
often secured by collateral posted under an industry standard 
credit support annex to the master netting agreement. An event 
of default may also occur under a credit support annex if a 
party fails to make a collateral delivery that remains uncured 
following applicable notice and grace periods. 

The netting and collateral rights incorporated in the 

master netting agreements are considered to be legally 
enforceable if a supportive legal opinion has been obtained 
from counsel of recognized standing that provides (i) the 
requisite level of certainty regarding enforceability and (ii) 
that the exercise of rights by the non-defaulting party to 
terminate and close-out transactions on a net basis under these 
agreements will not be stayed or avoided under applicable law 
upon an event of default, including bankruptcy, insolvency or 
similar proceeding. 

A legal opinion may not be sought for certain jurisdictions 

where local law is silent or unclear as to the enforceability of 
such rights or where adverse case law or conflicting regulation 
may cast doubt on the enforceability of such rights. In some 
jurisdictions and for some counterparty types, the insolvency 
law may not provide the requisite level of certainty. For 

246

example, this may be the case for certain sovereigns, 
municipalities, central banks and U.S. pension plans. 

Exposure to credit risk on derivatives is affected by 

market volatility, which may impair the ability of 
counterparties to satisfy their obligations to the Company. 
Credit limits are established and closely monitored for 
customers engaged in derivatives transactions. Citi considers 
the level of legal certainty regarding enforceability of its 
offsetting rights under master netting agreements and credit 
support annexes to be an important factor in its risk 
management process. Specifically, Citi generally transacts 
much lower volumes of derivatives under master netting 
agreements where Citi does not have the requisite level of 
legal certainty regarding enforceability, because such 
derivatives consume greater amounts of single counterparty 
credit limits than those executed under enforceable master 
netting agreements. 

Information pertaining to Citigroup’s derivatives 

activities, based on notional amounts, is presented in the table 
below. Derivative notional amounts are reference amounts 
from which contractual payments are derived and do not 
represent a complete measure of Citi’s exposure to derivative 
transactions. Citi’s derivative exposure arises primarily from 
market fluctuations (i.e., market risk), counterparty failure 
(i.e., credit risk) and/or periods of high volatility or financial 
stress (i.e., liquidity risk), as well as any market valuation 
adjustments that may be required on the transactions. 
Moreover, notional amounts do not reflect the netting of 
offsetting trades. For example, if Citi enters into a receive-
fixed interest rate swap with $100 million notional, and offsets 
this risk with an identical but opposite pay-fixed position with 
a different counterparty, $200 million in derivative notionals is 
reported, although these offsetting positions may result in de 
minimis overall market risk. 

Cash collateral and security collateral in the form of G10 

In addition, aggregate derivative notional amounts can 

government debt securities are often posted by a party to a 
master netting agreement to secure the net open exposure of 
the other party; the receiving party is free to commingle/
rehypothecate such collateral in the ordinary course of its 
business. Nonstandard collateral such as corporate bonds, 
municipal bonds, U.S. agency securities and/or MBS may also 
be pledged as collateral for derivative transactions. Security 
collateral posted to open and maintain a master netting 
agreement with a counterparty, in the form of cash and/or 
securities, may from time to time be segregated in an account 
at a third-party custodian pursuant to a tri-party account 
control agreement.

fluctuate from period to period in the normal course of 
business based on Citi’s market share, levels of client activity 
and other factors. All derivatives are recorded in Trading 
account assets/Trading account liabilities on the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet.

(1) Credit derivatives are arrangements designed to allow one party (protection purchaser) to transfer the credit risk of a “reference asset” to another party (protection 
seller). These arrangements allow a protection seller to assume the credit risk associated with the reference asset without directly purchasing that asset. The 
Company enters into credit derivative positions for purposes such as risk management, yield enhancement, reduction of credit concentrations and diversification of 
overall risk.

The following tables present the gross and net fair values 

of the Company’s derivative transactions and the related 
offsetting amounts as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. Gross 
positive fair values are offset against gross negative fair values 
by counterparty, pursuant to enforceable master netting 
agreements. Under ASC 815-10-45, payables and receivables 
in respect of cash collateral received from or paid to a given 
counterparty pursuant to a credit support annex are included in 
the offsetting amount if a legal opinion supporting the 
enforceability of netting and collateral rights has been 
obtained. GAAP does not permit similar offsetting for security 
collateral. 

In addition, the following tables reflect rules adopted by 

clearing organizations that require or allow entities to treat 
certain derivative assets, liabilities and the related variation 
margin as settlement of the related derivative fair values for 
legal and accounting purposes, as opposed to presenting gross 
derivative assets and liabilities that are subject to collateral, 
whereby the counterparties would also record a related 
collateral payable or receivable. As a result, the tables reflect a 
reduction of approximately $340 billion and $280 billion as of 
December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, of derivative 
assets and derivative liabilities that previously would have 
been reported on a gross basis, but are now legally settled and 
not subject to collateral. The tables also present amounts that 
are not permitted to be offset, such as security collateral or 
cash collateral posted at third-party custodians, but which 
would be eligible for offsetting to the extent that an event of 
default has occurred and a legal opinion supporting 
enforceability of the netting and collateral rights has been 
obtained.

consistently throughout the hedging relationships. The 
assessment of effectiveness may exclude changes in the value 
of the hedged item that are unrelated to the risks being hedged 
and the changes in fair value of the derivative associated with 
time value. Citi excludes changes in the cross-currency basis 
associated with cross-currency swaps from the assessment of 
hedge effectiveness and records it in Other comprehensive 
income.

Discontinued Hedge Accounting
A hedging instrument must be highly effective in 
accomplishing the hedge objective of offsetting either changes 
in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item for the risk 
being hedged. Management may voluntarily de-designate an 
accounting hedge at any time, but if a hedging relationship is 
not highly effective, it no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting and must be de-designated. Subsequent changes in 
the fair value of the derivative are recognized in Other revenue 
or Principal transactions, similar to trading derivatives, with 
no offset recorded related to the hedged item.

For fair value hedges, any changes in the fair value of the 
hedged item remain as part of the basis of the asset or liability 
and are ultimately realized as an element of the yield on the 
item. For cash flow hedges, changes in fair value of the end-
user derivative remain in Accumulated other comprehensive 
income (loss) (AOCI) and are included in the earnings of 
future periods when the forecasted hedged cash flows impact 
earnings. However, if it becomes probable that some or all of 
the hedged forecasted transactions will not occur, any amounts 
that remain in AOCI related to these transactions must be 
immediately reflected in Other revenue.

The foregoing criteria are applied on a decentralized 

basis, consistent with the level at which market risk is 
managed, but are subject to various limits and controls. The 
underlying asset, liability or forecasted transaction may be an 
individual item or a portfolio of similar items.

For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, 

amounts recognized in Principal transactions in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income include certain derivatives 
not designated in a qualifying hedging relationship. Citigroup 
presents this disclosure by business classification, showing 
derivative gains and losses related to its trading activities 
together with gains and losses related to non-derivative 
instruments within the same trading portfolios, as this 
represents how these portfolios are risk managed. See Note 6 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further 
information.

The amounts recognized in Other revenue in the 

Consolidated Statement of Income related to derivatives not 
designated in a qualifying hedging relationship are shown 
below. The table below does not include any offsetting gains 
(losses) on the economically hedged items to the extent that 
such amounts are also recorded in Other revenue.

Accounting for Derivative Hedging
Citigroup accounts for its hedging activities in accordance 
with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. As a general rule, 
hedge accounting is permitted where the Company is exposed 
to a particular risk, such as interest rate or foreign exchange 
risk, that causes changes in the fair value of an asset or 
liability or variability in the expected future cash flows of an 
existing asset, liability or a forecasted transaction that may 
affect earnings.

Derivative contracts hedging the risks associated with 
changes in fair value are referred to as fair value hedges, while 
contracts hedging the variability of expected future cash flows 
are cash flow hedges. Hedges that utilize derivatives or debt 
instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated 
with equity investments in non-U.S.-dollar-functional-
currency foreign subsidiaries (net investment in a foreign 
operation) are net investment hedges.

To qualify as an accounting hedge under the hedge 
accounting rules (versus an economic hedge where hedge 
accounting is not applied), a hedging relationship must be 
highly effective in offsetting the risk designated as being 
hedged. The hedging relationship must be formally 
documented at inception, detailing the particular risk 
management objective and strategy for the hedge. This 
includes the item and risk(s) being hedged, the hedging 
instrument being used and how effectiveness will be assessed. 
The effectiveness of these hedging relationships is evaluated at 
hedge inception and on an ongoing basis both on a 
retrospective and prospective basis, typically using 
quantitative measures of correlation, with hedge 
ineffectiveness measured and recorded in current earnings. 
Hedge effectiveness assessment methodologies are performed 
in a similar manner for similar hedges, and are used 

252

 
 
Fair Value Hedges

Hedging of Benchmark Interest Rate Risk
Citigroup’s fair value hedges are primarily hedges of fixed-
rate long-term debt or assets, such as available-for-sale debt 
securities or loans.

For qualifying fair value hedges of interest rate risk, the 
changes in the fair value of the derivative and the change in 
the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk 
are presented within Interest revenue or Interest expense based 
on whether the hedged item is an asset or a liability. 

Citigroup has executed a last-of-layer hedge, which 
permits an entity to hedge the interest rate risk of a stated 
portion of a closed portfolio of prepayable financial assets that 
are expected to remain outstanding for the designated tenor of 
the hedge. In accordance with ASC 815, an entity may exclude 
prepayment risk when measuring the change in fair value of 
the hedged item attributable to interest rate risk under the last-
of-layer approach. Similar to other fair value hedges, where 
the hedged item is an asset, the fair value of the hedged item 
attributable to interest rate risk will be presented in Interest 
revenue along with the change in the fair value of the hedging 
instrument.

Hedging of Foreign Exchange Risk
Citigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to 
foreign exchange rate movements in available-for-sale debt 
securities and long-term debt that are denominated in 
currencies other than the functional currency of the entity 
holding the securities or issuing the debt. The hedging 
instrument is generally a forward foreign exchange contract or 
a cross-currency swap contract. Citigroup considers the 
premium associated with forward contracts (i.e., the 
differential between the spot and contractual forward rates) as 
the cost of hedging; this amount is excluded from the 
assessment of hedge effectiveness and is generally reflected 
directly in earnings over the life of the hedge. Citi also 
excludes changes in cross-currency basis associated with 
cross-currency swaps from the assessment of hedge 
effectiveness and records it in Other comprehensive income.

Hedging of Commodity Price Risk 
Citigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to spot 
price movements in physical commodities inventories. The 
hedging instrument is a futures contract to sell the underlying 
commodity. In this hedge, the change in the value of the 
hedged inventory is reflected in earnings, which offsets the 
change in the fair value of the futures contract that is also 
reflected in earnings. Although the change in the fair value of 
the hedging instrument recorded in earnings includes changes 
in forward rates, Citigroup excludes the differential between 
the spot and the contractual forward rates under the futures 
contract from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, and it is 
generally reflected directly in earnings over the life of the 
hedge. Citi also excludes changes in forward rates from the 
assessment of hedge effectiveness and records it in Other 
comprehensive income.

Cumulative Basis Adjustment
Upon electing to apply ASC 815 fair value hedge accounting, 
the carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted to reflect the 
cumulative changes in the hedged risk. This cumulative hedge 
basis adjustment becomes part of the carrying value of the 
hedged item until the hedged item is derecognized from the 
balance sheet. The table below presents the carrying amount of 
Citi’s hedged assets and liabilities under qualifying fair value 
hedges at December 31, 2021 and 2020, along with the 
cumulative hedge basis adjustments included in the carrying 
value of those hedged assets and liabilities, that would reverse 
through earnings in future periods.

$6 billion as the hedged amount (from a closed portfolio of prepayable 
financial assets with a carrying value of $25 billion as of December 31, 
2021) in a last-of-layer hedging relationship.

(2)  These amounts include a cumulative basis adjustment of $(18) million 
for active hedges and $62 million for de-designated hedges as of 
December 31, 2020, related to certain prepayable financial assets 
previously designated as the hedged item in a fair value hedge using the 
last-of-layer approach. The Company designated approximately $3

financial assets with a carrying value of $19 billion as of December 31, 
2020) in a last-of-layer hedging relationship.

(3)  Carrying amount represents the amortized cost.

255

 
 
Cash Flow Hedges
Citigroup hedges the variability of forecasted cash flows due 
to changes in contractually specified interest rates associated 
with floating-rate assets/liabilities and other forecasted 
transactions. Variable cash flows from those liabilities are 
synthetically converted to fixed-rate cash flows by entering 
into receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps and 
receive-variable, pay-fixed forward-starting interest rate 
swaps. Variable cash flows associated with certain assets are 
synthetically converted to fixed-rate cash flows by entering 
into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. These cash 
flow hedging relationships use either regression analysis or 
dollar-offset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging 
relationships are highly effective at inception and on an 
ongoing basis. 

Citigroup hedges the variability from changes in a 

contractually specified rate and recognizes the entire change in 
fair value of the cash flow hedging instruments in AOCI. The 
full change in the value of the hedging instrument is required 
to be recognized in AOCI, and then recognized in earnings in 
the same period that the cash flows impact earnings. The 
pretax change in AOCI from cash flow hedges is presented 
below:

(1) All amounts reclassified into earnings for interest rate contracts are included in Interest revenue/Interest expense (Net interest income). For all other hedges, the 

amounts reclassified to earnings are included primarily in Other revenue and Net interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 

For cash flow hedges, the entire change in the fair value 

of the hedging derivative is recognized in AOCI and then 
reclassified to earnings in the same period that the forecasted 
hedged cash flows impact earnings. The net gain (loss) 
associated with cash flow hedges expected to be reclassified 
from AOCI within 12 months of December 31, 2021 is 
approximately $614 million. The maximum length of time 
over which forecasted cash flows are hedged is 10 years.
The after-tax impact of cash flow hedges on AOCI is 

shown in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

256

 
 
 
Net Investment Hedges
Consistent with ASC 830-20, Foreign Currency Matters—
Foreign Currency Transactions, ASC 815 allows the hedging 
of the foreign currency risk of a net investment in a foreign 
operation. Citigroup uses foreign currency forwards, cross-
currency swaps, options and foreign currency-denominated 
debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk 
associated with Citigroup’s equity investments in several non-
U.S.-dollar-functional-currency foreign subsidiaries. Citigroup 
records the change in the carrying amount of these 
investments in Foreign currency translation adjustment within 
AOCI. Simultaneously, the effective portion of the hedge of 
this exposure is also recorded in Foreign currency translation 
adjustment and any ineffective portion is immediately 
recorded in earnings.

For derivatives designated as net investment hedges, 
Citigroup follows the forward-rate method outlined in ASC 
815-35-35. According to that method, all changes in fair value, 
including changes related to the forward-rate component of the 
foreign currency forward contracts and the time value of 
foreign currency options, are recorded in Foreign currency 
translation adjustment within AOCI.

For foreign currency-denominated debt instruments that 

are designated as hedges of net investments, the translation 
gain or loss that is recorded in Foreign currency translation 
adjustment is based on the spot exchange rate between the 
functional currency of the respective subsidiary and the U.S. 
dollar, which is the functional currency of Citigroup. To the 
extent that the notional amount of the hedging instrument 
exactly matches the hedged net investment, and the underlying 
exchange rate of the derivative hedging instrument relates to 
the exchange rate between the functional currency of the net 
investment and Citigroup’s functional currency (or, in the case 
of a non-derivative debt instrument, such instrument is 
denominated in the functional currency of the net investment), 
no ineffectiveness is recorded in earnings.

The pretax gain (loss) recorded in Foreign currency 
translation adjustment within AOCI, related to net investment 
hedges, was $855 million, $(600) million and $(569) million 
for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, 
respectively.

Economic Hedges
Citigroup often uses economic hedges when hedge accounting 
would be too complex or operationally burdensome. End-user 
derivatives that are economic hedges are carried at fair value, 
with changes in value included in either Principal transactions 
or Other revenue. 

For asset/liability management hedging, fixed-rate long-

term debt is recorded at amortized cost under GAAP.

For other hedges that either do not meet the ASC 815 
hedging criteria or for which management decides not to apply 
ASC 815 hedge accounting, the derivative is recorded at fair 
value on the balance sheet with the associated changes in fair 
value recorded in earnings, while the debt continues to be 
carried at amortized cost. Therefore, current earnings are 
affected by the interest rate shifts and other factors that cause a 
change in the swap’s value, but for which no offsetting change 
in value is recorded on the debt.

Citigroup may alternatively elect to account for the debt at 

fair value under the fair value option. Once the irrevocable 
election is made upon issuance of the debt, the full change in 
fair value of the debt is reported in earnings. The changes in 
fair value of the related interest rate swap are also reflected in 
earnings, which provides a natural offset to the debt’s fair 
value change. To the extent that the two amounts differ 
because the full change in the fair value of the debt includes 
risks not offset by the interest rate swap, the difference is 
automatically captured in current earnings.

Additional economic hedges include hedges of the credit 
risk component of commercial loans and loan commitments. 
Citigroup periodically evaluates its hedging strategies in other 
areas and may designate either an accounting hedge or an 
economic hedge after considering the relative costs and 
benefits. Economic hedges are also employed when the 
hedged item itself is marked to market through current 
earnings, such as hedges of commitments to originate one- to 
four-family mortgage loans to be HFS and MSRs.

Credit Derivatives
Citi is a market maker and trades a range of credit derivatives. 
Through these contracts, Citi either purchases or writes 
protection on either a single name or a portfolio of reference 
credits. Citi also uses credit derivatives to help mitigate credit 
risk in its corporate and consumer loan portfolios and other 
cash positions and to facilitate client transactions. 

Citi monitors its counterparty credit risk in credit 
derivative contracts. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, 
approximately 99% and 97%, respectively, of the gross 
receivables are from counterparties with which Citi maintains 
master netting agreements, collateral agreements or settles 
daily. A majority of Citi’s top 15 counterparties (by receivable 
balance owed to Citi) are central clearing houses, banks, 
financial institutions or other dealers. Contracts with these 
counterparties do not include ratings-based termination events. 
However, counterparty ratings downgrades may have an 
incremental effect by lowering the threshold at which Citi may 
call for additional collateral. 

The range of credit derivatives entered into includes credit 

default swaps, total return swaps, credit options and credit-
linked notes. 

A credit default swap is a contract in which, for a fee, a 
protection seller agrees to reimburse a protection buyer for any 
losses that occur due to a predefined credit event on a 
reference entity. These credit events are defined by the terms 
of the derivative contract and the reference entity and are 
generally limited to the market standard of failure to pay on 
indebtedness and bankruptcy of the reference entity and, in a 
more limited range of transactions, debt restructuring. Credit 
derivative transactions that reference emerging market entities 
also typically include additional credit events to cover the 
acceleration of indebtedness and the risk of repudiation or a 
payment moratorium. In certain transactions, protection may 
be provided on a portfolio of reference entities or asset-backed 
securities. If there is no credit event, as defined by the specific 
derivative contract, then the protection seller makes no 
payments to the protection buyer and receives only the 
contractually specified fee. However, if a credit event occurs 
as defined in the specific derivative contract sold, the 

257

protection seller will be required to make a payment to the 
protection buyer. Under certain contracts, the seller of 
protection may not be required to make a payment until a 
specified amount of losses has occurred with respect to the 
portfolio and/or may only be required to pay for losses up to a 
specified amount.

A total return swap typically transfers the total economic 

performance of a reference asset, which includes all associated 
cash flows, as well as capital appreciation or depreciation. The 
protection buyer receives a floating rate of interest and any 
depreciation on the reference asset from the protection seller 
and, in return, the protection seller receives the cash flows 
associated with the reference asset plus any appreciation. 
Thus, according to the total return swap agreement, the 
protection seller will be obligated to make a payment any time 
the floating interest rate payment plus any depreciation of the 
reference asset exceeds the cash flows associated with the 
underlying asset. A total return swap may terminate upon a 
default of the reference asset or a credit event with respect to 
the reference entity, subject to the provisions of the related 
total return swap agreement between the protection seller and 
the protection buyer.

A credit option is a credit derivative that allows investors 

to trade or hedge changes in the credit quality of a reference 
entity. For example, in a credit spread option, the option writer 
assumes the obligation to purchase or sell credit protection on 
the reference entity at a specified “strike” spread level. The 
option purchaser buys the right to sell credit default protection 
on the reference entity to, or purchase it from, the option 
writer at the strike spread level. The payments on credit spread 
options depend either on a particular credit spread or the price 
of the underlying credit-sensitive asset or other reference 
entity. The options usually terminate if a credit event occurs 
with respect to the underlying reference entity. 

A credit-linked note is a form of credit derivative 
structured as a debt security with an embedded credit default 
swap. The purchaser of the note effectively provides credit 
protection to the issuer by agreeing to receive a return that 
could be negatively affected by credit events on the underlying 
reference entity. If the reference entity defaults, the note may 
be cash settled or physically settled by delivery of a debt 
security of the reference entity. Thus, the maximum amount of 
the note purchaser’s exposure is the amount paid for the 
credit-linked note.

Fair values included in the above tables are prior to 
application of any netting agreements and cash collateral. For 
notional amounts, Citi generally has a mismatch between the 
total notional amounts of protection purchased and sold, and it 
may hold the reference assets directly rather than entering into 
offsetting credit derivative contracts as and when desired. The 
open risk exposures from credit derivative contracts are 
largely matched after certain cash positions in reference assets 
are considered and after notional amounts are adjusted, either 
to a duration-based equivalent basis or to reflect the level of 
subordination in tranched structures. The ratings of the credit 
derivatives portfolio presented in the tables and used to 
evaluate payment/performance risk are based on the assigned 
internal or external ratings of the reference asset or entity. 
Where external ratings are used, investment-grade ratings are 
considered to be “Baa/BBB” and above, while anything below 
is considered non-investment grade. Citi’s internal ratings are 
in line with the related external rating system. 

Citigroup evaluates the payment/performance risk of the 

credit derivatives for which it stands as a protection seller 
based on the credit rating assigned to the underlying reference 
credit. Credit derivatives written on an underlying non-
investment-grade reference entity represent greater payment 
risk to the Company. The non-investment-grade category in 
the table above also includes credit derivatives where the 
underlying reference entity has been downgraded subsequent 
to the inception of the derivative. 

The maximum potential amount of future payments under 

credit derivative contracts presented in the table above is 
based on the notional value of the derivatives. The Company 
believes that the notional amount for credit protection sold is 
not representative of the actual loss exposure based on 
historical experience. This amount has not been reduced by the 
value of the reference assets and the related cash flows. In 
accordance with most credit derivative contracts, should a 
credit event occur, the Company usually is liable for the 
difference between the protection sold and the value of the 
reference assets. Furthermore, the notional amount for credit 
protection sold has not been reduced for any cash collateral 
paid to a given counterparty, as such payments would be 
calculated after netting all derivative exposures, including any 
credit derivatives with that counterparty in accordance with a 
related master netting agreement. Due to such netting 
processes, determining the amount of collateral that 
corresponds to credit derivative exposures alone is not 
possible. The Company actively monitors open credit-risk 
exposures and manages this exposure by using a variety of 
strategies, including purchased credit derivatives, cash 
collateral or direct holdings of the referenced assets. This risk 
mitigation activity is not captured in the table above.

Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features in Derivatives
Certain derivative instruments contain provisions that require 
the Company to either post additional collateral or 
immediately settle any outstanding liability balances upon the 
occurrence of a specified event related to the credit risk of the 
Company. These events, which are defined by the existing 
derivative contracts, are primarily downgrades in the credit 
ratings of the Company and its affiliates. 

The fair value (excluding CVA) of all derivative 
instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that 
were in a net liability position at December 31, 2021 and 2020 
was $19 billion and $25 billion, respectively. The Company 
posted $16 billion and $22 billion as collateral for this 
exposure in the normal course of business as of December 31, 
2021 and 2020, respectively.

A downgrade could trigger additional collateral or cash 

settlement requirements for the Company and certain 
affiliates. In the event that Citigroup and Citibank were 
downgraded a single notch by all three major rating agencies 
as of December 31, 2021, the Company could be required to 
post an additional $1.3 billion as either collateral or settlement 
of the derivative transactions. In addition, the Company could 
be required to segregate with third-party custodians collateral 
previously received from existing derivative counterparties in 
the amount of $0.1 billion upon the single notch downgrade, 
resulting in aggregate cash obligations and collateral 
requirements of approximately $1.4 billion.

Derivatives Accompanied by Financial Asset Transfers
The Company executes total return swaps that provide it with 
synthetic exposure to substantially all of the economic return 
of the securities or other financial assets referenced in the 
contract. In certain cases, the derivative transaction is 
accompanied by the Company’s transfer of the referenced 
financial asset to the derivative counterparty, most typically in 
response to the derivative counterparty’s desire to hedge, in 
whole or in part, its synthetic exposure under the derivative 
contract by holding the referenced asset in funded form. In 
certain jurisdictions these transactions qualify as sales, 
resulting in derecognition of the securities transferred (see 
Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further 
discussion of the related sale conditions for transfers of 
financial assets). For a significant portion of the transactions, 
the Company has also executed another total return swap 
where the Company passes on substantially all of the 
economic return of the referenced securities to a different third 
party seeking the exposure. In those cases, the Company is not 
exposed, on a net basis, to changes in the economic return of 
the referenced securities.

These transactions generally involve the transfer of the 
Company’s liquid government bonds, convertible bonds or 
publicly traded corporate equity securities from the trading 
portfolio and are executed with third-party financial 
institutions. The accompanying derivatives are typically total 
return swaps. The derivatives are cash settled and subject to 
ongoing margin requirements.

When the conditions for sale accounting are met, the 
Company reports the transfer of the referenced financial asset 
as a sale and separately reports the accompanying derivative 
transaction. These transactions generally do not result in a gain 

260

or loss on the sale of the security, because the transferred 
security was held at fair value in the Company’s trading 
portfolio. For transfers of financial assets accounted for as a 
sale by the Company, and for which the Company has retained 
substantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred 
asset through a total return swap executed with the same 
counterparty in contemplation of the initial sale (and still 
outstanding), both the asset amounts derecognized and the 
gross cash proceeds received as of the date of derecognition 
were $2.9 billion and $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2021 
and 2020, respectively. 

At December 31, 2021, the fair value of these previously 

derecognized assets was $2.9 billion. The fair value of the 
total return swaps as of December 31, 2021 was $13 million 
recorded as gross derivative assets and $58 million recorded as 
gross derivative liabilities. At December 31, 2020, the fair 
value of these previously derecognized assets was $2.2 billion, 
and the fair value of the total return swaps was $135 million 
recorded as gross derivative assets and $7 million recorded as 
gross derivative liabilities. 

The balances for the total return swaps are on a gross 

basis, before the application of counterparty and cash 
collateral netting, and are included primarily as equity 
derivatives in the tabular disclosures in this Note.

261

23. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK 

Concentrations of credit risk exist when changes in economic, 
industry or geographic factors similarly affect groups of 
counterparties whose aggregate credit exposure is material in 
relation to Citigroup’s total credit exposure. Although 
Citigroup’s portfolio of financial instruments is broadly 
diversified along industry, product and geographic lines, 
material transactions are completed with other financial 
institutions, particularly in the securities trading, derivatives 
and foreign exchange businesses.

In connection with the Company’s efforts to maintain a 
diversified portfolio, the Company limits its exposure to any 
one geographic region, country or individual creditor and 
monitors this exposure on a continuous basis. At 
December 31, 2021, Citigroup’s most significant 
concentration of credit risk was with the U.S. government and 
its agencies. The Company’s exposure, which primarily results 
from trading assets and investments issued by the U.S. 
government and its agencies, amounted to $414.5 billion and 
$370.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
The German, United Kingdom and Japanese governments and 
their agencies, which are rated investment grade by both 
Moody’s and S&P, were the next largest exposures. The 
Company’s exposure to Germany amounted to $48.9 billion 
and $51.8 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, 
respectively. The Company’s exposure to the United Kingdom 
amounted to $31.1 billion and $26.0 billion at December 31, 
2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company’s exposure to 
Japan amounted to $30.1 billion and $35.5 billion at 
December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The foreign 
government exposures are composed of investment securities, 
loans and trading assets.

The Company’s exposure to states and municipalities 
amounted to $22.0 billion and $26.1 billion at December 31, 
2021 and 2020, respectively, and was composed of trading 
assets, investment securities, derivatives and lending activities.

24.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT 

ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement, defines fair value, 
establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value 
and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair 
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date, and 
therefore represents an exit price. Among other things, the 
standard requires the Company to maximize the use of 
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
when measuring fair value.

Under ASC 820-10, the probability of counterparty 
default is factored into the valuation of derivative and other 
positions, and the impact of Citigroup’s own credit risk is also 
factored into the valuation of derivatives and other liabilities 
that are measured at fair value.

Fair Value Hierarchy
ASC 820-10 specifies a hierarchy of inputs based on whether 
the inputs are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs 
are developed using market data and reflect market participant 
assumptions, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s 
market assumptions. These two types of inputs have created 
the following fair value hierarchy:

•

•

•

Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active 
markets.
Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active 
markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments 
in markets that are not active and model-derived 
valuations in which all significant inputs and significant 
value drivers are observable in the market.
Level 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in 
which one or more significant inputs or significant value 
drivers are unobservable.

As required under the fair value hierarchy, the Company 

considers relevant and observable market inputs in its 
valuations where possible. 

The fair value hierarchy classification approach typically 

utilizes rules-based and data driven selection criteria to 
determine whether an instrument is classified as Level 1, 
Level 2, or Level 3:

•

•

•

The determination of whether an instrument is quoted in 
an active market and therefore considered a Level 1 
instrument is based upon the frequency of observed 
transactions and the quality of independent market data 
available on the measurement date. 
A Level 2 classification is assigned where there is 
observability of prices / market inputs to models, or where 
any unobservable inputs are not significant to the 
valuation. The determination of whether an input is 
considered observable is based on the availability of 
independent market data and its corroboration, for 
example through observed transactions in the market.
Otherwise, an instrument is classified as Level 3.

Determination of Fair Value
For assets and liabilities carried at fair value, the Company 
measures fair value using the procedures set out below, 
irrespective of whether the assets and liabilities are measured 
at fair value as a result of an election, a non-recurring lower-
of-cost-or-market (LOCOM) adjustment, or because they are 
required to be measured at fair value.

When available, the Company uses quoted market prices 
from active markets to determine fair value and classifies such 
items as Level 1. In some specific cases where a market price 
is available, the Company will apply practical expedients 
(such as matrix pricing) to calculate fair value, in which case 
the items may be classified as Level 2.

The Company may also apply a price-based methodology 

that utilizes, where available, quoted prices or other market 
information obtained from recent trading activity in positions 
with the same or similar characteristics to the position being 
valued. If relevant and observable prices are available, those 
valuations may be classified as Level 2. However, when there 
are one or more significant unobservable “price” inputs, those 
valuations will be classified as Level 3. Furthermore, when a 
quoted price is considered stale, a significant adjustment to the 
price of a similar security may be necessary to reflect 
differences in the terms of the actual security or loan being 
valued, or alternatively, when prices from independent sources 
may be insufficient to corroborate a valuation, the “price” 
inputs are considered unobservable and the fair value 
measurements are classified as Level 3.

If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is 
based upon internally developed valuation techniques that use, 
where possible, current market-based parameters, such as 
interest rates, currency rates and option volatilities. Items 
valued using such internally generated valuation techniques 
are classified according to the lowest level input or value 
driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be 
classified as Level 3 even though there may be some 
significant inputs that are readily observable.

Fair value estimates from internal valuation techniques 

are verified, where possible, to prices obtained from 
independent vendors or brokers. Vendors’ and brokers’ 
valuations may be based on a variety of inputs ranging from 
observed prices to proprietary valuation models, and the 
Company assesses the quality and relevance of this 
information in determining the estimate of fair value. The 
following section describes the valuation methodologies used 
by the Company to measure various financial instruments at 
fair value. Where appropriate, the description includes details 
of the valuation models, the key inputs to those models and 
any significant assumptions.

Market Valuation Adjustments
Generally, the unit of account for a financial instrument is the 
individual financial instrument. The Company applies market 
valuation adjustments that are consistent with the unit of 
account, which does not include adjustment due to the size of 
the Company’s position, except as follows. ASC 820-10 
permits an exception, through an accounting policy election, to 
measure the fair value of a portfolio of financial assets and 
financial liabilities on the basis of the net open risk position 

263

when certain criteria are met. Citi has elected to measure 
certain portfolios of financial instruments that meet those 
criteria, such as derivatives, on the basis of the net open risk 
position. The Company applies market valuation adjustments, 
including adjustments to account for the size of the net open 
risk position, consistent with market participant assumptions.
Valuation adjustments are applied to items classified as 
Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy to ensure that the 
fair value reflects the price at which the net open risk position 
could be exited. These valuation adjustments are based on the 
bid/offer spread for an instrument in the market. When Citi 
has elected to measure certain portfolios of financial 
investments, such as derivatives, on the basis of the net open 
risk position, the valuation adjustment may take into account 
the size of the position.

Credit valuation adjustments (CVA) and funding 
valuation adjustments (FVA) are applied to the relevant 
population of over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instruments 
where adjustments to reflect counterparty credit risk, own 
credit risk and term funding risk are required to estimate fair 
value. This principally includes derivatives with a base 
valuation (e.g., discounted using overnight indexed swap 
(OIS)) requiring adjustment for these effects, such as 
uncollateralized interest rate swaps. The CVA represents a 
portfolio-level adjustment to reflect the risk premium 
associated with the counterparty’s (assets) or Citi’s (liabilities) 
non-performance risk. 

credit default swap (CDS) market are applied to the 
expected future cash flows determined in step one. Citi’s 
own credit CVA is determined using Citi-specific CDS 
spreads for the relevant tenor. Generally, counterparty 
CVA is determined using CDS spread indices for each 
credit rating and tenor. For certain identified netting sets 
where individual analysis is practicable (e.g., exposures to 
counterparties with liquid CDSs), counterparty-specific 
CDS spreads are used. For FVA, a term structure of 
spreads is applied to the expected funding exposures (e.g.,  
the market liquidity spread used to represent the term 
funding premium associated with certain OTC 
derivatives).

The CVA and FVA are designed to incorporate a market 

view of the credit and funding risk, respectively, inherent in 
the derivative portfolio. However, most unsecured derivative 
instruments are negotiated bilateral contracts and are not 
commonly transferred to third parties. Derivative instruments 
are normally settled contractually or, if terminated early, are 
terminated at a value negotiated bilaterally between the 
counterparties. Thus, the CVA and FVA may not be realized 
upon a settlement or termination in the normal course of 
business. In addition, all or a portion of these adjustments may 
be reversed or otherwise adjusted in future periods in the event 
of changes in the credit or funding risk associated with the 
derivative instruments.

The FVA represents a market funding risk premium

inherent in the uncollateralized portion of a derivative 
portfolio and in certain collateralized derivative portfolios that 
do not include standard credit support annexes (CSAs), such 
as where the CSA does not permit the reuse of collateral 
received. Citi’s FVA methodology leverages the existing CVA 
methodology to estimate a funding exposure profile. The 
calculation of this exposure profile considers collateral 
agreements in which the terms do not permit the Company to 
reuse the collateral received, including where counterparties 
post collateral to third-party custodians. Citi’s CVA and FVA 
methodologies consist of two steps: 

•

•

First, the exposure profile for each counterparty is 
determined using the terms of all individual derivative 
positions and a Monte Carlo simulation or other 
quantitative analysis to generate a series of expected cash 
flows at future points in time. The calculation of this 
exposure profile considers the effect of credit risk 
mitigants and sources of funding, including pledged cash 
or other collateral and any legal right of offset that exists 
with a counterparty through arrangements such as netting 
agreements. Individual derivative contracts that are 
subject to an enforceable master netting agreement with a 
counterparty are aggregated as a netting set for this 
purpose, since it is those aggregate net cash flows that are 
subject to nonperformance risk. This process identifies 
specific, point-in-time future cash flows that are subject to 
nonperformance and term funding risk, rather than using 
the current recognized net asset or liability as a basis to 
measure the CVA and FVA.

Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and 
Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase
No quoted prices exist for these instruments, since fair value is 
determined using a discounted cash flow technique. Cash 
flows are estimated based on the terms of the contract, taking 
into account any embedded derivative or other features. These 
cash flows are discounted using interest rates appropriate to 
the maturity of the instrument as well as the nature of the 
underlying collateral. Generally, when such instruments are 
recorded at fair value, they are classified within Level 2 of the 
fair value hierarchy, as the inputs used in the valuation are 
readily observable. However, certain long-dated positions are 
classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Trading Account Assets and Liabilities—Trading Securities 
and Trading Loans
When available, the Company uses quoted market prices in 
active markets to determine the fair value of trading securities; 
such items are classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 
Examples include government securities and exchange-traded 
equity securities.

For bonds and secondary market loans traded over the 
counter, the Company generally determines fair value utilizing 
various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows, 
price-based and internal models. Fair value estimates from 
these internal valuation techniques are verified, where 
possible, to prices obtained from independent sources, 
including third-party vendors. A price-based methodology 
utilizes, where available, quoted prices or other market 
information obtained from recent trading activity of assets 
with similar characteristics to the bond or loan being valued. 
The yields used in discounted cash flow models are derived 
from the same price information. Trading securities and loans 
priced using such methods are generally classified as Level 2. 
However, when the primary inputs to the valuation are 
unobservable, or prices from independent sources are 
insufficient to corroborate valuation, a loan or security is 
generally classified as Level 3. Fair value estimates from these 
internal valuation techniques are verified, where possible, to 

265

prices obtained from independent sources, including third-
party vendors. 

When the Company’s principal exit market for a portfolio 

of loans is through securitization, the Company uses the 
securitization price as a key input into the fair value of the 
loan portfolio. The securitization price is determined from the 
assumed proceeds of a hypothetical securitization within the 
current market environment. Where such a price verification is 
possible, loan portfolios are typically classified as Level 2 in 
the fair value hierarchy.

For most of the subprime mortgage backed security 
(MBS) exposures, fair value is determined utilizing observable 
transactions where available, or other valuation techniques 
such as discounted cash flow analysis utilizing valuation 
assumptions derived from similar, more observable securities 
as market proxies. The valuation of certain asset-backed 
security (ABS) CDO positions is inferred through the net asset 
value of the underlying assets of the ABS CDO. 

Trading Account Assets and Liabilities—Derivatives
Exchange-traded derivatives, measured at fair value using 
quoted (i.e., exchange) prices in active markets, where 
available, are classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

Derivatives without a quoted price in an active market and 
derivatives executed over the counter are valued using internal 
valuation techniques. These derivative instruments are 
classified as either Level 2 or Level 3 depending on the 
observability of the significant inputs to the model.

The valuation techniques depend on the type of derivative 

and the nature of the underlying instrument. The principal 
techniques used to value these instruments are discounted cash 
flows and internal models, such as derivative pricing models 
(e.g., Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo simulations). 

The key inputs depend upon the type of derivative and the 

nature of the underlying instrument and include interest rate 
yield curves, foreign exchange rates, volatilities and 
correlation. 

Investments
The investments category includes available-for-sale debt and 
marketable equity securities whose fair values are generally 
determined by utilizing similar procedures described for 
trading securities above or, in some cases, using vendor 
pricing as the primary source.

Also included in investments are nonpublic investments in 

private equity and real estate entities. Determining the fair 
value of nonpublic securities involves a significant degree of 
management’s judgment, as no quoted prices exist and such 
securities are not generally traded. In addition, there may be 
transfer restrictions on private equity securities. The 
Company’s process for determining the fair value of such 
securities utilizes commonly accepted valuation techniques, 
including guideline public company analysis and comparable
transactions. In determining the fair value of nonpublic 
securities, the Company also considers events such as a 
proposed sale of the investee company, initial public offerings, 
equity issuances or other observable transactions. Private 
equity securities are generally classified as Level 3 of the fair 
value hierarchy.

 
 
 
 
 
In addition, the Company holds investments in certain 
alternative investment funds that calculate NAV per share, 
including hedge funds, private equity funds and real estate 
funds. Investments in funds are generally classified as non-
marketable equity securities carried at fair value. The fair 
values of these investments are estimated using the NAV per 
share of the Company’s ownership interest in the funds where 
it is not probable that the investment will be realized at a price 
other than the NAV. Consistent with the provisions of ASU 
2015-07, these investments are categorized within the fair 
value hierarchy and are not included in the tables below. See 
Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for 
additional information.

Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt
Where fair value accounting has been elected, the fair value of 
non-structured liabilities is determined by utilizing internal 
models using the appropriate discount rate for the applicable 
maturity. Such instruments are classified as Level 2 of the fair 
value hierarchy when all significant inputs are readily 
observable.

The Company determines the fair value of hybrid 

financial instruments, including structured liabilities, using the 
appropriate derivative valuation methodology (described 
above in “Trading Account Assets and Liabilities—
Derivatives”) given the nature of the embedded risk profile. 
Such instruments are classified as Level 2 or Level 3 
depending on the observability of significant inputs to the 
model.

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
The following tables present for each of the fair value 
hierarchy levels the Company’s assets and liabilities that are 
measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 
2021 and 2020. The Company may hedge positions that have 

been classified in the Level 3 category with other financial 
instruments (hedging instruments) that may be classified as 
Level 3, but also with financial instruments classified as 
Level 1 or Level 2. The effects of these hedges are presented 
gross in the following tables:

(1) Represents netting of (i) the amounts due under securities purchased under agreements to resell and the amounts owed under securities sold under agreements to 

(2)

repurchase and (ii) derivative exposures covered by a qualifying master netting agreement and cash collateral offsetting.
Includes positions related to investments in unallocated precious metals, as discussed in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Also includes physical 
commodities accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value and unfunded credit products.

(3) Represents the netting of cash collateral paid and received by counterparties under enforceable credit support agreements. Substantially all netting of cash 

collateral received and paid is against OTC derivative assets and liabilities, respectively.

(4) Amounts exclude $0.2 billion of investments measured at NAV in accordance with ASU 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for 

Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent). 

(5) Because the amount of the cash collateral paid/received has not been allocated to the Level 1, 2 and 3 subtotals, these percentages are calculated based on total 

assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, excluding the cash collateral paid/received on derivatives.

Changes in Level 3 Fair Value Category
The following tables present the changes in the Level 3 fair 
value category for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 
2020. The gains and losses presented below include changes in 
the fair value related to both observable and unobservable 
inputs.

The Company often hedges positions with offsetting 
positions that are classified in a different level. For example, 

the gains and losses for assets and liabilities in the Level 3 
category presented in the tables below do not reflect the effect 
of offsetting losses and gains on hedging instruments that may 
be classified in the Level 1 and Level 2 categories. In addition, 
the Company hedges items classified in the Level 3 category 
with instruments also classified in Level 3 of the fair value 
hierarchy. The hedged items and related hedges are presented 
gross in the following tables:

(1) Net realized/unrealized gains (losses) are presented as increase (decrease) to Level 3 assets, and as (increase) decrease to Level 3 liabilities. Changes in fair value 

of available-for-sale debt securities are recorded in AOCI, unless related to credit impairment, while gains and losses from sales are recorded in Realized gains 
(losses) from sales of investments in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

(2) Unrealized gains (losses) on MSRs are recorded in Other revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
(3) Represents the amount of total gains or losses for the period, included in earnings (and AOCI for changes in fair value of available-for-sale debt securities and 

DVA on fair value option liabilities), attributable to the change in fair value relating to assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 that are still held at December 31, 
2020.

(4) Total Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities have been netted in these tables for presentation purposes only.

Level 3 Fair Value Rollforward 
The following were the significant Level 3 transfers for the 
period December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021:

• During the 12 months ended December 31, 2021, 

transfers of Loans of $2.1 billion from Level 3 to Level 2 
were primarily driven by equity forward and volatility 
inputs that have been assessed as not significant to the 
overall valuation of certain hybrid loan instruments, 
including equity options and long dated equity call 
spreads.

• During the 12 months ended December 31, 2021, 

transfers of Equity contracts of $1.1 billion from Level 2 
to Level 3 were due to equity forward and volatility inputs 
becoming an unobservable and/or significant input 
relative to the overall valuation of equity options and 
equity swaps. In other instances, market changes have 
resulted in observable equity forward and volatility inputs 
becoming an insignificant input to the overall valuation of 
the instrument (e.g., when an option becomes deep-in or 
deep-out of the money). This has resulted in $1.9 billion 
of certain Equity contracts being transferred from Level 3 
to Level 2.

• During the 12 months ended December 31, 2021, 

transfers of Long-term debt were $8.6 billion from Level 
2 to Level 3. Of the $8.6 billion transfer in, approximately 
$7.2 billion related to interest rate option volatility inputs 
becoming unobservable and/or significant relative to their 

overall valuation, and $1.0 billion related to equity 
volatility inputs (in addition to other volatility inputs, e.g., 
interest rate volatility inputs) becoming unobservable and/
or significant to their overall valuation. In other instances, 
market changes have resulted in some inputs becoming 
more observable, and some unobservable inputs becoming 
less significant to the overall valuation of the instruments 
(e.g., when an option becomes deep-in or deep-out of the 
money). This has resulted in $9.8 billion of certain 
structured long-term debt products being transferred from 
Level 3 to Level 2 during the 12 months ended December 
31, 2021.

The following were the significant Level 3 transfers for                           
the period December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020:

•

•

During the 12 months ended December 31, 2020, 
transfers of Interest rate contracts of $1.6 billion from 
Level 2 to Level 3 were due to interest rate option 
volatility becoming an unobservable and/or significant 
input relative to the overall valuation of inflation and 
other interest rate derivatives.
During the 12 months ended December 31, 2020, 
$6.6 billion of Long-term debt containing embedded 
derivatives was transferred from Level 2 to Level 3, as a 
result of interest rate option volatility, equity correlation 
and credit derivative inputs becoming unobservable and/
or significant input relative to the overall valuation of 
certain structured long-term debt products. In other 
instances, market changes resulted in unobservable

Valuation Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair 
Value Measurements
The Company’s Level 3 inventory consists of both cash
instruments and derivatives of varying complexity.

The following tables present the valuation techniques 

covering the majority of Level 3 inventory and the most 

significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value 
measurements. Differences between this table and amounts 
presented in the Level 3 Fair Value Rollforward table 
represent individually immaterial items that have been 
measured using a variety of valuation techniques other than 
those listed.

Uncertainty of Fair Value Measurements Relating to

Valuation uncertainty arises when there is insufficient or 
disperse market data to allow a precise determination of the 
exit value of a fair-valued position or portfolio in today’s 
market. This is especially prevalent in Level 3 fair value 
instruments, where uncertainty exists in valuation inputs that 
may be both unobservable and significant to the instrument’s 
(or portfolio’s) overall fair value measurement. The 
uncertainties associated with key unobservable inputs on the 
Level 3 fair value measurements may not be independent of 
one another. In addition, the amount and direction of the 
uncertainty on a fair value measurement for a given change in 
an unobservable input depends on the nature of the instrument 
as well as whether the Company holds the instrument as an 
asset or a liability. For certain instruments, the pricing, 
hedging and risk management are sensitive to the correlation 
between various inputs rather than on the analysis and 
aggregation of the individual inputs.

The following section describes some of the most 
significant unobservable inputs used by the Company in 
Level 3 fair value measurements.

Correlation
Correlation is a measure of the extent to which two or more 
variables change in relation to each other. A variety of 
correlation-related assumptions are required for a wide range 
of instruments, including equity and credit baskets, foreign 
exchange options, Credit Index Tranches and many other 
instruments. For almost all of these instruments, correlations 
are not directly observable in the market and must be 
calculated using alternative sources, including historical 
information. Estimating correlation can be especially difficult 
where it may vary over time, and calculating correlation 
information from market data requires significant assumptions 
regarding the informational efficiency of the market (e.g., 
swaption markets). Uncertainty therefore exists when an 
estimate of the appropriate level of correlation as an input into 
some fair value measurements is required.

Changes in correlation levels can have a substantial 

impact, favorable or unfavorable, on the value of an 
instrument, depending on its nature. A change in the default 
correlation of the fair value of the underlying bonds 
comprising a CDO structure would affect the fair value of the 
senior tranche. For example, an increase in the default 
correlation of the underlying bonds would reduce the fair 
value of the senior tranche, because highly correlated 
instruments produce greater losses in the event of default and a 
portion of these losses would become attributable to the senior 
tranche. That same change in default correlation would have a 
different impact on junior tranches of the same structure.

Volatility
Volatility represents the speed and severity of market price 
changes and is a key factor in pricing options. Volatility 
generally depends on the tenor of the underlying instrument 
and the strike price or level defined in the contract. Volatilities 
for certain combinations of tenor and strike are not observable 
and need to be estimated using alternative methods, such as 
comparable instruments, historical analysis or other sources of 

279

market information. This leads to uncertainty around the final 
fair value measurement of instruments with unobservable 
volatilities. 

The general relationship between changes in the value of 

an instrument (or a portfolio) to changes in volatility also 
depends on changes in interest rates and the level of the 
underlying index. Generally, long option positions (assets) 
benefit from increases in volatility, whereas short option 
positions (liabilities) will suffer losses. Some instruments are 
more sensitive to changes in volatility than others. For 
example, an at-the-money option would experience a greater 
percentage change in its fair value than a deep-in-the-money 
option. In addition, the fair value of an option with more than 
one underlying security (e.g., an option on a basket of 
equities) depends on the volatility of the individual underlying 
securities as well as their correlations.

Yield
In some circumstances, the yield of an instrument is not 
observable in the market and must be estimated from historical 
data or from yields of similar securities. This estimated yield 
may need to be adjusted to capture the characteristics of the 
security being valued. Whenever the amount of the adjustment 
is significant to the value of the security, the fair value 
measurement is classified as Level 3.

Adjusted yield is generally used to discount the projected 
future principal and interest cash flows on instruments, such as 
asset-backed securities. Adjusted yield is impacted by changes 
in the interest rate environment and relevant credit spreads. 

Prepayment
Voluntary unscheduled payments (prepayments) change the 
future cash flows for the investor and thereby change the fair 
value of the security. The effect of prepayments is more 
pronounced for residential mortgage-backed securities. 
Prepayment is generally negatively correlated with 
delinquency and interest rate. A combination of low 
prepayments and high delinquencies amplifies each input’s 
negative impact on a mortgage securities’ valuation. As 
prepayment speeds change, the weighted average life of the 
security changes, which impacts the valuation either positively 
or negatively, depending upon the nature of the security and 
the direction of the change in the weighted average life.

Recovery
Recovery is the proportion of the total outstanding balance of 
a bond or loan that is expected to be collected in a liquidation 
scenario. For many credit securities (e.g., commercial 
mortgage backed securities), the expected recovery amount of 
a defaulted property is typically unknown until a liquidation of 
the property is imminent. The assumed recovery of a security 
may differ from its actual recovery that will be observable in 
the future. Generally, an increase in the recovery rate 
assumption increases the fair value of the security. An increase 
in loss severity, the inverse of the recovery rate, reduces the 
amount of principal available for distribution and, as a result, 
decreases the fair value of the security.

Credit Spread
Credit spread is a component of the security representing its 
credit quality. Credit spread reflects the market perception of 
changes in prepayment, delinquency and recovery rates, 
therefore capturing the impact of other variables on the fair 
value. Changes in credit spread affect the fair value of 
securities differently depending on the characteristics and 
maturity profile of the security. For example, credit spread is a 
more significant driver of the fair value measurement of a high 
yield bond as compared to an investment grade bond. 
Generally, the credit spread for an investment grade bond is 
also more observable and less volatile than its high yield 
counterpart.

280

Where the fair value of the related collateral is based on 
an appraised value, the loan is generally classified as Level 3. 
In addition, for corporate loans, appraisals of the collateral are 
often based on sales of similar assets; however, because the 
prices of similar assets require significant adjustments to 
reflect the unique features of the underlying collateral, these 
fair value measurements are generally classified as Level 3.

The fair value of non-marketable equity securities under 
the measurement alternative is based on observed transaction 
prices for the identical or similar investment of the same 
issuer, or an internal valuation technique in the case of an 
impairment. Where there are insufficient market observations 
to conclude the inputs are observable, where significant 
adjustments are made to the observed transaction prices or 
when an internal valuation technique is used, the security is 
classified as Level 3. Fair value may differ from the observed 
transaction price due to a number of factors, including 
marketability adjustments and differences in rights and 
obligations when the observed transaction is not for the 
identical investment held by Citi.

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a 
nonrecurring basis and, therefore, are not included in the 
tables above. These include assets measured at cost that have 
been written down to fair value during the periods as a result 
of an impairment. These also include non-marketable equity 
securities that have been measured using the measurement 
alternative and are either (i) written down to fair value during 
the periods as a result of an impairment or (ii) adjusted upward 
or downward to fair value as a result of a transaction observed 
during the periods for the identical or similar investment of the 
same issuer. In addition, these assets include loans held-for-
sale and other real estate owned that are measured at the lower 
of cost or market value.

The following tables present the carrying amounts of all 
assets that were still held for which a nonrecurring fair value 
measurement was recorded:

based on the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell, 
primarily real estate.

The fair value of loans HFS is determined where possible 
using quoted secondary-market prices. If no such quoted price 
exists, the fair value of a loan is determined using quoted 
prices for a similar asset or assets, adjusted for the specific 
attributes of that loan. Fair value for the other real estate 
owned is based on appraisals. For loans whose carrying 
amount is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, 
the fair values depend on the type of collateral. Fair value of 
the collateral is typically estimated based on quoted market 
prices if available, appraisals or other internal valuation 
techniques.

Estimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments Not 
Carried at Fair Value
The following tables present the carrying value and fair value 
of Citigroup’s financial instruments that are not carried at fair 
value. The tables below therefore exclude items measured at 
fair value on a recurring basis presented in the tables above.

The disclosure also excludes leases, affiliate investments, 

pension and benefit obligations, certain insurance contracts 
and tax-related items. Also, as required, the disclosure 
excludes the effect of taxes, any premium or discount that 
could result from offering for sale at one time the entire 
holdings of a particular instrument, excess fair value 
associated with deposits with no fixed maturity and other 
expenses that would be incurred in a market transaction. In 
addition, the tables exclude the values of non-financial assets 
and liabilities, as well as a wide range of franchise, 
relationship and intangible values, which are integral to a full 
assessment of Citigroup’s financial position and the value of 
its net assets. 

Fair values vary from period to period based on changes 

in a wide range of factors, including interest rates, credit 
quality and market perceptions of value, and as existing assets 
and liabilities run off and new transactions are entered into.

unfunded lending commitments at December 31, 2021 and

Level 3. The Company does not estimate the fair values of 
consumer unfunded lending commitments, which are 
generally cancellable by providing notice to the borrower.

25.  FAIR VALUE ELECTIONS 

The Company may elect to report most financial instruments 
and certain other items at fair value on an instrument-by-
instrument basis with changes in fair value reported in 
earnings, other than DVA (see below). The election is made 
upon the initial recognition of an eligible financial asset, 
financial liability or firm commitment or when certain 
specified reconsideration events occur. The fair value election 
may not otherwise be revoked once an election is made. The 

changes in fair value are recorded in current earnings. 
Movements in DVA are reported as a component of AOCI. 
Additional discussion regarding the applicable areas in which 
fair value elections were made is presented in Note 24 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company has elected fair value accounting for its 

mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). See Note 21 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on 
Citi’s MSRs.

The following table presents the changes in fair value of those items for which the fair value option has been elected:

Own Debt Valuation Adjustments (DVA)
Own debt valuation adjustments are recognized on Citi’s 
liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected 
using Citi’s credit spreads observed in the bond market. 
Changes in fair value of fair value option liabilities related to 
changes in Citigroup’s own credit spreads (DVA) are reflected 
as a component of AOCI. See Note 1 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements for additional information. 

Among other variables, the fair value of liabilities for 
which the fair value option has been elected (other than non-
recourse debt and similar liabilities) is impacted by the 
narrowing or widening of the Company’s credit spreads. 
The estimated changes in the fair value of these non-
derivative liabilities due to such changes in the Company’s 
own credit spread (or instrument-specific credit risk) were a 
gain of $296 million and a loss of $616 million for the years 
ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Changes in 
fair value resulting from changes in instrument-specific credit 
risk were estimated by incorporating the Company’s current 
credit spreads observable in the bond market into the relevant 
valuation technique used to value each liability as described 
above.

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial 
Liabilities

Selected Portfolios of Securities Purchased Under 
Agreements to Resell, Securities Borrowed, Securities Sold 
Under Agreements to Repurchase, Securities Loaned and 
Certain Uncollateralized Short-Term Borrowings
The Company elected the fair value option for certain 
portfolios of fixed income securities purchased under 
agreements to resell and fixed income securities sold under 

agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed, securities 
loaned and certain uncollateralized short-term borrowings held 
primarily by broker-dealer entities in the United States, the 
United Kingdom and Japan. In each case, the election was 
made because the related interest rate risk is managed on a 
portfolio basis, primarily with offsetting derivative 
instruments that are accounted for at fair value through 
earnings. 

Changes in fair value for transactions in these portfolios 

are recorded in Principal transactions. The related interest 
revenue and interest expense are measured based on the 
contractual rates specified in the transactions and are reported 
as Interest revenue and Interest expense in the Consolidated 
Statement of Income.

Certain Loans and Other Credit Products
Citigroup has also elected the fair value option for certain 
other originated and purchased loans, including certain 
unfunded loan products, such as guarantees and letters of 
credit, executed by Citigroup’s lending and trading businesses. 
None of these credit products are highly leveraged financing 
commitments. Significant groups of transactions include loans 
and unfunded loan products that are expected to be either sold 
or securitized in the near term, or transactions where the 
economic risks are hedged with derivative instruments, such 
as purchased credit default swaps or total return swaps where 
the Company pays the total return on the underlying loans to a 
third party. Citigroup has elected the fair value option to 
mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge 
accounting is complex and to achieve operational 
simplifications. Fair value was not elected for most lending 
transactions across the Company.

In addition to the amounts reported above, $719 million

certain credit products selected for fair value accounting were 
outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Certain Investments in Private Equity and Real Estate 
Ventures 
Citigroup invests in private equity and real estate ventures for 
the purpose of earning investment returns and for capital 
appreciation. The Company has elected the fair value option 
for certain of these ventures, because such investments are 
considered similar to many private equity or hedge fund 
activities in Citi’s investment companies, which are reported 
at fair value. The fair value option brings consistency in the 
accounting and evaluation of these investments. All 
investments (debt and equity) in such private equity and real 
estate entities are accounted for at fair value. These 
investments are classified as Investments on Citigroup’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Changes in the fair values of these investments are 
classified in Other revenue in the Company’s Consolidated 
Statement of Income.

Certain Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale (HFS)
Citigroup has elected the fair value option for certain 
purchased and originated prime fixed-rate and conforming 
adjustable-rate first mortgage loans HFS. These loans are 
intended for sale or securitization and are hedged with 
derivative instruments. The Company has elected the fair 
value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where 
hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational 
simplifications.

Changes in the fair value of funded and unfunded credit 

products are classified in Principal transactions in Citi’s 
Consolidated Statement of Income. Related interest revenue is 
measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported 
as Interest revenue on Trading account assets or loan interest 
depending on the balance sheet classifications of the credit 
products. The changes in fair value for the years ended 
December 31, 2021 and 2020 due to instrument-specific credit 
risk totaled to a loss of $21 million and a loss of $16 million, 
respectively.

Certain Investments in Unallocated Precious Metals
Citigroup invests in unallocated precious metals accounts 
(gold, silver, platinum and palladium) as part of its commodity 
and foreign currency trading activities or to economically 
hedge certain exposures from issuing structured liabilities. 
Under ASC 815, the investment is bifurcated into a debt host 
contract and a commodity forward derivative instrument. 
Citigroup elects the fair value option for the debt host contract, 
and reports the debt host contract within Trading account 
assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The 
total carrying amount of debt host contracts across unallocated 
precious metals accounts was approximately $0.3 billion and 
$0.5 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The 
amounts are expected to fluctuate based on trading activity in 
future periods.

As part of its commodity and foreign currency trading 
activities, Citi trades unallocated precious metals investments 
and executes forward purchase and forward sale derivative 
contracts with trading counterparties. When Citi sells an 
unallocated precious metals investment, Citi’s receivable from 
its depository bank is repaid and Citi derecognizes its 
investment in the unallocated precious metal. The forward 
purchase or sale contract with the trading counterparty indexed 
to unallocated precious metals is accounted for as a derivative, 
at fair value through earnings. As of December 31, 2021, there 
were approximately $15.2 billion and $10.5 billion of notional 
amounts of such forward purchase and forward sale derivative 
contracts outstanding, respectively.

Certain Debt Liabilities
The Company has elected the fair value option for certain debt 
liabilities. The Company elected the fair value option because 
these exposures are considered to be trading-related positions 
and, therefore, they are managed on a fair value basis. These 
positions will continue to be classified as debt, deposits or 
derivatives classified as Trading account liabilities on the 
Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet according to their 
legal form.

The portion of the changes in fair value attributable to 

changes in Citigroup’s own credit spreads (i.e., DVA) is 
reflected as a component of AOCI while all other changes in 
fair value are reported in Principal transactions. Changes in 
the fair value of these liabilities include accrued interest, 
which is also included in the change in fair value reported in 
Principal transactions.

Certain Non-Structured Liabilities
The Company has elected the fair value option for certain non-
structured liabilities with fixed and floating interest rates. The 
Company has elected the fair value option where the interest 
rate risk of such liabilities may be economically hedged with 
derivative contracts or the proceeds are used to purchase 

financial assets that will also be accounted for at fair value 
through earnings. The elections have been made to mitigate 
accounting mismatches and to achieve operational 
simplifications. These positions are reported in Short-term 
borrowings and Long-term debt on the Company’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. The portion of the changes in fair 
value attributable to changes in Citigroup’s own credit spreads 
(i.e., DVA) is reflected as a component of AOCI while all 
other changes in fair value are reported in Principal 
transactions.

Interest expense on non-structured liabilities is measured 
based on the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest 
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
