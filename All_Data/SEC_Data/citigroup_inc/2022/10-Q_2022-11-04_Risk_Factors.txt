MANAGING GLOBAL RISK

For Citi, effective risk management is of primary importance 
to its overall operations. Accordingly, Citi’s risk management 
process has been designed to monitor, evaluate and manage 
the principal risks it assumes in conducting its activities. 
Specifically, the activities that Citi engages in, and the risks 
those activities generate, must be consistent with Citi’s 
mission, strategy, value proposition, key guiding principles 
and risk appetite. For more information on managing global 
risk at Citi, see “Managing Global Risk” in Citi’s 2021 Form 
10-K.

The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings 
across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison 
of credit exposure across all lines of business, geographic 
regions and products. Counterparty risk ratings reflect an 
estimated probability of default for a counterparty and are 
derived by leveraging validated statistical models, scorecard 
models and external agency ratings (under defined 
circumstances), in combination with consideration of factors 
specific to the obligor or market, such as management 
experience, competitive position, regulatory environment and 
commodity prices. Facility risk ratings are assigned that reflect 
the probability of default of the obligor and factors that affect 
the loss given default of the facility, such as support or 
collateral. Internal obligor ratings that generally correspond to 
BBB and above are considered investment grade, while those 
below are considered non-investment grade.

Note: Total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending 
commitments. 

In addition to the obligor and facility risk ratings assigned 

to all exposures, Citi may classify exposures in the corporate 
credit portfolio. These classifications are consistent with Citi’s 
interpretation of the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of 
criticized exposures, which may categorize exposures as 
special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss.

Risk ratings and classifications are reviewed regularly, 

and adjusted as appropriate. The credit review process 
incorporates quantitative and qualitative factors, including 
financial and non-financial disclosures or metrics, 
idiosyncratic events or changes to the competitive, regulatory 
or macroeconomic environment. 

Citigroup believes the corporate credit portfolio to be 
appropriately rated and classified as of September 30, 2022. 
Citigroup has taken action to adjust internal ratings and 
classifications of exposures as both the macroeconomic 
environment and obligor-specific factors have changed, 
particularly where additional stress has been seen. 

As obligor risk ratings are downgraded, the probability of 

default increases. Downgrades of obligor risk ratings tend to 
result in a higher provision for credit losses. In addition, 
downgrades may result in the purchase of additional credit 
derivatives or other risk mitigants to hedge the incremental 
credit risk, or may result in Citi’s seeking to reduce exposure 
to an obligor or an industry sector. Citi will continue to review 
exposures to ensure that the appropriate probability of default 
is incorporated into all risk assessments.

See Note 13 for additional information on Citi’s corporate 

credit portfolio.

Credit Risk Mitigation
As part of its overall risk management activities, Citigroup 
uses credit derivatives and other risk mitigants to hedge 
portions of the credit risk in its corporate credit portfolio, in 
addition to outright asset sales. Citi may enter into partial-term 
hedges as well as full-term hedges. In advance of the 
expiration of partial-term hedges, Citi will determine, among 
other factors, the economic feasibility of hedging the 
remaining life of the instrument. The results of the mark-to-
market and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives 
are reflected primarily in Principal transactions in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income.

At September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and December 31, 

2021, ICG had economic hedges on the corporate credit 
portfolio of $36.5 billion, $36.8 billion and $39.3 billion, 
respectively. Citigroup’s expected credit loss model used in 
the calculation of its ACL does not include the favorable 
impact of credit derivatives and other mitigants that are 
marked-to-market. In addition, the reported amounts of direct 
outstandings and unfunded lending commitments in the tables 
above do not reflect the impact of these hedging transactions. 
The credit protection was economically hedging underlying 
ICG corporate credit portfolio exposures with the following 
risk rating distribution:

(1) End-of-period loans include interest and fees on credit cards.
(2) Legacy Franchises—3Q22 Asia Consumer loan balances exclude approximately $17 billion of loans ($12 billion of retail banking loans and $5 billion of credit 

card loan balances) reclassified to held-for-sale (HFS) (Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet) as a result of Citi’s signed agreements to sell its consumer 
banking businesses in seven countries (see Legacy Franchises above and Note 2 for additional information). Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan, 
India and Bahrain consumer banking businesses were reclassified to HFS starting 1Q22. In addition, the Australia consumer banking business was reclassified to 
HFS from 3Q21 until the closing of its sale on June 1, 2022; and the Philippines consumer banking business was reclassified to HFS from 4Q21 until the closing 
of its sale on August 1, 2022. Accordingly, loans from these sold businesses are excluded from the Asia Consumer loan balances as of the end of such periods.

(3) Consists of $99.3 billion, $94.6 billion, $94.1 billion, $92.7 billion and $92.0 billion of loans in North America as of September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022, March 
31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2021, respectively. For additional information on the credit quality of the Global Wealth portfolio, see Note 13.

(4) Consists of $51.8 billion, $54.2 billion, $56.1 billion, $58.6 billion and $58.3 billion of loans outside North America as of September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022, 

March 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2021, respectively.

(5) See Note 13 for details on loan-to-value ratios for the portfolios and FICO scores for the U.S. portfolio.

marketable investment securities, commercial real estate and limited partner capital commitments in private equity) and have experienced very low historical 
NCLs. As discussed below, approximately 95% of the classifiably managed portion of these loans are investment grade. See “Consumer Loan Delinquencies 
Amounts and Ratios” below for details on the delinquency-managed portfolio.

(7) Asia Consumer also includes loans and leases in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.

Consumer Credit Trends

Personal Banking and Wealth Management (PBWM)

Personal Banking and Wealth Management

U.S. Personal Banking’s Branded cards portfolio includes 

proprietary and co-branded cards. 

As shown in the chart above, the third quarter of 2022 net 
credit loss rate in Branded cards was unchanged quarter-over-
quarter and decreased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the 
continued impact of high payment rates, driven by lasting 
effects of government stimulus, unemployment benefits and 
consumer relief programs.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-

over-quarter and year-over year, driven by a modest increase 
in net flow rates, primarily reflecting the ongoing 
normalization.

Retail Services

As indicated above, PBWM consists of U.S. Personal Banking 
and Global Wealth Management (Global Wealth). U.S. 
Personal Banking provides cards products through Branded 
cards and Retail services, and mortgages and home equity, 
small business and personal consumer loans through Citi’s 
Retail banking network. The Retail bank is concentrated in six 
major metropolitan areas in the U.S. Global Wealth provides 
cards, mortgages and personal, small business and other 
consumer loans through the Private bank, Citigold and Wealth 
at Work. 

As of September 30, 2022, approximately 40% of PBWM 
consumer loans consisted of Branded cards and Retail services 
card loans, which generally drives the overall credit 
performance of PBWM, as U.S. Cards net credit losses 
represent approximately 90% of total PBWM losses. 

As shown in the chart above, the third quarter of 2022 net 
credit loss rate in PBWM was unchanged quarter-over-quarter 
and increased year-over-year, driven by an increase in net flow 
rates, primarily reflecting ongoing normalization from 
historically low levels in U.S. Cards.

PBWM’s 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, also driven by an 
increase in net flow rates, primarily reflecting the ongoing 
normalization in U.S. Cards.

Branded Cards

U.S. Personal Banking’s Retail services partners directly 

with more than 20 retailers and dealers to offer private label 
and co-branded cards. Retail services’ target market focuses 
on select industry segments such as home improvement, 
specialty retail, consumer electronics and fuel. Retail services 
continually evaluates opportunities to add partners within 
target industries that have strong loyalty, lending or payment 
programs and growth potential.

As shown in the chart above, the third quarter of 2022 net 

credit loss rate in Retail services increased quarter-over-
quarter and year-over-year, driven by an increase in net flow 
rates, primarily reflecting the ongoing normalization from 
historically low levels.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-
over-quarter and year-over-year, also driven by an increase in 
net flow rates, primarily reflecting the ongoing normalization. 
For additional information on cost of credit, delinquency 

and other information for Citi’s cards portfolios, see each 
respective business’s results of operations above and Note 13.

41

Retail Banking

U.S. Personal Banking’s Retail banking portfolio consists 
primarily of consumer mortgages and other unsecured lending 
products, such as small business loans and personal loans. The 
portfolio is generally delinquency managed, where Citi 
evaluates credit risk based on FICO scores, delinquencies and 
the value of underlying collateral. The consumer mortgages in 
this portfolio have historically been extended to high credit 
quality customers, generally with loan-to-value ratios that are 
less than 80% on first and second mortgages. For additional 
information, see “Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratios” in Note 13.
As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 
Retail banking for the third quarter of 2022 decreased quarter-
over-quarter, due to industry-wide episodic overdraft losses in 
the first half of the year, but increased year-over-year, 
primarily driven by the lingering impact of the episodic losses.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily driven by 
U.S. mortgages, which reflected the lasting effects of 
government stimulus, unemployment benefits and consumer 
relief programs.

Global Wealth

As discussed above, the Global Wealth credit portfolio 
primarily consists of consumer mortgages, cards and other 
lending products extended to customer segments that range 
from the affluent to ultra-high-net-worth through the Private 
bank, Citigold and Wealth at Work. These customer segments 
represent a target market that is characterized by historically 
low default rates and delinquencies. 

As of September 30, 2022, approximately $53 billion, or 
35%, of the portfolio was classifiably managed and primarily 
consisted of margin lending, commercial real estate, 
subscription credit finance and other lending programs. These 
classifiably managed loans are primarily evaluated for credit 

42

risk based on their internal risk rating, of which 95% is rated 
investment grade. While the delinquency rate in the chart 
above is calculated only for the delinquency-managed 
portfolio, the net credit loss rate is calculated using net credit 
losses for both the delinquency and classifiably managed 
portfolios.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate and 

90+ days past due delinquency rate for the third quarter of 
2022 were broadly stable quarter-over-quarter and year-over-
year, reflecting the strong credit profiles of the portfolios. 

Legacy Franchises
Legacy Franchises provides traditional retail banking and 
branded card products to retail and small business customers 
in Asia Consumer and Mexico Consumer.

Asia(1) Consumer

(1) Asia Consumer includes Legacy Franchises activities in certain EMEA 

countries for all periods presented.

As of September 30, 2022, Asia Consumer operated in the 

remaining 11 countries in Asia and EMEA (Australia and the 
Philippines were included until sold on June 1, 2022 and 
August 1, 2022, respectively) and provides credit cards, 
consumer mortgages and small business and personal loans.
As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 
Asia Consumer for the third quarter of 2022 increased quarter-
over-quarter, primarily driven by lower average loans in Korea 
(decline of $2.6 billion) due to the continued wind-down of 
the business. The net credit loss rate decreased year-over-year, 
primarily driven by the impact of the charge-off of peak 
delinquent loans in early 2021, which resulted in lower 
delinquencies, leading to lower net credit losses in the current 
quarter. The year-over-year decrease was also driven by the 
reclassification of loans to held-for-sale during the third 
quarter of 2021 or thereafter (including approximately $12 
billion of retail banking loans and $5 billion of credit card loan 
balances for the third quarter of 2022), as a result of Citi’s 
signing of sale agreements for the Philippines, Bahrain, India, 
Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam consumer 
banking businesses.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-
over-quarter, primarily driven by lower end-of-period loans in 
Korea (decline of $3.3 billion) due to the continued wind-
down of the business, and decreased year-over-year, mainly 
driven by the impact of the Asia held-for-sale reclassification 
and the charge-off of peak delinquencies.

The performance of Asia Consumer’s portfolios continues 

to reflect the strong credit profiles in the region’s target 
customer segments. Regulatory changes in many markets in 

 
Asia over the past few years have also resulted in improved 
credit quality. 

Mexico Consumer

Mexico Consumer operates in Mexico through 

Citibanamex and provides credit cards, consumer mortgages 
and small business and personal loans. Mexico Consumer 
serves a more mass-market segment in Mexico and focuses on 
developing multiproduct relationships with customers.

As shown in the chart above, the third quarter of 2022 net 

credit loss rate in Mexico Consumer increased quarter-over-
quarter, largely driven by higher episodic mortgage recoveries 
in the second quarter of 2022, and decreased year-over-year, 
primarily driven by the impact of the charge-off of peak 
delinquencies in early 2021, which resulted in lower 
delinquencies, leading to lower net credit losses in the current 
quarter. 

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily driven by 
the impact of the charge-off of peak delinquencies and higher 
payment rates.

For additional information on cost of credit, loan 
delinquency and other information for Citi’s consumer loan 
portfolios, see PBWM and Legacy Franchises results of 
operations above and Note 13.

U.S. Cards FICO Distribution
The following tables show the current FICO score

(1)  The FICO bands in the tables are consistent with general industry peer 

presentations. 

The FICO distribution of both cards portfolios remained 
largely unchanged from the prior quarter and the prior year. 
The FICO distribution continues to reflect strong underlying 
credit quality and a benefit from the continued impacts of 
government stimulus, unemployment benefits and customer 
relief programs, as well as lower credit utilization primarily by 
customers with lower FICO scores. See Note 13 for additional 
information on FICO scores.

(1) End-of-period (EOP) loans include interest and fees on credit cards.
(2) The ratios of 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due are calculated based on EOP loans, net of unearned income.
(3) The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios for Retail banking exclude loans guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies since the 

potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) 
were $96 million ($0.6 billion), $119 million ($0.7 billion) and $146 million ($1.5 billion) at September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, 
respectively. The amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP 
loans) were $67 million, $72 million and $78 million at September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. The EOP loans in the table 
include the guaranteed loans.

(4) The 90+ days past due balances for Branded cards and Retail services are generally still accruing interest. Citi’s policy is generally to accrue interest on credit card 

loans until 180 days past due, unless a notification of bankruptcy filing has been received earlier.

(5) Excludes EOP classifiably managed Private bank loans. These loans are not included in the delinquency numerator, denominator and ratios. 
(6) These loans are evaluated for non-accrual status and write-off primarily based on their internal risk classification and not solely on their delinquency status, and 

therefore delinquency metrics are excluded from this table. As of September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, 95%, 94% and 93% of Global 
Wealth classifiably managed loans were rated investment grade. For additional information on the credit quality of the Global Wealth portfolio, including 
classifiably managed portfolios, see “Consumer Credit Trends” above.

(7) Asia Consumer includes delinquencies and loans in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.

(8) Citi recently entered into agreements to sell certain Asia consumer banking businesses. Accordingly, the loans of these businesses have been reclassified as HFS 

in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and hence the loans and related delinquencies and ratios are not included in this table. The reclassifications 
commenced as follows: Australia (3Q21, and closed on June 1, 2022), the Philippines (4Q21, and closed on August 1, 2022) and Bahrain, India, Indonesia, 
Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam (1Q22). See Note 2 for additional information.

(9) The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are primarily related to U.S. mortgages guaranteed by U.S. 
government-sponsored agencies since the potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the U.S. agencies. The amounts excluded for 90+ days past due and 
(EOP loans) were $95 million ($0.3 billion), $84 million ($0.2 billion) and $138 million ($0.4 billion) at September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 
2021, respectively. The amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due 
EOP loans) were $31 million, $27 million and $42 million at September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. The EOP loans in the table 
include the guaranteed loans.

(1) Average loans include interest and fees on credit cards.
(2) The ratios of net credit losses are calculated based on average loans, net of unearned income.
(3) Asia Consumer includes NCLs and average loans in certain EMEA countries (Russia, Poland and Bahrain) for all periods presented.
(4) Citi recently entered into agreements to sell certain Asia consumer banking businesses, which have been reclassified as HFS in Other assets and Other liabilities 
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As a result, approximately $34 million, $50 million and $5 million in related net credit losses (NCLs) were recorded as a 
reduction in revenue (Other revenue) in 3Q22, 2Q22 and 3Q21, respectively. Accordingly, these NCLs are not included in this table. The reclassifications 
commenced as follows: Australia (3Q21, and closed on June 1, 2022), the Philippines (4Q21, and closed on August 1, 2022) and Bahrain, India, Indonesia, 
Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam (1Q22). See Note 2 for additional information.

(1) North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Mexico is included in offices outside North America. The classification of corporate loans between 

offices in North America and outside North America is based on the domicile of the booking unit. The difference between the domicile of the booking unit and the 
domicile of the managing unit is not material. 

(2) Loans secured primarily by real estate.
(3) Consumer loans are net of unearned income of $671 million, $631 million, $591 million, $629 million and $616 million at September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022, 
March 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2021, respectively. Unearned income on consumer loans primarily represents unamortized origination 
fees and costs, premiums and discounts. 

(4) Corporate loans include Mexico SBMM loans and are net of unearned income of $(750) million, $(759) million, $(766) million, $(770) million and $(798) million 
at September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022, March 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2021, respectively. Unearned income on corporate loans primarily 
represents interest received in advance, but not yet earned, on loans originated on a discounted basis.

(5) Because loans carried at fair value do not have an ACLL, they are excluded from the ACLL ratio calculation.

Includes both Branded cards and Retail services. As of September 30, 2022, the $10.6 billion of ACLL represented approximately 48 months of coincident net 
credit loss coverage. As of September 30, 2022, Branded cards ACLL as a percentage of EOP loans was 6.2% and Retail services ACLL as a percentage of EOP 
loans was 10.1%. As of December 31, 2021, the $10.8 billion of loan loss reserves represented approximately 63 months of coincident net credit loss coverage. 
The decrease in the coincident coverage ratio at September 30, 2022 was primarily due to the relatively higher levels of NCLs during the third quarter of 2022. As 
of December 31, 2021, Branded cards ACLL as a percentage of EOP loans was 7.1% and Retail services ACLL as a percentage of EOP loans was 10.0%.

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets and Renegotiated Loans
For additional information on Citi’s non-accrual loans and 
assets and renegotiated loans, see “Non-Accrual Loans and 
Assets and Renegotiated Loans” in Citi’s 2021 Form 10-K.

Non-Accrual Loans
The table below summarizes Citigroup’s non-accrual loans as 
of the periods indicated. Non-accrual loans may still be current 
on interest payments. In situations where Citi reasonably 
expects that only a portion of the principal owed will 
ultimately be collected, all payments received are reflected as 
a reduction of principal and not as interest income. For all 
other non-accrual loans, cash interest receipts are generally 
recorded as revenue.

(1) Corporate loans are placed on non-accrual status based upon a review by Citigroup’s risk officers. Corporate non-accrual loans may still be current on interest 

payments. With limited exceptions, the following practices are applied for consumer loans: consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are placed on 
non-accrual status at 90 days past due and are charged off at 120 days past due; residential mortgage loans are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and 
written down to net realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent with industry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest on credit card loans until such 
loans are charged off, which typically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency. As such, the non-accrual loan disclosures do not include credit card loans. The 
balances above represent non-accrual loans within Corporate loans and Consumer loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

(2) Approximately 68%, 52%, 66%, 56% and 58% of Citi’s corporate non-accrual loans were performing at September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022, March 31, 2022, 

December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2021, respectively.

(3) The September 30, 2022 total corporate non-accrual loans represented 0.51% of total corporate loans. 
(4)  Asia Consumer includes balances in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.

Note: The amounts shown in the table above are presented on an average basis. For securities, the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be 
realized and, therefore, exclude any securities that are encumbered and incorporate any haircuts applicable under the U.S. LCR rule. The table above incorporates 
various restrictions that could limit the transferability of liquidity between legal entities, including Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.
(1)  Foreign government debt includes securities issued or guaranteed by foreign sovereigns, agencies and multilateral development banks. Foreign government debt 
securities are held largely to support local liquidity requirements and Citi’s local franchises and principally include government bonds from Japan, Mexico, 
Singapore, Korea and Hong Kong. 

The table above includes average amounts of HQLA held 
at Citigroup’s operating entities that are eligible for inclusion 
in the calculation of Citigroup’s consolidated Liquidity 
Coverage ratio (LCR), pursuant to the U.S. LCR rules. These 
amounts include the HQLA needed to meet the minimum 
requirements at these entities as well as any amounts in excess 
of these minimums that are available to be transferred to other 
entities within Citigroup. Citigroup’s average HQLA for the 
third quarter of 2022 increased quarter-over-quarter, primarily 
driven by an increase in unsecured wholesale funding. 

As of September 30, 2022, Citigroup had approximately 
$967 billion of available liquidity resources to support client 
and business needs, including end-of-period HQLA assets; 
additional unencumbered securities, including excess liquidity 
held at bank entities that is non-transferable to other entities 
within Citigroup; and available assets not already accounted 
for within Citi’s HQLA to support Federal Home Loan Bank 
(FHLB) and Federal Reserve Bank discount window 
borrowing capacity.

Short-Term Liquidity Measurement: Liquidity Coverage 
Ratio (LCR)
In addition to internal 30-day liquidity stress testing performed 
for Citi’s major entities, operating subsidiaries and countries, 
Citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the LCR. The 
table below details the components of Citi’s LCR calculation 
and HQLA in excess of net outflows for the periods indicated:

was primarily driven by an increase in average HQLA, 
partially offset by an increase in net outflows.

End-of-period deposits decreased 3% year-over-year, 
largely driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation 
and lower balances in Legacy Franchises. End-of-period 
deposits decreased 1% sequentially.

On an average basis, deposits declined 2% year-over-year 
and were largely unchanged sequentially. The year-over-year 
decline primarily reflected the impact of foreign exchange 
translation and a decline in Legacy Franchises, partially offset 
by growth in Corporate/Other. The decline in Legacy 
Franchises was due to the impact of held-for-sale accounting 
as a result of the signing of sale agreements for consumer 
franchises in Asia and EMEA. ICG average deposits declined 
2% year-over-year, driven by decreases in TTS, Securities 
services and Markets, largely reflecting the impact of foreign 
exchange translation. PBWM average deposits increased 1% 
year-over-year, driven by modest growth in both U.S. Personal 
Banking and Global Wealth. Corporate/Other average 
deposits increased $13 billion year-over-year due to the 
issuance of institutional certificates of deposit, as Citi 
continues to diversify its funding profile.

Long-Term Liquidity Measurement: Net Stable Funding 
Ratio (NSFR)
As previously disclosed, the U.S. banking agencies adopted a 
final rule to assess the availability of a bank’s stable funding 
against a required level. 

The final rule became effective on July 1, 2021, while 
public disclosure requirements to report the ratio will occur on 
a semiannual basis beginning June 30, 2023. Citi was in 
compliance with the final rule as of September 30, 2022.

End-of-period loans decreased 3% year-over-year, largely 
driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation and lower 
balances in Legacy Franchises. End-of-period loans declined 
2% sequentially.

On an average basis, loans declined 2% year-over-year 

and were largely unchanged sequentially. The year-over-year 
decline was primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange 
translation and lower balances in Legacy Franchises, which 
more than offset growth in both PBWM and ICG. The decline 
in Legacy Franchises primarily reflected the reclassification of 
loans to Other assets to reflect held-for-sale accounting as a 
result of the signing of sale agreements for consumer 
franchises in Asia and EMEA, as well as the impact of the 
Korea wind-down. PBWM average loans increased 5% year-
over-year, primarily driven by Branded cards and Retail 
services. ICG average loans increased 1% year-over-year, 
largely driven by trade finance in TTS.

Long-Term Debt 
The weighted-average maturity of unsecured long-term debt 
issued by Citigroup and its affiliates (including Citibank) with 
a remaining life greater than one year was approximately 
7.8 years as of September 30, 2022, compared to 8.6 years as 
of the prior year and 8.0 years as of the prior quarter. The 
weighted-average maturity is calculated based on the 
contractual maturity of each security. For securities that are 
redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the holder, the 
weighted-average maturity is calculated based on the earliest 
date an option becomes exercisable.

Citi’s long-term debt outstanding at the Citigroup parent 

company includes benchmark senior and subordinated debt 
and what Citi refers to as customer-related debt, consisting of 
structured notes, such as equity- and credit-linked notes, as 
well as non-structured notes. Citi’s issuance of customer-
related debt is generally driven by customer demand and 
complements benchmark debt issuance as a source of funding 
for Citi’s non-bank entities. Citi’s long-term debt at the bank 
includes bank notes, FHLB advances and securitizations.

Note: Amounts represent the current value of long-term debt on Citi’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet that, for certain debt instruments, includes 
consideration of fair value, hedging impacts and unamortized discounts and 
premiums.
(1) Non-bank includes long-term debt issued to third parties by the parent 

holding company (Citigroup) and Citi’s non-bank subsidiaries (including 
broker-dealer subsidiaries) that are consolidated into Citigroup. As of 
September 30, 2022, non-bank included $71.4 billion of long-term debt 
issued by Citi’s broker-dealer and other subsidiaries that are 
consolidated into Citigroup. Certain Citigroup consolidated hedging 
activities are also included in this line.

(2) Local country and other includes debt issued by Citi’s affiliates in 
support of their local operations. Within non-bank, certain secured 
financing is also included.

(3) Predominantly credit card securitizations, primarily backed by Branded 

cards receivables.

Citi’s total long-term debt outstanding declined 2% year-

over-year, as declines in unsecured benchmark debt at both the 
bank and non-banking entities, as well as securitizations at the 
bank, were partially offset by the issuance of customer-related 
debt at the non-bank entities. Sequentially, long-term debt 
outstanding declined 2%, largely driven by a decline in senior 
debt at the non-bank entities, partially offset by an increase in 
FHLB borrowings at the bank. 

As part of its liability management, Citi has considered, 

and may continue to consider, opportunities to redeem or 
repurchase its long-term debt pursuant to open market 
purchases, tender offers or other means. Such redemptions and 
repurchases help reduce Citi’s overall funding costs. During 
the third quarter of 2022, Citi redeemed or repurchased an 
aggregate of approximately $9.8 billion of its outstanding 
long-term debt.

Citi manages the risks in its secured funding by 

conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in 
capacity, tenor, haircut, collateral profile and client actions. In 
addition, Citi maintains counterparty diversification by 
establishing concentration triggers and assessing counterparty 
reliability and stability under stress. Citi generally sources 
secured funding from more than 150 counterparties.

Short-Term Borrowings
Citi’s short-term borrowings of $47 billion increased 60% 
year-over-year and 18% sequentially, reflecting an increase in 
FHLB advances and commercial paper issuance, as Citi 
continues to diversify its funding profile (see Note 16 for 
further information on Citigroup’s and its affiliates’ 
outstanding short-term borrowings).

Secured Funding Transactions and Short-Term 
Borrowings
Citi supplements its primary sources of funding with short-
term financings that generally include (i) secured funding 
transactions consisting of securities loaned or sold under 
agreements to repurchase, i.e., repos, and (ii) to a lesser extent, 
short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper and 
borrowings from the FHLB and other market participants. 

Secured Funding Transactions
Secured funding is primarily accessed through Citi’s broker-
dealer subsidiaries to fund efficiently both (i) secured lending 
activity and (ii) a portion of the securities inventory held in the 
context of market making and customer activities. Citi also 
executes a smaller portion of its secured funding transactions 
through its bank entities, which are typically collateralized by 
government debt securities. Generally, daily changes in the 
level of Citi’s secured funding are primarily due to 
fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book 
(as described below) and securities inventory. 

Secured funding of $203 billion as of September 30, 2022 

decreased 3% from the prior-year period and increased 2% 
sequentially, driven by normal business activity. The average 
balance for secured funding was approximately $207 billion 
for the quarter ended September 30, 2022.

The portion of secured funding in the broker-dealer 
subsidiaries that funds secured lending is commonly referred 
to as “matched book” activity. The majority of this activity is 
secured by high-quality liquid securities such as U.S. Treasury 
securities, U.S. agency securities and foreign government debt 
securities. Other secured funding is secured by less liquid 
securities, including equity securities, corporate bonds and 
asset-backed securities, the tenor of which is generally equal 
to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding matched book 
assets.

The remainder of the secured funding activity in the 
broker-dealer subsidiaries serves to fund securities inventory 
held in the context of market making and customer activities. 
To maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market 
conditions, including under periods of stress, Citi manages 
these activities by taking into consideration the quality of the 
underlying collateral and establishing minimum required 
funding tenors. The weighted average maturity of Citi’s 
secured funding of less liquid securities inventory was greater 
than 110 days as of September 30, 2022.

Credit Ratings
While not included in the table below, the long-term and 
short-term ratings of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. 
(CGMHI) were A/A-1 at S&P Global Ratings and A+/F1 at 
Fitch as of September 30, 2022.

Fitch Ratings (Fitch)

Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s)

S&P Global Ratings (S&P)

Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades
Ratings downgrades by Moody’s, Fitch or S&P could 
negatively impact Citigroup’s and/or Citibank’s funding and 
liquidity due to reduced funding capacity, including derivative 
triggers, which could take the form of cash obligations and 
collateral requirements.

For additional information on the impact of credit rating 

changes on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see “Risk 
Factors—Liquidity Risks” and “Credit Ratings” in Citi’s 2021 
Form 10-K.

Citigroup Inc. and Citibank—Potential Derivative Triggers
As of September 30, 2022, Citi estimates that a hypothetical 
one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of 
Citigroup Inc. across all three major rating agencies could 
impact Citigroup’s funding and liquidity due to derivative 
triggers by approximately $0.6 billion, compared to $0.5 
billion as of June 30, 2022. Other funding sources, such as 
secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, 
for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be 
adversely affected.

As of September 30, 2022, Citi estimates that a 
hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-
term rating of Citibank across all three major rating agencies 
could impact Citibank’s funding and liquidity due to 
derivative triggers by approximately $0.8 billion, compared to 
$0.7 billion as of June 30, 2022. Other funding sources, such 
as secured funding transactions and other margin 
requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could 
also be adversely impacted.

In total, as of September 30, 2022, Citi estimates that a 
one-notch downgrade of Citigroup Inc. and Citibank across all 
three major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate 
cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately 
$1.4 billion, compared to $1.2 billion as of June 30, 2022 (see 
also Note 19). As detailed under “High-Quality Liquid Assets 
(HQLA)” above, Citigroup has various liquidity resources 
available to its bank and non-bank entities in part as a 
contingency for the potential events described above.

Citibank—Additional Potential Impacts
In addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a 
potential downgrade of Citibank’s senior debt/long-term rating 
across any of the three major rating agencies could also have 
an adverse impact on the commercial paper/short-term rating 
of Citibank. As of September 30, 2022, Citibank had liquidity 
commitments of approximately $11.0 billion to consolidated 
asset-backed commercial paper conduits, compared to $9.0 
billion as of June 30, 2022 (see Note 18 for additional 
information).

In addition to the above-referenced liquidity resources of 

certain Citibank entities, Citibank could reduce the funding 
and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades 
described above through mitigating actions, including 
repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial 
paper conduits. In the event of the potential downgrades 
described above, Citi believes that certain corporate customers 
could re-evaluate their deposit relationships with Citibank. 
This re-evaluation could result in clients adjusting their 
discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository 
institution, which could potentially reduce certain deposit 
levels at Citibank. However, Citi could choose to adjust 
pricing, offer alternative deposit products to its existing 
customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers, in 
addition to the mitigating actions referenced above.

is a key metric that analyzes the impact of a range of scenarios 
on Citi’s Banking Book net interest income and certain other 
interest rate-sensitive income versus a base case. IRE does not 
represent a forecast of Citi’s net interest income.

The scenarios, methodologies and assumptions used in 

this analysis are periodically evaluated and enhanced in 
response to changes in the market environment, changes in 
Citi’s balance sheet composition, enhancements in Citi’s 
modelling and other factors.

During the third quarter of 2022, Citi transitioned its IRE 
analysis, employing enhanced methodologies and changes to 
certain assumptions. The changes included, among other 
things, assumptions around the projected balance sheet and 
revisions to the treatment of certain business contributions 
(notably accrual positions in ICG’s Markets businesses). 
These changes resulted in a higher impact to Citi’s net interest 
income over a 12-month period (see the table below for 
details).

Under the enhanced methodology, Citi utilizes the most 
recent quarter-end balance sheet, assuming no changes to its 
composition and size over the forecasted horizon (holding the 
balance sheet static). The forecasts incorporate expectations 
and assumptions of deposit pricing, loan spreads and mortgage 
prepayment behavior implied by the interest rate curves in 
each scenario. The base case scenario reflects the market 
implied forward interest rates, and sensitivity scenarios 
assume instantaneous shocks to the base case. The forecasts do 
not assume Citi takes any risk-mitigating actions in response 
to changes in the interest rate environment. Certain interest 
rates are subject to flooring assumptions in downward rate 
scenarios. Deposit pricing sensitivities, (i.e., deposit betas), are 
informed by historical and expected behavior. Actual deposit 
pricing could differ from the assumptions used in these 
forecasts.

Citi’s IRE analysis primarily reflects the impacts from the 

following Banking Book assets and liabilities: loans, client 
deposits, Citi’s deposits with other banks, investment 
securities, long-term debt, any related interest rate hedges and 
the funds transfer pricing of positions in total trading and 
credit portfolio VAR. It excludes impacts from any positions 
which are included in total trading and credit portfolio VAR.

Citi also measures the potential impacts of changes in 

interest rates on the value of its AOCI, which can in turn 
impact Citi’s common equity and tangible common equity. 
This will impact Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 and other 
regulatory capital ratios. Citi seeks to manage its exposure to 
changes in the market level of interest rates, while limiting the 
potential impact on its AOCI and regulatory capital position.
AOCI at risk is managed as part of the Company-wide 
interest rate risk position. AOCI at risk considers potential 
changes in AOCI (and the corresponding impact on the 
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio) relative to Citi’s capital 
generation capacity.

MARKET RISK

Market risk arises from both Citi’s trading and non-trading
portfolios. For additional information on market risk and
market risk management at Citi, see “Market Risk—
Overview” and “Risk Factors” in Citi’s 2021 Form 10-K.

Market Risk of Non-Trading Portfolios
Market risk from non-trading portfolios stems predominantly 
from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and 
foreign exchange rates on Citi’s net interest income and on 
Citi’s Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) 
from its investment securities portfolios. Market risk from 
non-trading portfolios also includes the potential impact of 
changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital invested in 
foreign currencies.

Banking Book Interest Rate Risk 
For interest rate risk purposes, Citi’s non-trading portfolios are 
referred to as the Banking Book. Management of interest rate 
risk in the Banking Book is governed by Citi’s Non-Trading 
Market Risk Policy. Management’s Asset & Liability 
Committee (ALCO) establishes Citi’s risk appetite and related 
limits for interest rate risk in the Banking Book, which are 
subject to approval by Citigroup’s Board of Directors. 
Corporate Treasury is responsible for the day-to-day 
management of Citi’s Banking Book interest rate risk as well 
as periodically reviewing it with the ALCO. Citi’s Banking 
Book interest rate risk management is also subject to 
independent oversight from Treasury Risk Management, a 
second line of defense team reporting to the Treasury Chief 
Risk Officer.

Changes in interest rates impact Citi’s net income, AOCI 

and CET1. These changes primarily affect Citi’s Banking 
Book through net interest income, due to a variety of risk 
factors, including:

•

•
•

•

Differences in timing and amounts of the maturity or 
repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet 
instruments;
Changes in level and/or shape of interest rate curves;
Client behavior in response to changes in interest rate 
(e.g., mortgage prepayments, deposit betas); and
Changes in maturity of instruments resulting from 
changes in interest rate environment.

As part of their ongoing activities, Citi’s businesses generate 
interest rate-sensitive positions from their client-facing 
products, such as loans and deposits. The component of this 
interest rate risk that can be hedged is transferred via Citi’s 
funds transfer pricing process to Corporate Treasury. 
Corporate Treasury uses various tools to manage the total 
interest rate risk position within the established risk appetite 
and target Citi’s desired risk profile, including its investment 
securities portfolio, company-issued debt and interest rate 
derivatives. 

In addition, Citi uses multiple metrics to measure its 
Banking Book interest rate risk. Interest Rate Exposure (IRE)

June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively.
Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.

(3)

Citi’s balance sheet is asset sensitive (assets reprice faster than 
liabilities), resulting in higher net interest income in increasing 
interest rate scenarios. The estimated impact to Citi’s net 
interest income in a 100 bps upward rate shock scenario as of 
the third quarter of 2022 increased modestly quarter-over-
quarter and decreased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the 
net impact of lower expected gains due to U.S. dollar interest 
rate moves that have already been realized and changes in 
Citi’s balance sheet. At progressively higher interest rate 
levels, the marginal net interest income benefit is lower, as 
Citi assumes it will pass on a larger share of rate changes to 
depositors (i.e., higher betas), further reducing Citi’s IRE 
sensitivity. Currency-specific interest rate changes and balance 
sheet factors may drive quarter-to-quarter volatility in Citi’s 
estimated IRE.

In a 100 bps upward rate shock scenario, Citi expects that 

the $969 million initial negative impact to AOCI could 
potentially be offset in shareholders’ equity through the 

expected recovery of the impact on AOCI through accretion of 
Citi’s investment portfolio and expected net interest income 
benefit over a period of approximately three months.

Scenario Analysis
The following table presents the estimated impact to Citi’s net 
interest income, AOCI and Common Equity Tier 1 Capital 
ratio (on a fully implemented basis) under five different 
scenarios of changes in interest rate for the U.S. dollar and all 
other currencies in which Citi has invested capital as of 
September 30, 2022. The 100 bps downward rate scenarios are 
impacted by the low level of interest rates in several countries 
and the assumption that market interest rates, as well as rates 
paid to depositors and charged to borrowers, do not fall below 
zero (i.e., the “flooring assumption”). The rate scenarios are 
also impacted by convexity related to mortgage products.

As shown in the table above, the estimated impact to 
Citi’s net interest income remains larger under Scenario 2 than 
Scenario 3, as Citi’s Banking Book has relatively higher 
interest rate exposure to the short end of the yield curve. For 
U.S. dollars, exposure to downward rate shocks is larger in 
magnitude than to upward rate shocks. This is because of the 
lower benefit to net interest income from Citi’s deposit base at 
higher rate levels, as well as the prepayment effects on 
mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. For other 
currencies, exposure to downward rate shocks is smaller in 
magnitude as a result of Citi’s flooring assumption given low 
rate levels for certain non-U.S. dollar currencies.

The magnitude of the impact to AOCI is greater under 
Scenario 2 as compared to Scenario 3. This is because the 
combination of changes to Citi’s investment portfolio, 
partially offset by changes related to Citi’s pension liabilities, 
results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at 
shorter- and intermediate-term maturities.

Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates—Impacts on AOCI 
and Capital
As of September 30, 2022, Citi estimates that an unanticipated 
parallel instantaneous 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar 
against all of the other currencies in which Citi has invested 
capital could reduce Citi’s tangible common equity (TCE) by 
approximately $1.6 billion, or 0.97%, as a result of changes to 
Citi’s foreign currency translation adjustment in AOCI, net of 
hedges. This impact would be primarily due to changes in the 
value of the Mexican peso, Euro, Singapore dollar and Indian 
rupee.

This impact is also before any mitigating actions Citi may 

take, including ongoing management of its foreign currency 
translation exposure. Specifically, as currency movements 
change the value of Citi’s net investments in foreign currency-
denominated capital, these movements also change the value 
of Citi’s risk-weighted assets denominated in those currencies. 
This, coupled with Citi’s foreign currency hedging strategies, 
such as foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency 
forwards and other currency hedging instruments, lessens the 
impact of foreign currency movements on Citi’s Common 
Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio. Changes in these hedging 
strategies, as well as hedging costs, divestitures and tax 
impacts, can further affect the actual impact of changes in 
foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital as compared to an 
unanticipated parallel shock, as described above.

The effect of Citi’s ongoing management strategies with 

respect to quarterly changes in foreign exchange rates, and the 
quarterly impact of these changes on Citi’s TCE and Common 
Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio, are shown in the table below. See 
Note 17 for additional information on the changes in AOCI.

Interest revenue and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments primarily related to the tax-exempt bond portfolio and certain tax-advantaged 
loan programs (based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%) of $46 million, $44 million and $46 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, 
June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. 
Interest expense associated with certain hybrid financial instruments, which are classified as Long-term debt and accounted for at fair value, is reported together 
with any changes in fair value as part of Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income and is therefore not reflected in Interest expense in the 
table above.

(3) The average rate on interest revenue and net interest margin reflects the taxable equivalent gross-up adjustment. See footnote 1 above.
(4) Citi’s NIM is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets.

Interest revenue and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments discussed in the table above.

Citi’s net interest income in the third quarter of 2022 
increased 18% to $12.6 billion versus the prior-year period. As 
presented in the table above, Citi’s net interest income on a 
taxable equivalent basis increased 17% year-over-year, or $1.9 
billion, driven by higher net interest income in non-ICG 
Markets, while net interest income in ICG Markets (Fixed 
income markets and Equity markets) declined 3%. The 
increase in non-ICG Markets net interest income primarily 
reflected higher interest rates, growth in interest-earning 
balances from cards, improved deposit spreads in Services and 
higher income from Citi’s investment portfolio. The decline in 
ICG Markets net interest income largely reflected a change in 
the mix of trading positions in support of client activity. 
Citi’s net interest margin was 2.31% on a taxable 
equivalent basis in the third quarter of 2022, an increase of 7 
basis points from the prior quarter, primarily driven by the 
impact of higher interest rates and improved deposit spreads in 
Services.

Interest revenue and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments discussed in the table above.

(1)
(2) Rate/volume variance is allocated based on the percentage relationship of changes in volume and changes in rate to the total net change.
(3) Changes in average rates reflect changes in prevailing local interest rates, including inflationary effects and monetary corrections in certain countries.
(4)

Interest expense on Trading account liabilities of ICG is reported as a reduction of Interest revenue. Interest revenue and Interest expense on cash collateral 
positions are reported in interest on Trading account assets and Trading account liabilities, respectively.
Includes Brokerage payables.

Market Risk of Trading Portfolios

Value at Risk (VAR)
Citi believes its VAR model is conservatively calibrated to incorporate fat-tail scaling and the greater of short-term (approximately the 
most recent month) and long-term (three years) market volatility. As of September 30, 2022, Citi estimates that the conservative 
features of the VAR calibration contribute an approximate 40% add-on to what would be a VAR estimated under the assumption of 
stable and perfectly, normally distributed markets. As of June 30, 2022, the add-on was 53%.

As presented in the table below, Citi’s average trading VAR for the third quarter of 2022 increased quarter-over-quarter, mainly 

due to higher market volatilities of interest rates in the ICG Markets businesses.

(1)  Covariance adjustment (also known as diversification benefit) equals the difference between the total VAR and the sum of the VARs tied to each risk type. The 
benefit reflects the fact that the risks within individual and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VAR on a given day will be 
lower than the sum of the VARs relating to each risk type. The determination of the primary drivers of changes to the covariance adjustment is made by an 
examination of the impact of both model parameter and position changes.

(2)  The total trading VAR includes mark-to-market and certain fair value option trading positions in ICG, with the exception of hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value 

option loans and all CVA exposures. Available-for-sale and accrual exposures are not included.

(3)  The specific risk-only component represents the level of equity and fixed income issuer-specific risk embedded in VAR. 
(4)  The credit portfolio is composed of mark-to-market positions associated with non-trading business units, the CVA relating to derivative counterparties and all 

associated CVA hedges. FVA and DVA are not included. The credit portfolio also includes hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value option loans and hedges to the 
leveraged finance pipeline within capital markets origination in ICG.

Regulatory VAR Back-testing
In accordance with Basel III, Citi is required to perform back-
testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR 
model. Regulatory VAR back-testing is the process in which 
the daily one-day VAR, at a 99% confidence interval, is 
compared to the buy-and-hold profit and loss (i.e., the profit 
and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of 
the day and re-priced the following day). Buy-and-hold profit 
and loss represents the daily mark-to-market profit and loss 
attributable to price movements in covered positions from the 
close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and 
loss excludes realized trading revenue, net interest, fees and 
commissions, intra-day trading profit and loss and changes in 
reserves.

Based on a 99% confidence level, Citi would expect two 

to three days in any one year where buy-and-hold losses 
exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the conservative 
calibration of Citi’s VAR model (as a result of taking the 
greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-tail scaling 
of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer exceptions under 
normal and stable market conditions. Periods of unstable 
market conditions could increase the number of back-testing 
exceptions.

As of September 30, 2022, there were two back-testing 

exceptions observed for Citi’s Regulatory VAR in the last 12 
months.

 OTHER RISKS
For additional information regarding other risks, including 
Citi’s management of other risks, see “Managing Global Risk
—Other Risks” in Citi’s 2021 Form 10-K.

LIBOR Transition Risk 
The Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the LIBOR Act), 
enacted earlier this year, provides for the use of a statutory 
replacement for the overnight, one-month, three-month, six 
month and 12-month tenors of USD LIBOR in all contracts 
governed by U.S. law that lack adequate fallback provisions. 
On July 28, 2022, the Federal Reserve Board published in the 
Federal Register its proposed rulemaking that would 
implement the LIBOR Act. The proposal contains the Federal 
Reserve Board’s recommendation of benchmark replacements 
for various product types. As required by the LIBOR Act, each 
proposed replacement rate is based on the Secured Overnight 
Financing Rate (SOFR). 

Citi continues to review the effect of the LIBOR Act and 
the Federal Reserve Board’s proposal and monitor its ongoing 
rulemaking process, which is expected to facilitate the 
transition to replacement rates for Citi’s USD LIBOR-linked 
securities, loans and contracts without fallbacks or fallbacks 
based on USD LIBOR that are governed by U.S. law and yet 
to be remediated.

For additional information about Citi’s actions to address 

a transition away from and discontinuance of LIBOR, see 
“Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—LIBOR Transition 
Risk” in Citi’s 2021 Form 10-K. For information about Citi’s 
LIBOR transition risks, see “Risk Factors—Other Risks” in 
the 2021 Form 10-K.

Country Risk

Top 25 Country Exposures
The following table presents Citi’s top 25 exposures by 
country (excluding the U.S.) as of September 30, 2022. 
(Including the U.S., the total exposure as of September 30, 
2022 to the top 25 countries would represent approximately 
97% of Citi’s exposure to all countries.)

For purposes of the table, loan amounts are reflected in 
the country where the loan is booked, which is generally based 
on the domicile of the borrower. For example, a loan to a 
Chinese subsidiary of a Switzerland-based corporation will 
generally be categorized as a loan in China. In addition, Citi 
has developed regional booking centers in certain countries, 

most significantly in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland, 
in order to more efficiently serve its corporate customers. As 
an example, with respect to the U.K., only 38% of corporate 
loans presented in the table below are to U.K. domiciled 
entities (40% for unfunded commitments), with the balance of 
the loans predominately to European domiciled counterparties. 
Approximately 88% of the total U.K. funded loans and 89% of 
the total U.K. unfunded commitments were investment grade 
as of September 30, 2022. 

Trading account assets and investment securities are 
generally categorized based on the domicile of the issuer of 
the security of the underlying reference entity. For additional 
information on the assets included in the table, see the 
footnotes to the table below.

June 30, 2022 includes Legacy Franchises loans reclassified to HFS as a result of Citi’s agreement to sell its consumer banking business in the Philippines, which 
closed on August 1, 2022. For additional information, see “Legacy Franchises” above and Note 2.

(10)  September 30, 2022 includes approximately $250 million of Russian government securities pledged as collateral to clearing houses. Given the geopolitical 

uncertainty in Russia, it is no longer possible to conclude, with a well-founded basis, the collectability of such pledged collateral in the Russian legal system in the 
event of a clearing house default.

Russia 

Introduction
In Russia, Citi has operated through both its ICG and Legacy 
Franchises segments. Citi continues to monitor the war in 
Ukraine, related sanctions and economic conditions and 
continues to mitigate its Russia exposures and risks as 
appropriate.

As previously disclosed, Citi intends to wind down nearly 
all of its consumer, local commercial and institutional banking 
businesses in the country. As a result, Citi has ceased 
soliciting any new business or new clients in Russia. Citi will 
continue to manage its existing legal and regulatory 
commitments and obligations, as well as support its 

employees, during this period. For additional information, see 
“Citi’s Wind-Down of Its Russia Businesses” below.

For additional information about Citi’s risks related to its 
Russia exposures, see “Forward-Looking Statements” below 
and “Risk Factors—Market-Related Risk,” “—Operational 
Risks” and “—Other Risks” in Citi’s 2021 Form 10-K.

Investment securities include debt securities available-for-sale (AFS), recorded at fair market value, primarily local government debt securities. There were no 
impairment losses recognized during the second and third quarters of 2022.

(2)  Net mark-to-market (MTM) on OTC derivatives and securities lending/borrowing transactions (repos). Effective from 2Q22, reverse repurchase agreements have 

been shown gross of collateral and reclassified to net MTM on derivatives/repos in the table above, as netting of collateral for Russia-related reverse repurchase 
agreements was removed. This removal was due to the inability to conclude, with a well-founded basis, the enforceability of contractual rights in the Russian legal 
system in the event of a counterparty default, given the geopolitical uncertainty caused by the war in Ukraine. As this exposure was already included in Total 
third-party exposure, the Total Russia exposure was not impacted by this reclassification.

(3)  Unfunded exposure consists of unfunded corporate lending commitments, letters of credit and other contingencies. 
(4)  Cash on deposit and placements are primarily with the Central Bank of Russia and have increased primarily due to borrower paydowns as risk mitigation activities 

have reduced AO Citibank’s loan portfolio.

(5)  The majority of AO Citibank’s third-party exposures was funded with domestic deposit liabilities from both corporate and personal banking clients.
(6)  Citigroup’s currency translation adjustment (CTA) loss included in its Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) related to its indirect subsidiary, AO 
Citibank, is excluded from the above table, because the CTA loss is not held in AO Citibank and would be recognized in Citigroup’s earnings upon either the 
substantial liquidation or a loss of control of AO Citibank. Citi has separately described these risks in “Deconsolidation Risk” below.

During the third quarter of 2022, Citi continued to reduce 
its operations in Russia and Russia-related exposures, resulting 
in a net decrease in Total Russia exposure of $0.5 billion, 
shown in the table above, as well as a change in composition 
of exposure as mitigation efforts have reduced Citi’s third-
party credit risk. Depreciation of the ruble against the U.S. 
dollar resulted in a decrease in exposure of $0.7 billion, 
partially offset by a $0.2 billion increase in exposure in local 
currency terms, driven by earnings plus ongoing portfolio 
reductions, net proceeds of which are deposited with the 
Central Bank of Russia.

Citi’s continued risk mitigation efforts include ICG 
borrower paydowns and limiting extensions of new credit. 
ICG’s credit exposure also reflected a shift to a higher 
proportion of stronger credit names, including a higher 
proportion of subsidiaries of multinational companies that are 
headquartered outside of Russia, primarily in the U.S. and 
Europe. The decline in overall exposure was also driven by a 
reduction in exposures to Russian counterparties not held by 
AO Citibank.

Citi’s net investment in Russia was approximately $1.3 

billion as of September 30, 2022 (compared to $1.2 billion as 
of June 30, 2022). The increase was primarily driven by 
earnings generated by AO Citibank during the quarter, 
partially offset by depreciation of the ruble against the U.S. 
dollar. A portion of Citi’s net investment was hedged for 
foreign currency depreciation as of September 30, 2022, using 
forward foreign exchange contracts executed with 
international peer banks. Going forward, Citi may record 
devaluations on its net ruble-denominated assets in earnings, 
without the benefit from a change in the fair value of 
derivative positions used to economically hedge the exposures. 
In the event of a loss of control of AO Citibank, Citi would be 
required to write off its net investment of approximately $1.3 
billion (compared to $1.2 billion as of June 30, 2022), 
recognize a pretax CTA loss of approximately $1.0 billion 
through earnings (compared to $0.9 billion as of June 30, 
2022), and recognize a loss of $0.3 billion (compared to $0.4 
billion as of June 30, 2022) on intercompany liabilities owed 
by AO Citibank to other Citi entities outside Russia (see 
“Deconsolidation Risk” below). 

3Q22 Earnings and Other Impacts on Citi’s Businesses
Citi’s ICG, PBWM and Legacy Franchises segments and 
Corporate/Other were impacted by various macroeconomic 
factors and volatilities, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine 
and its direct and indirect impact on the European and global 
economy. For a broader discussion of these factors and 
volatilities on Citi’s businesses, see “Executive Summary” and 
each business’s results of operations above. 

As of September 30, 2022, Citigroup’s ACL included a 

$1.2 billion remaining credit reserve for Citi’s direct and 
indirect Russian exposure (down from $1.6 billion at June 30, 
2022), consisting of approximately $0.5 billion (compared to 
$0.8 billion at June 30, 2022) related to Citi’s direct exposures 
to Russian counterparties and approximately $0.7 billion 
(compared to $0.8 billion at June 30, 2022) related to the 
impact of the war in Ukraine on the broader global 
macroeconomic environment.

Citi’s Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations
In August 2022, Citi disclosed its decision to wind down its 
Russia consumer and local commercial banking businesses, 
including actively pursuing portfolio sales. In connection with 
the wind-down plan, Citi expects to incur approximately $170 
million in costs (excluding the impact from any portfolio 
sales), primarily over the next 18 months, largely driven by 
restructuring, vendor termination fees and other related 
charges.

On October 28, 2022, Citi entered into an agreement to 

sell a portfolio of ruble-denominated personal installment 
loans, totaling approximately $345 million in outstanding loan 
balances as of the third quarter of 2022, to Uralsib, a Russian 
commercial bank. Citi expects to incur a loss of approximately 
$35 million as a result of the sale, which is expected to close 
in the fourth quarter of 2022. In connection with the portfolio 
sale, Citi also entered into a referral agreement to transfer to 
Uralsib a portfolio of ruble-denominated credit card loans, 
subject to customer consents. The outstanding card loans 
balance was approximately $320 million as of the third quarter 
of 2022. Citi will refer credit card customers, who at the 
customers’ sole discretion will be eligible to refinance their 
outstanding card loan balances with Uralsib.

Moreover, Citi will be ending nearly all of the 

institutional banking services it offers in Russia by the end of 
the first quarter of 2023. Going forward, Citi’s only operations 
in Russia will be those necessary to fulfill its remaining legal 
and regulatory obligations. At this time, Citi expects to incur 
estimated costs of approximately $100 million in connection 
with this action. The wind-down of the institutional banking 
business could accelerate the substantial liquidation of AO 
Citibank, and therefore impact the timing of the release of the 
related CTA loss into earnings. 

Deconsolidation Risk
Citi’s operations in Russia subject it to various risks, 
including, among others, foreign currency volatility, including 
appreciations or devaluations; business restrictions; sanctions 
or asset freezes; or other deconsolidation events (for additional 
information, see “Risk Factors—Other Risks” in Citi’s 2021 
Form 10-K). Examples of triggers that may result in 
deconsolidation of AO Citibank include voluntary or forced 
sale of ownership or loss of control due to actions of relevant 
governmental authorities, including expropriation (i.e., the 
entity becomes subject to the complete control of a 
government, court, administrator, trustee or regulator); 
revocation of banking license; and loss of ability to elect a 
board of directors or appoint members of senior management. 
As of September 30, 2022, Citi continued to consolidate AO 
Citibank because none of the deconsolidation factors were 
triggered.

As discussed above, in the event of a loss of control of 

AO Citibank, Citi would be required to write off its net 
investment of approximately $1.3 billion (compared to $1.2 
billion as of June 30, 2022), recognize a CTA loss of 
approximately $1.0 billion through earnings (compared to $0.9 
billion as of June 30, 2022), and recognize a loss of $0.3 
billion (compared to $0.4 billion as of June 30, 2022) on 
intercompany liabilities owed by AO Citibank to other Citi 
entities outside Russia. In the sole event of a substantial
