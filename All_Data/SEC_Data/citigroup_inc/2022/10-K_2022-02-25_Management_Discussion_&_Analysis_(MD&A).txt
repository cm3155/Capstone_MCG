MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
As described further throughout this Executive Summary, Citi 
demonstrated continued progress across the franchise during 
2021:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

Citi’s earnings increased significantly versus the prior 
year, largely reflecting an allowance for credit loss (ACL) 
release of approximately $8.8 billion as a result of 
continued improvement in both the macroeconomic 
environment and portfolio credit quality. 
Citi’s revenues declined 5% from the prior year. 
Excluding a pretax loss of approximately $0.7 billion 
(approximately $0.6 billion after-tax) related to Citi’s 
agreement to sell its Australia consumer banking business 
in Asia Global Consumer Banking (GCB) (see 
“Citigroup” below), Citi’s revenues declined 4%, as 
strength in investment banking, equity markets, the 
private bank and securities services in Institutional Clients 
Group (ICG) was more than offset by normalization in 
market activity in fixed income markets within ICG, as 
well as the impact of lower deposit spreads and card loans 
across GCB. 
Citi’s expenses included pretax costs of approximately 
$1.2 billion ($1.1 billion after-tax) primarily related to 
charges incurred from the voluntary early retirement 
program (VERP) in connection with the wind-down of the 
Korea consumer banking business (for additional 
information, see “Asia GCB” below).
Citi continued to invest in its transformation, including 
infrastructure supporting its risk and control environment, 
and make business-led investments.
Citi had broad-based deposit growth across ICG and GCB 
(up 3% and 5%, respectively), reflecting continued 
engagement across both corporate and consumer clients.
Citi returned approximately $11.8 billion of capital to its 
common shareholders in the form of $4.2 billion in 
dividends and $7.6 billion in common share repurchases, 
totaling approximately 105 million common shares, while 
maintaining robust regulatory capital ratios.
In addition to the sale announcements related to Asia 
GCB, Citi also announced it intends to exit the consumer, 
small business and middle-market banking operations of 
Citibanamex in Mexico. Citi’s planned divestitures of its 
consumer businesses across Mexico, Asia and EMEA are 
aligned with the repositioning of its consumer operations 
to focus on global wealth centers, as well as payments and 
lending and a targeted retail presence in the U.S. (For 
additional information on the exit markets and Citi’s 
revised reporting structure effective for the first quarter of 
2022, see “Strategic Refresh—Market Exits and Revised 
Reporting Strategy” above and “Latin America GCB” and 
“Asia GCB” below.)

Although economic growth and employment rates have 
continued to recover from pandemic-related lows, particularly 
in the U.S., various macroeconomic and other challenges and 
uncertainties related to, among other things, the duration and 

7

severity of the pandemic-related public health crisis, 
disruptions of global supply chains, inflationary pressures, 
increasing interest rates and geopolitical tensions involving 
Eastern Europe, will continue to create uncertainty around 
Citi’s businesses and results. 

For a discussion of trends, uncertainties and risks that will 

or could impact Citi’s businesses, results of operations and 
financial condition during 2022, see “2021 Results Summary,” 
“Risk Factors,” each respective business’s results of 
operations and “Managing Global Risk” below. 

2021 Results Summary

Citigroup
Citigroup reported net income of $22.0 billion, or $10.14 per 
share, compared to net income of $11.0 billion, or $4.72 per 
share, in the prior year. The increase in net income was driven 
by lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher expenses and 
lower revenues. Citigroup’s effective tax rate was 20%, up 
modestly from 19% in the prior year. Earnings per share 
increased significantly, primarily driven by net income. 

Citigroup revenues of $71.9 billion decreased 5% from 

the prior year. Excluding the Australia loss on sale, Citigroup 
revenues decreased 4%, primarily driven by lower revenues in 
both ICG and GCB, partially offset by higher revenues in 
Corporate/Other.

As discussed above, Citi’s 2021 results include the 
impacts of divestitures of Citi’s consumer banking businesses 
in Asia. Reported revenues include the Australia loss on sale 
(approximately $0.7 billion pretax, $0.6 billion after-tax), 
primarily reflecting the impact of a currency translation 
adjustment (CTA) loss (net of hedges) already reflected in the 
Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) component 
of equity. Upon closing, the CTA balance will be removed 
from the AOCI component of equity, resulting in a neutral 
impact to Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. 

Reported expenses include the impact of the Korea VERP 

of approximately $1.1 billion (approximately $0.8 billion 
after-tax) and contract modification costs related to the Asia 
divestitures of approximately $119 million (approximately $98 
million after-tax). (As used throughout this Form 10-K, Citi’s 
results of operations and financial condition excluding the 
impact of the Australia loss on sale, Korea VERP and other 
Asia divestiture-related costs are non-GAAP financial 
measures. Citi believes the presentation of its results of 
operations and financial condition excluding the divestiture-
related impacts described above provides a meaningful 
depiction of the underlying fundamentals of its broader results 
and Asia GCB businesses’ results for investors, industry 
analysts and others.)

Citigroup’s end-of-period loans decreased 1% from the 

prior year to $668 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign 
currency translation into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes 
(FX translation), Citigroup’s end-of-period loans were largely 
unchanged, as growth in ICG was offset by lower loans in 
GCB and Corporate/Other. Citigroup’s end-of-period deposits 

increased 3% to $1.3 trillion. Excluding the impact of FX 
translation, Citigroup’s end-of-period deposits increased 4%, 
reflecting growth in both GCB and ICG. (As used throughout 
this Form 10-K, Citi’s results of operations excluding the 
impact of FX translation are non-GAAP financial measures. 
Citi believes the presentation of its results of operations and 
financial condition excluding the impact of FX translation 
provides a meaningful depiction of the underlying 
fundamentals of its businesses for investors, industry analysts 
and others.)

Expenses
Citigroup operating expenses of $48.2 billion increased 9% 
versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of the Asia 
divestitures, expenses of $47.0 billion increased 6%, primarily 
reflecting investments in Citi’s transformation, including 
infrastructure supporting its risk and control environment, 
business-led investments and revenue- and transaction-related 
expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Citi expects 
expenses in 2022 to continue to be impacted by its 
transformation-related and business-led investments.

Cost of Credit
Citi’s total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and 
claims were a benefit of $3.8 billion, compared to a cost of 
$17.5 billion in the prior year primarily related to the 
pandemic. The decreased cost of credit was driven by a net 
ACL reserve release of $8.8 billion (versus a build of $9.8 
billion in the prior year) as well as lower net credit losses. 
Citi’s net ACL release primarily reflected improvement in 
Citi’s macroeconomic outlook and portfolio credit quality. Citi 
could experience higher credit costs in 2022, as the level of 
ACL releases from 2021 are unlikely to continue, and Citi 
expects to build ACL reserves for new lending volumes. 

For further information on the drivers of Citi’s ACL, see 
“Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—
Citi’s Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)” below. 

Net credit losses of $4.9 billion declined 36% from the 

prior year. Consumer net credit losses of $4.5 billion 
decreased 32%, primarily reflecting lower loan volumes and 
improved delinquencies in the North America cards portfolios. 
Corporate net credit losses of $395 million decreased 60%, 
primarily reflecting improvements in portfolio credit quality. 
For additional information on Citi’s consumer and 

corporate credit costs and ACL, see each respective business’s 
results of operations and “Credit Risk” below.

Capital
Citigroup’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio was 12.2% as 
of December 31, 2021, based on the Basel III Standardized 
Approach framework for determining risk-weighted assets, 
compared to 11.5% as of December 31, 2020, based on the 
Basel III Advanced Approaches for determining risk-weighted 
assets. The increase in the ratio primarily reflected actions to 
reduce risk-weighted assets (RWA) and a temporary pause in 
common share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2021, in 
preparation for the implementation of the Standardized 
Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR) on January 
1, 2022. Citi resumed common share repurchases in January 
2022.

8

Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio was 5.7% as of 

December 31, 2021, compared to 7.0% as of December 31, 
2020. The decrease was primarily driven by the expiration of 
temporary relief granted by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) 
as of the end of the first quarter of 2021. For additional 
information on SA-CCR and Citi’s capital ratios, see “Capital 
Resources” below.

Institutional Clients Group
ICG net income of $15.7 billion increased 36%, reflecting 
lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher expenses and 
lower revenues. ICG operating expenses increased 8% to 
$26.5 billion, reflecting continued investments in Citi’s 
transformation, business-led investments and revenue- and 
transaction-related expenses, partially offset by productivity 
savings.

ICG revenues of $43.9 billion decreased 3%, as a 7% 
increase in Banking revenues was more than offset by an 11% 
decline in Markets and securities services revenues. The 
increase in Banking revenues included the impact of $144 
million of losses on loan hedges related to corporate lending 
and the private bank, compared to losses of $51 million in the 
prior year.

Banking revenues of $23.3 billion (excluding the impact 
of losses on loan hedges) increased 7%, as higher revenues in 
investment banking and the private bank were partially offset 
by lower revenues in treasury and trade solutions and 
corporate lending. Investment banking revenues of $7.5 billion 
increased 30%, reflecting growth across products, particularly 
in advisory and equity underwriting. Advisory revenues 
increased 78% to $1.8 billion, equity underwriting revenues 
increased 53% to $2.4 billion and debt underwriting revenues 
increased 3% to $3.3 billion.

Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $9.4 billion 
declined 4%, as higher fee revenues, including a recovery in 
commercial card revenues, as well as growth in trade were 
more than offset by the impact of lower deposit spreads. 
Private bank revenues increased 5%. Excluding the impact of 
gains on loan hedges, private bank revenues of $4.0 billion 
increased 6%, driven by higher loan volumes and spreads, as 
well as higher managed investments and deposits, partially 
offset by lower deposit spreads. Corporate lending revenues 
decreased 3%. Excluding the impact of losses on loan hedges, 
corporate lending revenues of $2.3 billion decreased 1%, as 
lower cost of funds was more than offset by lower loan 
volumes.

Markets and securities services revenues of $20.8 billion 

decreased 11%. Fixed income markets revenues of $13.7 
billion decreased 22%, reflecting a normalization in market 
activity across rates and spread products. Equity markets 
revenues of $4.5 billion increased 25%, driven by growth 
across all products, reflecting solid client activity and 
favorable market conditions. Securities services revenues of 
$2.7 billion increased 6%, as strong fee revenues, driven by 
higher settlement volumes and higher assets under custody, 
were partially offset by lower deposit spreads. For additional 
information on the results of operations of ICG in 2021, see 
“Institutional Clients Group” below.

Year-over-year, excluding the impact of FX translation, 
international GCB average deposits of $146 billion increased 
5%, average retail banking loans of $72 billion decreased 3% 
and assets under management of $145 billion increased 5%. 
On this basis, international GCB average card loans of $20 
billion decreased 13%, while credit card spend volumes of 
$100 billion increased 9%, reflecting a continued recovery in 
credit card spend activity from the pandemic-related low 
levels in the prior year.

Corporate/Other
Corporate/Other net income was $215 million, compared to a 
net loss of $1.1 billion in the prior year, reflecting higher 
revenues, lower expenses, lower cost of credit, and the release 
of a foreign tax credit (FTC) valuation allowance. Operating 
expenses of $1.6 billion decreased 14%, reflecting the absence 
of the prior year’s civil money penalty and the wind-down of 
legacy assets, partially offset by increases related to Citi’s 
transformation.

Corporate/Other revenues of $667 million compared to 
$71 million in the prior year, primarily driven by higher net 
revenue from the investment portfolio. For additional 
information on the results of operations of Corporate/Other in 
2021, see “Corporate/Other” below.

CITI’S CONSENT ORDER COMPLIANCE
Citi has embarked on a multiyear transformation, with the 
target outcome to change Citi’s business and operating models 
such that they simultaneously strengthen risk and controls and 
improve Citi’s value to customers, clients and shareholders. 

This includes efforts to effectively implement the October 

2020 FRB and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 
(OCC) consent orders issued to Citigroup and Citibank, 
respectively. In the second quarter of 2021, Citi made an 
initial submission to the OCC, and submitted its plans to 
address the consent orders to both regulators during the third 
quarter of 2021. Citi continues to work constructively with the 
regulators, and will continue to reflect their feedback in its 
project plans and execution efforts.

As discussed above, Citi’s efforts include continued 
investments in its transformation, including the remediation of 
its consent orders. Citi's CEO has made the strengthening of 
Citi's risk and control environment a strategic priority and has
established a Chief Administrative Officer organization to 
centralize program management. In addition, the Citigroup 
and Citibank Boards of Directors each formed a 
Transformation Oversight Committee, an ad hoc committee of 
each Board, to provide oversight of management’s 
remediation efforts under the consent orders.

For additional information about the consent orders, see 
“Risk Factors—Compliance Risks” below and Citi’s Current 
Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 7, 2020. 

Global Consumer Banking
GCB net income was $6.1 billion, compared to net income of 
$667 million in the prior year, reflecting lower cost of credit, 
partially offset by lower revenues and higher expenses. GCB 
operating expenses of $20.0 billion increased 12%. Excluding 
the impact of FX translation and the Asia divestitures, 
expenses increased 5%, reflecting continued investments in 
Citi’s transformation, as well as business-led investments and 
volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity 
savings.

GCB revenues of $27.3 billion decreased 10% from the 

prior year. Excluding the impact of FX translation and the 
Australia loss on sale, revenues decreased 9%, as continued 
solid deposit growth and growth in assets under management 
were more than offset by lower card loans and lower deposit 
spreads. For additional information on GCB’s results of 
operations, including the impact of FX translation, see “Global 
Consumer Banking” below.

North America GCB revenues of $17.5 billion decreased 
9%, with lower revenues across branded cards, retail services 
and retail banking. Branded cards revenues of $8.2 billion 
decreased 7%, reflecting continued higher payment rates. 
Retail services revenues of $5.1 billion decreased 15%, 
reflecting continued higher payment rates and lower average 
loans as well as higher partner payments. Retail banking 
revenues of $4.2 billion decreased 7%, as the benefit of 
stronger deposit volumes was more than offset by lower 
deposit spreads and lower mortgage revenues.

North America GCB average deposits of $206 billion 
increased 17% year-over-year and average retail banking loans 
of $50 billion decreased 4% year-over-year, while assets under 
management of $87 billion increased 8%. Average branded 
cards loans of $81 billion decreased 4% and average retail 
services loans decreased 7%, reflecting higher payment rates. 
Branded cards spend volume of $411 billion increased 21% 
and retail services spend volume of $92 billion increased 18%, 
reflecting a recovery in sales activity from the pandemic-
driven low levels in the prior year. For additional information 
on the results of operations of North America GCB in 2021, 
see “Global Consumer Banking—North America GCB” below.
International GCB revenues (consisting of Latin America 
GCB and Asia GCB (which includes the results of operations 
in certain EMEA countries)) of $9.8 billion declined 11% 
versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of FX translation 
and the Australia loss on sale, international GCB revenues 
declined 7%. Excluding the impact of FX translation, Latin 
America GCB revenues decreased 9%, driven by lower 
average loans and lower deposit spreads. Excluding the impact 
of FX translation and the Australia loss on sale, Asia GCB 
revenues decreased 6%, reflecting lower spreads, partially 
offset by higher investment revenues. For additional 
information on the results of operations of Latin America GCB 
and Asia GCB in 2021, including the impacts of FX 
translation, see “Global Consumer Banking—Latin America 
GCB” and “Global Consumer Banking—Asia GCB” below.

(1)  Revenue previously referred to as net interest revenue is now referred to as net interest income. During the fourth quarter of 2021, Citi reclassified deposit 

insurance expenses from Interest expense to Other operating expenses for all periods presented. Amounts reclassified for each year were $1,207 million for 2021, 
$1,203 million for 2020, $781 million for 2019, $1,182 million for 2018 and $1,249 million for 2017. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
(2)  2017 includes the one-time impact related to enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform). 2020, 2019 and 2018 reflect the tax rate structure post Tax 

Reform. RoTCE for 2017 excludes the one-time impact from Tax Reform and is a non-GAAP financial measure. For additional information, see “Significant 
Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—Income Taxes” below. 

(3)  The return on average common stockholders’ equity is calculated using net income less preferred stock dividends divided by average common stockholders’ 

equity. The return on average total Citigroup stockholders’ equity is calculated using net income divided by average Citigroup stockholders’ equity.

(4)  RoTCE and TBV are non-GAAP financial measures. For information on RoTCE and TBV, see “Capital Resources—Tangible Common Equity, Book Value Per 

Share, Tangible Book Value Per Share and Returns on Equity” below.

(5)  Citi’s risk-based capital and leverage ratios for 2017 are non-GAAP financial measures, which reflect full implementation of regulatory capital adjustments and 

deductions prior to the effective date of January 1, 2018.

(6)  Citi’s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach, and the reportable Total Capital 
ratio was the lower derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2019 to 2017. Citi’s reportable 
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios were the lower derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework as of 
December 31, 2020. 

(7)  Dividends declared per common share as a percentage of net income per diluted share.
(8)  Total common dividends declared plus common share repurchases as a percentage of net income available to common shareholders (Net income, less preferred 

dividends). See “Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity,” Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “Equity Security 
Repurchases” below for the component details.

The amount and types of Markets revenues are impacted 
by a variety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity; 
changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign 
exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit 
spreads, as well as their implied volatilities; investor 
confidence and other macroeconomic conditions. Assuming 
all other market conditions do not change, increases in client 
activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in increases 
in revenues. However, changes in market conditions can 
significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads and 
the fair value of product inventory. For example, a decrease in 
market liquidity may increase bid/offer spreads, decrease 
client activity levels and widen credit spreads on product 
inventory positions. 

ICG’s management of the Markets businesses involves 
daily monitoring and evaluation of the above factors at the 
trading desk as well as the country level. 

In the Markets businesses, client revenues are those 
revenues directly attributable to client transactions at the time 
of inception, including commissions, interest or fees earned. 
Client revenues do not include the results of client facilitation 
activities (e.g., holding product inventory in anticipation of 
client demand) or the results of certain economic hedging 
activities.

ICG’s international presence is supported by trading 
floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network 
in 95 countries and jurisdictions. At December 31, 2021, ICG 
had $1.8 trillion in assets and $950 billion in deposits. 
Securities services and issuer services managed $24.0 trillion 
in assets under custody and administration at December 31, 
2021, of which Citi provides both custody and administrative 
services to certain clients related to $1.9 trillion of such assets. 
Managed assets under trust were $3.8 trillion at December 31, 
2021. For additional information on these operations, see 
“Administration and Other Fiduciary Fees” in Note 5 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS GROUP

As of December 31, 2021, Institutional Clients Group (ICG) 
included Banking and Markets and securities services (for 
additional information on these businesses, see “Citigroup 
Segments” above). ICG provided corporate, institutional, 
public sector and high-net-worth clients around the world with 
a full range of wholesale banking products and services, 
including fixed income and equity sales and trading, foreign 
exchange, prime brokerage, derivative services, equity and 
fixed income research, corporate lending, investment banking 
and advisory services, private banking, cash management, 
trade finance and securities services. ICG transacted with 
clients in both cash instruments and derivatives, including 
fixed income, foreign currency, equity and commodity 
products.

For information on Citi’s planned revision to its reporting 
structure, including the reporting of the private bank as part of 
a new reporting segment, Personal Banking and Wealth 
Management, see “Strategic Refresh—Market Exits and 
Planned Revision to Reporting Structure” above.

ICG revenue is generated primarily from fees and spreads 

associated with these activities. ICG earns fee income for 
assisting clients with transactional services and clearing and 
providing brokerage and investment banking services and 
other such activities. Such fees are recognized at the point in 
time when Citigroup’s performance under the terms of a 
contractual arrangement is completed, which is typically at the 
trade/execution date or closing of a transaction. Revenue 
generated from these activities is recorded in Commissions 
and fees and Investment banking. Revenue is also generated 
from assets under custody and administration, which is 
recognized as/when the associated promised service is 
satisfied, which normally occurs at the point in time the 
service is requested by the customer and provided by Citi. 
Revenue generated from these activities is primarily recorded 
in Administration and other fiduciary fees. For additional 
information on these various types of revenues, see Note 5 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In addition, as a market maker, ICG facilitates 
transactions, including holding product inventory to meet 
client demand, and earns the differential between the price at 
which it buys and sells the products. These price differentials 
and the unrealized gains and losses on the inventory are 
recorded in Principal transactions. Mark-to-market gains and 
losses on certain credit derivatives (used to hedge the 
corporate loan portfolio) are also recorded in Principal 
transactions (for additional information on Principal 
transactions revenue, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements). Other primarily includes realized gains and losses 
on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, gains and losses on 
equity securities not held in trading accounts and other non-
recurring gains and losses. Interest income earned on assets 
held, less interest paid on long- and short-term debt and to 
customers on deposits, is recorded as Net interest income.

(1)  Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the private bank and corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. 

Gains (losses) on loan hedges include the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. The 
fixed premium costs of these hedges are netted against the private bank and corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. Gains (losses) on 
loan hedges include $(131) million and $(74) million related to the corporate loan portfolio and $(13) million and $23 million related to the private bank for the 
years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. All of gains (losses) on loan hedges are related to the corporate loan portfolio for the year ended 
December 31, 2019. Citigroup’s results of operations excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.

(2)  2019 includes an approximate $350 million gain on Citi’s investment in Tradeweb. 
(3)  Excludes principal transactions revenues of ICG businesses other than Markets, primarily treasury and trade solutions and the private bank.
(4)  Citi assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items. For example, securities that generate Net 

interest income may be risk managed by derivatives that are recorded in Principal transactions revenue. For a description of the composition of these revenue line 
items, see Notes 4, 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The discussion of the results of operations for ICG below excludes (where noted) the impact of gains (losses) on hedges of accrual 
loans, which are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.

2021 vs. 2020
Net income of $15.7 billion increased 36% versus the prior 
year, primarily driven by lower cost of credit, partially offset 
by higher expenses and lower revenues.

Revenues decreased 3%, reflecting lower Markets and 
securities services revenues, partially offset by higher Banking 
revenues. Banking revenues were up 7% (both including and 
excluding the impact of losses on loan hedges), driven by 
higher revenues in investment banking and the private bank, 
partially offset by lower revenues in treasury and trade 
solutions and corporate lending. Markets and securities 
services revenues were down 11%, primarily reflecting a 
normalization in fixed income markets revenues, partially 
offset by growth in equity markets and securities services.

Citi expects that revenues in its markets and investment 
banking businesses will continue to reflect the overall market 
environment during 2022.

Within Banking:

•

•

•

•

Investment banking revenues were up 30%, reflecting 
growth in the overall market wallet. Advisory revenues 
increased 78%, reflecting strength in North America and 
EMEA, driven by growth in the market wallet as well as 
wallet share gains. Equity underwriting revenues 
increased 53%, reflecting strength in North America and 
EMEA, driven by growth in the market wallet, as well as 
wallet share gains. Debt underwriting revenues increased 
3%, reflecting strength in EMEA, as growth in the market 
wallet was partially offset by a decline in wallet share.
Treasury and trade solutions revenues decreased 4% 
(both including and excluding the impact of FX 
translation), reflecting a decline in revenues in the cash 
business, partially offset by an increase in trade revenues. 
Cash revenues decreased, driven by the ongoing impact of 
lower deposit spreads. The decrease was partially offset 
by strong growth in fee revenues reflecting solid client 
engagement and growth in transaction volumes, including 
growth in USD clearing, commercial cards and cross-
border solutions. The increase in trade revenues was 
driven by improved trade spreads and growth in loans, 
reflecting an increase in trade flows and originations, 
primarily in Asia and EMEA. Average trade loans 
increased 5% (both including and excluding the impact of 
FX translation).
Corporate lending revenues decreased 3%, including the 
impact of losses on loan hedges. Excluding the impact of 
losses on loan hedges, revenues decreased 1%, as lower 
cost of funds was more than offset by lower loan volumes, 
reflecting muted demand given strong client liquidity 
positions. Average loans decreased 20% during the 
current year. 
Private bank revenues increased 5%. Excluding the 
impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, revenues 
increased 6%, driven by strong performance in North 
America and EMEA. The higher revenues reflected 
continued momentum with new and existing clients, 

17

resulting in higher loan volumes and spreads, higher 
managed investments revenues and higher deposit 
volumes. The increase in revenues was partially offset by 
lower deposit spreads due to the ongoing low interest rate 
environment and lower capital markets revenue.

Within Markets and securities services:

•

•

•

Fixed income markets revenues decreased 22%, reflecting 
lower revenues across all regions, largely driven by a 
comparison to a strong prior year, as well as a 
normalization in market activity, particularly in rates and 
currencies, and spread products. Non-interest revenues 
decreased, reflecting lower investor client activity across 
rates and currencies and spread products. Net interest 
income also decreased, largely reflecting a change in the 
mix of trading positions. 

Rates and currencies revenues decreased 27%, driven 
by the normalization in market activity, and a comparison 
to a strong prior year that included elevated levels of 
volatility related to the pandemic. Spread products and 
other fixed income revenues decreased 11%, driven by a 
comparison to a strong prior year and the normalization in 
market activity, particularly in flow trading and structured 
products, reflecting lower volatility and spreads, partially 
offset by strong securitization activity. 
Equity markets revenues increased 25%, driven by growth 
across all products. Equity derivatives revenues increased 
reflecting higher client activity, particularly in EMEA and 
North America. Prime finance revenues increased due to 
favorable market conditions as well as growth in client 
balances. Cash equities revenues increased modestly, 
reflecting higher client activity. Non-interest revenues 
increased, primarily due to higher principal transactions 
revenues, reflecting higher client activity.
Securities services revenues increased 6%. Excluding the 
impact of FX translation, revenues increased 7%, as an 
increase in fee revenues with both new and existing 
clients, driven by growth in assets under custody and 
settlement volumes, was partially offset by lower deposit 
spreads.

Expenses were up 8%, primarily driven by continued 
investments in Citi’s transformation, business-led investments 
and higher incentive compensation, as well as transactional 
related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. 

Provisions reflected a benefit of $2.9 billion compared to 

costs of $5.6 billion in the prior year, driven by an ACL 
release and lower net credit losses.

Net credit losses declined to $396 million from $987 
million in the prior year, driven by improvements in portfolio 
credit quality.

The ACL release was $3.3 billion compared to a build of 
$4.6 billion in the prior year. The release was primarily driven 
by improvements in portfolio credit quality as well as Citi’s 
improved macroeconomic outlook. For additional information 

on Citi’s ACL, see “Significant Accounting Policies and 
Significant Estimates” below.

GLOBAL CONSUMER BANKING

As of December 31, 2021, Global Consumer Banking (GCB) consisted of consumer banking businesses in North America, Latin 
America (consisting of Citi’s consumer banking business in Mexico) and Asia. GCB provided traditional banking services to retail 
customers through retail banking, branded cards and, in the U.S., retail services (for information on consumer market exits related to 
Latin America GCB and Asia GCB as well as Citi’s planned revision to its reporting structure, see “Strategic Refresh—Market Exits 
and Planned Revision to Reporting Structure” above). 

GCB’s markets in the U.S., Mexico and Asia had a combined 2,154 branches in 19 countries and jurisdictions as of December 31, 
2021. At December 31, 2021, GCB had $267 billion in loans and $362 billion in retail banking deposits (excluding approximately $10 
billion of loans and $8 billion of deposits reclassified to held-for-sale as a result of Citi’s agreements to sell its consumer banking 
businesses in Australia and the Philippines).

2021 vs. 2020 
Net income was $5.9 billion, compared to a net loss of $46 
million in the prior year, reflecting significantly lower cost of 
credit, partially offset by lower revenues and higher expenses.
Revenues decreased 9%, reflecting lower revenues in 

retail banking, branded cards and retail services.

Retail banking revenues decreased 7%, as the benefit of 
strong deposit growth and growth in assets under management 
(increase of 8%, reflecting favorable market conditions and 
strong client engagement) was more than offset by lower 
deposit spreads, as well as lower mortgage revenues. Average 
deposits increased 17%, driven by higher levels of consumer 
liquidity due to government stimulus, as well as continued 
strategic efforts to drive organic growth. 

Cards revenues decreased 10%. Branded cards revenues 
decreased 7%, primarily driven by continued higher payment 
rates, reflecting increased customer liquidity from government 
stimulus and relief programs, partially offset by higher 
spending-related revenues. Credit card spend volume 
increased 21%, reflecting a continued recovery in sales 
activity from the pandemic-driven low levels in the prior year. 
Retail services revenues decreased 15%, primarily driven 
by lower average loans (down 7%), reflecting higher payment 
rates from the increased customer liquidity from government 
stimulus and relief programs, as well as higher partner 
payments, reflecting higher income sharing as a result of lower 
net credit losses. For additional information on partner 
payments, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. Credit card spend volume increased 18%, 
reflecting a continued recovery in sales activity from the 
pandemic-driven low levels in the prior year.

Expenses increased 6%, primarily driven by continued 
investments in Citi’s transformation, as well as business-led 
investments and higher volume-related expenses, partially 
offset by productivity savings.

Provisions reflected a benefit of $1.0 billion, compared to 
costs of $9.1 billion in the prior year, primarily driven by a net 
ACL release compared to a net ACL build in the prior year, as 
well as lower net credit losses. Net credit losses decreased 
41%, consisting of lower net credit losses in both branded 
cards (down 39% to $1.7 billion) and retail services (down 
46% to $1.2 billion), primarily driven by lower loan volumes 
and improved delinquencies, primarily as a result of the higher 
payment rates. 

The net ACL release was $4.0 billion, compared to a net 
build of $4.1 billion in the prior year, reflecting improvement 
in portfolio credit quality and the continued improvement in 
the macroeconomic outlook. For additional information on 
Citi’s ACL, see “Significant Accounting Policies and 
Significant Estimates” below.

For additional information on North America GCB’s retail 

banking, and its branded cards and retail services portfolios,

LATIN AMERICA GCB

As of December 31, 2021, Latin America GCB provided traditional retail banking and branded card products to consumer and small 
business customers in Mexico through Citibanamex. 

As discussed above, Citi intends to exit its consumer, small business and middle-market banking operations in Mexico. For 
additional information, see Citi’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 11, 2022. For information on Citi’s 
planned revision to its reporting structure, including the reporting of the Mexico consumer, small business and middle-market banking 
operations as part of a new reporting segment, Legacy Franchises, see “Strategic Refresh—Market Exits and Planned Revision to 
Reporting Structure” above.

At December 31, 2021, Latin America GCB had 1,276 retail branches in Mexico, with $8.6 billion in retail banking loans and

(2) Presentation of this metric excluding FX translation is a non-GAAP financial measure.
NM  Not meaningful

The discussion of the results of operations for Latin America GCB below excludes the impact of FX translation for all periods 
presented. Presentations of the results of operations, excluding the impact of FX translation, are non-GAAP financial measures. For a 
reconciliation of certain of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.

2021 vs. 2020 
Net income was $798 million, compared to $250 million in the 
prior year, reflecting significantly lower cost of credit and 
modestly lower expenses, partially offset by lower revenues.

Revenues decreased 9%, reflecting lower cards and retail 
banking revenues, largely due to the continued impact of the 
pandemic.

Retail banking revenues decreased 4%, primarily driven 

by lower loan volumes and deposit spreads, partially offset by 
growth in assets under management. Average loans decreased 
13%, reflecting the impact of the pandemic on customer 
activity. Assets under management increased 8%, reflecting 
favorable market conditions, as well as strong client 
engagement.

Cards revenues decreased 21%, primarily driven by lower 

average loans (down 11%), reflecting higher payment rates. 
Credit card spend volume increased 16%, reflecting a 
continued recovery in sales activity from the pandemic-driven 
low levels in the prior year.

Expenses decreased 2%, as productivity savings more 
than offset continued investments in Citi’s transformation. 
Provisions of $174 million decreased 87%, primarily 
driven by a net ACL release compared to a net ACL build in 
the prior year, partially offset by higher net credit losses 
resulting from pandemic-related charge-offs.

The net ACL release was $826 million, compared to a 
build of $329 million in the prior year. The release reflected an 
improvement in portfolio credit quality, as well as continued 
improvement in the macroeconomic outlook and lower loan 
volumes. For additional information on Citi’s ACL, see 
“Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” 
below.

For additional information on Latin America GCB’s retail 

banking and its branded cards portfolios, see “Credit Risk—

ASIA GCB

As of December 31, 2021, Asia GCB provided traditional retail banking and branded card products to retail and small business 
customers. Included within Asia GCB were traditional retail banking and branded card products provided to retail customers in certain 
EMEA countries, primarily the UAE, Poland and Russia. 

As discussed above, Citi is pursuing exits of its consumer franchises in 13 markets across Asia and EMEA and will focus its 
consumer banking franchise in the two regions on four wealth centers: Singapore, Hong Kong, the UAE and London. In 2021, Citi 
entered into agreements to sell its consumer banking businesses in Australia and the Philippines, and made a decision to wind down 
and close its Korea consumer banking business (for additional information, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 

In addition, in January 2022, Citi entered into agreements to sell its consumer banking businesses in Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, 

Thailand and Vietnam. For information on Citi’s planned revision to its reporting structure, including the reporting of the 13 exit 
markets as part of a new reporting segment, Legacy Franchises, see “Strategic Refresh—Market Exits and Planned Revision to 
Reporting Structure” above.

At December 31, 2021, on a combined basis, the businesses had 220 retail branches, $58.9 billion in retail banking loans and 
$117.7 billion in deposits. In addition, the businesses had $13.1 billion in outstanding card loan balances. These amounts exclude 
approximately $10 billion of loans ($7 billion of retail banking loans and $3 billion of credit card loan balances) and $8 billion of 
deposits reclassified to held-for-sale (HFS) as a result of Citi’s agreements to sell its consumer banking businesses in Australia and the 
Philippines. Australia and the Philippines are the only consumer businesses reclassified as HFS at December 31, 2021. For additional 
information, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The discussion of the results of operations for Asia GCB below excludes the impact of FX translation for all periods presented. 
Presentations of the results of operations, excluding the impact of FX translation, are non-GAAP financial measures. For a 
reconciliation of certain of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.

2021 vs. 2020
Net loss was $675 million, compared to net income of $475 
million in the prior year. The net loss included the following 
items related to the 13 exit markets: (i) approximately $1.1 
billion (approximately $0.8 billion after-tax) related to charges 
incurred from the voluntary early retirement program (VERP) 
in connection with the wind-down of the Korea consumer 
banking business; (ii) an approximate $0.7 billion pretax loss 
($0.6 billion after-tax) related to the agreement to sell the 
Australia consumer banking business, largely reflecting the 
impact of a CTA loss (net of hedges); and (iii) contract 
modification costs related to the Asia divestitures of $119 
million ($98 million after-tax).  

Excluding the above items, net income was $807 million 

compared to net income of $475 million in the prior year, 
reflecting significantly lower cost of credit, partially offset by 
higher expenses and lower revenues.

Revenues decreased 16%, including the Australia loss on 
sale. Excluding the Australia loss on sale, revenues declined 
6%, reflecting lower retail banking and cards revenues, largely 
due to the continued impact of the pandemic, including lower 
interest rates. 

Retail banking revenues decreased 22%, including the 
Australia loss on sale. Excluding the Australia loss on sale, 
revenues decreased 7%, as growth in both investment 
revenues and deposits was more than offset by lower deposit 
spreads due to lower interest rates and lower FX and insurance 
revenues. Assets under management increased 3%, reflecting 
the impact of improved market conditions, as well as client 
engagement. Average deposits increased 6% and average 
loans decreased 2%. The decline in retail banking revenues 
was also impacted by a 3% decrease in retail lending revenues, 
reflecting a decline in personal loans driven by spread 
compression.

Cards revenues decreased 5%, as lower average loans 
(down 14%, including the reclassification to held-for-sale 
related to Australia and the Philippines and higher payment 
rates) were partially offset by higher spending-related 
revenues (credit card spend volume up 8%), reflecting a 
continued recovery in sales activity from the pandemic-driven 
low levels in the prior year.

Expenses increased 30%, including approximately $1.2 
billion of costs related to the Asia divestitures. Excluding the 
costs related to the Asia divestitures, expenses increased 6%, 
primarily driven by continued investments in Citi’s 
transformation, as well as business-led investments, partially 
offset by productivity savings.

Provisions decreased 74%, primarily driven by a net ACL 
release compared to a net ACL build in the prior year, as well 
as lower net credit losses. Net credit losses decreased 10%, 
primarily reflecting lower cards loan volumes and improved 
delinquencies.

The net ACL release was $376 million, compared to a 
build of $528 million in the prior year. The release reflected an 
improvement in portfolio credit quality. For additional 
information on Citi’s ACL, see “Significant Accounting 
Policies and Significant Estimates” below.

portfolios and its branded cards portfolios, see “Credit Risk—

CORPORATE/OTHER

Activities not assigned to the operating segments (ICG and GCB) are included in Corporate/Other. As of December 31, 2021, 
Corporate/Other included certain unallocated costs of global staff functions (including certain finance, risk, human resources, legal 
and compliance), other corporate expenses and unallocated global operations and technology expenses and income taxes, as well as 
results of Corporate Treasury, certain North America legacy consumer loan portfolios, discontinued operations and other legacy assets. 
For information on Citi’s planned revision to its reporting structure, including the reporting of the North America legacy consumer 
loan portfolios, discontinued operations and other legacy assets as part of a new reporting segment, Legacy Franchises, see “Strategic

2021 vs. 2020 
Net income was $215 million, compared to a net loss of $1.1 
billion in the prior year, reflecting higher revenues, lower 
expenses and lower cost of credit. 

Revenues of $667 million compared to $71 million in the 

prior year, primarily driven by higher net revenue from the 
investment portfolio.

Expenses decreased 14%, reflecting the absence of a civil 
money penalty in the prior year and the wind-down of legacy 
assets, partially offset by increases related to Citi’s 
transformation.

Provisions reflected a net benefit of $369 million, 

compared to costs of $178 million in the prior year, primarily 
driven by a net ACL release in the current year ($286 million 
compared to a net build of $200 million in the prior year). The 
release reflected the continued improvement in the 
macroeconomic outlook.

MANAGING GLOBAL RISK

Overview
For Citi, effective risk management is of primary importance 
to its overall operations. Accordingly, Citi’s risk management 
process has been designed to monitor, evaluate and manage 
the principal risks it assumes in conducting its activities. 
Specifically, the activities that Citi engages in, and the risks 
those activities generate, must be consistent with Citi’s 
Mission and Value Proposition and the key principles that 
guide it, as well as Citi's risk appetite. As discussed above, 
Citi is continuing its efforts to comply with the FRB and OCC 
consent orders, relating principally to various aspects of risk 
management, compliance, data quality management and 
governance, and internal controls (see “Citi’s Consent Order 
Compliance” and “Risk Factors—Compliance Risks” above).

Risk management must be built on a foundation of ethical 

culture. Under Citi’s Mission and Value Proposition, which 
was developed by its senior leadership and distributed 
throughout the Company, Citi strives to serve its clients as a 
trusted partner by responsibly providing financial services that 
enable growth and economic progress while earning and 
maintaining the public’s trust by constantly adhering to the 
highest ethical standards. As such, Citi asks all colleagues to 
ensure that their decisions pass three tests: they are in Citi’s 
clients’ interests, create economic value and are always 
systemically responsible. In addition, Citi evaluates 
colleagues’ performance against behavioral expectations set 
out in Citi’s Leadership Principles, which were designed in 
part to effectuate Citi’s Mission and Value Proposition. Other 
culture-related efforts in connection with conduct risk, ethics 
and leadership, escalation and treating customers fairly help 
Citi to execute its Mission and Value Proposition.

Citi has established an Enterprise Risk Management 

(ERM) Framework to ensure that all of Citi’s risks are 
managed appropriately and consistently across Citi and at an 
aggregate, enterprise-wide level. The ERM Framework details 
the principles used to support effective enterprise-wide risk 
management across the end-to-end risk management lifecycle. 
The ERM Framework also provides clarity on the expected 
activities in relation to risk management of the Citigroup 
Board of Directors (the Board), Citi’s Executive Management 
Team (See “Risk Governance—Executive Management 
Team” below) and employees across the lines of defense. The 
underlying pillars of the framework encompass:

•

•

•

Culture—the core principles and behaviors that underpin 
a strong culture of risk awareness, in line with Citi’s 
Mission and Value Proposition, and Leadership 
Principles;
Governance—the committee structure and reporting 
arrangements that support the appropriate oversight of 
risk management activities at the Board and Executive 
Management Team levels;
Risk Management—the end-to-end risk management 
cycle including the identification, measurement, 
monitoring, controlling and reporting of all risks 
including emerging, growing, idiosyncratic or otherwise 
material risks, and aggregated to an enterprise-wide level; 
and

66

•

Enterprise Programs—the key risk management 
programs performed across the risk management lifecycle 
for all risk categories; these programs also outline the 
specific roles played by each of the lines of defense in 
these processes.

Each of these pillars is underpinned by Supporting 
Capabilities, which are the infrastructure, people, technology 
and data, and modelling and analytical capabilities that are in 
place to enable the execution of the ERM Framework.

Citi’s approach to risk management requires that its risk-
taking be consistent with its risk appetite. Risk appetite is the 
aggregate type and level of risk Citi is willing to take in order 
to meet its strategic objectives and business plan. Citi’s Risk 
Appetite Framework sets boundaries for risk-taking and 
consists of a set of risk appetite statements as well as the 
governance processes through which the risk appetite is 
established, communicated, cascaded and monitored.

Citi’s risks are generally categorized and summarized as 

follows:

•

•

Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the decline in 
credit quality (or downgrade risk) or failure of a borrower, 
counterparty, third party or issuer to honor its financial or 
contractual obligations.
Liquidity risk is the risk that Citi will not be able to 
efficiently meet both expected and unexpected current and 
future cash flow and collateral needs without adversely 
affecting either daily operations or financial conditions of 
Citi. 

•

• Market risk (Trading and Non-Trading): Market risk of 
trading portfolios is the risk of loss arising from changes 
in the value of Citi’s assets and liabilities resulting from 
changes in market variables, such as equity and 
commodity prices or credit spreads. Market risk of non-
trading portfolios is the risk to current or projected 
financial condition and resilience arising from movements 
in interest rates and resulting from repricing risk, basis 
risk, yield curve risk and options risk.
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from 
inadequate or failed internal processes, people and 
systems, or from external events. It includes legal risk, 
which is the risk of loss (including litigation costs, 
settlements and regulatory fines) resulting from the failure 
of Citi to comply with laws, regulations, prudent ethical 
standards and contractual obligations in any aspect of 
Citi’s business, but excludes strategic and reputation risks 
(see below).
Compliance risk is the risk to current or projected 
financial condition and resilience arising from violations 
of laws, rules or regulations, or from non-conformance 
with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures 
or ethical standards. 
Reputation risk is the risk to current or projected financial 
conditions and resilience arising from negative public 
opinion. 
Strategic risk is the risk of a sustained impact (not 
episodic impact) to Citi’s core strategic objectives as 
measured by impacts on anticipated earnings, market 
capitalization, or capital, arising from the external factors

Enterprise Level.

and Chief Compliance Officer (CCO)) who have unrestricted 
access to the Citigroup Board of Directors and its Risk 
Management Committee to facilitate the ability to execute 
their specific responsibilities pertaining to escalation to the 
Citigroup Board of Directors.

Citi uses a lines of defense model as a key component of 
its ERM Framework to manage its risks. The lines of defense 
model brings together risk-taking, risk oversight and risk 
assurance under one umbrella and provides an avenue for risk 
accountability of first line of defense, a construct for effective 
challenge by the second line of defense (Independent Risk 
Management and Independent Compliance Risk 
Management), and empowers independent risk assurance by 
the third line of defense (Internal Audit). In addition, Citi has 
enterprise support functions that support safety and soundness 
across Citi. Each of the lines of defense and enterprise support 
functions, along with the Board, are empowered to perform 
relevant risk management processes and responsibilities in 
order to manage Citi’s risks in a consistent and effective 
manner.

First Line of Defense: Front Line Units and Front Line 
Unit Activities
Citi’s first line of defense owns the risks inherent in or arising 
from their business and is responsible for identifying, 
measuring, monitoring, controlling and reporting those risks 
consistent with Citi’s strategy, Mission and Value Proposition, 
Leadership Principles and risk appetite. 

Front line units are responsible and held accountable for 
managing the risks associated with their activities within the 
boundaries set by independent risk management. They are also 
responsible for designing and implementing effective internal 
controls and maintaining processes for managing their risk 
profile, including through risk mitigation, so that it remains 
consistent with Citi’s established risk appetite.

Front line unit activities are considered part of the first 

line of defense and are subject to the oversight and challenge 
of independent risk management. 

The first line of defense is composed of Citi’s Business 

Management, Regional and Country Management, certain 
Corporate Functions (Enterprise Operations and Technology, 
Chief Administrative Office, Global Public Affairs, Office of 
the Citibank Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Finance), as 
well as other front line unit activities. Front line units may also 
include enterprise support units and activities—see “Enterprise 
Support Functions” below.

Second Line of Defense: Independent Risk Management 
Independent risk management units are independent of front 
line units. They are responsible for overseeing the risk-taking 
activities of the first line of defense and challenging the first 
line of defense in the execution of their risk management 
responsibilities. They are also responsible for independently 
identifying, measuring, monitoring, controlling and reporting 
aggregate risks and for setting standards for the management 
and oversight of risk. Independent risk management is 
comprised of Independent Risk Management (IRM) and 
Independent Compliance Risk Management (ICRM) and are 
led by chief risk executives (i.e., Chief Risk Officer (CRO) 

67

Independent Risk Management
The IRM organization sets risk and control standards for the 
first line of defense and actively manages and oversees 
aggregate credit, market (trading and non-trading), liquidity, 
strategic, operational and reputation risks across Citi, 
including risks that span categories, such as concentration risk, 
country risk and climate risk. 

IRM is organized to align to risk categories, legal entities/
regions and Company-wide, cross-risk functions or processes 
(i.e., foundational areas). There are teams that report to an 
independent CRO for various risk categories and legal entities/
regions. In addition, there are foundational teams that report to 
Foundational Risk Management heads. The Risk Category, 
Legal Entity/Regional CROs and Foundational Risk 
Management Heads report to the Citigroup CRO.

Independent Compliance Risk Management 
The ICRM organization actively oversees compliance risk 
across Citi, sets compliance risk and control standards for the 
first line of defense to manage compliance risk and promotes 
business conduct and activity that is consistent with Citi’s 
Mission and Value Proposition and the compliance risk 
appetite. Citi’s objective is to embed an enterprise-wide 
compliance risk management framework and culture that 
identifies, measures, monitors, controls and escalates 
compliance risk across Citi. 

ICRM is aligned by product line, function and geography 

to provide compliance risk management advice and credible 
challenge on day-to-day matters and strategic decision-making 
for key initiatives. ICRM also has program-level Enterprise 
Compliance units responsible for setting standards and 
establishing priorities for program-related compliance efforts. 
These Compliance Risk Management heads report directly to 
the CCO.

Third Line of Defense: Internal Audit
Internal Audit is independent of front line units and 
independent risk management units. The role of Internal Audit 
is to provide independent, objective, reliable, valued and 
timely assurance to the Citigroup Board of Directors, its Audit 
Committee, Citi senior management and regulators over the 
effectiveness of governance, risk management and controls 
that mitigate current and evolving risks and enhance the 
control culture within Citi. Internal Audit reports to a chief 
audit executive (i.e., Citi’s Chief Auditor) who has 
unrestricted access to the Board and the board of directors of 
certain subsidiaries or their respective audit committees to 
facilitate the ability to execute specific responsibilities 
pertaining to escalation of risks and issues. The Internal Audit 
function has designated Chief Auditors responsible for 
assessing the design and effectiveness of controls within the 
various business units, functions, geographies and legal 
entities in which Citi operates.

•

•

Ethics, Conduct and Culture Committee: provides 
oversight of Citi’s Conduct Risk Management Program.
Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee: 
provides oversight of reputational issues, Environmental, 
Social and Governance (ESG) and sustainability matters, 
and legal and regulatory compliance risks as they relate to 
corporate governance matters.

In addition to the above, the Board has established the 
following ad hoc committee: 

•

Transformation Oversight Committee: provides oversight 
of the actions of Citi’s management to develop and 
execute a transformation of Citi’s risk and control 
environment pursuant to the recent regulatory consent 
orders (for additional information see “Citi’s Consent 
Order Compliance” above).

The Executive Management Team has established five 
standing committees that cover the primary risks to which Citi 
(i.e., Group) is exposed. These consist of:

•

•

•

•

•

Group Strategic Risk Committee (GSRC): provides 
governance oversight of Citi’s management actions to 
adequately identify, monitor, report, manage and escalate 
all material strategic risks facing Citi. 
Citigroup Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO): 
responsible for governance over management’s Liquidity 
Risk and Market Risk (non-trading) management and for 
monitoring and influencing the balance sheet, investment 
securities and capital management activities of Citigroup.
Group Risk Management Committee (GRMC): provides 
governance oversight of Credit Risk and Market Risk 
(trading) management in the Trading Book.
Group Business Risk and Control Committee (GBRCC): 
provides governance oversight of Citi’s Compliance and 
Operational Risks. 
Group Reputation Risk Committee (GRRC): provides 
governance oversight for Reputation Risk management 
across Citi.

In addition to the Executive Management committees listed 
above, the Board may establish ad-hoc committees in response 
to regulatory feedback or to manage additional activities 
where deemed necessary.

Enterprise Support Functions
Enterprise support functions engage in activities that support 
safety and soundness across Citi. These functions provide 
advisory services and/or design, implement, maintain and 
oversee Company-wide programs that support Citi in 
maintaining an effective control environment. 

Enterprise support functions are comprised of Human 

Resources, International Franchise Management, Legal 
(including Citi Security and Investigative Services). 

Enterprise support functions, units and activities are 
subject to the relevant Company-wide independent oversight 
processes specific to the risk category that they generate (e.g., 
operational risk, compliance risk, reputation risk).

Risk Governance
Citi’s ERM Framework encompasses risk management 
processes to address risks undertaken by Citi through 
identification, measurement, monitoring, controlling and 
reporting of all risks. The ERM Framework integrates these 
processes with appropriate governance to complement Citi’s 
commitment to maintaining strong and consistent risk 
management practices.

Board Oversight
The Board is responsible for oversight of risk management 
and holds the Executive Management Team accountable for 
implementing the ERM Framework and meeting strategic 
objectives within Citi’s risk appetite.

Executive Management Team
The Board delegates authority to an Executive Management 
Team for directing and overseeing day-to-day management of 
Citi. The Executive Management Team is led by the Citigroup 
CEO and provides oversight of group activities, both directly 
and through authority delegated to committees it has 
established to oversee the management of risk, to ensure 
continued alignment with Citi’s strategy and risk appetite.

Board and Executive Management Committees
The Board executes its responsibilities either directly or 
through its committees. The Board has delegated authorities to 
the following Board standing committees to help fulfill its 
oversight and risk management responsibilities:

•

•

•

Risk Management Committee (RMC): assists the Board in 
fulfilling its responsibility with respect to (i) oversight of 
Citi’s risk management framework, including the 
significant policies and practices used in managing credit, 
market, liquidity, strategic, operational, compliance, 
reputation and certain other risks, including those 
pertaining to capital management, and (ii) performance 
oversight of the Global Risk Review—credit, capital and 
collateral review functions.
Audit Committee: provides oversight of Citi’s financial 
reporting and internal control risk, as well as Internal 
Audit and Citi’s external independent accountants.
Personnel and Compensation Committee: provides 
oversight of incentive compensation plans and risk related 
to compensation.

68

The figure below illustrates the reporting lines between the Board and Executive Management committees:

idiosyncratic framework consisting of single name 
concentrations for each business and across Citigroup and a 
specialized framework consisting of product limits.

Credit exposures are generally reported in notional terms 

for accrual loans, reflecting the value at which the loans as 
well as other off-balance sheet commitments are carried on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Credit exposure arising from 
capital markets activities is generally expressed as the current 
mark-to-market, net of margin, reflecting the net value owed 
to Citi by a given counterparty. 

The credit risk associated with these credit exposures is a 

function of the idiosyncratic creditworthiness of the obligor, as 
well as the terms and conditions of the specific obligation. Citi 
assesses the credit risk associated with its credit exposures on 
a regular basis through its Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) 
process (see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant 
Estimates—Allowance for Credit Losses” below and Notes 1 
and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), as well as 
through regular stress testing at the company, business, 
geography and product levels. These stress-testing processes 
typically estimate potential incremental credit costs that would 
occur as a result of either downgrades in the credit quality or 
defaults of the obligors or counterparties. For additional 
information on Citi’s credit risk management, see Note 14 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

CREDIT RISK

Overview
Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the decline in 
credit quality of a client, customer or counterparty (or 
downgrade risk) or the failure of a borrower, counterparty, 
third party or issuer to honor its financial or contractual 
obligations. Credit risk arises in many of Citigroup’s business 
activities, including:

•
•
•
•

consumer, commercial and corporate lending; 
capital markets derivative transactions; 
structured finance; and 
securities financing transactions (repurchase and reverse 
repurchase agreements, and securities loaned and 
borrowed).

Credit risk also arises from clearing and settlement 
activities, when Citi transfers an asset in advance of receiving 
its counter-value or advances funds to settle a transaction on 
behalf of a client. Concentration risk, within credit risk, is the 
risk associated with having credit exposure concentrated 
within a specific client, industry, region or other category.

Credit risk is one of the most significant risks Citi faces as 
an institution. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—
Credit Risk” above. As a result, Citi has an established 
framework in place for managing credit risk across all 
businesses that includes a defined risk appetite, credit limits 
and credit policies. Citi’s credit risk management also includes 
processes and policies with respect to problem recognition, 
including “watch lists,” portfolio reviews, stress tests, updated 
risk ratings and classification triggers. 

With respect to Citi’s clearing and settlement activities, 

intraday client usage of clearing lines is monitored against 
limits, as well as against usage patterns with settlement 
activity monitored daily and intraday for select products. To 
the extent that a problem develops, Citi typically moves the 
client to a secured (collateralized) operating model. Generally, 
Citi’s intraday clearing and settlement lines are uncommitted 
and cancelable at any time.

To manage concentration of risk within credit risk, Citi 

has in place a framework consisting of industry limits, an

CONSUMER CREDIT
Citi fulfills a broad spectrum of customers’ financial needs 
with activities spanning retail banking, wealth management, 
credit card, personal loan, mortgage and small business 
banking through North America GCB. During 2021, Citi also 
provided such activities in 18 countries in Latin America GCB 
and Asia GCB (for information on Citi’s consumer market 
exits in Latin America GCB and Asia GCB, see “Strategic 
Refresh—Market Exits and Planned Revision to Reporting 
Structure” above). The retail banking products include 
consumer mortgages, home equity, personal and small 
business loans and lines of credit and similar related products 
building a generally prime portfolio through well-defined 
lending parameters. Citi uses its risk appetite framework to 
define its lending parameters.

Overall Consumer Credit Trends

Global Consumer Banking

As shown in the chart above, GCB’s net credit loss rate 

decreased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year for the 
fourth quarter of 2021, primarily reflecting the continued 
impact of government stimulus, unemployment benefits and 
consumer relief programs in North America GCB, and a 
decline following the peak charge-offs in Asia GCB and Latin 
America GCB in recent quarters. 

GCB’s 90+ days past due delinquency rate remained 

unchanged quarter-over-quarter. The 90+days past due 
delinquency rate decreased year-over-year, primarily due to 
the continued impacts of government stimulus, unemployment 
benefits and consumer relief programs in North America GCB, 
as well as lower delinquencies in Asia GCB and Latin America 
GCB, following the charge-off of peak delinquencies in recent 
quarters.

North America GCB

North America GCB provides mortgage, home equity, 
small business and personal loans through Citi’s retail banking 
network and card products through branded cards and retail 
services businesses. The retail bank is concentrated in six 
major metropolitan cities in the U.S. (for additional 
information on the U.S. retail bank, see “North America GCB” 
above).

As of December 31, 2021, approximately 74% of North 

America GCB consumer loans consisted of branded and retail 
services cards, which generally drives the overall credit 
performance of North America GCB (for additional 
information on North America GCB’s cards portfolios, 
including delinquency and net credit loss rates, see “Credit 
Card Trends” below).

71

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 
North America GCB for the fourth quarter of 2021 decreased 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily reflecting 
the continued impact of high payment rates in cards, driven by 
government stimulus. 

Year-over-year, the payment rates were also impacted by 

unemployment benefits and consumer relief programs.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate in North America 

GCB increased modestly quarter-over-quarter, primarily due 
to seasonality in cards, while the 90+ days past due 
delinquency rate decreased year-over-year, primarily 
reflecting the continued impact of high payment rates in cards, 
driven by government stimulus.

Latin America GCB

Latin America GCB operates in Mexico through 

Citibanamex and provides credit cards, consumer mortgages 
and small business and personal loans. Latin America GCB 
serves a more mass-market segment in Mexico and focuses on 
developing multiproduct relationships with customers.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 

Latin America GCB for the fourth quarter of 2021 decreased 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. The impact of 
charge-offs of delinquent loans in prior quarters resulted in 
lower delinquencies that led to lower net credit losses in the 
current quarter. 

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. The impact of 
charge-offs of delinquent loans in prior quarters and higher 
payment rates resulted in a lower 90+ days past due 
delinquency rate in the current quarter.

Asia(1) GCB 

(1)  Asia includes GCB activities in certain EMEA countries for all periods 

presented.

North America GCB’s branded cards portfolio includes 

proprietary and co-branded cards. 

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 
North America branded cards for the fourth quarter of 2021 
decreased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily 
reflecting the continued impact of high payment rates, driven 
by government stimulus. Year-over-year, the payment rates 
were also impacted by unemployment benefits and consumer 
relief programs.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate remained 

unchanged quarter-over-quarter and decreased year-over-year, 
primarily reflecting the continued impact of high payment 
rates, driven by government stimulus. Year-over-year, the 
payment rates were also impacted by unemployment benefits 
and consumer relief programs.

North America Retail Services

Retail services partners directly with more than 20 
retailers and dealers to offer private label and co-branded 
cards. Retail services’ target market focuses on select industry 
segments such as home improvement, specialty retail, 
consumer electronics and fuel.

Retail services continually evaluates opportunities to add 

partners within target industries that have strong loyalty, 
lending or payment programs and growth potential.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 
retail services for the fourth quarter of 2021 decreased quarter-
over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily reflecting the 
continued impact of high payment rates, driven by government 
stimulus. Year-over-year, the payment rates were also 
impacted by unemployment benefits and consumer relief 
programs.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-
over-quarter due to seasonality, and decreased year-over-year, 
primarily reflecting the continued impact of high payment 
rates, driven by government stimulus. Year-over-year, the 
payment rates were also impacted by unemployment benefits 
and consumer relief programs.

During 2021, Asia GCB operated in 17 countries and 
jurisdictions in Asia and EMEA and provided credit cards, 
consumer mortgages and small business and personal loans.
As shown in the chart above, the fourth quarter of 2021 

net credit loss rate in Asia GCB decreased quarter-over-
quarter, driven by the charge-off of peak delinquencies in 
recent quarters. Year-over-year, the net credit loss rate 
decreased, as elevated losses during the prior year returned to 
pre-pandemic levels. The decrease was also driven by the 
reclassification of approximately $10 billion of loans to held-
for-sale as a result of Citi’s entry into agreements to sell its 
consumer banking businesses in Australia and the Philippines 
(Asia HFS reclass).

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased 

quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, driven by the charge-
off of peak delinquencies in recent quarters, as elevated losses 
returned to pre-pandemic levels, as well as the impact of the 
Asia HFS reclass.

The performance of Asia GCB’s portfolios continues to 
reflect the strong credit profiles in the region’s target customer 
segments. Regulatory changes in many markets in Asia over 
the past few years have also resulted in improved credit 
quality.

delinquency and other information for Citi’s consumer loan 
portfolios, see each respective business’s results of operations

(1) End-of-period (EOP) loans include interest and fees on credit cards.
(2) The ratios of 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due are calculated based on EOP loans, net of unearned income.
(3) The 90+ days past due balances for North America—branded and North America—retail services are generally still accruing interest. Citigroup’s policy is 

generally to accrue interest on credit card loans until 180 days past due, unless notification of bankruptcy filing has been received earlier.

(4) The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios for North America GCB exclude loans guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies since 

the potential loss predominantly resides with the U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) were 
$185 million ($1.1 billion), $171 million ($0.7 billion) and $135 million ($0.5 billion) at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The amounts excluded 
for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans) were $74 million, $98 million 
and $72 million at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

(5) Asia includes delinquencies and loans in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.
(6) During 2021, Citi’s Australia and the Philippines consumer banking businesses were reclassified as HFS, due to Citi’s entry into agreements to sell the businesses. 
Accordingly, Australia and the Philippines consumer loans are recorded in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and hence the loans and related 
delinquencies and ratios are not included in this table. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

(7) The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are primarily related to U.S. mortgages guaranteed by U.S. 
government-sponsored agencies since the potential loss predominantly resides with the U.S. agencies. The amounts excluded for 90+ days past due EOP loans 
were $138 million ($0.4 billion), $183 million ($0.5 billion) and $172 million ($0.4 billion) at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The amounts 
excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans) were $35 million, 
$73 million and $55 million at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

(3) Asia includes NCLs and average loans in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.
(4) As a result of Citi’s entry into agreements to sell its consumer banking businesses in Australia and the Philippines during 2021, these businesses were reclassified 
as HFS beginning in 2021. As a result of HFS accounting treatment, approximately $6 million of net credit losses (NCLs) was recorded as a reduction in revenue 
(Other revenue) in 2021. Accordingly, these NCLs are not included in this table, as well as Loans HFS that are recorded in Other assets on the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

CORPORATE CREDIT
Consistent with its overall strategy, Citi’s corporate clients are 
typically corporations that value the depth and breadth of 
Citi’s global network. Citi aims to establish relationships with 
these clients that, consistent with client needs, encompass 
multiple products, including cash management and trade 
services, foreign exchange, lending, capital markets and M&A 
advisory. During 2021, Citi’s corporate credit exposures also 
included exposures in the private bank, excluding certain loans 
managed on a delinquency basis. For information on Citi’s 
planned revision to its reporting structure effective for the first 
quarter of 2022, including the reporting of the private bank as 
part of a new reporting segment, Personal Banking and 
Wealth Management, see “Strategic Refresh—Market Exits 
and Planned Revision to Reporting Structure” above.

Corporate Credit Portfolio
The following table details Citi’s corporate credit portfolio 
within ICG (excluding certain loans in the private bank, which 
are managed on a delinquency basis, as well as loans carried at 
fair value and held-for-sale), and before consideration of 
collateral or hedges, by remaining tenor for the periods

The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings 
across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison 
of credit exposure across all lines of business, geographic 
regions and products. Counterparty risk ratings reflect an 
estimated probability of default for a counterparty and are 
derived by leveraging validated statistical models, scorecard 
models and external agency ratings (under defined 
circumstances), in combination with consideration of factors 
specific to the obligor or market, such as management 
experience, competitive position, regulatory environment and 
commodity prices. Facility risk ratings are assigned that reflect 
the probability of default of the obligor and factors that affect 
the loss given default of the facility, such as support or 
collateral. Internal obligor ratings that generally correspond to 
BBB and above are considered investment grade, while those 
below are considered non-investment grade.

Note: Total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending 
commitments. 

In addition to the obligor and facility risk ratings assigned 

to all exposures, Citi may classify exposures in the corporate 
credit portfolio. These classifications are consistent with Citi’s 
interpretation of the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of 
criticized exposures, which may categorize exposures as 
special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss.

Risk ratings and classifications are reviewed regularly, 

and adjusted as appropriate. The credit review process 
incorporates quantitative and qualitative factors, including 
financial and non-financial disclosures or metrics, 
idiosyncratic events or changes to the competitive, regulatory 
or macroeconomic environment. This includes but is not 
limited to exposures in those sectors significantly impacted by 
the pandemic (including consumer retail, commercial real 
estate and transportation). 

Citi believes the corporate credit portfolio to be 

appropriately rated and classified as of December 31, 2021. 
Since the onset of the pandemic, Citi has taken action to adjust 
internal ratings and classifications of exposures as both the 
macroeconomic environment and obligor-specific factors have 
changed, particularly where additional stress has been seen. 

As obligor risk ratings are downgraded, the probability of 

default increases. Downgrades of obligor risk ratings tend to 
result in a higher provision for credit losses. In addition, 
downgrades may result in the purchase of additional credit 
derivatives or other risk mitigants to hedge the incremental 
credit risk, or may result in Citi’s seeking to reduce exposure 
to an obligor or an industry sector. Citi will continue to review 
exposures to ensure that the appropriate probability of default 
is incorporated into all risk assessments.

For additional information on Citi’s corporate credit 

portfolio, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.

Exposure to Commercial Real Estate
As of December 31, 2021, ICG’s total corporate credit 
exposure to commercial real estate (CRE) was $66 billion, 
with $44 billion consisting of direct outstanding funded loans 
(mainly included in the real estate and private bank categories 
in the above table), or 7% of Citi’s total outstanding loans. In 
addition, as of December 31, 2021, more than 70% of ICG’s 
total corporate CRE exposure was to borrowers in the U.S. 
Also as of December 31, 2021, approximately 77% of ICG’s 
total corporate CRE exposure was rated investment grade.

As of December 31, 2021, the ACLL was 0.9% of funded 

CRE exposure, including 2.4% of funded non-investment-
grade exposure.

Of the total CRE exposure:

•

•

•

•

$20 billion ($12 billion of direct outstanding funded 
loans) relates to Community Reinvestment Act-related 
lending provided pursuant to Citi’s regulatory 
requirements to meet the credit needs of borrowers in low 
and moderate income neighborhoods.
$20 billion ($16 billion of direct outstanding funded 
loans) relates to exposure secured by mortgages on 
underlying properties or in well-rated securitization 
exposures.
$15 billion ($5 billion of direct outstanding funded loans) 
relates to unsecured loans to large REITs, with nearly 
74% of the exposure rated investment grade.
$11 billion ($11 billion of direct outstanding funded 
loans) relates to CRE exposure in the private bank, of 
which 100% is secured by mortgages. In addition, 48% of 
the exposure is also full recourse to the client. As of 
December 31, 2021, 82% of the exposure was rated 
investment grade.

Credit Risk Mitigation
As part of its overall risk management activities, Citi uses 
credit derivatives and other risk mitigants to hedge portions of 
the credit risk in its corporate credit portfolio, in addition to 
outright asset sales. Citi may enter into partial-term hedges as 
well as full-term hedges. In advance of the expiration of 
partial-term hedges, Citi will determine, among other factors, 
the economic feasibility of hedging the remaining life of the 
instrument. The results of the mark-to-market and any realized 
gains or losses on credit derivatives are reflected primarily in 
Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of 
Income.

At December 31, 2021, September 30, 2021 and 

December 31, 2020, ICG (excluding the delinquency-managed 
private bank portfolio) had economic hedges on the corporate 
credit portfolio of $39.6 billion, $38.1 billion and 
$38.8 billion, respectively. Citi’s expected credit loss model 
used in the calculation of its ACL does not include the 
favorable impact of credit derivatives and other mitigants that 
are marked to market. In addition, the reported amounts of 
direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments in the 
tables above do not reflect the impact of these hedging 
transactions. The credit protection was economically hedging 
underlying ICG (excluding the delinquency-managed private 
bank portfolio) corporate credit portfolio exposures with the 
following risk rating distribution:

(1)  North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Mexico is included in offices outside North America. The classification between offices in North 

America and outside North America is based on the domicile of the booking unit. The difference between the domicile of the booking unit and the domicile of the 
managing unit is not material.

(2)  Loans secured primarily by real estate.
(3)  Corporate loans are net of unearned income of ($799) million. Unearned income on corporate loans primarily represents interest received in advance, but not yet 

earned, on loans originated on a discounted basis.

(4)  Based on contractual terms. Repricing characteristics may effectively be modified from time to time using derivative contracts. See Note 22 to the Consolidated 

Financial Statements.

(1) North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Mexico is included in offices outside North America. The classification of corporate loans between 

offices in North America and outside North America is based on the domicile of the booking unit. The difference between the domicile of the booking unit and the 
domicile of the managing unit is not material.

(2) Loans secured primarily by real estate.
(3) Consumer loans are net of unearned income of $659 million, $749 million, $783 million, $742 million and $768 million at December 31, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018 

and 2017, respectively. Unearned income on consumer loans primarily represents unamortized origination fees and costs, premiums and discounts. 

(4) Corporate loans include private bank loans and are net of unearned income of $(799) million, $(844) million, $(814) million, $(855) million and $(794) million at 
December 31, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Unearned income on corporate loans primarily represents interest received in advance, but not yet 
earned, on loans originated on a discounted basis.

(5) Because loans carried at fair value do not have an ACLL, they are excluded from the ACLL ratio calculation.

(1) On January 1, 2020, Citi adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 326, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (CECL). The ASC introduces a new credit 
loss methodology requiring earlier recognition of credit losses while also providing additional disclosure about credit risk. On January 1, 2020, Citi recorded a 
$4.1 billion, or an approximate 29%, pretax increase in the Allowance for credit losses, along with a $3.1 billion after-tax decrease in Retained earnings and a 
deferred tax asset increase of $1.0 billion. This transition impact reflects (i) a $4.9 billion build to the consumer ACL due to longer estimated tenors than under the 
incurred loss methodology under prior U.S. GAAP, net of recoveries; and (ii) a $0.8 billion decrease to the corporate ACL due to shorter remaining tenors, 
incorporation of recoveries and use of more specific historical loss data based on an increase in portfolio segmentation across industries and geographies. See Note 
1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the impact of Citi’s adoption of CECL.

(2) Citi had a change in accounting related to its variable post-charge-off third-party collection costs that was recorded as an adjustment to its January 1, 2020 opening

allowance for credit losses on loans of $443 million. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Includes all adjustments to the allowance for credit losses, such as changes in the allowance from acquisitions, dispositions, securitizations, FX translation, 
purchase accounting adjustments, etc.
2021 includes an approximate $280 million reclass related to Citi’s agreement to sell its consumer banking business in Australia and an approximate $90 million 
reclass related to Citi’s agreement to sell its consumer banking business in the Philippines. Those ACLL were reclassified to Other assets during 2021. 2021 also 
includes a decrease of approximately $134 million related to FX translation.
2020 includes reductions of approximately $4 million related to the transfer to HFS of various real estate loan portfolios. In addition, 2020 includes an increase of 
approximately $97 million related to FX translation.
2019 includes reductions of approximately $42 million related to the sale or transfer to HFS of various loan portfolios. In addition, 2019 includes a reduction of 
approximately $60 million related to FX translation.
2018 includes reductions of approximately $201 million related to the sale or transfer to HFS of various loan portfolios, which include approximately $106 million 
related to the transfer of various real estate loan portfolios to HFS. In addition, 2017 includes an increase of approximately $115 million related to FX translation.
2017 includes reductions of approximately $261 million related to the sale or transfer to HFS of various loan portfolios, which include approximately $106 million 
related to the transfer of various real estate loan portfolios to HFS. In addition, 2017 includes an increase of approximately $115 million related to FX translation.

(9) December 31, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017 exclude $6.1 billion, $6.9 billion, $4.1 billion, $3.2 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, of loans which are 

carried at fair value.

(10) 2020 corporate ACLUC includes a non-provision transfer of $68 million, representing reserves on performance guarantees. The reserves on these contracts were 

reclassified out of the ACL on unfunded lending commitments and into other liabilities.

(11) Represents additional credit reserves recorded as Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
(12) Beginning in 2020, under CECL, the ACLL represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio and troubled debt restructurings. See 
“Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements below. Attribution of the ACLL is made for 
analytical purposes only and the entire ACLL is available to absorb credit losses in the overall portfolio. Prior to 2020, the ACLL represented management’s 
estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio, as well as probable losses related to large individually evaluated impaired loans and TDRs. See “Superseded 
Accounting Principles” in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets and Renegotiated Loans
There is a certain amount of overlap among non-accrual loans 
and assets and renegotiated loans. The following summary 
provides a general description of each category.

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets:

•

•

•

•

•

Corporate and consumer (including commercial banking) 
non-accrual status is based on the determination that 
payment of interest or principal is doubtful.
A corporate loan may be classified as non-accrual and still 
be performing under the terms of the loan structure. Non-
accrual loans may still be current on interest payments. 
Citi’s corporate non-accrual loans were $1.9 billion, $2.4 
billion and $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2021, 
September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 
Of these, approximately 54%, 56% and 59% were 
performing at December 31, 2021, September 30, 2021 
and December 31, 2020, respectively.
Consumer non-accrual status is generally based on aging, 
i.e., the borrower has fallen behind on payments.
Consumer mortgage loans, other than Federal Housing 
Administration (FHA) insured loans, are classified as 
non-accrual within 60 days of notification that the 
borrower has filed for bankruptcy. In addition, home 
equity loans are classified as non-accrual if the related 
residential first mortgage loan is 90 days or more past 
due.
North America branded cards and retail services are not 
included because, under industry standards, credit card 
loans accrue interest until such loans are charged off, 
which typically occurs at 180 days of contractual 
delinquency.

Renegotiated Loans:

•

•

Includes both corporate and consumer loans whose terms 
have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring 
(TDR).
Includes both accrual and non-accrual TDRs.

88

Non-Accrual Loans
The table below summarizes Citigroup’s non-accrual loans as 
of the periods indicated. Non-accrual loans may still be current 
on interest payments. In situations where Citi reasonably 
expects that only a portion of the principal owed will 
ultimately be collected, all payments received are reflected as 
a reduction of principal and not as interest income. For all 
other non-accrual loans, cash interest receipts are generally 
recorded as revenue.

LIQUIDITY RISK

Overview
Adequate and diverse sources of funding and liquidity are 
essential to Citi’s businesses. Funding and liquidity risks arise 
from several factors, many of which are mostly or entirely 
outside Citi’s control, such as disruptions in the financial 
markets, changes in key funding sources, credit spreads, 
changes in Citi’s credit ratings and macroeconomic, 
geopolitical and other conditions. For additional information, 
see “Risk Factors—Liquidity Risks” above.

Citi’s funding and liquidity management objectives are 

aimed at (i) funding its existing asset base, (ii) growing its 
core businesses, (iii) maintaining sufficient liquidity, 
structured appropriately, so that Citi can operate under a 
variety of adverse circumstances, including potential 
Company-specific and/or market liquidity events in varying 
durations and severity, and (iv) satisfying regulatory 
requirements, including, among other things, those related to 
resolution planning (for additional information, see 
“Resolution Plan” and “Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity 
(TLAC)” below). Citigroup’s primary liquidity objectives are 
established by entity, and in aggregate, across two major 
categories:

•

•

Citibank (including Citibank Europe plc, Citibank 
Singapore Ltd. and Citibank (Hong Kong) Ltd.); and
Citi’s non-bank and other entities, including the parent 
holding company (Citigroup Inc.), Citi’s primary 
intermediate holding company (Citicorp LLC), Citi’s 
broker-dealer subsidiaries (including Citigroup Global 
Markets Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Limited. and 
Citigroup Global Markets Japan Inc.) and other bank and 
non-bank subsidiaries that are consolidated into Citigroup 
(including Citibanamex).

At an aggregate Citigroup level, Citi’s goal is to maintain 
sufficient funding in amount and tenor to fully fund customer 
assets and to provide an appropriate amount of cash and high-
quality liquid assets (as discussed below), even in times of 
stress, in order to meet its payment obligations as they come 
due. The liquidity risk management framework provides that 
in addition to the aggregate requirements, certain entities be 
self-sufficient or net providers of liquidity, including in 
conditions established under their designated stress tests.

Citi’s primary funding sources include (i) corporate and 

consumer deposits via Citi’s bank subsidiaries, including 
Citibank, N.A. (Citibank), (ii) long-term debt (primarily senior 
and subordinated debt) mainly issued by Citigroup Inc., as the 
parent, and Citibank, and (iii) stockholders’ equity. These 
sources may be supplemented by short-term borrowings, 
primarily in the form of secured funding transactions.
As referenced above, Citi’s funding and liquidity 

framework ensures that the tenor of these funding sources is of 
sufficient term in relation to the tenor of its asset base. The 
goal of Citi’s asset/liability management is to ensure that there 
is sufficient liquidity and tenor in the liability structure relative 
to the liquidity profile of the assets. This reduces the risk that 
liabilities will become due before assets mature or are 

92

monetized. This excess liquidity is held primarily in the form 
of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA), as set forth in the table 
below. 

Citi’s liquidity is managed via a centralized treasury 

model by Treasury, in conjunction with regional and in-
country treasurers with oversight provided by Independent 
Risk Management and various Asset & Liability Committees 
(ALCOs) at the Citigroup, region, country and business levels. 
Pursuant to this approach, Citi’s HQLA is managed with 
emphasis on asset-liability management and entity-level 
liquidity adequacy throughout Citi.

Citi’s CRO and Chief Financial Officer co-chair 

Citigroup’s ALCO, which includes Citi’s Treasurer and other 
senior executives. The ALCO sets the strategy of the liquidity 
portfolio and monitors portfolio performance (for additional 
information about the ALCO, see “Risk Governance—Board 
and Executive Management Committees” above). Significant 
changes to portfolio asset allocations are approved by the 
ALCO. Citi also has other ALCOs, which are established at 
various organizational levels to ensure appropriate oversight 
for countries, franchise businesses and regions, serving as the 
primary governance committees for managing Citi’s balance 
sheet and liquidity.

As a supplement to ALCO, Citi’s Funding and Liquidity 

Risk Committee (FLRC) is a more focused assembly for 
funding and liquidity risk matters. The FLRC reviews and 
discusses the funding and liquidity risk profile of, as well as 
risk management practices for Citigroup and Citibank and 
reports its findings and recommendations to each relevant 
ALCO as appropriate.

Liquidity Monitoring and Measurement

Stress Testing 
Liquidity stress testing is performed for each of Citi’s major 
entities, operating subsidiaries and/or countries. Stress testing 
and scenario analyses are intended to quantify the potential 
impact of an adverse liquidity event on the balance sheet and 
liquidity position, and to identify viable funding alternatives 
that can be utilized. These scenarios include assumptions 
about significant changes in key funding sources, market 
triggers (such as credit ratings), potential uses of funding and 
macroeconomic, geopolitical and other conditions. These 
conditions include expected and stressed market conditions as 
well as Company-specific events.

Liquidity stress tests are performed to ascertain potential 
mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety 
of time horizons and over different stressed conditions. To 
monitor the liquidity of an entity, these stress tests and 
potential mismatches are calculated with varying frequencies, 
with several tests performed daily.

Given the range of potential stresses, Citi maintains 

contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for 
individual entities. These plans specify a wide range of readily 
available actions for a variety of adverse market conditions or 
idiosyncratic stresses.

Note: The amounts set forth in the table above are presented on an average basis. For securities, the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be 
realized and, therefore, exclude any securities that are encumbered and incorporate any haircuts applicable under the U.S. LCR rule. The table above incorporates 
various restrictions that could limit the transferability of liquidity between legal entities, including Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.
(1)   Foreign government debt includes securities issued or guaranteed by foreign sovereigns, agencies and multilateral development banks. Foreign government debt 

securities are held largely to support local liquidity requirements and Citi’s local franchises and principally include government bonds from Japan, Mexico, South 
Korea, India and Hong Kong.

The table above includes average amounts of HQLA held at 
Citigroup’s operating entities that are eligible for inclusion in 
the calculation of Citigroup’s consolidated Liquidity Coverage 
ratio (LCR), pursuant to the U.S. LCR rules. These amounts 
include the HQLA needed to meet the minimum requirements 
at these entities and any amounts in excess of these minimums 
that are assumed to be transferable to other entities within 
Citigroup. Citigroup’s HQLA increased quarter-over-quarter 
as of the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily reflecting an 
increase in deposits. 

As of December 31, 2021, Citigroup had $961 billion of 

available liquidity resources to support client and business 
needs, including end-of-period HQLA assets; additional 
unencumbered securities, including excess liquidity held at 
bank entities that is non-transferable to other entities within 
Citigroup; and available assets not already accounted for 
within Citi’s HQLA to support Federal Home Loan Bank 
(FHLB) and Federal Reserve Bank discount window 
borrowing capacity.

Short-Term Liquidity Measurement: Liquidity Coverage 
Ratio (LCR)
In addition to internal 30-day liquidity stress testing performed 
for Citi’s major entities, operating subsidiaries and countries, 
Citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the LCR.

The  LCR  is  calculated  by  dividing  HQLA  by  estimated 
net  outflows  assuming  a  stressed  30-day  period,  with  the  net 
outflows determined by standardized stress outflow and inflow 
rates  prescribed  in  the  LCR  rule.  The  outflows  are  partially 
offset  by  contractual  inflows  from  assets  maturing  within  30 
days. Similar to outflows, the inflows are calculated based on 
prescribed  factors  to  various  assets  categories,  such  as  retail 
loans as well as unsecured and secured wholesale lending. The 
minimum LCR requirement is 100%.

 The table below details the components of Citi’s LCR 

calculation and HQLA in excess of net outflows for the 
periods indicated:

Long-Term Liquidity Measurement: Net Stable Funding 
Ratio (NSFR)
As previously disclosed, in October 2020, the U.S. banking 
agencies adopted a final rule to assess the availability of a 
bank’s stable funding against a required level. 

In general, a bank’s available stable funding includes 
portions of equity, deposits and long-term debt, while its 
required stable funding will be based on the liquidity 
characteristics of its assets, derivatives and commitments. 
Standardized weightings are required to be applied to the 
various asset and liabilities classes. The ratio of available 
stable funding to required stable funding is required to be 
greater than 100%. 

The final rule became effective beginning July 1, 2021, 
while public disclosure requirements to report the ratio will 
occur on a semiannual basis beginning June 30, 2023. Citi was 
in compliance with the final rule as of December 31, 2021.

Loans
As part of its funding and liquidity objectives, Citi seeks to 
fund its existing asset base appropriately as well as maintain 
sufficient liquidity to grow its GCB and ICG businesses, 
including its loan portfolio. Citi maintains a diversified 
portfolio of loans to its consumer and institutional clients. The 
table below details the average loans, by business and/or 
segment, and the total end-of-period loans for each of the

On an average basis, loans were largely unchanged both 
year-over-year and sequentially. Excluding the impact of FX 
translation, average loans increased 1% year-over-year and 
were largely unchanged sequentially. On this basis, average 
GCB loans declined 4% year-over-year, primarily reflecting 
the reclassification of loans to held-for-sale as a result of Citi’s

entry into agreements to sell its consumer banking businesses 
in Australia and the Philippines.

Excluding the impact of FX translation, average ICG 
loans increased 5% year-over-year. Loans in corporate lending 
declined 12% on an average basis, reflecting net repayments 
as Citi continued to assist its clients in accessing the capital 
markets, as well as lower demand. Private bank loans 
increased 10%, largely driven by increased secured lending to 
high-net-worth clients. Markets and securities services loans 
increased 29%, reflecting an increase in securitization 
financing. TTS loans increased 15%, reflecting an increase in 
trade flows and originations. 

Average Corporate/Other loans continued to decline 

(down 46%), driven by the wind-down of legacy assets.

Long-Term Debt 
Long-term debt (generally defined as debt with original 
maturities of one year or more) represents the most significant 
component of Citi’s funding for the Citigroup parent company 
and Citi’s non-bank subsidiaries and is a supplementary source 
of funding for the bank entities. 

Long-term debt is an important funding source due in part 

to its multiyear contractual maturity structure. The weighted-
average maturity of unsecured long-term debt issued by 
Citigroup and its affiliates (including Citibank) with a 
remaining life greater than one year was approximately 
8.6 years as of December 31, 2021, unchanged from the prior 
quarter and the prior year. The weighted-average maturity is 
calculated based on the contractual maturity of each security. 
For securities that are redeemable prior to maturity at the 
option of the holder, the weighted-average maturity is 
calculated based on the earliest date an option becomes 
exercisable.

Citi’s long-term debt outstanding at the Citigroup parent 

company includes benchmark senior and subordinated debt 
and what Citi refers to as customer-related debt, consisting of 
structured notes, such as equity- and credit-linked notes, as 
well as non-structured notes. Citi’s issuance of customer-
related debt is generally driven by customer demand and 
complements benchmark debt issuance as a source of funding 
for Citi’s non-bank entities. Citi’s long-term debt at the bank 
includes Citibank benchmark senior debt, FHLB borrowings 
and securitizations.

Note: Amounts represent the current value of long-term debt on Citi’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet that, for certain debt instruments, includes 
consideration of fair value, hedging impacts and unamortized discounts and 
premiums.
(1) Non-bank includes long-term debt issued to third parties by the parent 

holding company (Citigroup) and Citi’s non-bank subsidiaries (including 
broker-dealer subsidiaries) that are consolidated into Citigroup. As of 
December 31, 2021, non-bank included $65.9 billion of long-term debt 
issued by Citi’s broker-dealer and other subsidiaries, as well as certain 
Citigroup consolidated hedging activities.

(2) Local country and other includes debt issued by Citi’s affiliates in 
support of their local operations. Within non-bank, certain secured 
financing is also included. Within bank, borrowings under certain U.S. 
government-sponsored liquidity programs are also included. 

(3) Predominantly credit card securitizations, primarily backed by branded 

credit card receivables.

As of the fourth quarter of 2021, Citi’s total long-term 
debt outstanding decreased year-over-year, primarily driven 
by declines in unsecured benchmark senior debt at the non-
bank entities and the bank, as well as securitizations and 
FHLB borrowings at the bank. The decrease in total long-term 
debt was partially offset by the issuance of customer-related 
debt at the non-bank entities. Sequentially, long-term debt 
outstanding decreased, driven primarily by decreases in 
unsecured benchmark senior debt at the non-bank entities and 
securitizations at the bank, partially offset by the issuance of 
customer-related debt at the non-bank entities.

As part of its liability management, Citi also has 
considered, and may continue to consider, opportunities to 
redeem or repurchase its long-term debt pursuant to open 
market purchases, tender offers or other means. Such 
redemptions and repurchases help reduce Citi’s overall 
funding costs. During 2021, Citi redeemed or repurchased an 
aggregate of approximately $33.8 billion of its outstanding 
long-term debt.

Citigroup executed an inter-affiliate agreement with 
Citicorp, Citigroup’s operating material legal entities 
and certain other affiliated entities pursuant to which 
Citicorp is required to provide liquidity and capital 
support to Citigroup’s operating material legal entities 
in the event Citigroup were to enter bankruptcy 
proceedings (Citi Support Agreement); 
pursuant to the Citi Support Agreement:

•

•

•

Citigroup made an initial contribution of assets, 
including certain high-quality liquid assets and 
inter-affiliate loans (Contributable Assets), to 
Citicorp, and Citicorp became the business-as-
usual funding vehicle for Citigroup’s operating 
material legal entities;
Citigroup will be obligated to continue to transfer 
Contributable Assets to Citicorp over time, subject 
to certain amounts retained by Citigroup to, among 
other things, meet Citigroup’s near-term cash 
needs; 
in the event of a Citigroup bankruptcy, Citigroup 
will be required to contribute most of its remaining 
assets to Citicorp; and

(iv)

the obligations of both Citigroup and Citicorp under the 
Citi Support Agreement, as well as the Contributable 
Assets, are secured pursuant to a security agreement.

The Citi Support Agreement provides two mechanisms, 
besides Citicorp’s issuing of dividends to Citigroup, pursuant 
to which Citicorp will be required to transfer cash to Citigroup 
during business as usual so that Citigroup can fund its debt 
service as well as other operating needs: (i) one or more 
funding notes issued by Citicorp to Citigroup and (ii) a 
committed line of credit under which Citicorp may make loans 
to Citigroup. 

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)
U.S. GSIBs are required to maintain minimum levels of TLAC 
and eligible LTD, each set by reference to the GSIB’s 
consolidated risk-weighted assets (RWA) and total leverage 
exposure. The intended purpose of the requirements is to 
facilitate the orderly resolution of U.S. GSIBs under the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act. For 
additional information, including Citi’s TLAC and LTD 
amounts and ratios, see “Capital Resources—Current 
Regulatory Capital Standards” and “Risk Factors—
Compliance Risks” above. 

Resolution Plan
Citi is required under Title I of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 
Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank 
Act) and the rules promulgated by the FDIC and Federal 
Reserve Board to periodically submit a plan for Citi’s rapid 
and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the 
event of material financial distress or failure. 

(ii)

On December 17, 2019, the Federal Reserve Board and 

(iii)

FDIC issued feedback on the resolution plans filed on July 1, 
2019 by the eight U.S. Global Systemically Important Banks, 
including Citigroup. The Federal Reserve Board and FDIC 
identified one shortcoming, but no deficiencies, in Citigroup's 
resolution plan relating to governance mechanisms. Based on 
regulatory changes effective December 31, 2019, Citigroup's 
2021 resolution plan submission, which was filed on July 1, 
2021 was a targeted resolution plan, only including a subset of 
the information of a full resolution plan and additional 
information, identified by the Federal Reserve Board and 
FDIC on July 1, 2020. Citigroup will alternate between 
submitting a full resolution plan and a targeted resolution plan 
on a biennial cycle. For additional information on Citi’s 
resolution plan submissions, see “Risk Factors—Strategic 
Risks” above. Citigroup’s preferred resolution strategy is 
“single point of entry” under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 

Under Citi’s preferred “single point of entry” resolution 

plan strategy, only Citigroup, the parent holding company, 
would enter into bankruptcy, while Citigroup’s material legal 
entities (as defined in the public section of its 2021 resolution 
plan, which can be found on the Federal Reserve Board’s and 
FDIC’s websites) would remain operational outside of any 
resolution or insolvency proceedings. Citigroup’s resolution 
plan has been designed to minimize the risk of systemic 
impact to the U.S. and global financial systems, while 
maximizing the value of the bankruptcy estate for the benefit 
of Citigroup’s creditors, including its unsecured long-term 
debt holders. 

In addition, in line with the Federal Reserve Board’s final 
total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) rule, Citigroup believes 
it has developed the resolution plan so that Citigroup’s 
shareholders and unsecured creditors—including its unsecured 
long-term debt holders—bear any losses resulting from 
Citigroup’s bankruptcy. Accordingly, any value realized by 
holders of its unsecured long-term debt may not be sufficient 
to repay the amounts owed to such debt holders in the event of 
a bankruptcy or other resolution proceeding of Citigroup.
The FDIC has also indicated that it was developing a 

single point of entry strategy to implement the Orderly 
Liquidation Authority under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act, 
which provides the FDIC with the ability to resolve a firm 
when it is determined that bankruptcy would have serious 
adverse effects on financial stability in the U.S.

As previously disclosed, in response to feedback received 
from the Federal Reserve Board and FDIC, Citigroup took the 
following actions:

(i)

Citicorp LLC (Citicorp), an existing wholly owned 
subsidiary of Citigroup, was established as an 
intermediate holding company (an IHC) for certain of 
Citigroup’s operating material legal entities;

SECURED FUNDING TRANSACTIONS AND SHORT-
TERM BORROWINGS
Citi supplements its primary sources of funding with short-
term financings that generally include (i) secured funding 
transactions consisting of securities loaned or sold under 
agreements to repurchase, i.e., repos, and (ii) to a lesser extent, 
short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper and 
borrowings from the FHLB and other market participants. 

Secured Funding Transactions
Secured funding is primarily accessed through Citi’s broker-
dealer subsidiaries to fund efficiently both (i) secured lending 
activity and (ii) a portion of the securities inventory held in the 
context of market-making and customer activities. Citi also 
executes a smaller portion of its secured funding transactions 
through its bank entities, which are typically collateralized by 
government debt securities. Generally, daily changes in the 
level of Citi’s secured funding are primarily due to 
fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book 
(as described below) and securities inventory. 

Secured funding of $191 billion as of December 31, 2021 
decreased 3% from the prior-year period and 9% sequentially. 
Excluding the impact of FX translation, secured funding 
decreased 1% from the prior-year period and 8% sequentially, 
driven by normal business activity. The average balance for 
secured funding was approximately $222 billion for the 
quarter ended December 31, 2021.

The portion of secured funding in the broker-dealer 
subsidiaries that funds secured lending is commonly referred 
to as “matched book” activity. The majority of this activity is 
secured by high-quality liquid securities such as U.S. Treasury 

securities, U.S. agency securities and foreign government debt 
securities. Other secured funding is secured by less liquid 
securities, including equity securities, corporate bonds and 
asset-backed securities, the tenor of which is generally equal 
to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding matched book 
assets.

The remainder of the secured funding activity in the 
broker-dealer subsidiaries serves to fund securities inventory 
held in the context of market-making and customer activities. 
To maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market 
conditions, including under periods of stress, Citi manages 
these activities by taking into consideration the quality of the 
underlying collateral and establishing minimum required 
funding tenors. The weighted average maturity of Citi’s 
secured funding of less liquid securities inventory was greater 
than 110 days as of December 31, 2021.

Citi manages the risks in its secured funding by 

conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in 
capacity, tenor, haircut, collateral profile and client actions. In 
addition, Citi maintains counterparty diversification by 
establishing concentration triggers and assessing counterparty 
reliability and stability under stress. Citi generally sources 
secured funding from more than 150 counterparties.

Short-Term Borrowings
Citi’s short-term borrowings of $28 billion as of the fourth 
quarter of 2021 decreased 5% year-over-year, reflecting a 
decline in FHLB advances, and 6% sequentially, primarily 
driven by a decline in structured notes (see Note 17 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on 
Citigroup’s and its affiliates’ outstanding short-term 
borrowings).

98

CREDIT RATINGS
Citigroup’s funding and liquidity, funding capacity, ability to 
access capital markets and other sources of funds, the cost of 
these funds and its ability to maintain certain deposits are 
partially dependent on its credit ratings. 

The table below shows the ratings for Citigroup and 
Citibank as of December 31, 2021. While not included in the 
table below, the long-term and short-term ratings of Citigroup 
Global Markets Holding Inc. (CGMHI) were BBB+/A-2 at 
S&P Global Ratings and A+/F1 at Fitch as of December 31, 
2021.

Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades
Ratings downgrades by Moody’s, Fitch or S&P Global 
Ratings could negatively impact Citigroup’s and/or Citibank’s 
funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity, 
including derivative triggers, which could take the form of 
cash obligations and collateral requirements.

The following information is provided for the purpose of 

analyzing the potential funding and liquidity impact to 
Citigroup and Citibank of a hypothetical simultaneous 
ratings downgrade across all three major rating agencies. This 
analysis is subject to certain estimates, estimation 
methodologies, judgments and uncertainties. Uncertainties 
include potential ratings limitations that certain entities may 
have with respect to permissible counterparties, as well as 
general subjective counterparty behavior. For example, certain 
corporate customers and markets counterparties could re-
evaluate their business relationships with Citi and limit 
transactions in certain contracts or market instruments with 
Citi. Changes in counterparty behavior could impact Citi’s 
funding and liquidity, as well as the results of operations of 
certain of its businesses. The actual impact to Citigroup or 
Citibank is unpredictable and may differ materially from the 
potential funding and liquidity impacts described below. For 
additional information on the impact of credit rating changes 
on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see “Risk Factors—
Liquidity Risks” above.

Citigroup Inc. and Citibank—Potential Derivative Triggers
As of December 31, 2021, Citi estimates that a hypothetical 
one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of 
Citigroup Inc. across all three major rating agencies could 
impact Citigroup’s funding and liquidity due to derivative 
triggers by approximately $0.8 billion, compared to $1.1 
billion as of September 30, 2021. Other funding sources, such 
as secured financing transactions and other margin 
requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could

As of December 31, 2021, Citi estimates that a 
hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-
term rating of Citibank across all three major rating agencies 
could impact Citibank’s funding and liquidity due to 
derivative triggers by approximately $0.6 billion, compared to 
$0.5 billion as of September 30, 2021. Other funding sources, 
such as secured financing transactions and other margin 
requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could 
also be adversely affected.

In total, as of December 31, 2021, Citi estimates that a 
one-notch downgrade of Citigroup and Citibank across all 
three major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate 
cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately 
$1.4 billion, compared to $1.6 billion as of September 30, 
2021 (see also Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements). As detailed under “High-Quality Liquid Assets” 
above, Citigroup has various liquidity resources available to 
its bank and non-bank entities in part as a contingency for the 
potential events described above.

In addition, a broad range of mitigating actions are 
currently included in Citigroup’s and Citibank’s contingency 
funding plans. For Citigroup, these mitigating factors include, 
but are not limited to, accessing surplus funding capacity from 
existing clients, tailoring levels of secured lending and 
adjusting the size of select trading books and collateralized 
borrowings at certain Citibank subsidiaries. Mitigating actions 
available to Citibank include, but are not limited to, selling or 
financing highly liquid government securities, tailoring levels 
of secured lending, adjusting the size of select trading assets, 
reducing loan originations and renewals, raising additional 
deposits or borrowing from the FHLB or central banks. Citi 
believes these mitigating actions could substantially reduce the 
funding and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades 
described above.

Citibank—Additional Potential Impacts
In addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a 
potential downgrade of Citibank’s senior debt/long-term rating 
across any of the three major rating agencies could also have 
an adverse impact on the commercial paper/short-term rating 
of Citibank. Citibank has provided liquidity commitments to 
consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits, 
primarily in the form of asset purchase agreements. As of 
December 31, 2021, Citibank had liquidity commitments of 
approximately $9.0 billion to consolidated asset-backed 
commercial paper conduits, compared to $10.0 billion as of 
September 30, 2021 (for additional information, see Note 21 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

In addition to the above-referenced liquidity resources of 

certain Citibank entities, Citibank could reduce the funding 
and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades 
described above through mitigating actions, including 
repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial 
paper conduits. In the event of the potential downgrades 
described above, Citi believes that certain corporate customers 
could re-evaluate their deposit relationships with Citibank. 
This re-evaluation could result in clients adjusting their 
discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository 
institution, which could potentially reduce certain deposit 
levels at Citibank. However, Citi could choose to adjust 
pricing, offer alternative deposit products to its existing 
customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers, in 
addition to the mitigating actions referenced above.

assumptions. The changes include, among other things, 
assumptions around the projected balance sheet (being more 
static), coupled with revisions to the treatment of certain 
business contributions to IRE, mainly accrual positions in 
ICG’s Markets businesses. These changes are planned for 
2022, and will result in a higher impact to Citi’s NII and AOCI 
and a better reflection of the nature of the portfolios. 

In order to manage changes in interest rates effectively, 

Citi may modify pricing on new customer loans and deposits, 
purchase fixed-rate securities, issue debt that is either fixed or 
floating or enter into derivative transactions that have the 
opposite risk exposures. Citi regularly assesses the viability of 
these and other strategies to reduce its interest rate risks and 
implements such strategies when it believes those actions are 
prudent. 

Citi manages interest rate risk as a consolidated 

Company-wide position. Citi’s client-facing businesses create 
interest rate-sensitive positions, including loans and deposits, 
as part of their ongoing activities. Citi Treasury aggregates 
these risk positions and manages them centrally. Operating 
within established limits, Citi Treasury makes positioning 
decisions and uses tools, such as Citi’s investment securities 
portfolio, company-issued debt and interest rate derivatives, to 
target the desired risk profile. Changes in Citi’s interest rate 
risk position reflect the accumulated changes in all non-trading 
assets and liabilities, with potentially large and offsetting 
impacts, as well as in Citi Treasury’s positioning decisions.
Citigroup employs additional measurements, including 
stress testing the impact of non-linear interest rate movements 
on the value of the balance sheet, and the analysis of portfolio 
duration and volatility, particularly as they relate to mortgage 
loans and mortgage-backed securities and the potential impact 
of the change in the spread between different market indices.

Interest Rate Risk of Investment Portfolios—Impact 
on AOCI
Citi also measures the potential impacts of changes in interest 
rates on the value of its AOCI, which can in turn impact Citi’s 
common equity and tangible common equity. This will impact 
Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 and other regulatory capital 
ratios. Citi’s goal is to benefit from an increase in the market 
level of interest rates, while limiting the impact of changes in 
AOCI on its regulatory capital position.

AOCI at risk is managed as part of the Company-wide 
interest rate risk position. AOCI at risk considers potential 
changes in AOCI (and the corresponding impact on the 
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio) relative to Citi’s capital 
generation capacity.

MARKET RISK

OVERVIEW
Market risk is the potential for losses arising from changes in 
the value of Citi’s assets and liabilities resulting from changes 
in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange 
rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as 
well as their implied volatilities. Market risk emanates from 
both Citi’s trading and non-trading portfolios. For additional 
information on market risk and market risk management, see 
“Risk Factors” above.

Each business is required to establish, with approval from 
Citi’s market risk management, a market risk limit framework 
for identified risk factors that clearly defines approved risk 
profiles and is within the parameters of Citi’s overall risk 
appetite. These limits are monitored by the Risk organization, 
including various regional, legal entity and business Risk 
Management committees, Citi’s country and business Asset & 
Liability Committees and the Citigroup Risk Management and 
Asset & Liability Committees. In all cases, the businesses are 
ultimately responsible for the market risks taken and for 
remaining within their defined limits.

MARKET RISK OF NON-TRADING PORTFOLIOS 
Market risk from non-trading portfolios stems from the 
potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign 
exchange rates on Citi’s net interest income, and on Citi’s 
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) from 
its debt securities portfolios. Market risk from non-trading 
portfolios also includes the potential impact of changes in 
foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital invested in foreign 
currencies. 

Net Interest Income at Risk
Net interest income, for interest rate exposure purposes, is the 
difference between the yield earned on the non-trading 
portfolio assets (including customer loans) and the rate paid on 
the liabilities (including customer deposits or company 
borrowings). Net interest income is affected by changes in the 
level of interest rates, as well as the amounts and mix of assets 
and liabilities, and the timing of contractual and assumed 
repricing of assets and liabilities to reflect market rates.

Citi’s principal measure of risk to net interest income is 

interest rate exposure (IRE). IRE measures the change in 
expected net interest income in each currency resulting solely 
from unanticipated changes in forward interest rates. 

Citi’s estimated IRE incorporates various assumptions 

including prepayment rates on loans, customer behavior and 
the impact of pricing decisions. For example, in rising interest 
rate scenarios, portions of the deposit portfolio may be 
assumed to experience rate increases that are less than the 
change in market interest rates. In declining interest rate 
scenarios, it is assumed that mortgage portfolios experience 
higher prepayment rates. Citi’s estimated IRE below assumes 
that its businesses and/or Citi Treasury make no additional 
changes in balances or positioning in response to the 
unanticipated rate changes.

Citi is planning to transition the sensitivity analysis for its 

IRE (see the current IRE sensitivity impacts below), 
employing enhanced methodologies and changes to certain

(1) Certain trading-oriented businesses within Citi have accrual-accounted positions that are excluded from the estimated impact to net interest income in the table, 
since these exposures are managed economically in combination with mark-to-market positions. The U.S. dollar interest rate exposure associated with these 
businesses was $(179) million for a 100 bps instantaneous increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2021.
Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.

(2)

The year-over-year increase in the estimated impact to net 

interest income primarily reflected changes in Citi’s balance 
sheet composition and Citi Treasury positioning. The year-
over-year changes in the estimated impact to AOCI and the 
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio primarily reflected the 
impact of the composition of Citi Treasury’s investment and 
derivatives portfolio.

In the event of a parallel instantaneous 100 bps increase in 

interest rates, Citi expects that the negative impact to AOCI 
would be offset in shareholders’ equity through the expected 
recovery of the impact on AOCI through accretion of Citi’s 
investment portfolio over a period of time. As of 
December 31, 2021, Citi expects that the $4.6 billion negative 

impact to AOCI in such a scenario could potentially be offset 
over approximately 27 months.

The following table sets forth the estimated impact to 
Citi’s net interest income, AOCI and the Common Equity 
Tier 1 Capital ratio (on a fully implemented basis) under five 
different changes in interest rate scenarios for the U.S. dollar 
and Citi’s other currencies. The 100 bps downward rate 
scenarios are impacted by the low level of interest rates in 
several countries and the assumption that market interest rates, 
as well as rates paid to depositors and charged to borrowers, 
do not fall below zero (i.e., the “flooring assumption”). The 
rate scenarios are also impacted by convexity related to 
mortgage products.

Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.

As shown in the table above, the magnitude of the impact 

to Citi’s net interest income and AOCI is greater under 
Scenario 2 as compared to Scenario 3. This is because the 
combination of changes to Citi’s investment portfolio, 
partially offset by changes related to Citi’s pension liabilities, 
results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at 
shorter- and intermediate-term maturities.

Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates—Impacts on AOCI 
and Capital
As of December 31, 2021, Citi estimates that an unanticipated 
parallel instantaneous 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar 
against all of the other currencies in which Citi has invested 
capital could reduce Citi’s tangible common equity (TCE) by 
approximately $1.5 billion, or 0.9%, as a result of changes to 
Citi’s FX translation adjustment in AOCI, net of hedges. This 
impact would be primarily due to changes in the value of the 
Mexican peso, Euro, Singapore dollar and Indian rupee.

This impact is also before any mitigating actions Citi may 

take, including ongoing management of its FX translation 
exposure. Specifically, as currency movements change the 
value of Citi’s net investments in foreign currency-
denominated capital, these movements also change the value 
of Citi’s risk-weighted assets denominated in those currencies. 
This, coupled with Citi’s foreign currency hedging strategies, 
such as foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency 
forwards and other currency hedging instruments, lessens the 
impact of foreign currency movements on Citi’s Common 
Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio. Changes in these hedging 
strategies, as well as hedging costs, divestitures and tax 
impacts, can further affect the actual impact of changes in 
foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital as compared to an 
unanticipated parallel shock, as described above.

In addition, the effect of Citi’s ongoing management 

strategies with respect to quarterly changes in foreign 
exchange rates, and the quarterly impact of these changes on 
Citi’s TCE and Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio, are 
shown in the table below. For additional information on the 
changes in AOCI, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.

Note: Revenue previously referred to as net interest revenue is now referred to as net interest income. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2021, Citi reclassified 
deposit insurance expenses (FDIC and other similar insurance assessments outside of the U.S.) from Interest expense to Other operating expenses for all periods 
presented. Amounts reclassified for each year were $1,207 million for 2021, $1,203 million for 2020 and $781 million for 2019. 
(1)

Interest revenue and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments related to the tax-exempt bond portfolio and certain tax-advantaged loan 
programs (based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%) of $192 million, $196 million and $208 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
Interest expense associated with certain hybrid financial instruments, which are classified as Long-term debt and accounted for at fair value, is reported together
with any changes in fair value as part of Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income and is therefore not reflected in Interest expense in the 
table above.

(2)

(3)  The average rate on interest revenue and net interest margin reflects the taxable equivalent gross-up adjustment. See footnote 1 above.
(4)  Citi’s net interest margin (NIM) is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets.

Interest revenue and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments discussed in the table above.

Citi’s net interest income (NII) in the fourth quarter of 
2021 was $10.8 billion ($10.9 billion on a taxable equivalent 
basis), largely unchanged versus the prior year, as a modest 
increase in non-ICG Markets NII (approximately $60 million) 
offset an equivalent decline in ICG Markets (fixed income 
markets and equity markets). Citi’s NIM was 1.98% on a 
taxable equivalent basis in the fourth quarter of 2021, a 
decrease of one basis point from the prior quarter, largely 
reflecting deposit growth. 

Citi’s NII for 2021 decreased 5%, or approximately $2.3 
billion, to $42.5 billion ($42.7 billion on a taxable equivalent 
basis) versus the prior year. The decrease was primarily 
related to a decline in non-ICG Markets NII, largely reflecting 
lower interest rates and lower loan balances. In 2021, Citi’s
NIM was 1.99% on a taxable equivalent basis, compared to 
2.22% in 2020, primarily driven by lower rates and a mix-shift 
in balances.

Market Risk of Trading Portfolios
Trading portfolios include positions resulting from market-
making activities, hedges of certain available-for-sale (AFS) 
debt securities, the CVA relating to derivative counterparties 
and all associated hedges, fair value option loans and hedges 
of the loan portfolio within capital markets origination within 
ICG.

The market risk of Citi’s trading portfolios is monitored 
using a combination of quantitative and qualitative measures, 
including, but not limited to:

•
•
•

factor sensitivities; 
value at risk (VAR); and 
stress testing.

Each trading portfolio across Citi’s businesses has its own 
market risk limit framework encompassing these measures and 
other controls, including trading mandates, new product 
approval, permitted product lists and pre-trade approval for 
larger, more complex and less liquid transactions.

The following chart of total daily trading-related revenue 
(loss) captures trading volatility and shows the number of days 
in which revenues for Citi’s trading businesses fell within 
particular ranges. Trading-related revenue includes trading, net 
interest and other revenue associated with Citi’s trading 
businesses. It excludes DVA, FVA and CVA adjustments 
incurred due to changes in the credit quality of counterparties, 
as well as any associated hedges of that CVA. In addition, it 
excludes fees and other revenue associated with capital 
markets origination activities. Trading-related revenues are 
driven by both customer flows and the changes in valuation of 
the trading inventory. As shown in the chart below, positive 
trading-related revenue was achieved for 95.8% of the trading 
days in 2021.

Daily Trading-Related Revenue (Loss)(1)—Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2021
In millions of dollars

(1)  Reflects the effects of asymmetrical accounting for economic hedges of certain AFS debt securities. Specifically, the change in the fair value of hedging 

derivatives is included in trading-related revenue, while the offsetting change in the fair value of hedged AFS debt securities is included in AOCI and not reflected 
above.

110

Factor Sensitivities
Factor sensitivities are expressed as the change in the value of 
a position for a defined change in a market risk factor, such as 
a change in the value of a U.S. Treasury Bond for a one-basis-
point change in interest rates. Citi’s Global Market Risk 
function, within the Independent Risk Management 
organization, works to ensure that factor sensitivities are 
calculated, monitored and limited for all material risks taken in 
the trading portfolios.

Value at Risk (VAR)
VAR estimates, at a 99% confidence level, the potential 
decline in the value of a position or a portfolio under normal 
market conditions assuming a one-day holding period. VAR 
statistics, which are based on historical data, can be materially 
different across firms due to differences in portfolio 
composition, differences in VAR methodologies and 
differences in model parameters. As a result, Citi believes 
VAR statistics can be used more effectively as indicators of 
trends in risk-taking within a firm, rather than as a basis for 
inferring differences in risk-taking across firms.

Citi uses a single, independently approved Monte Carlo 

simulation VAR model (see “VAR Model Review and 
Validation” below), which has been designed to capture 
material risk sensitivities (such as first- and second-order 
sensitivities of positions to changes in market prices) of 

various asset classes/risk types (such as interest rate, credit 
spread, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks). Citi’s 
VAR includes positions that are measured at fair value; it does 
not include investment securities classified as AFS or HTM. 
For information on these securities, see Note 13 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Citi believes its VAR model is conservatively calibrated 

to incorporate fat-tail scaling and the greater of short-term 
(approximately the most recent month) and long-term (three 
years) market volatility. The Monte Carlo simulation involves 
approximately 450,000 market factors, making use of 
approximately 350,000 time series, with sensitivities updated 
daily, volatility parameters updated intra-monthly and 
correlation parameters updated monthly. The conservative 
features of the VAR calibration contribute an approximate 
33% add-on to what would be a VAR estimated under the 
assumption of stable and perfectly, normally distributed 
markets. 

As set forth in the table below, Citi’s average trading 
VAR decreased $5 million from 2020 to 2021, mainly due to a 
reduction of market volatility, given improved macroeconomic 
conditions, compared to 2020. Citi’s average trading and 
credit portfolio VAR decreased $24 million from 2020 to 2021 
due to VAR volatility recalibration.

(1) Covariance adjustment (also known as diversification benefit) equals the difference between the total VAR and the sum of the VARs tied to each risk type. The 
benefit reflects the fact that the risks within individual and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VAR on a given day will be 
lower than the sum of the VARs relating to each risk type. The determination of the primary drivers of changes to the covariance adjustment is made by an 
examination of the impact of both model parameter and position changes. 

(2)  The total trading VAR includes mark-to-market and certain fair value option trading positions in ICG, with the exception of hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value 

option loans and all CVA exposures. Available-for-sale and accrual exposures are not included.

(3)   The specific risk-only component represents the level of equity and fixed income issuer-specific risk embedded in VAR. 
(4)   The credit portfolio is composed of mark-to-market positions associated with non-trading business units including Citi Treasury, the CVA relating to derivative 
counterparties and all associated CVA hedges. FVA and DVA are not included. The credit portfolio also includes hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value option 
loans and hedges to the leveraged finance pipeline within capital markets origination in ICG.

VAR Model Review and Validation
Generally, Citi’s VAR review and model validation process 
entails reviewing the model framework, major assumptions 
and implementation of the mathematical algorithm. In 
addition, product specific back-testing on portfolios is
periodically completed as part of the ongoing model 
performance monitoring process and reviewed with Citi’s U.S. 
banking regulators. Furthermore, Regulatory VAR back-
testing (as described below) is performed against buy-and-
hold profit and loss on a monthly basis for multiple sub-
portfolios across the organization (trading desk level, ICG 
business segment and Citigroup) and the results are shared 
with U.S. banking regulators.

Material VAR model and assumption changes must be 

independently validated within Citi’s Independent Risk 
Management organization. All model changes, including those 
for the VAR model, are validated by the model validation 
group within Citi’s Model Risk Management. In the event of 
significant model changes, parallel model runs are undertaken 
prior to implementation. In addition, significant model and 
assumption changes are subject to the periodic reviews and 
approval by Citi’s U.S. banking regulators.

Citi uses the same independently validated VAR model 
for both Regulatory VAR and Risk Management VAR (i.e., 
total trading and total trading and credit portfolios VARs) and, 
as such, the model review and validation process for both 
purposes is as described above.

Regulatory VAR, which is calculated in accordance with 
Basel III, differs from Risk Management VAR due to the fact 
that certain positions included in Risk Management VAR are 
not eligible for market risk treatment in Regulatory VAR. The 

112

composition of Risk Management VAR is discussed under 
“Value at Risk” above. The applicability of the VAR model 
for positions eligible for market risk treatment under U.S. 
regulatory capital rules is periodically reviewed and approved 
by Citi’s U.S. banking regulators.

In accordance with Basel III, Regulatory VAR includes 
all trading book-covered positions and all foreign exchange 
and commodity exposures. Pursuant to Basel III, Regulatory 
VAR excludes positions that fail to meet the intent and ability 
to trade requirements and are therefore classified as non-
trading book and categories of exposures that are specifically 
excluded as covered positions. Regulatory VAR excludes 
CVA on derivative instruments and DVA on Citi’s own fair 
value option liabilities. CVA hedges are excluded from 
Regulatory VAR and included in credit risk-weighted assets as 
computed under the Advanced Approaches for determining 
risk-weighted assets.

Regulatory VAR Back-Testing
In accordance with Basel III, Citi is required to perform back-
testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR 
model. Regulatory VAR back-testing is the process in which 
the daily one-day VAR, at a 99% confidence interval, is 
compared to the buy-and-hold profit and loss (i.e., the profit 
and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of 
the day and re-priced the following day). Buy-and-hold profit 
and loss represents the daily mark-to-market profit and loss 
attributable to price movements in covered positions from the 
close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and 
loss excludes realized trading revenue, net interest, fees and 
commissions, intra-day trading profit and loss and changes in 
reserves.

Based on a 99% confidence level, Citi would expect two 

to three days in any one year where buy-and-hold losses 
exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the conservative 
calibration of Citi’s VAR model (as a result of taking the 
greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-tail scaling 
of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer exceptions under 
normal and stable market conditions. Periods of unstable 
market conditions could increase the number of back-testing 
exceptions.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The following graph shows the daily buy-and-hold profit 
and loss associated with Citi’s covered positions compared to 
Citi’s one-day Regulatory VAR during 2021. As of December 
31, 2021, one back-testing exception was observed at the 
Citigroup level.

The difference between the 54.4% of days with buy-and-
hold gains for Regulatory VAR back-testing and the 95.8% of 
days with trading, net interest and other revenue associated 
with Citi’s trading businesses, shown in the histogram of daily 
trading-related revenue below, reflects, among other things, 
that a significant portion of Citi’s trading-related revenue is 
not generated from daily price movements on these positions 
and exposures, as well as differences in the portfolio 
composition of Regulatory VAR and Risk Management VAR.

Regulatory Trading VAR and Associated Buy-and-Hold Profit and Loss(1)—12 Months ended December 31, 2021
In millions of dollars

(1)   Buy-and-hold profit and loss, as defined by the banking regulators under Basel III, represents the daily mark-to-market revenue movement attributable to the 
trading position from the close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue and net interest intra-day trading 
profit and loss on new and terminated trades, as well as changes in reserves. Therefore, it is not comparable to the trading-related revenue presented in the chart of 
daily trading-related revenue above.

113

Stress Testing
Citi performs market risk stress testing on a regular basis to 
estimate the impact of extreme market movements. It is 
performed on individual positions and trading portfolios, as 
well as in aggregate, inclusive of multiple trading portfolios. 
Citi’s market risk management, after consultations with the 
businesses, develops both systemic and specific stress 
scenarios, reviews the output of periodic stress testing 
exercises and uses the information to assess the ongoing 
appropriateness of exposure levels and limits. Citi uses two 
complementary approaches to market risk stress testing across 
all major risk factors (i.e., equity, foreign exchange, 
commodity, interest rate and credit spreads): top-down 
systemic stresses and bottom-up business-specific stresses. 
Systemic stresses are designed to quantify the potential impact 
of extreme market movements on an institution-wide basis, 
and are constructed using both historical periods of market 
stress and projections of adverse economic scenarios. 
Business-specific stresses are designed to probe the risks of 
particular portfolios and market segments, especially those 
risks that are not fully captured in VAR and systemic stresses.
The systemic stress scenarios and business-specific stress 
scenarios at Citi are used in several reports reviewed by senior 
management and also to calculate internal risk capital for 
trading market risk. In general, changes in market values are 
defined over a one-year horizon. For the most liquid positions 
and market factors, changes in market values are defined over 
a shorter two-month horizon. The limited set of positions and 
market factors whose market value changes are defined over a 
two-month horizon are those that in management’s judgment 
have historically remained very liquid during financial crises, 
even as the trading liquidity of most other positions and 
market factors materially declined.

114

OPERATIONAL RISK

Overview
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or 
failed internal processes, people and systems or from external 
events. This includes legal risk, which is the risk of loss 
(including litigation costs, settlements, and regulatory fines) 
resulting from the failure of Citi to comply with laws, 
regulations, prudent ethical standards, and contractual 
obligations in any aspect of its businesses, but excludes 
strategic and reputation risks. Citi also recognizes the impact 
of operational risk on the reputation risk associated with Citi’s 
business activities. 

Operational risk is inherent in Citi’s global business 
activities, as well as related support functions, and can result 
in losses. Citi maintains a comprehensive Citi-wide risk 
taxonomy to classify operational risks that it faces using 
standardized definitions across Citi’s Operational Risk 
Management Framework (see discussion below). This 
taxonomy also supports regulatory requirements and 
expectations inclusive of those related to U.S. Basel III, 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), 
Heightened Standards for Large Financial Institutions and 
Dodd Frank Annual Stress Testing (DFAST). 

Citi manages operational risk consistent with the overall 
framework described in “Managing Global Risk—Overview” 
above. Citi’s goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate 
levels relative to the characteristics of its businesses, the 
markets in which it operates, its capital and liquidity and the 
competitive, economic and regulatory environment. This 
includes effectively managing operational risk and 
maintaining or reducing operational risk exposures within 
Citi’s operational risk appetite.

Citi’s Independent Operational Risk Management group 

has established a global-Operational Risk Management 
Framework with policies and practices for identification, 
measurement, monitoring, managing and reporting operational 
risks and the overall operating effectiveness of the internal 
control environment. As part of this framework, Citi has 
defined its operational risk appetite and established a 
manager’s control assessment (MCA) process for self-
identification of significant operational risks, assessment of 
the performance of key controls and mitigation of residual risk 
above acceptable levels. 

Each major business segment must implement operational 

risk processes consistent with the requirements of this 
framework. This includes:

understanding the operational risks they are exposed to;
designing controls to mitigate identified risks;
establishing key indicators;

•
•
•
• monitoring and reporting whether the operational risk 

•

•

•

exposures are in or out of their operational risk appetite;
having processes in place to bring operational risk 
exposures within acceptable levels; 
periodically estimate and aggregate the operational risks 
they are exposed to; and
ensuring that sufficient resources are available to 
actively improve the operational risk environment and 
mitigate emerging risks.

115

Citi considers operational risks that result from the 
introduction of new or changes to existing products, or result 
from significant changes in its organizational structures, 
systems, processes and personnel. 

Citi has a governance structure for the oversight of 

operational risk exposures through Business Risk and Controls 
Committees (BRCCs), which include a Citigroup BRCC as 
well as business, functions, regional and country BRCCs. 
BRCCs are chaired by the individuals in the first line of 
defense and provide escalation channels for senior 
management to review operational risk exposures including 
breaches of operational risk appetite, key indicators, 
operational risk events, and control issues. Membership 
includes senior business and functions leadership as well as 
members of the second line of defense.

In addition, Independent Risk Management, including the 
Operational Risk Management group, works proactively with 
Citi’s businesses and functions to drive a strong and embedded 
operational risk management culture and framework across 
Citi. The Operational Risk Management group actively 
challenges business and functions implementation of the 
Operational Risk Management Framework requirements and 
the quality of operational risk management practices and 
outcomes.

Information about businesses’ key operational risks, 
historical operational risk losses and the control environment 
is reported by each major business segment and functional 
area. Citi’s operational risk profile and related information is 
summarized and reported to senior management, as well as to 
the Audit and Risk Committees of Citi’s Board of Directors by 
the Head of Operational Risk Management.

Operational risk is measured through Operational Risk 

Capital and Operational Risk Regulatory Capital for the 
Advanced Approaches under Basel III. Projected operational 
risk losses under stress scenarios are estimated as a required 
part of the FRB’s CCAR process. 

For additional information on Citi’s operational risks, see 

“Risk Factors—Operational Risk” above.

Cybersecurity Risk

Overview
Cybersecurity risk is the business risk associated with the 
threat posed by a cyber attack, cyber breach or the failure to 
protect Citi’s most vital business information assets or 
operations, resulting in a financial or reputational loss	(for 
additional information, see the operational processes and 
systems and cybersecurity risk factors in “Risk Factors—
Operational Risks” above). With an evolving threat landscape, 
ever-increasing sophistication of threat actor tactics, 
techniques and procedures, and use of new technologies to 
conduct financial transactions, Citi and its clients, customers 
and third parties are and will continue to be at risk from cyber 
attacks and information security incidents. Citi recognizes the 
significance of these risks and, therefore, leverages an 
intelligence-led strategy to protect against, detect and respond 
to, and recover from cyber attacks. Further, Citi actively 
participates in financial industry, government and cross-sector 
knowledge-sharing groups to enhance individual and 
collective cybersecurity preparedness and resilience. 

Risk Management
Citi’s technology and cybersecurity risk management program 
is built on three lines of defense. Citi’s first line of defense 
under the Office of the Chief Information Security Officer 
provides frontline business, operational and technical controls 
and capabilities to protect against cybersecurity risks, and to 
respond to cyber incidents and data breaches. Citi manages 
these threats through state-of-the-art Fusion Centers, which 
serve as central commands for monitoring and coordinating 
responses to cyber threats. The enterprise information security 
team is responsible for infrastructure defense and security 
controls, performing vulnerability assessments and third-party 
information security assessments, employee awareness and 
training programs and security incident management. In each 
case the team works in coordination with a network of 
information security officers who are embedded within the 
businesses and functions globally. 

Citi’s Operational Risk Management-Technology and 

Cyber (ORM-T/C) and Independent Compliance Risk 
Management-Technology and Information Security (ICRM-T) 
groups serve as the second line of defense, and actively 
evaluate, anticipate and challenge Citi’s risk mitigation 
practices and capabilities. Citi seeks to proactively identify
and remediate technology and cybersecurity risks before they 
materialize as incidents that negatively affect business 
operations. Accordingly, the ORM-T/C team independently 
challenges and monitors capabilities in accordance with Citi’s 
defined Technology and Cyber Risk Appetite statements. To 
address evolving cybersecurity risks and corresponding 
regulations, ORM-T/C and ICRM-T teams collectively also 
monitor cyber legal and regulatory requirements, identify and 
define emerging risks, execute strategic cyber threat 
assessments, perform new products and initiative reviews, 
perform data management risk oversight and conduct cyber 
risk assurance reviews (inclusive of third-party assessments). 
In addition, ORM-T/C employs tools and oversees and 
challenges metrics that are both tailored to cybersecurity 
and technology and aligned with Citi’s overall operational risk 
management framework to effectively track, identify and
manage risk.

Internal audit serves as the third line of defense and 
independently provides assurance on how effectively the 
organization as a whole manages cybersecurity risk. Citi also 
has multiple senior committees such as the Information 
Security Risk Committee (ISRC), which governs enterprise-
level risk tolerance inclusive of cybersecurity risk.

Board Oversight
Citi’s Board of Directors provides oversight of management’s 
efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risk and respond to cyber 
incidents. The Board receives regular reports on cybersecurity 
and engages in discussions throughout the year with 
management and subject-matter experts on the effectiveness of 
Citi’s overall cybersecurity program. The Board also obtains 
updates on Citi’s inherent cybersecurity risks and Citi’s road 
map and progress for addressing these risks. 

Moreover, Citi’s Board and its committee members 
receive contemporaneous reporting on significant cyber events 
including response, legal obligations, and outreach and 
notification to regulators, and customers when needed, as well 

116

as guidance to management as appropriate. In 2021, the Board 
of Directors underwent a cyber incident tabletop exercise. 
Also in 2021, the Board’s Risk Management Committee 
approved a standalone Cybersecurity Risk Appetite Statement 
against which Citi’s performance is measured quarterly. For 
additional information on the Board’s oversight of 
cybersecurity risk management, see Citi’s 2022 proxy 
statement to be filed with the SEC in March 2022.

COMPLIANCE RISK
Compliance risk is the risk to current or projected financial 
condition and resilience arising from violations of laws, rules, 
or regulations, or from non-conformance with prescribed 
practices, internal policies and procedures or ethical standards. 
Compliance risk exposes Citi to fines, civil money penalties, 
payment of damages and the voiding of contracts. Compliance 
risk can result in diminished reputation, harm to Citi’s 
customers, limited business opportunities and lessened 
expansion potential. It encompasses the risk of noncompliance 
with all laws and regulations, as well as prudent ethical 
standards and some contractual obligations. It could also 
include exposure to litigation (known as legal risk) from all 
aspects of traditional and non-traditional banking.

Citi seeks to operate with integrity, maintain strong 

ethical standards and adhere to applicable policies and 
regulatory and legal requirements. Citi must maintain and 
execute a proactive Compliance Risk Management (CRM) 
Policy that is designed to manage compliance risk effectively 
across Citi, with a view to fundamentally strengthen the 
compliance risk management culture across the lines of 
defense taking into account Citi’s risk governance framework 
and regulatory requirements. Independent Compliance Risk 
Management’s (ICRM) primary objectives are to:

•

Drive and embed a culture of compliance and control 
throughout Citi;

• Maintain and oversee an integrated CRM Policy and 

Compliance Risk Framework that facilitates enterprise-
wide compliance with local, national or cross-border laws, 
rules or regulations, Citi’s internal policies, standards and 
procedures and relevant standards of conduct;
Assess compliance risks and issues across product lines, 
functions and geographies, supported by globally 
consistent systems and compliance risk management 
processes; and
Provide compliance risk data aggregation and reporting 
capabilities.

•

•

To anticipate, control and mitigate compliance risk, Citi 
has established the CRM Policy to achieve standardization and 
centralization of methodologies and processes, and to enable 
more consistent and comprehensive execution of compliance 
risk management. 

Citi has a commitment, as well as an obligation, to 
identify, assess and mitigate compliance risks associated with 
its businesses and functions. ICRM is responsible for 
oversight of Citi’s CRM Policy, while all businesses and 
global control functions are responsible for managing their 
compliance risks and operating within the Compliance Risk 
Appetite. 

Citi carries out its objectives and fulfills its 

responsibilities through the Compliance Risk Framework, 

which is composed of the following integrated key activities, 
to holistically manage compliance risk:

• Management of Citi’s compliance with laws, rules and 
regulations by identifying and analyzing changes, 
assessing the impact, and implementing appropriate 
policies, processes and controls;
Developing and providing compliance training to ensure 
colleagues are aware of and understand the key laws, 
rules and regulations;

•

• Monitoring the Compliance Risk Appetite, which is 

articulated through qualitative compliance risk statements 
describing Citi’s appetite for certain types of risk and 
quantitative measures to monitor the Company’s 
compliance risk exposure;

• Monitoring and testing of compliance risks and controls 

•

in assessing conformance with laws, rules, regulations and 
internal policies; and
Issue identification, escalation and remediation to drive 
accountability, including measurement and reporting of 
compliance risk metrics against established thresholds in 
support of the CRM Policy and Compliance Risk 
Appetite.

As discussed above, Citi is working to address the FRB 

and OCC consent orders, which include improvements to 
Citi’s Compliance Risk Framework and its Enterprise-wide 
application (for additional information regarding the consent 
orders, see “Citi’s Consent Order Compliance” above).

REPUTATION RISK
Citi’s reputation is a vital asset in building trust with its 
stakeholders and Citi is diligent in enhancing and protecting 
its reputation with its colleagues, customers, investors and 
regulators. To support this, Citi has developed a reputation 
risk framework. Under this framework, Citigroup and Citibank 
have implemented a risk appetite statement and related key 
indicators to monitor corporate activities and operations 
relative to our risk appetite. The framework also requires that 
business segments and regions escalate significant reputation 
risks that require review or mitigation through a Reputation 
Risk Committee or equivalent.

The Reputation Risk Committees, which are composed of 

Citi’s most senior executives, govern the process by which 
material reputation risks are identified, monitored, reported, 
managed, and escalated. The Reputation Risk Committees 
determine the appropriate actions to be taken in line with risk 
appetite and regulatory expectations, while promoting a 
culture of risk awareness and high standards of integrity and 
ethical behavior across the Company, consistent with Citi’s 
mission and value proposition. The Reputation Risk 
Committees in the business segments and regions are part of 
the governance infrastructure that Citi has in place to review 
the reputation risk posed by business activities, sales practices, 
product design, or perceived conflicts of interest. These 
committees may also raise potential reputation risks for due 
consideration by the Reputation Risk Committee at the 
corporate level. The Citigroup Reputation Risk Committee 
may escalate reputation risks to the Nomination, Governance 
and Public Affairs Committee or other appropriate committee 
of the Citigroup Board of Directors. 

The responsibility for enhancing and protecting Citi’s 
reputation is shared by all colleagues, who are guided by Citi’s 
Code of Conduct. Colleagues are expected to exercise sound 
judgment and common sense in decisions and actions. They 
are also expected to promptly escalate all issues that present 
potential reputation risk in line with policy.

STRATEGIC RISK
As discussed above, strategic risk is the risk of a sustained 
impact (not episodic impact) to Citi’s core strategic objectives 
as measured by impacts on anticipated earnings, market 
capitalization, or capital, arising from the external factors 
affecting the Company’s operating environment; as well as the 
risks associated with defining the strategy and executing the 
strategy, which are identified, measured and managed as part 
of the Strategic Risk Framework at the Enterprise Level. 

In this context, external factors affecting Citi’s operating 

environment are the economic environment, geopolitical/
political landscape, industry/competitive landscape, societal 
trends, customer/client behavior, regulatory/legislative 
environment and trends related to investors/shareholders.

Citi’s Executive Management Team is responsible for the 
development and execution of Citi’s strategy. This strategy is 
translated into forward-looking plans (collectively Citi’s 
Strategic Plan) that are then cascaded across the organization. 
Citi’s Strategic Plan is presented to the board on an annual 
basis and is aligned with Risk Appetite thresholds and 
includes Top Risk identification as required by internal 
frameworks. It is also aligned with limit requirements for 
capital allocation. Governance and oversight of strategic risk 
is facilitated by internal committees on a group-wide basis as 
well as strategic committees at the ICG, GCB and regional 
levels.

Citi works to ensure that strategic risks are adequately 
considered and addressed across its various risk management 
activities, and that strategic risks are assessed in the context of 
Citi’s risk appetite. Citi conducts a top-down, bottom-up risk 
identification process to identify risks, including strategic 
risks. Business segments undertake a quarterly risk 
identification process to systematically identify and document 
all material risks faced by Citi. Independent Risk Management 
oversees the Risk Identification process through regular 
reviews and coordinates identification and monitoring of Top 
Risks. Independent Risk Management also manages strategic 
risk by monitoring risk appetite thresholds in conjunction with 
various strategic risk committees, which are part of the 
governance structure that Citi has in place to manage its 
strategic risks. 

For additional information on Citi’s strategic risks, see 

“Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” above.

OTHER RISKS

LIBOR Transition Risk
The LIBOR administrator ceased publication of non-USD 
LIBOR and one week and two-month USD LIBOR on a 
representative basis on December 31, 2021, with plans to 
cease publication of all other USD LIBOR tenors on June 30, 
2023. Regulators expect banks, including Citi, to have ceased 
entering into new contracts that reference USD LIBOR as a 

117

benchmark by December 31, 2021, except for limited 
circumstances as set out in regulatory guidance. 

Citi recognizes that a transition away from and 
discontinuance of LIBOR presents various risks and 
challenges that could significantly impact financial markets 
and market participants, including Citi (for information about 
Citi’s risks from a transition away from and discontinuation of 
LIBOR or any other benchmark rates, see “Risk Factors—
Other Risks” above). Accordingly, Citi has continued its 
efforts to identify and manage its LIBOR transition risks. 

For example, Citi continues to closely monitor legislative, 
regulatory and other developments related to LIBOR transition 
matters and legislative relief. The International Swaps and 
Derivatives Association (ISDA) published the Interbank 
Offered Rate (IBOR) Fallbacks Protocol for existing IBOR 
derivatives transactions, which became effective in January 
2021. The IBOR Fallbacks Protocol provides derivatives 
market participants with new fallbacks for legacy and new 
derivatives contracts if both counterparties adhere to the 
protocol or engage in bilateral amendments (see discussion 
below regarding Citi’s adherence to the protocol). In April 
2021, legislation was adopted in New York State that provides 
for the use of a statutory replacement for USD LIBOR in 
certain New York law legacy contracts. Similar federal 
legislation was passed in the House of Representatives in 
December 2021 and is pending passage by the Senate, 
although there is no guarantee that the federal legislative 
proposal will become law. 

In addition, Citi has established a LIBOR governance and 

implementation program focused on identifying and 
addressing the impact of LIBOR transition on Citi’s clients, 
operational capabilities and financial contracts. The program 
operates globally across Citi’s businesses and functions and 
includes active involvement of senior management, oversight 
by Citi’s Asset and Liability Committee and reporting to the 
Risk Management Committee of Citigroup’s Board of 
Directors. As part of the program, Citi has continued to 
implement its LIBOR transition action plans and associated 
roadmaps under the following key workstreams: program 
management; transition strategy and risk management; 
customer management, including internal communications and 
training, legal/contract management and product management; 
financial exposures and risk management; regulatory and 
industry engagement; operations and technology; and finance, 
risk, tax and treasury. 

During 2021, Citi continued to participate in a number of 

working groups formed by global regulators, including the 
Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) convened by 
the FRB. These working groups promote and advance 
development of alternative reference rates and seek to identify 
and address potential challenges from any transition to such 
rates. Citi’s LIBOR transition action plans and associated 
roadmaps are intended to be consistent with the timelines 
recommended by these working groups. This includes the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s SOFR First 
Initiative, which is designed to promote derivatives trading in 
SOFR. Citi also continued to engage with regulators, financial 
accounting bodies and others on LIBOR transition matters. 

Citi’s LIBOR transition efforts include, among other 

things, reducing its overall exposure to LIBOR, increasing 

118

Citi’s virtual client communication efforts and client transition 
facilitation, including outreach regarding new industry-led 
protocols and solutions, and using alternative reference rates 
in certain newly issued financial instruments and products. In 
the past several years, Citi has issued preferred stock and 
benchmark debt referencing the Secured Overnight Financing 
Rate (SOFR) and issued customer-related debt referencing 
SOFR and the Sterling Overnight Interbank Average Rate 
(SONIA), the recommended replacement rate for Sterling 
LIBOR. Citi has also originated and arranged loans 
referencing SOFR and SONIA and executed SOFR and 
SONIA-based derivatives contracts. Further, Citi has also been 
investing in its systems and infrastructure, as client activity 
moves away from LIBOR to alternative reference rates. Since 
the ARRC’s recommendation of CME Group’s Term SOFR in 
July 2021, Citi has focused on systems’ readiness to provide 
Term SOFR loan and derivatives to clients, where permitted. 

In 2021, Citi also focused on remediating existing LIBOR 

contracts for which	publication ceased on a representative 
basis on December 31, 2021. Substantially all of these 
contracts were remediated by December 31, 2021, and Citi 
continues to actively engage in and track the remediation of 
any remaining contracts after December 31, 2021. As of 
December 31, 2021, Citi’s overall USD LIBOR gross notional 
exposure for contracts maturing after the LIBOR cessation 
date of June 30, 2023 was approximately $7.1 trillion, which 
includes approximately $4 trillion of cleared derivatives that 
are covered by planned Central Counterparty Clearing House 
(CCP) conversions, and approximately $2.4 trillion of bilateral 
derivatives that are covered by robust contract fallback 
language. The remaining exposure of approximately $0.7 
trillion includes bilateral derivatives and cash products that 
will be addressed by 2022 contract remediation plans. 

In addition, for LIBOR contracts that have not yet been 

remediated, Citi continues to review the effect of relevant 
legislative solutions, which are expected to facilitate the 
transition to replacement rates. 

Climate Risk
Climate change presents immediate and long-term risks to Citi 
and its clients and customers, with the risks expected to 
increase over time. Climate risk refers to the risk of loss 
arising from climate change and is comprised of both physical 
risk and transition risk. Physical risk considers how chronic 
and acute climate change (e.g., increased storms, drought, 
fires, floods) can directly damage physical assets (e.g., real 
estate, crops) or otherwise impact their value or productivity. 
Transition risk considers how changes in policy, technology, 
business practices and market preferences to address climate 
change (e.g., carbon pricing policies, power generation shifts 
from fossil fuels to renewable energy) can lead to changes in 
the value of assets, commodities and companies.

Climate risk is an overarching risk that can act as a driver 

of other categories of risk, such as credit risk from obligors 
exposed to high climate risk, reputational risk from increased 
stakeholder concerns about financing high-carbon industries 
and operational risk from physical risks to Citi’s facilities and 
personnel.

Citi currently identifies climate risk as an “emerging risk” 

within its enterprise risk management framework. Emerging 

risks are risks or thematic issues that are either new to the 
landscape, or in the case of climate risk, existing risks that are 
rapidly changing or evolving in an escalating fashion, which 
are difficult to assess due to limited data or other uncertainties. 
For additional information on climate risk, see “Risk Factors
—Other Risks” above.

Citi reviews factors related to climate risk under its 
longstanding Environmental and Social Risk Management 
(ESRM) Policy, which includes a focus on climate risk related 
to financed projects and clients in high-carbon sectors. 
Cautious of the credit risk of stranded assets, as well as the 
reputational risks associated with the coal sector due to its 
high carbon emissions, Citi began a phase-down of its 
financing of thermal coal mining companies in 2015 and of 
new coal-fired power plants in 2018. As Citi’s phase-down 
has continued, Citi’s ESRM Policy was updated to include a 
prohibition on all project-related financing of new coal-fired 
power plants and new or expanding thermal coal mines as well 
as clear timetables to reduce financing of companies with high 
exposure to coal fired power and coal mining who do not 
pursue low-carbon transition in the coming years. These sector 
approaches allow Citi to set a comprehensive and industry-
wide approach to clarify its positions, set clear expectations 
for its clients and help address certain climate risk driven 
credit risk concerns while reducing reputation risk.

Citi continues to explore and test methodologies for 

quantifying how climate risks could impact the individual 
credit profiles of its clients across various sectors. To assist in 
embedding climate risk assessments in its credit assessment 
process, Citi is developing sector-specific climate risk 
assessments. Such climate risk assessments are designed to 
supplement publicly available client disclosures and data 
provided from third-party vendors and facilitate conversations 
with clients on their most material climate risks and 
management plans for adaptation and mitigation. In the near 
term, Citi’s assessments will consider sectors that have been 
identified as higher climate risk by Citi’s risk identification 
process. This will not only help Citi better understand its  
clients’ businesses and climate-related risks, but will also 
provide a source of climate data. Citi’s net zero plan is leading 
to the further integration of climate risk discussions into client 
engagement and client selection.

Furthermore, Citi is developing globally consistent 
principles and approaches for managing climate risk across 
Citi. Climate risk will be embedded into relevant policies and 
processes over time.

In addition, Citi continues to participate in financial 

industry collaborations to develop and pilot new 
methodologies and approaches for measuring and assessing 
the potential financial risks of climate change. Citi is also 
closely monitoring regulatory developments on climate risk 
and sustainable finance, and actively engaging with regulators 
on these topics.

Country Risk

Top 25 Country Exposures 
The following table presents Citi’s top 25 exposures by 
country (excluding the U.S.) as of December 31, 2021. 
(Including the U.S., the total exposure as of December 31, 
2021 to the top 25 countries would represent approximately 
98% of Citi’s exposure to all countries.) 

For purposes of the table, loan amounts are reflected in 
the country where the loan is booked, which is generally based 
on the domicile of the borrower. For example, a loan to a 
Chinese subsidiary of a Switzerland-based corporation will 
generally be categorized as a loan in China. In addition, Citi 
has developed regional booking centers in certain countries, 

most significantly in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland, 
in order to more efficiently serve its corporate customers. As 
an example, with respect to the U.K., only 33% of corporate 
loans presented in the table below are to U.K. domiciled 
entities (36% for unfunded commitments), with the balance of 
the loans predominately to European domiciled counterparties. 
Approximately 87% of the total U.K. funded loans and 88% of 
the total U.K. unfunded commitments were investment grade 
as of December 31, 2021. 

Trading account assets and investment securities are 
generally categorized based on the domicile of the issuer of 
the security of the underlying reference entity. For additional 
information on the assets included in the table, see the 
footnotes to the table below.

“Risk Factors” above.

Russia
Citi operates both its ICG and GCB businesses in Russia, 
although the Company is currently pursuing the exit of its 
GCB business in the country. All of Citi’s domestic operations 
in Russia are conducted through a subsidiary of Citibank, 
which uses the Russian ruble as its functional currency. Citi’s 
net investment in Russia was approximately $1 billion as of 
December 31, 2021. The majority of Citi’s net investment was 
hedged for foreign currency depreciation as of December 31, 
2021, using forward foreign exchange contracts. Citi’s total 
third-party exposure was approximately $8.2 billion as of 
December 31, 2021. These assets primarily consisted of 
corporate and consumer loans, local government debt 
securities, reverse repurchase agreements, and cash on deposit 
and placements with the Bank of Russia and other financial 
institutions. A significant portion of Citi’s third-party 
exposures were funded with domestic deposit liabilities from 
both ICG and GCB clients. Further, Citi has approximately 
$1.6 billion of additional exposures to Russian counterparties 
that are not held on the Russian subsidiary and are not 
included in the $8.2 billion above.

The $5.4 billion in Russia credit and other exposures in 
the “Top 25 Country Exposures” table above does not include 
approximately $1.0 billion of cash and placements with the 
Bank of Russia and other financial institutions and $1.8 billion 
of reverse repurchase agreements with various counterparties.
Citi continues to monitor the current Russia–Ukraine 

geopolitical situation and economic conditions and will 
mitigate its exposures and risks as appropriate. For additional 
information, see “Risk Factors—Market-Related Risk,” “—
Operational Risks” and “—Other Risks” above.

located in that country.

Argentina
Citi operates in Argentina through its ICG businesses. As of 
December 31, 2021, Citi’s net investment in its Argentine 
operations was approximately $1.5 billion. Citi uses the U.S. 
dollar as the functional currency for its operations in highly 
inflationary countries under U.S. GAAP. Citi uses Argentina’s 
official market exchange rate to remeasure its net Argentine 
peso-denominated assets into the U.S. dollar. As of 
December 31, 2021, the official Argentine peso exchange rate 
against the U.S. dollar was 102.73.

The Central Bank of Argentina maintains certain capital 

and currency controls that generally restrict Citi’s ability to 
access U.S. dollars in Argentina and remit substantially all of 
its earnings from its Argentine operations. Citi’s net 
investment in its Argentine operations is likely to increase as 
Citi continues to generate net income from its Argentine 
franchise and the majority of its earnings cannot be remitted.
Due to the currency controls implemented by the Central 

Bank of Argentina, certain indirect foreign exchange 
mechanisms have developed that some Argentine entities may 
use to obtain U.S. dollars, generally at rates that are 
significantly higher than Argentina’s official exchange rate. 
Citibank Argentina is precluded from accessing these 
alternative mechanisms, and these exchange mechanisms 
cannot be used to remeasure Citi’s net monetary assets into the 
U.S. dollar under U.S. GAAP. Citi cannot predict future 
fluctuations in Argentina’s official market exchange rate or to 
what extent Citi may be able to access U.S. dollars at the 
official exchange rate in the future.

Citi economically hedges the foreign currency risk in its 
net Argentine peso-denominated assets to the extent possible 
and prudent using non-deliverable forward (NDF) derivative 
instruments that are primarily executed outside of Argentina. 
As of December 31, 2021, the international NDF market had 
very limited liquidity, resulting in Citi being unable to 
economically hedge nearly all of its Argentine peso exposure. 
As a result, and to the extent that Citi does not execute NDF 
contracts for this unhedged exposure in the future, Citi would 
record devaluations on its net Argentine peso‑denominated 
assets in earnings, without any benefit from a change in the 
fair value of derivative positions used to economically hedge 
the exposure. 

Citi continually evaluates its economic exposure to its 
Argentine counterparties and reserves for changes in credit 
risk and sovereign risk associated with its Argentine assets. 
Citi believes it has established appropriate allowances for 
credit losses on its Argentine loans, and appropriate fair value 
adjustments on Argentine assets and liabilities measured at fair 
value, for such risks under U.S. GAAP as of December 31, 
2021. However, U.S. regulatory agencies may require Citi to 
record additional reserves in the future, increasing ICG’s cost 
of credit, based on the perceived country risk associated with 
its Argentine exposures.

FFIEC—Cross-Border Claims on Third Parties and Local 
Country Assets
Citi’s cross-border disclosures are set forth below, based on 
the country exposure bank regulatory reporting guidelines of 
the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council 
(FFIEC). The following summarizes some of the FFIEC key 
reporting guidelines:

•

•

•

•

•

Amounts are based on the domicile of the ultimate 
obligor, counterparty, collateral (only including qualifying 
liquid collateral), issuer or guarantor, as applicable (e.g., a 
security recorded by a Citi U.S. entity but issued by the 
U.K. government is considered U.K. exposure; a loan 
recorded by a Citi Mexico entity to a customer domiciled 
in Mexico where the underlying collateral is held in 
Germany is considered German exposure). 
Amounts do not consider the benefit of collateral received 
for secured financing transactions (i.e., repurchase 
agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and securities 
loaned and borrowed) and are reported based on notional 
amounts. 
Netting of derivative receivables and payables, reported at 
fair value, is permitted, but only under a legally binding 
netting agreement with the same specific counterparty, 
and does not include the benefit of margin received or 
hedges.
Credit default swaps (CDS) are included based on the 
gross notional amount sold and purchased and do not 
include any offsetting CDS on the same underlying entity. 
Loans are reported without the benefit of hedges.

Given the requirements noted above, Citi’s FFIEC cross-
border exposures and total outstandings tend to fluctuate, in 
some cases significantly, from period to period. As an 
example, because total outstandings under FFIEC guidelines 
do not include the benefit of margin or hedges, market 
volatility in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and credit 
spreads may cause significant fluctuations in the level of total 
outstandings, all else being equal.
