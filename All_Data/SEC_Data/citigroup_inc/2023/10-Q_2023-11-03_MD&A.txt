EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Third Quarter of 2023 Results Summary

Third Quarter of 2023—Results Demonstrated Strength of 
Diversified Business Model and Progress Toward 
Priorities
As described further throughout this Executive Summary, 
during the third quarter of 2023:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

Citi’s revenues increased 9% versus the prior-year period. 
Excluding divestiture-related impacts (see “Legacy 
Franchises” below), revenues increased 10%, driven by 
higher net interest income and non-interest revenues. 
Citi’s expenses increased 6% versus the prior-year period, 
both on a reported basis and excluding divestiture-related 
impacts (see “Legacy Franchises” below), largely driven 
by continued investments in risk and controls, the impacts 
of inflation and severance. The increase was partially 
offset by productivity savings and expense reductions 
from the exited markets and continued wind-downs (see 
“Expenses” below).
Citi’s cost of credit was $1.8 billion versus $1.4 billion in 
the prior-year period. The increase was primarily driven 
by the ongoing normalization in net credit losses and 
volume growth in Branded cards and Retail services in 
PBWM.
Citi returned $1.5 billion to common shareholders in the 
form of dividends and share repurchases. 
Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio under 
the Basel III Standardized Approach increased to 13.6% 
as of September 30, 2023, compared to 12.3% as of 
September 30, 2022 (see “Capital Resources” below). 
This compares to Citi’s required regulatory CET1 Capital 
ratio of 12.3% as of October 1, 2023 under the Basel III 
Standardized Approach.
Citi continued to make progress on its consumer banking 
business divestitures in the third quarter of 2023, 
including the closing of its Taiwan sale transaction and 
working toward the closing of its Indonesia sale 
transaction in the fourth quarter of 2023. (For additional 
information on the progress of Citi’s other exits and wind-
downs, see “Legacy Franchises” below.) 
As previously disclosed, Citi announced it will be making 
changes to its operating model to simplify the Company 
and further align its organizational structure with its 
business strategy. This new operating model will elevate 
the leaders of Citi’s five key businesses and eliminate 
management layers, and reflect the next step in Citi’s 
work to implement its strategic and other initiatives. For 
additional information, see “Planned Revision to 
Operating Model and Financial Reporting Structure” 
above.

Citigroup
Citigroup reported net income of $3,546 million in the current 
quarter, up 2%, compared to net income of $3,479 million in 
the prior-year period, or $1.63 per share, unchanged from the 
prior-year period. The net income increase was driven by the 
higher revenues, partially offset by the higher expenses, the 
higher cost of credit and a higher effective tax rate. 
Citigroup’s effective tax rate was 25% versus 20% in the 
prior-year period, largely driven by the geographic mix of 
earnings in the current quarter (see “Income Taxes” below). 
Results for the third quarter of 2023 included divestiture-
related impacts of $299 million in earnings before taxes ($214 
million after-tax). See “Legacy Franchises” below for details 
about the divestiture-related impacts. These divestiture-related 
impacts, collectively, had a $0.11 beneficial impact on 
earnings per share (EPS) in the current quarter. Excluding 
these divestiture-related impacts, EPS was $1.52. (As used 
throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi’s results of operations and 
financial condition excluding divestiture-related impacts are 
non-GAAP financial measures.)

Results for the third quarter of 2022 included divestiture-
related impacts of $519 million in earnings before taxes ($256 
million after-tax). See “Legacy Franchises” below for details 
about the divestiture-related impacts. These divestiture-related 
impacts, collectively, had a $0.13 beneficial impact on EPS in 
the prior-year period. Excluding these divestiture-related 
impacts, EPS was $1.50.

Citigroup revenues of $20.1 billion in the third quarter of 

2023 increased 9% on a reported basis, and 10% excluding 
divestiture-related impacts versus the prior-year period. The 
increase in revenues reflected strength across Services and 
Markets in Institutional Clients Group (ICG) and U.S. 
Personal Banking in Personal Banking and Wealth 
Management (PBWM), as well as growth in Banking in ICG. 
The increase was partially offset by a revenue reduction from 
the exited markets and continued wind-downs in Legacy 
Franchises.

Citigroup’s end-of-period loans were $666 billion, up 3% 
versus the prior-year period, largely driven by growth in U.S. 
Personal Banking. 

Citigroup’s end-of-period deposits were approximately 

$1.3 trillion, down 3% versus the prior-year period. The 
decline in deposits was largely due to a reduction in Services, 
reflecting monetary tightening, a shift of deposits to higher-
yielding investments in Global Wealth Management (Global 
Wealth) and a reduction of institutional certificates of deposit 
in Corporate/Other. For additional information about Citi’s 
deposits by business, including drivers and deposit trends, see 
each respective business’s results of operations and “Liquidity 
Risk—Deposits” below.

During the third quarter of 2023, Citi repurchased $0.5 
billion of common shares and paid $1.0 billion of common 
dividends (see “Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, 
Repurchases of Equity Securities and Dividends” below). Citi 
will continue to assess common share repurchases on a 
quarter-by-quarter basis given uncertainty regarding 
regulatory capital requirements. For additional information, 
see “Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital Standards and 
Developments” below.

Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio as of 
September 30, 2023 was 6.0%, compared to 5.7% as of 
September 30, 2022, and 5.8% as of December 31, 2022. The 
increase was driven by higher Tier 1 Capital from net income, 
partially offset by an increase in Total Leverage Exposure. For 
additional information on Citi’s capital ratios and related 
components, see “Capital Resources” below. 

Institutional Clients Group
ICG net income of $2.4 billion increased 12%, primarily 
driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses 
and higher cost of credit. ICG operating expenses of $7.2 
billion increased 10%, primarily driven by continued 
investments in risks and controls and volume-related expenses, 
partially offset by productivity savings.

ICG revenues of $10.6 billion increased 12% (including 

gain (loss) on loan hedges), driven by growth across Services, 
Markets and Banking, partially offset by an approximate $180 
million net impact from a currency devaluation in Argentina 
on Citi’s net investment in the country. Revenues also 
included a loss on loan hedges of $47 million in the third 
quarter of 2023, compared with a loss on loan hedges of $56 
million in the prior-year period.

Services revenues of $4.7 billion increased 13%. TTS 
revenues of $3.6 billion increased 12%, driven by 17% growth 
in net interest income and 1% growth in non-interest revenue. 
The increase in TTS net interest income was primarily driven 
by higher interest rates and deposit volume growth. The 
increase in non-interest revenue was driven by continued 
growth in underlying drivers, primarily a 16% increase in 
cross-border transaction value, a 6% increase in U.S. dollar 
clearing volume and an 8% increase in commercial card spend 
volume. The increase in non-interest revenue was largely 
offset by the impact from the currency devaluation in 
Argentina on Citi’s net investment in the country. Securities 
services revenues of $1.1 billion increased 16%, largely driven 
by higher net interest income across currencies.

Markets revenues of $4.5 billion increased 10%, driven 

by an increase of 14% in Fixed income markets, largely 
reflecting strength in rates and currencies. The increase was 
partially offset by a decrease of 3% in Equity markets, driven 
by a decline in equity derivatives, partially offset by growth in 
equity cash and prime services.

Expenses
Citigroup’s operating expenses of $13.5 billion increased 6% 
from the prior-year period, both on a reported basis and 
excluding divestiture-related impacts. The higher expenses 
largely reflected continued investments in risk and controls, 
the impact of inflation and severance, partially offset by 
productivity savings and expense reductions from the exited 
markets and wind-downs in Legacy Franchises. Expenses also 
continued to be impacted by investments in Citi’s 
transformation and business- and enterprise-led investments. 

Citi expects to continue to incur higher expenses in the 
fourth quarter of 2023, including additional severance costs 
related to its organizational and management simplification 
initiatives.

Cost of Credit
Citi’s total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and 
claims was a cost of $1.8 billion, compared to $1.4 billion in 
the prior-year period. This increase was driven by higher net 
credit losses (see below), partially offset by a lower net build 
in the ACL for loans and unfunded commitments and other 
provisions. 

The net build of $203 million in the ACL for loans and 
unfunded lending commitments and other provisions in the 
current quarter was primarily driven by growth in Branded 
cards and Retail services card balances in PBWM. This 
compared to a net build of $478 million in the ACL for loans 
and unfunded lending commitments and other provisions in 
the prior-year period. For additional information on Citi’s 
ACL, see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant 
Estimates—Citi’s Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)” below. 
Net credit losses of $1.6 billion increased 85% from the 
prior-year period. Consumer net credit losses of $1.6 billion 
increased 79%, reflecting ongoing normalization, particularly 
in Branded cards and Retail services. Corporate net credit 
losses increased to $58 million from $6 million in the prior-
year period.

Citi expects to incur higher year-over-year net credit 
losses for the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily driven by 
ongoing normalization, particularly in the cards businesses in 
PBWM. Net credit losses in the cards businesses are expected 
to reach pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2023.

For additional information on Citi’s consumer and 

corporate credit costs, see each respective business’s results of 
operations and “Credit Risk” below.

Capital
Citigroup’s CET1 Capital ratio was 13.6% as of September 
30, 2023, compared to 12.3% as of September 30, 2022, based 
on the Basel III Standardized Approach for determining risk-
weighted assets (RWA). The increase was primarily driven by 
net income and impacts from the sales of certain Asia 
Consumer Banking (Asia Consumer) businesses, as well as 
business actions, including a reduction in RWA, partially 
offset by the payment of common dividends and share 
repurchases.

Banking revenues of $1.4 billion increased 18%, 

including the gain (loss) on loan hedges in the current quarter 
and the prior-year period. Excluding the gain (loss) on loan 
hedges, Banking revenues of $1.5 billion increased 17%, 
driven by higher revenues in Investment banking. Investment 
banking revenues of $844 million increased 34%, reflecting 
increased client activity in debt underwriting and an absence 
of certain realized and unrealized gains (losses) in the prior-
year period. Corporate lending revenues increased 2%, 
including the impact of the gain (loss) on loan hedges. 
Excluding the impact of the gain (loss) on loan hedges, 
Corporate lending revenues increased 1% versus the prior-year 
period. (As used throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi’s results of 
operations and financial condition excluding the impact of the 
gain (loss) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.) 
For additional information on the results of operations of 

ICG for the third quarter of 2023, see “Institutional Clients 
Group” below.

Personal Banking and Wealth Management
PBWM net income of $803 million increased 1%, as higher 
revenues were largely offset by higher cost of credit and 
higher expenses. PBWM operating expenses of $4.3 billion 
increased 5%, largely driven by investments in risks and 
controls and severance, partially offset by productivity 
savings.

PBWM revenues of $6.8 billion increased 10%, driven by 
growth in net interest income, reflecting strong loan growth in 
U.S. Personal Banking, as well as higher non-interest revenue, 
primarily due to lower partner payments in Retail services and 
higher investment product revenues in Global Wealth.

U.S. Personal Banking revenues of $4.9 billion increased 

13%, primarily driven by higher revenues in cards, partially 
offset by lower Retail banking revenues. Branded cards 
revenues of $2.5 billion increased 12%, primarily driven by 
the higher net interest income, as average loans increased 
12%. Retail services revenues of $1.7 billion increased 21%, 
primarily driven by the higher net interest income from loan 
growth, as well as the lower partner payments. Retail banking 
revenues of $624 million decreased 3%, largely driven by the 
transfer of certain relationships and the associated deposits to 
Global Wealth, partially offset by higher deposit spreads.

Global Wealth revenues of $1.9 billion increased 2%, 
primarily driven by higher investment product revenues across 
all regions, the benefit of the transfer of certain relationships 
and the associated deposits from Retail banking, and higher 
lending revenue.

For additional information on the results of operations of 

PBWM for the third quarter of 2023, see “Personal Banking 
and Wealth Management” below.

Legacy Franchises
Legacy Franchises net income was $125 million, compared to 
$316 million in the prior-year period, primarily driven by 
lower revenues and higher cost of credit, partially offset by 
lower expenses. Legacy Franchises operating expenses of $1.8 
billion decreased 3%, primarily driven by the impact of exited 
markets and continued wind-downs, partially offset by 
separation costs and the impact of FX translation in Mexico 

6

Consumer, Small Business and Middle-Market Banking 
(Mexico Consumer/SBMM).

Legacy Franchises revenues of $2.2 billion decreased 
13%, largely driven by the lower gain on sale impacts in Asia 
Consumer and reductions from exited markets and continued 
wind-downs. The decrease was partially offset by higher 
revenues in Mexico Consumer/SBMM, largely reflecting the 
impact of FX translation, higher interest rates and volume 
growth.

For additional information on the results of operations of 
Legacy Franchises for the third quarter of 2023, see “Legacy 
Franchises” below.

Corporate/Other 
Corporate/Other net income was $189 million, compared to 
$209 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by lower 
income tax benefits, partially offset by higher revenues and 
lower operating expenses. Corporate/Other operating 
expenses of $237 million decreased from $286 million in the 
prior-year period, primarily driven by lower consulting 
expenses.

Corporate/Other revenues of $500 million increased from 

$299 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by the 
absence of prior-year mark-to-market losses, primarily related 
to retained interchange litigation risk associated with shares of 
Visa B common stock that Citi previously sold.

For additional information on the results of operations of 
Corporate/Other for the third quarter of 2023, see “Corporate/
Other” below.

Macroeconomic and Other Risks and Uncertainties 
Various geopolitical, macroeconomic and regulatory 
challenges and uncertainties continue to adversely impact 
economic conditions in the U.S. and globally, including 
continued elevated interest rates and inflation, economic and 
geopolitical challenges related to China, the Russia–Ukraine 
war and escalating tensions and conflicts in the Middle East, 
and a potential U.S. government shutdown. These and other 
factors have adversely affected financial markets, negatively 
impacted global economic growth rates and resulted in a 
continued risk of recession in the U.S., Europe and other 
regions and countries. In addition, these and other factors 
could adversely affect Citi’s customers, clients, businesses, 
funding costs, cost of credit and overall results of operations 
and financial condition during the fourth quarter of 2023.

As previously disclosed in May 2023, the Federal Deposit 

Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a proposal that would 
implement a special assessment to recover its uninsured 
deposit losses from recent bank failures. The FDIC estimated 
that the preliminary cost of the failures is approximately $15.8 
billion, an estimate that would be periodically adjusted. The 
FDIC is proposing to collect the special assessment at an 
annual rate of approximately 12.5 basis points of uninsured 
U.S. deposits, over eight quarterly assessment periods 
beginning in 2024. Citi is likely to incur up to a $1.5 billion 
pretax charge, impacting operating expenses, if the final rule 
for the FDIC special assessment, which is expected before the 
end of 2023, is enacted as proposed.

Additionally, in July 2023, the U.S. banking agencies 
issued a notice of proposed rulemaking, known as the Basel III 
Endgame, related to regulatory capital requirements that, if 
finalized as proposed, would have a material impact on Citi’s 
current capital position. For additional information, see 
“Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital Standards and 
Developments—Basel III Revisions” below.

For a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and risks 

that will or could impact Citi’s businesses, results of 
operations, capital and other financial condition during the 
remainder of 2023, see “Third Quarter of 2023 Results 
Summary” above and each respective business’s results of 
operations, “Managing Global Risk,” including “Managing 
Global Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—Russia” and “—
Argentina,” and “Forward-Looking Statements” below and

INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS GROUP

Institutional Clients Group (ICG) includes Services, Markets and Banking (for additional information on these businesses, see 
“Citigroup Operating Segments” above). ICG provides corporate, institutional and public sector clients around the world with a full 
range of wholesale banking products and services, including fixed income and equity sales and trading, foreign exchange, prime 
brokerage, derivative services, equity and fixed income research, corporate lending, investment banking and advisory services, cash 
management, trade finance and securities services. ICG transacts with clients in both cash instruments and derivatives, including fixed 
income, foreign currency, equity and commodity products. For more information on ICG’s business activities, see “Institutional 
Clients Group” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

For information on Citi’s planned revision to its financial reporting structure as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, including, 

among other things, the elimination of the ICG operating segment and the resulting creation of three new reportable operating 
segments (Services, consisting of Treasury and Trade Solutions and Securities Services; Markets, consisting of Fixed Income and 
Equity markets; and Banking, consisting of Investment Banking and Corporate Lending), see “Planned Revision to Operating Model 
and Financial Reporting Structure” above.

ICG’s international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 95 

countries and jurisdictions. As previously disclosed, as of March 31, 2023, Citi ended nearly all of the institutional banking services it 
offered in Russia, with the remaining services only those necessary to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations. For 
additional information about Citi’s continued efforts to reduce its operations and exposure in Russia, see “Managing Global Risk—
Other Risks—Country Risk—Russia” below.

At September 30, 2023, ICG had $1.7 trillion in assets and $782 billion in deposits. Securities services managed $23.0 trillion in 

assets under custody and administration at September 30, 2023, of which Citi provided both custody and administrative services to 
certain clients related to $1.8 trillion of such assets. Managed assets under trust were $4.1 trillion at September 30, 2023. For 
additional information on these operations, see “Administration and Other Fiduciary Fees” in Note 5.

(1)  Citi assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items. For example, securities that generate Net 

interest income may be risk managed with derivatives that are recorded in Principal transactions revenue within Non-interest revenue. For a description of the 
composition of these revenue line items, see Notes 4, 5 and 6.

(2)  Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. Gain (loss) on 

loan hedges includes the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. The fixed premium 
costs of these hedges are netted against the corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. Citigroup’s results of operations excluding the 
impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.

NM Not meaningful

The discussion of the results of operations for ICG below excludes (where noted) the impact of any gain (loss) on hedges of accrual 
loans, which are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.

3Q23 vs. 3Q22
Net income of $2.4 billion increased 12%, primarily driven by 
higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses and higher 
cost of credit.

Revenues increased 12% (including gain (loss) on loan 

hedges), driven by higher Services, Banking and Markets 
revenues, partially offset by an approximate $180 million net 
impact from a currency devaluation in Argentina on Citi’s net 
investment in the country. Services revenues were up 13%, 
driven by higher revenues in both TTS and Securities services. 
Banking revenues were up 18% (including the impact of the 
gain (loss) on loan hedges), reflecting higher revenues in both 
Investment banking and Corporate lending. Markets revenues 
were up 10%, driven by higher revenues in Fixed income 
markets, partially offset by lower revenues in Equity markets.
Citi expects revenues in its Markets and Investment 
banking businesses will continue to reflect the overall market 
environment during the fourth quarter of 2023.

Within Services:

•

•

TTS revenues increased 12%, driven by 17% growth in 
net interest income and 1% growth in non-interest 
revenue, reflecting strong growth across all client 
segments. The increase in net interest income was 
primarily driven by higher interest rates as well as growth 
in deposits, partially offset by higher interest rates paid on 
deposits. Average deposits increased 2%, largely driven 
by growth in EMEA, Asia and Latin America. On a 
quarter-over-quarter basis, average deposits were down, 
mainly in North America, driven by portfolio 
optimization efforts and monetary tightening. Average 
loans increased 2%, mainly driven by growth in Latin 
America and North America. The increase in non-interest 
revenue was driven by strong fee growth in the cash 
business, reflecting solid client engagement and continued 
growth of underlying drivers, including higher cross-
border flows (up 16%), U.S. dollar clearing volume (up 
6%) and commercial card spend (up 8%). The increase in 
non-interest revenue was largely offset by the impact 
from the currency devaluation in Argentina.
Securities services revenues increased 16%, as net interest 
income grew 36%, driven by higher interest rates across 
currencies and cost of funds management, partially offset 
by the impact of an 8% decline in average deposits. The 
decline in average deposits reflected the impact of 
monetary tightening. Non-interest revenues increased 3%, 
driven by higher fees due to higher assets under custody 
and administration and continued elevated levels of 
corporation actions in Issuer services. The increase in 

14

non-interest revenue was partially offset by the impact 
from the currency devaluation in Argentina.

Within Markets:

•

•

Fixed income markets increased 14%, driven by North 
America, largely reflecting strength in rates and 
currencies despite continued lower market volatility.
Rates and currencies increased 12%, driven by a 

conducive rate environment and associated market-
making activity. Spread products and other fixed income 
revenues increased 21%. This increase was driven by 
North America, reflecting higher commodities revenue, 
and growth in the financing and securitization business, 
including increased client or market activity.
Equity markets revenues decreased 3%, driven by a 
decline in equity derivatives, partially offset by growth in 
equity cash and prime services. The decline in equity 
derivatives revenues reflected a more challenging 
macroeconomic environment and lower volatility. The 
increase in equity cash revenue was driven by increased 
client activity. Prime services revenues increased 
modestly and the business continued to grow prime 
finance balances.

Within Banking:

•

•

Investment banking revenues increased 34%, as strength 
in equity and debt underwriting was partially offset by a 
decline in advisory. Advisory revenues decreased 21%, 
reflecting a decline in EMEA, driven by macroeconomic 
uncertainties resulting in a lower market wallet, in 
addition to lower wallet share. Equity underwriting 
revenues increased 32%, reflecting growth in EMEA and 
North America, driven by growth in wallet share, partially 
offset by lower market wallet. Debt underwriting 
revenues increased 190%, reflecting growth in North 
America and EMEA, driven by wallet share gains, largely 
in investment grade, as well as growth in leveraged loans. 
The increase in debt underwriting revenues also reflected 
an absence of certain realized and unrealized losses of 
$110 million in the prior-year period, compared to gains 
of $16 million in the current-year period.
Corporate lending revenues increased 2%, including the 
impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges. Excluding the 
impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, revenues 
increased modestly (up 1%).

Within Markets:

•

•

Fixed income markets revenues were largely unchanged. 
Rates and currencies revenues increased 4%, driven by 
strength in rates, partially offset by a decline in the 
currencies business, primarily reflecting lower volatility 
and a strong prior-year comparison. Spread products and 
other fixed income revenues decreased 11%, driven by 
lower client activity. 
Equity markets revenues decreased 14%, primarily due to 
a decline in equity derivatives, largely driven by the same 
factors described above, as well as a modest decline in 
equity cash. 

Within Banking:

•

•

Investment banking revenues decreased 9%. Advisory 
revenues decreased 31%, primarily driven by lower 
market wallet. Equity underwriting revenues decreased 
13%, driven by lower wallet share. Debt underwriting 
revenues increased 18%, driven by growth in wallet share, 
partially offset by a decline in market wallet. 
Corporate lending revenues decreased 43%, including the 
impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges. Excluding the 
impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, revenues 
decreased 12%, primarily driven by the impact of foreign 
currency translation, as well as lower volumes.

Expenses increased 9%, primarily driven by continued 
investment in Citi’s transformation, investments in TTS, other 
risk and controls investments, volume-related expenses and 
other structural expenses, including severance costs, partially 
offset by productivity savings and FX translation.

Provisions reflected a cost of $182 million, compared to 
$855 million in the prior-year period. Net credit losses were 
$146 million, compared to $48 million in the prior-year 
period. 

The ACL build was $36 million, compared to $807 

million in the prior-year period. The lower build was driven by 
the absence of Russia-related ACL builds in the prior-year 
period. The lower build was partially offset by a $458 million 
build for other assets, primarily related to an increase in 
transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S. driven 
by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking 
law.

Expenses increased 10%, primarily driven by continued 
investment in risk and controls and volume-related expenses, 
partially offset by productivity savings. 

Provisions reflected a cost of $196 million, compared to 

$86 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by an ACL 
build for loans and higher net credit losses. Net credit losses 
were $51 million, compared to no losses in the prior-year 
period.

The ACL build was $145 million, compared to $86 
million in the prior-year period, largely driven by an ACL 
build for loans of $101 million, primarily due to specific risks 
and uncertainties impacting vulnerable industries and regions, 
partially offset by improved key macroeconomic variable 
forecasts. For additional information on Citi’s ACL, see 
“Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” 
below.

portfolio, see “Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk—

above, “Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk
—Argentina” and “—Russia” and “Forward-Looking 
Statements” below and “Risk Factors” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-
K.

2023 YTD vs. 2022 YTD
Net income of $7.9 billion decreased 10%, primarily driven by 
higher expenses and higher cost of credit, partially offset by a 
modest increase in revenues.

Revenues increased 1% (including gain (loss) on loan 
hedges), driven by higher Services revenues, partially offset 
by lower Banking and Markets revenues as well as the 
approximate $180 million net impact from the currency 
devaluation in Argentina. Services revenues increased 18%, 
driven by higher revenues in both TTS and Securities services. 
Banking revenues declined 27% (including the impact of the 
gain (loss) on loan hedges), reflecting lower revenues in both 
Investment banking and Corporate lending. Markets revenues 
declined 3%, driven by lower revenues in Equity markets, 
reflecting lower client activity, driven by decreased volatility 
and a strong prior-year comparison. 

Within Services:

•

•

TTS revenues increased 18%, with growth in net interest 
income of 24% and non-interest revenue of 7%, largely 
driven by the same factors described above.
Securities services revenues increased 18%, reflecting 
higher net interest income, largely driven by the same 
factors described above. Non-interest revenue declined 
3%, as a decrease in revenues in the custody business and 
the impact from the currency devaluation in Argentina 
were partially offset by an increase in Issuer services.

PERSONAL BANKING AND WEALTH MANAGEMENT

Personal Banking and Wealth Management (PBWM) consists of U.S. Personal Banking and Global Wealth Management (Global 
Wealth). U.S. Personal Banking includes Branded cards and Retail services, which have proprietary card portfolios (Cash, Rewards 
and Value) and co-branded cards (including Costco and American Airlines) within Branded cards, and co-brand and private label 
relationships within Retail services (including, among others, The Home Depot, Best Buy, Sears and Macy’s). U.S. Personal Banking 
also includes Retail banking, which provides traditional banking services to retail and small business customers. Global Wealth 
includes Private bank, Wealth at Work and Citigold and provides financial services to clients from affluent to ultra-high-net-worth 
through banking, lending, mortgages, investment, custody and trust product offerings in 20 countries, including the U.S., Mexico and 
four wealth management centers: Singapore, Hong Kong, the UAE and London.

For information on Citi’s planned revision to its financial reporting structure as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, including, 

among other things, the elimination of the PBWM operating segment and the resulting creation of two new reportable operating 
segments (Wealth, consisting of Private Bank, Wealth at Work and Citigold; and U.S. Personal Banking, consisting of Cards (Branded 
Cards and Retail Services) and Retail Banking), see “Planned Revision to Operating Model and Financial Reporting Structure” above.
At September 30, 2023, U.S. Personal Banking had 652 retail bank branches concentrated in the six key metropolitan areas of 

New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and Washington, D.C. U.S. Personal Banking had $156 billion in 
outstanding credit card balances, $109 billion in deposits, $39 billion in mortgages and $4 billion in personal and small business loans. 
Global Wealth had $307 billion in deposits, $89 billion in mortgage loans, $57 billion in personal and small business loans and $5 
billion in outstanding credit card balances.

3Q23 vs. 3Q22 
Net income was $803 million, compared to $792 million in the 
prior-year period, driven by higher revenues, partially offset 
by higher cost of credit and higher expenses.

Revenues increased 10%, primarily driven by higher net 

interest income, reflecting strong loan growth in U.S. Personal 
Banking, as well as higher non-interest revenue, primarily due 
to lower partner payments in Retail services and higher 
investment product revenues in Global Wealth. 

U.S. Personal Banking revenues increased 13%, reflecting 
higher revenues in cards, partially offset by lower revenues in 
Retail banking.

Cards revenues increased 16%. Branded cards revenues 

increased 12%, primarily driven by the higher net interest 
income, reflecting the strong loan growth. Branded cards new 
account acquisitions increased 5% and card spend volumes 
increased 4%. Average loans increased 12%, reflecting lower 
payment rates and the higher card spend volumes.

Retail services revenues increased 21%, primarily driven 
by the higher net interest income on higher loan balances, as 
well as higher non-interest revenue due to the lower partner 
payments on higher net credit losses. Retail services card 
spend volumes decreased 5%, primarily driven by lower 
discretionary retail spend. Average loans increased 9%, 
reflecting lower payment rates, partially offset by the lower 
card spend volumes. 

Retail banking revenues decreased 3%, primarily driven 
by the impact of the transfer of certain relationships and the 
associated deposit balances to Global Wealth, partially offset 
by strength in deposit spreads. Average loans increased 17%, 
primarily driven by mortgage originations and lower 
refinancings due to higher interest rates. Average deposits 
decreased 4%, largely reflecting the transfer of certain 
relationships and the associated deposit balances to Global 
Wealth.

Global Wealth revenues increased 2%, primarily driven 
by higher investment product revenue across all regions, the 
benefits of the transfer of certain relationships and the 
associated deposit balances from Retail banking, and higher 
lending revenue. Average loans were largely unchanged. 
Average deposits decreased 1%, reflecting transfers to higher-
yielding investments on Citi’s platform. Client assets 
increased 7%, primarily driven by increases in market 
valuations and net new inflows. Client advisors were largely 
unchanged. Private bank revenues decreased 1%, driven by 
higher interest rates paid on deposits, partially offset by the 
higher investment product revenue. Wealth at Work revenues 
increased 29%, driven by higher lending spreads and loan 
growth, primarily in mortgages, and Citigold revenues 
decreased 1%. 

Expenses increased 5%, largely driven by risk and 
controls investments and severance costs, partially offset by 
productivity savings.

Provisions were $1.5 billion, compared to $1.1 billion in 

the prior-year period, largely driven by higher net credit 
losses, partially offset by a lower net ACL build for loans. Net 
credit losses increased 89%, reflecting ongoing normalization 
in cards, with Branded cards net credit losses up 103% to $707 
million and Retail services net credit losses up 82% to $573 
million. Both Branded cards and Retail services net credit 
losses are expected to reach pre-pandemic levels by the end of 
2023. 

The net ACL build was $90 million, compared to $386 
million in the prior-year period, primarily reflecting growth in 
loan balances in Branded cards and Retail services. For 
additional information on Citi’s ACL, see “Significant 
Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” below.

For additional information on U.S. Personal Banking’s 

Branded cards, Retail services and Retail banking portfolios, 
see “Credit Risk—Consumer Credit” below.

For additional information about trends, uncertainties and 

risks related to PBWM’s future results, see “Executive 
Summary” above and “Forward-Looking Statements” below, 
and “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-
K.

2023 YTD vs. 2022 YTD
Net income was $1.8 billion, compared to $3.2 billion in the 
prior-year period, driven by higher cost of credit and higher 
expenses, partially offset by higher revenues. 

Revenues increased 8%, largely due to higher revenues in 

U.S. Personal Banking. U.S. Personal Banking revenues 
increased 14%, reflecting higher revenues in cards, largely 
driven by the same factors described above. Retail banking 
revenues decreased 3%, largely driven by the impact of the 
transfer of certain relationships and the associated deposit 
balances to Global Wealth. Global Wealth revenues decreased 
4%, largely driven by investment product revenue headwinds 
and lower net interest income, partially offset by the benefits 
of the transfer of certain relationships and the associated 
deposit balances from Retail banking. 

Expenses increased 7%, primarily driven by continued 
investments in Citi’s transformation, other risk and controls 
investments and severance costs, partially offset by 
productivity savings. 

Provisions were $4.6 billion, compared to $2.1 billion in 

the prior-year period, reflecting higher net credit losses, 
primarily driven by ongoing normalization in Branded cards 
and Retail services, as well as a net ACL build for loans. 

The net ACL build was $925 million, primarily driven by 
growth in loan balances in Branded cards and Retail services, 
compared to a release of $25 million in the prior-year period.

LEGACY FRANCHISES

As of September 30, 2023, Legacy Franchises included (i) Asia Consumer Banking (Asia Consumer), representing the consumer 
banking operations of the remaining five exit countries (China, Indonesia, Korea, Poland and Russia), (ii) Mexico Consumer Banking 
(Mexico Consumer) and Mexico Small Business and Middle-Market Banking (Mexico SBMM), collectively Mexico Consumer/
SBMM, and (iii) Legacy Holdings Assets (certain North America consumer mortgage loans and other legacy assets). Asia Consumer 
provides traditional retail banking and branded card products to retail and small business customers. Mexico Consumer/SBMM 
provides traditional retail banking and branded card products to consumers and small business customers and traditional middle-
market banking products and services to commercial customers through Citibanamex. 

For information on Citi’s planned revision to its financial reporting structure as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, including, 

among other things, the creation of a new All Other category, which will include Legacy Franchises (Asia Consumer, Mexico 
Consumer/SBMM and Legacy Holdings Assets), see “Planned Revision to Operating Model and Financial Reporting Structure” 
above.

Legacy Franchises also included the following eight Asia Consumer businesses prior to their sales: Australia, until its closing in 
June 2022; the Philippines, until its closing in August 2022; Thailand and Malaysia, until their closings in November 2022; Bahrain, 
until its closing in December 2022; India and Vietnam, until their closings in March 2023; and Taiwan, until its closing in August 
2023. 

Additionally, Citi has entered into an agreement to sell its consumer banking business in Indonesia and has continued to make 

progress on its wind-downs in China, Korea and Russia. In October 2023, Citi also announced the signing of an agreement to sell its 
onshore consumer wealth business in China. See Note 2 for additional information on Legacy Franchises’ consumer banking business 
sales and wind-downs. For additional information about Citi’s continued efforts to reduce its operations and exposures in Russia, see 
“Institutional Clients Group” above and “Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—Russia” below, as well as “Risk 
Factors” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

As previously disclosed, Citi intends to pursue an IPO of its consumer, small business and middle-market banking operations in 
Mexico. Citi will retain its ICG and Private bank businesses in Mexico. Citi currently expects that the separation of the businesses will 
be completed in the second half of 2024 and that the IPO will take place in 2025.

At September 30, 2023, on a combined basis, Legacy Franchises had 1,355 retail branches, $20 billion in retail banking loans and 
$51 billion in deposits. In addition, the businesses had $9 billion in outstanding card loan balances, and Mexico SBMM had $8 billion 
in outstanding corporate loan balances.

3Q23 vs. 3Q22 
Net income was $125 million, compared to $316 million in the 
prior-year period, driven by lower revenues and higher cost of 
credit, partially offset by lower expenses. 

Results for the third quarter of 2023 included divestiture-

related impacts of approximately $299 million in earnings 
before taxes (approximately $214 million after-tax), reflecting 
the following:

•

•

•
•

$396 million of aggregate divestiture-related revenues, 
primarily related to a gain on sale of the Taiwan consumer 
business, recorded in Other revenue
$114 million of aggregate divestiture-related expenses, 
largely relating to separation costs in Mexico Consumer/
SBMM and severance costs in Asia Consumer
$(17) million benefit of divestiture-related credit costs
$85 million of related taxes

Results for the third quarter of 2022 included divestiture-
related impacts of approximately $519 million (approximately 
$256 million after-tax), reflecting the following:

•

•

•
•

$614 million of aggregate divestiture-related revenues, 
primarily related to a gain on sale of the Philippines 
consumer business, recorded in Other revenue
$107 million of aggregate divestiture-related expenses, 
primarily composed of transaction costs (recognized as an 
operating expense) associated with the Philippines gain on 
sale, as well as severance and related costs associated 
with Asia Consumer
$(12) million benefit of divestiture-related credit costs
$263 million of related taxes

Revenues decreased 13%, primarily driven by lower 

revenues in Asia Consumer, partially offset by higher 
revenues in Mexico Consumer/SBMM. 

For additional information about trends, uncertainties and 

risks related to Legacy Franchises’ future results, see 
“Executive Summary” above, “Managing Global Risk—Other 
Risks—Country Risk—Russia” and “Forward-Looking 
Statements” below and “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” in 
Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

2023 YTD vs. 2022 YTD
Net income was $604 million, compared to a net loss of $84 
million in the prior-year period, driven by higher revenues and 
lower expenses, partially offset by higher cost of credit. 

Results for year-to-date 2023 included divestiture-related 

impacts of approximately $1.2 billion (approximately $770 
million after-tax), reflecting the following:

•

•
•
•

$1.4 billion of net divestiture gains, primarily related to 
the gain on sales of the India and Taiwan consumer 
banking businesses, recorded in Other revenue 
$266 million of aggregate divestiture-related expenses 
$(37) million benefit of divestiture-related credit costs 
$409 million of related taxes

Results for year-to-date 2022 included divestiture-related 

impacts of approximately $(110) million (approximately 
$(297) million after-tax), reflecting the following: 

•

•

•
•

$645 million of net divestiture gains, primarily related to 
a $616 million gain on sale of the Philippines consumer 
banking business, recorded in Other revenue in the third 
quarter of 2022
$638 million of aggregate divestiture-related expenses, 
including a $535 million goodwill impairment in the first 
quarter of 2022
$117 million of divestiture-related credit costs 
$187 million of related taxes 

Asia Consumer revenues of $672 million decreased from 

Revenues increased 9%, driven by higher revenues in 

$1.4 billion in the prior-year period, mainly driven by the 
lower gain on sale impacts in Asia Consumer and the 
reduction from exited markets and continued wind-downs. 
Mexico Consumer/SBMM revenues increased 32%, as 
cards revenues increased 46%, SBMM revenues increased 
27% and retail banking revenues increased 28%, primarily due 
to the benefit of FX translation as well as higher interest rates 
and higher lending volumes. 

Legacy Holdings Assets revenues of $(7) million 
decreased from $9 million in the prior-year period, largely 
driven by the continued wind-down of legacy assets.

Expenses decreased 3%, mainly driven by the impact of 

the exited markets and continued wind-downs, partially offset 
by separation costs and the impact of FX translation in Mexico 
Consumer/SBMM. 

Provisions were $188 million, compared to $167 million 
in the prior-year period, primarily driven by higher net credit 
losses, partially offset by a net ACL release in the current 
quarter. Net credit losses increased 34%, largely driven by the 
ongoing normalization in the Mexico Consumer portfolios. 

Mexico Consumer/SBMM and Legacy Holdings Assets, 
partially offset by lower revenues in Asia Consumer. 

Asia Consumer revenues decreased 13%, primarily driven 

by the reduction from exited markets and wind-downs, 
partially offset by higher gain on sale impacts in the current-
year period. Mexico Consumer/SBMM revenues increased 
24%, mainly due to the benefit of FX translation as well as 
higher interest rates and higher lending volumes. Legacy 
Holdings Assets revenues of $34 million increased from 
$(115) million in the prior-year period, primarily driven by the 
release of a CTA loss (net of hedges) recorded in AOCI in the 
second quarter of 2022. 

Expenses decreased 11%, mainly driven by the absence of 

the goodwill impairment that occurred in the first quarter of 
2022 and the impact of the exited markets and continued 
wind-downs.

Provisions were $833 million, compared to $448 million 
in the prior-year period, driven by higher lending volumes and 
net credit losses in Mexico Consumer, as well as a build for 
other assets, primarily related to an increase in transfer risk 
associated with exposures outside the U.S. driven by safety 
and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law.

CORPORATE/OTHER 

Activities not assigned to the operating segments (ICG, PBWM and Legacy Franchises) are included in Corporate/Other. Corporate/
Other included certain unallocated costs of global staff functions (including finance, risk, human resources, legal and compliance-
related costs), other corporate expenses and unallocated global operations and technology expenses and income taxes, as well as 
results of Corporate Treasury investment activities and discontinued operations. For information on Citi’s planned revision to its 
financial reporting structure as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, including, among other things, the creation of a new All Other 
category, which will include Corporate/Other, see “Planned Revision to Operating Model and Financial Reporting Structure” above. 
At September 30, 2023, Corporate/Other had $95 billion in assets, including Corporate Treasury investment securities and the 
Company’s deferred tax assets (DTAs).

3Q23 vs. 3Q22
Net income was $189 million, compared to $209 million in the 
prior-year period. The decrease in net income was primarily 
driven by higher income tax expense due to the geographic 
mix of earnings, partially offset by higher revenues and lower 
expenses. 

Revenues increased to $500 million, compared to $299 
million in the prior-year period, largely driven by the absence 
of prior-year mark-to-market losses, primarily related to 
retained interchange litigation risk associated with shares of 
Visa B common stock that Citi previously sold. 

Expenses were $237 million, compared to $286 million in 

the prior-year period, largely reflecting lower consulting 
expenses. 

For additional information about trends, uncertainties and 

risks related to Corporate/Other’s future results, see 
“Executive Summary” above, “Forward-Looking Statements” 
below and “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” in Citi’s 2022 
Form 10-K.

2023 YTD vs. 2022 YTD
Net income was $800 million, compared to net income of $448 
million in the prior-year period, largely driven by higher 
revenues and a prior-year release of a CTA loss (net of 
hedges) from AOCI (for additional information, see Note 2). 
The increase in net income was partially offset by higher 
income tax expense due to the geographic mix of earnings and 
lower discrete tax benefits as well as higher expenses.

Revenues increased to $2.1 billion, compared to $744 
million in the prior-year period, largely driven by higher net 
interest income from Deposits with banks and the investment 
portfolio, largely due to higher interest rates. 

Expenses were $849 million, compared to $706 million in 

the prior-year period, primarily reflecting higher severance 
costs, partially offset by lower consulting expenses.
