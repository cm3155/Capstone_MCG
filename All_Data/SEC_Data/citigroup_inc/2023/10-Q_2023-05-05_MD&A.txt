Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
Citi prepares its financial statements in accordance with U.S. 
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and also 
presents certain non-GAAP financial measures (non-GAAP 
measures) that exclude certain items or otherwise include 
components that differ from the most directly comparable 
measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-
GAAP measures are provided as additional useful information 
to assess Citi’s financial condition and results of operations 
(including period-to-period operating performance). These 
non-GAAP measures are not intended as a substitute for 
GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or 
calculated the same way as non-GAAP measures with similar 
names used by other companies. For more information, 
including the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial 
measures to their corresponding GAAP financial measures, 
see the respective sections where the measures are presented 
and described and the “Glossary of Terms and Acronyms” 
below.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

First Quarter of 2023—Results Demonstrated Continued 
Progress Toward Achieving Priorities
As described further throughout this Executive Summary, 
during the first quarter of 2023:

•

•

•

•

•

•

Citi’s revenues increased 12% versus the prior-year 
period, including a gain on sale of Citi’s India consumer 
banking business versus a loss related to the sale of Citi’s 
Australia consumer banking business in the prior-year 
period (for additional information, see “First Quarter of 
2023 Results Summary” below). Excluding these 
divestiture-related impacts, revenues increased 6%, 
primarily driven by higher net interest income, partially 
offset by lower non-interest revenues.
Citi’s expenses increased 1% versus the prior-year period, 
including divestiture-related impacts in both the current 
and prior-year periods (for additional information, see 
“First Quarter of 2023 Results Summary” below). 
Excluding these divestiture-related impacts, expenses 
increased 5%, primarily driven by continued investments 
in Citi’s transformation, other risk and control 
investments, inflation and severance costs, all partially 
offset by the benefit of productivity savings, foreign 
exchange translation and expense reduction from the 
closed exit markets and wind-downs (for additional 
information, see “Expenses” below).
Citi’s cost of credit was $2.0 billion versus $0.8 billion in 
the prior-year period. The increase reflected a net build of 
$0.7 billion in the allowance for credit losses (ACL) for 
loans and unfunded commitments and other provisions, 
compared to a net ACL release of $0.1 billion in the prior-
year period, primarily driven by macroeconomic 
deterioration and growth in card revolving balances, and 
higher net credit losses, primarily driven by ongoing 
normalization in Branded cards and Retail services.
Citi returned $1.0 billion to common shareholders in the 
form of dividends.
Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio 
increased to 13.4% as of March 31, 2023, compared to 
11.4% as of March 31, 2022 (for additional information, 
see “Capital Resources” below). This compares to Citi’s 
required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 12.0% as of 
January 1, 2023 under the Basel III Standardized 
Approach. 
Citi continued to make further progress on its consumer 
banking business divestitures in the first quarter of 2023, 
including, among other things, completing the sales of its 
India and Vietnam consumer banking businesses and 
working toward closing two additional sale transactions in 
2023, as well as progressing with the continued wind-
downs of the Korea and China consumer banking 
businesses and the Russia consumer, local commercial 
and institutional businesses.

First Quarter of 2023 Results Summary

Citigroup
Citigroup reported net income of $4.6 billion, or $2.19 per 
share, compared to net income of $4.3 billion, or $2.02 per 
share in the prior-year period. The increase in net income was 
primarily driven by the higher revenues, partially offset by the 
higher expenses and the higher cost of credit. Citigroup’s 
effective tax rate was approximately 25% in the current 
quarter, including the impact of divestitures, versus 18% in the 
prior-year period, which had higher discrete tax benefits (for 
additional information, see “Income Taxes” below). Earnings 
per share (EPS) increased 8%, reflecting the higher net income 
and an approximate 1% decline in average diluted shares 
outstanding. 

Results for the first quarter of 2023 included divestiture-

related impacts of $953 million in earnings before taxes ($648 
million after-tax), primarily recorded in Legacy Franchises, 
reflecting the following: 

•

•

•
•

$1,018 million of net divestiture gains, primarily related 
to a gain on sale of the India consumer banking business, 
recorded in revenues 
$73 million of aggregate divestiture-related costs, 
recorded in expenses
An $8 million benefit of divestiture-related credit costs
$305 million of related taxes

These divestiture-related impacts, collectively, had a 
$0.33 positive impact on EPS in the current quarter. Excluding 
these divestiture-related impacts, EPS was $1.86. (As used 
throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi’s results of operations and 
financial condition excluding the impact of divestiture-related 
impacts are non-GAAP financial measures.)

Results for the first quarter of 2022 included divestiture-

related impacts of $(677) million in earnings before taxes 
($(588) million after-tax), recorded in Legacy Franchises, 
reflecting the following:

•

• A $118 million pretax loss primarily related to the Asia 
markets, recorded in revenues; this pretax loss reflected 
an ACL release of $(104) million and a net revenue 
impact of $(14) million due to contractual adjustments
A $71 million cost of credit reclassification to revenues, 
as once a divestiture is classified as held-for-sale, credit 
costs, including ACL builds/releases and net credit losses, 
are reclassified to revenues
A $535 million goodwill impairment recorded in 
expenses, due to the re-segmentation and sequencing of 
divestitures, as well as $24 million of costs related to the 
Korea voluntary early retirement program, also recorded 
in expenses
$(89) million of related tax benefits

•

•

These divestiture-related impacts, collectively, had a 
$(0.30) negative impact on EPS in the prior-year period. 
Excluding these divestiture-related impacts, EPS was $2.32.

Citigroup revenues of $21.4 billion in the first quarter of 
2023 increased 12% from the prior-year period. As discussed 
above, reported revenues included net divestiture gains of 
approximately $1.0 billion this quarter, primarily related to the 
gain on sale of the India consumer banking business, 
compared to a loss of $47 million primarily related to the Asia 
markets in the prior-year period, both recorded in Legacy 
Franchises. Excluding these impacts, revenues increased 6%, 
reflecting strength across Services and Fixed income markets 
in Institutional Clients Group (ICG), as well as strong average 
loan growth in U.S. Personal Banking in Personal Banking 
and Wealth Management (PBWM). The higher revenues were 
partially offset by a decline in Investment banking and Equity 
markets in ICG and lower investment product revenues in 
Global Wealth Management (Global Wealth) in PBWM, as 
well as impacts from the closed exit markets and wind-downs 
in Legacy Franchises.

in Citi’s transformation, other risk and control investments, 
volume-related expenses and inflation.

Cost of Credit
Citi’s total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and 
claims was a cost of $2.0 billion, compared to $0.8 billion in 
the prior-year period. This increase reflected higher net credit 
losses (see below) and a net build of $0.7 billion in the ACL 
for loans and unfunded commitments and other provisions, 
primarily driven by macroeconomic deterioration and growth 
in card revolving balances in PBWM. This compared to a net 
ACL release and other provisions of $(0.1) billion in the prior-
year period. For additional information on Citi’s ACL, see 
“Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—
Citi’s Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)” below. 

Net credit losses of $1.3 billion increased 49% from the 
prior year. Consumer net credit losses of $1.3 billion increased 
52%, reflecting ongoing normalization, particularly in 
Branded cards and Retail services. Corporate net credit losses 
decreased to $22 million from $31 million. 

Citigroup’s end-of-period loans were $652 billion, down 

Citi also expects to incur higher net credit losses in 2023, 

1% versus the prior-year period, as growth in PBWM was 
more than offset by a decline in ICG and Legacy Franchises. 

Citigroup’s end-of-period deposits were approximately 
$1.3 trillion, largely unchanged versus the prior-year period, 
as a decrease in PBWM, largely reflecting Global Wealth 
clients reallocating deposits to higher-yielding investments on 
the business’s platform, was offset by an increase in 
institutional certificates of deposit in Corporate/Other. For 
additional information about Citi’s deposits by business, 
including drivers and deposit trends, see each respective 
business’s results of operations and “Liquidity Risk—
Deposits” below.

Expenses
Citigroup’s operating expenses of $13.3 billion increased 1% 
from the prior-year period. As discussed above, reported 
operating expenses included $73 million of divestiture-related 
costs this quarter, compared to $559 million in the prior-year 
period, both recorded in Legacy Franchises. Excluding these 
divestiture-related costs, expenses increased 5%, largely 
driven by the following:

•

•

Approximately 1% by continued investments in Citi’s 
transformation, largely related to risk and controls, data 
and finance programs.
Approximately 4% by structural expenses, largely in 
compensation and benefits, which included the full-year 
impact of hiring in the prior year, as well as hiring in the 
first quarter of 2023; and the impact of inflation and 
severance costs.

The increase in expenses was partially offset by 

productivity savings, lower business-led investments and the 
impact of foreign exchange translation, as well as expense 
reduction from the closed exit markets and wind-downs in 
Legacy Franchises.

As previously announced, Citi expects to incur higher 
expenses in 2023, primarily reflecting continued investments 

primarily driven by continued normalization toward pre-
pandemic levels, particularly in the cards business in PBWM.
For additional information on Citi’s consumer and 

corporate credit costs, see each respective business’s results of 
operations and “Credit Risk” below.

Capital
Citigroup’s CET1 Capital ratio was 13.4% as of March 31, 
2023, compared to 11.4% as of March 31, 2022, based on the 
Basel III Standardized Approach for determining risk-
weighted assets (RWA). The increase was primarily driven by 
net income, the impacts from the closing of the Asia consumer 
banking business sales, and business actions, including a 
reduction in RWA, partially offset by the payment of common 
dividends.

Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio as of March 

31, 2023 was 6.0%, compared to 5.6% as of March 31, 2022. 
The increase was driven by higher Tier 1 Capital, partially 
offset by a slight increase in Total Leverage Exposure. For 
additional information on Citi’s capital ratios and related 
components, see “Capital Resources” below.

During the first quarter of 2023, Citi continued to pause 
common share repurchases, in anticipation of any temporary 
capital impacts related to any potential signing of a sale 
agreement for its Mexico Consumer/SBMM businesses (for 
additional information, see “Macroeconomic and Other Risks 
and Uncertainties” and the capital return risk factor in “Risk 
Factors” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K) and to continue to have 
ample capital to serve its clients.

Institutional Clients Group
ICG net income of $3.3 billion increased 23%, primarily 
driven by lower cost of credit and higher revenues, partially 
offset by higher expenses. ICG operating expenses of $7.0 
billion increased 4%, largely driven by continued investments 
in Citi’s transformation, other risk and control investments, 
volume-related expenses and other structural expenses, 
including severance costs, partially offset by productivity 
savings and the impact of foreign exchange translation.

4

ICG revenues of $11.2 billion increased 1% (including 

gain (loss) on loan hedges), as strength in Treasury and trade 
solutions (TTS), Securities services and Fixed income markets 
was partially offset by declines in Banking and Equity 
markets. Results included a loss on loan hedges of $199 
million in the first quarter of 2023, compared with a gain on 
loan hedges of $169 million in the prior-year period.

Services revenues of $4.5 billion increased 29%. TTS 
revenues of $3.4 billion increased 31%, driven by 41% growth 
in net interest income and 13% growth in non-interest revenue. 
Strong performance in TTS was driven by higher interest rates 
and business actions, including growth in deposits, managing 
repricing and growth in fees. Securities services revenues of 
$1.1 billion increased 23%, as net interest income increased 
94%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies, and 
were partially offset by a 6% decrease in non-interest revenue 
due to the impact of lower settlement volumes and lower 
market valuations on assets under custody and administration.
Markets revenues of $5.6 billion decreased 4%, as growth 
in Fixed income markets was more than offset by a decline in 
Equity markets. Fixed income markets revenues of $4.5 billion 
increased 4%, primarily driven by strength in rates and 
currencies, partially offset by lower revenues in spread 
products and other fixed income. Equity markets revenues of 
$1.1 billion declined 25%, primarily reflecting reduced client 
activity in cash and equity derivatives relative to a strong 
quarter in the prior-year period.

Banking revenues of $1.2 billion decreased 38%, 

including the gain (loss) on loan hedges in the current quarter 
and the prior-year period. Excluding the gain (loss) on loan 
hedges, Banking revenues of $1.4 billion decreased 21%, 
driven by lower revenues in Investment banking and 
Corporate lending. Investment banking revenues of $774 
million decreased 25%, reflecting a decline in the overall 
market wallet, as continued geopolitical uncertainty, 
heightened macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility 
continued to impact client activity. Corporate lending revenues 
decreased 54%, including the impact of the gain (loss) on loan 
hedges. Excluding the impact of the gain (loss) on loan 
hedges, Corporate lending revenues decreased 14% versus the 
prior-year period, driven by lower volumes and higher 
hedging costs. 

For additional information on the results of operations of 

ICG for the first quarter of 2023, see “Institutional Clients 
Group” below.

Personal Banking and Wealth Management
PBWM net income of $489 million decreased 74%, driven by 
higher cost of credit and higher expenses, partially offset by 
higher revenues. PBWM operating expenses of $4.3 billion 
increased 9%, primarily driven by continued investments in 
Citi’s transformation, other risk and control investments and 
severance costs, partially offset by productivity savings.

PBWM revenues of $6.4 billion increased 9%, primarily 

due to higher net interest income, driven by strong loan 
growth across U.S. Personal Banking, partially offset by a 
decline in non-interest revenue, primarily driven by lower 
investment product revenues in Global Wealth.

U.S. Personal Banking revenues of $4.7 billion increased 
18%. Branded cards revenues of $2.5 billion increased 18%, 

5

primarily driven by the higher net interest income, as card 
spend volume increased 9% and average loans increased 15%. 
Retail services revenues of $1.6 billion increased 24%, 
primarily driven by the higher net interest income. Retail 
banking revenues of $613 million increased 3%, primarily 
driven by higher mortgage revenue and strong growth in 
installment lending, partially offset by the impact of the 
transfer of relationships and the associated deposit balances to 
Global Wealth.

Global Wealth revenues of $1.8 billion decreased 9%, 
largely driven by investment product revenue headwinds and 
higher interest rates paid on deposits, particularly in the 
Private bank.

For additional information on the results of operations of 

PBWM for the first quarter of 2023, see “Personal Banking 
and Wealth Management” below.

Legacy Franchises
Legacy Franchises net income was $604 million, compared to 
a net loss of $383 million in the prior-year period, primarily 
driven by higher revenues and lower expenses, partially offset 
by higher cost of credit. 

Legacy Franchises revenues of $2.9 billion increased 

48%, primarily driven by the gain on sale of the India 
consumer banking business, partially offset by the absence of 
the closed exit markets and wind-downs. 

Legacy Franchises expenses of $1.8 billion decreased 

24%, largely driven by the absence of the goodwill 
impairment in Asia Consumer Banking (Asia Consumer) 
recorded in the prior-year period and the benefit of the closed 
exit markets and wind-downs.

For additional information on the results of operations of 
Legacy Franchises for the first quarter of 2023, see “Legacy 
Franchises” below.

Corporate/Other 
Corporate/Other net income was $255 million, compared to 
$189 million in the prior-year period, reflecting higher 
revenues, partially offset by higher cost of credit, higher 
expenses and lower income tax benefits. Corporate/Other 
operating expenses of $310 million increased 19%, driven by 
continued investments in Citi’s transformation and other risk 
and control investments, partially offset by lower consulting 
expenses. 

Corporate/Other revenues of $914 million increased from 

$190 million in the prior-year period, driven by higher net 
interest income. The higher net interest income was primarily 
due to the investment portfolio, largely driven by higher 
interest rates. 

For additional information on the results of operations of 
Corporate/Other for the first quarter of 2023, see “Corporate/
Other” below.

Macroeconomic and Other Risks and Uncertainties
Various geopolitical and macroeconomic challenges and 
uncertainties continue to adversely impact economic 
conditions in the U.S. and globally, including continued 
elevated levels of inflation, central banks continuing to 
increase interest rates, recent bank failures and related 
volatility, uncertainty with respect to raising the U.S. federal 

debt limit, and economic and geopolitical challenges related to 
China and the Russia–Ukraine war. These and other factors 
have adversely affected financial markets, negatively impacted 
global economic growth rates and increased the risk of 
recession in the U.S., Europe and other countries. These and 
other factors could adversely affect Citi’s customers, clients, 
businesses, funding costs, expenses and overall results of 
operations and financial condition during the remainder of 
2023.

For example, on April 18, 2023, the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) announced that in May 2023, it 
will propose a special assessment to recover the uninsured 
deposit losses from the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and 
Signature Bank. On May 1, 2023, the FDIC announced that its 
Deposit Insurance Fund will incur additional costs related to 
the resolution of First Republic Bank. The FDIC did not 
indicate how it proposes covering these costs, but First 
Republic Bank was not resolved under special emergency 
provisions. Citibank, N.A. could incur an increase in its non-
interest expense from the imposition of additional costs by the 
FDIC, although the amount of such costs is not yet known or 
reasonably estimable. 

In addition, Citi could incur a significant loss on sale due 

to currency translation adjustment (CTA) losses (net of 
hedges) in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 
(AOCI), allocated goodwill and intangibles and other AOCI 
loss components related to the potential signing of a sale 
agreement for its remaining consumer banking divestitures. 
The majority of these losses would be regulatory capital 
neutral at closing.

For a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and risks 

that will or could impact Citi’s businesses, results of 
operations, capital and other financial condition during the 
remainder of 2023, see “First Quarter of 2023 Results 
Summary” above and each respective business’s results of 
operations, “Managing Global Risk,” including “Managing 
Global Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—Russia” and “—
Argentina,” and “Forward-Looking Statements” below and

INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS GROUP

Institutional Clients Group (ICG) includes Services, Markets and Banking (for additional information on these businesses, see 
“Citigroup Operating Segments” above). ICG provides corporate, institutional and public sector clients around the world with a full 
range of wholesale banking products and services, including fixed income and equity sales and trading, foreign exchange, prime 
brokerage, derivative services, equity and fixed income research, corporate lending, investment banking and advisory services, cash 
management, trade finance and securities services. ICG transacts with clients in both cash instruments and derivatives, including fixed 
income, foreign currency, equity and commodity products. For more information on ICG’s business activities, see “Institutional 
Clients Group” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K. 

ICG’s international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 95 
countries and jurisdictions. As part of previously disclosed plans, Citi has ended nearly all of the institutional banking services it 
offered in Russia as of March 31, 2023, with the remaining services only those necessary to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory 
obligations. In connection with this wind-down, Citi expects to incur approximately $210 million in total estimated charges (excluding 
the impact from any portfolio sales), of which $60 million relates to ICG. For additional information about Citi’s continued efforts to 
reduce its operations and exposure in Russia, see “Legacy Franchises” and “Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—
Russia” below.

At March 31, 2023, ICG had $1.8 trillion in assets and $819 billion in deposits. Securities services managed $23.0 trillion in 
assets under custody and administration at March 31, 2023, of which Citi provided both custody and administrative services to certain 
clients related to $1.9 trillion of such assets. Managed assets under trust were $3.9 trillion at March 31, 2023. For additional 
information on these operations, see “Administration and Other Fiduciary Fees” in Note 5.

(1)  Citi assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items. For example, securities that generate Net 

interest income may be risk managed with derivatives that are recorded in Principal transactions revenue within Non-interest revenue. For a description of the 
composition of these revenue line items, see Notes 4, 5 and 6.

(2)  Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. Gain (loss) on 

loan hedges include the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. The fixed premium 
costs of these hedges are netted against the corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. Citigroup’s results of operations excluding the 
impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.

The discussion of the results of operations for ICG below excludes (where noted) the impact of any gain (loss) on hedges of accrual 
loans, which are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.

1Q23 vs. 1Q22
Net income of $3.3 billion increased 23%, primarily driven by 
lower cost of credit and higher revenues, partially offset by 
higher expenses.

Revenues increased 1% (including gain (loss) on loan 
hedges), driven by higher Services revenues, partially offset 
by lower Banking and Markets revenues. Services revenues 
were up 29%, driven by higher revenues in both TTS and 
Securities services. Banking revenues were down 38% 
(including the impact of the gain (loss) on loan hedges), 
reflecting lower revenues in both Investment banking and 
Corporate lending. Markets revenues were down 4%, driven 
by Equity markets, partially offset by higher Fixed income 
markets revenues.

Within Services:

•

•

TTS revenues increased 31%, driven by 41% growth in 
net interest income and 13% growth in non-interest 
revenue, reflecting strong growth across all client 
segments. The increase in net interest income was 
primarily driven by higher interest rates and business 
actions, including growth in deposits and managing 
repricing. Average deposits increased 5%, largely driven 
by growth in EMEA and North America. Average loans 
decreased 2%, largely reflecting loans sales, primarily in 
North America. The increase in non-interest revenue was 
primarily due to strong fee growth across both the cash 
and trade businesses, reflecting solid client engagement 
and continued growth of underlying drivers, with U.S. 
dollar clearing volumes up 6%, cross-border flows up 
10% and commercial card spend up 40%.
Securities services revenues increased 23%, as net interest 
income grew 94%, driven by higher interest rates across 
currencies. The increase in revenues was partially offset 
by lower non-interest revenues (decrease of 6%), driven 
by lower settlement volumes (decline of 3%), along with 
lower market valuations on assets under custody and 
administration. The decline in non-interest revenue was 
partially offset by higher existing client activity and new 
client onboarding and continued elevated levels of 
corporate activity in Issuer services.

Within Markets:

•

Fixed income markets revenues increased 4%, driven by 
growth in rates and currencies, primarily in North 
America, partially offset by a decline in spread products 
and other fixed income, primarily in North America and 
EMEA.

Rates and currencies increased 13%, driven by the 
rates business, reflecting increased interest rate volatility, 
partially offset by a decline in the currencies business due 
to a strong prior-year comparison. Spread products and 
other fixed income revenues decreased 24%, due to 
decreased institutional and corporate client activity in 
spread products and a decline in commodities, primarily 

•

in North America, driven by decreased volatility against a 
strong prior-year comparison. 
Equity markets revenues decreased 25%, driven by equity 
derivatives, primarily reflecting lower activity in both 
corporate and institutional clients compared to a strong 
prior-year period. The lower revenues also reflected a 
decline in equity cash, driven by lower institutional client 
activity. Prime finance balances continued to grow in the 
quarter. 

Within Banking:

•

•

Investment banking revenues declined 25%, reflecting a 
decline in the overall market wallet, as continued 
geopolitical uncertainty, heightened macroeconomic 
uncertainty and volatility continued to impact client 
activity. Advisory revenues decreased 17%, reflecting a 
decline in North America and Asia, partially offset by 
growth in EMEA. The decrease in advisory revenues was 
driven by the lower market wallet, partially offset by 
wallet share gains. Equity underwriting revenues 
decreased 41%, reflecting a decline in North America, 
Asia and EMEA, driven by the decline in the market 
wallet as well as wallet share loss. Debt underwriting 
revenues decreased 24%, reflecting a decline in North 
America and EMEA, driven by the decline in the market 
wallet, partially offset by wallet share gains largely in the 
investment-grade portfolio.
Corporate lending revenues decreased 54%, including the 
impact of the gain (loss) on loan hedges. Excluding the 
impact of the gain (loss) on loan hedges, revenues 
decreased 14%, primarily driven by lower volumes and 
higher hedging costs. 

Expenses increased 4%, primarily driven by continued 
investment in Citi’s transformation, other risk and control 
investments, volume-related expenses and other structural 
expenses, including severance costs, partially offset by 
productivity savings and the impact of foreign exchange 
translation. 

Provisions reflected a benefit of $72 million, compared to 

costs of $971 million in the prior-year period, largely driven 
by an ACL release for loans and unfunded lending 
commitments and other provisions, compared to an ACL build 
in the prior-year period. Net credit losses were $22 million, 
compared to $30 million in the prior-year period.

The ACL release was $94 million, compared to a build of 

$941 million in the prior-year period. The year-over-year 
decrease in the ACL build was due to the absence of Russia-
related ACL builds in the prior-year period. The $94 million 
ACL release for the quarter was driven by a net ACL release 
for loans and unfunded lending commitments of $245 million, 
primarily due to reductions in Russia loan exposures, partially 
offset by $151 million related to an increase in transfer risk 
associated with exposures outside the U.S. For additional 
information on Citi’s ACL, see “Significant Accounting 
Policies and Significant Estimates” below.

1Q23 vs. 1Q22 
Net income was $489 million, compared to $1.9 billion in the 
prior-year period, driven by higher cost of credit and higher 
expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.

Revenues increased 9%, primarily due to higher net 

interest income, driven by strong loan growth across U.S. 
Personal Banking. The increase was partially offset by lower 
non-interest revenue, primarily reflecting lower investment 
product revenues in Global Wealth. 

U.S. Personal Banking revenues increased 18%, reflecting 

higher revenues in both cards and Retail banking.

Expenses increased 9%, primarily driven by continued 
investments in Citi’s transformation, other risk and control 
investments and severance costs, partially offset by 
productivity savings.

Provisions were $1.6 billion, compared to a benefit of 

$376 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by a net 
ACL build for loans and higher net credit losses. Net credit 
losses increased 58%, reflecting ongoing normalization from 
historically low levels, particularly in Branded cards (net 
credit losses up 72% to $521 million) and Retail services (net 
credit losses up 95% to $491 million). 

Cards revenues increased 20%. Branded cards revenues 

The net ACL build was $0.5 billion, compared to a net 

release of $1.1 billion in the prior-year period, primarily 
driven by a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions and 
growth in U.S. cards revolving balances. For additional 
information on Citi’s ACL, see “Significant Accounting 
Policies and Significant Estimates” below.

Branded cards, Retail services and Retail banking portfolios,

increased 18%, primarily driven by higher net interest income 
on higher card spend volumes and higher loan balances. 
Branded cards new account acquisitions increased 17% and 
card spend volumes increased 9%. Average loans increased 
15%, reflecting the higher card spend volumes and lower 
payment rates.

Retail services revenues increased 24%, primarily driven 
by higher net interest income on higher loan balances. Retail 
services card spend volumes decreased 3% and average loans 
increased 10%, reflecting lower payment rates. 

Retail banking revenues increased 3%, primarily driven 
by higher mortgage revenue and strong growth in installment 
lending, partially offset by the impact of the transfer of 
relationships and the associated deposit balances to Global 
Wealth. Average loans increased 14%, primarily driven by 
higher mortgage originations. Average deposits decreased 6%, 
reflecting the transfer of relationships and the associated 
deposit balances to Global Wealth.

Global Wealth revenues decreased 9%, largely reflecting 
investment product revenue headwinds and lower net interest 
income in the Private bank. Average deposits decreased 2% 
and average loans decreased 1%. The decline in average 
deposits largely reflected Global Wealth clients reallocating 
deposits to higher-yielding investments on the business’s 
platform, partially offset by the transfer of deposit 
relationships from Retail banking. Client assets decreased 4%, 
driven by declines in equity market valuations and lower 
deposits. Global Wealth continued to grow client advisors, 
which increased 3%. Private bank revenues decreased 27%, 
driven by the investment product revenue headwinds and 
higher interest rates paid on deposits. In addition, Wealth at 
Work revenues increased 5% and Citigold revenues increased 
4%.

LEGACY FRANCHISES

As of March 31, 2023, Legacy Franchises included (i) Asia Consumer Banking (Asia Consumer), representing the consumer banking 
operations of the remaining six Asia and EMEA exit countries, (ii) Mexico Consumer Banking (Mexico Consumer) and Mexico Small 
Business and Middle-Market Banking (Mexico SBMM), collectively Mexico Consumer/SBMM, and (iii) Legacy Holdings Assets 
(certain North America consumer mortgage loans and other legacy assets). Asia Consumer provides traditional retail banking and 
branded card products to retail and small business customers. Mexico Consumer/SBMM provides traditional retail banking and 
branded card products to consumers and small business customers and traditional middle-market banking products and services to 
commercial customers through Citibanamex. 

Legacy Franchises also included the following seven consumer banking businesses prior to their sale: Australia, until its closing 
on June 1, 2022; the Philippines, until its closing on August 1, 2022; Thailand and Malaysia, until their closings on November 1, 2022; 
Bahrain, until its closing on December 1, 2022; and India and Vietnam, until their closings on March 1, 2023. 

In addition, Citi has entered into agreements to sell its consumer banking businesses in Indonesia and Taiwan, and has continued 
to make progress on its wind-downs of consumer banking operations in Korea and China and consumer banking and local commercial 
banking operations in Russia (see below). See Note 2 for additional information on Legacy Franchises’ consumer banking business 
sales and wind-downs. 

In connection with Citi’s consumer and local commercial banking wind-down in Russia, Citi expects to incur approximately $210 
million in total estimated charges (excluding the impact from any portfolio sales), of which $150 million relates to Legacy Franchises, 
largely driven by restructuring, vendor termination fees and other related charges. Citi’s previously disclosed referral agreement with a 
Russian bank to settle a portfolio of ruble-denominated credit card loans, subject to customer consents, can be terminated under certain 
circumstances and is being reevaluated as Citi reviews other alternatives. The credit card loans will remain held-for-investment as Citi 
continues to explore pathways to accelerate the wind-down in a manner that is compliant with all applicable regulatory and legal 
requirements. For additional information about Citi’s continued efforts to reduce its operations and exposure in Russia, see 
“Institutional Clients Group” above and “Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—Russia” below, as well as “Risk 
Factors” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

At March 31, 2023, on a combined basis, Legacy Franchises had 1,406 retail branches, $20 billion in retail banking loans and $53 

billion in deposits. In addition, the businesses had $9 billion in outstanding card loan balances, and Mexico SBMM had $8 billion in 
outstanding corporate loan balances. These loan and deposit amounts exclude approximately $10 billion of loans ($9 billion of retail 
banking loans and $1 billion of credit card loan balances) and approximately $11 billion of deposits, all of which were reclassified to 
held-for-sale (HFS) (e.g., as Other assets and Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet) as a result of Citi’s entry into 
agreements to sell certain remaining consumer banking businesses. See Note 2 for additional information.

Net income was $604 million, compared to a net loss of $383 
million in the prior-year period, driven by higher revenues and 
lower expenses, partially offset by higher cost of credit. 

Results for the first quarter of 2023 included divestiture-

related impacts of $953 million in earnings before taxes ($648 
million after-tax), recorded in Legacy Franchises, reflecting 
the following: 

•

•

•
•

$1,018 million of net divestiture gains, primarily related 
to a gain on sale of the India consumer banking business, 
recorded in other revenue 
$73 million of aggregate divestiture-related costs, 
recorded in expenses
An $8 million benefit of divestiture-related credit costs
$305 million of related taxes

Results for the first quarter of 2022 included divestiture-
related impacts of $(677) million ($(588) million after-tax), 
recorded in Legacy Franchises, reflecting the following:

•

•

•

•

A $118 million pretax loss primarily related to the Asia 
markets, recorded in revenues; this pretax loss reflected 
an ACL release of $(104) million and a net revenue 
impact of $(14) million due to contractual adjustments
A $71 million cost of credit reclassification to revenues, 
as once a divestiture is classified as held-for-sale, credit 
costs, including ACL builds/releases and net credit losses, 
are reclassified to revenues
A $535 million goodwill impairment, recorded in 
expenses, due to the re-segmentation and sequencing of 
divestitures, as well as $24 million of costs related to the 
Korea voluntary early retirement program, also recorded

Revenues increased 48%, primarily driven by higher 
revenues in Asia Consumer and Mexico Consumer/SBMM. 
Asia Consumer revenues of $1.5 billion increased from 
$787 million in the prior-year period, primarily driven by the 
India gain on sale, partially offset by the absence of closed exit 
markets and wind-downs. 

Mexico Consumer/SBMM revenues increased 16%, as 
cards revenues increased 29%, SBMM revenues increased 
18% and retail banking revenues increased 11%, primarily due 
to the benefit of FX translation as well as higher interest rates 
and higher lending volumes. 

Legacy Holdings Assets revenues were largely 

unchanged.

Expenses decreased 24%, primarily driven by the absence 

of the goodwill impairment in the prior-year period and the 
benefit of the closed exit markets and wind-downs. 

Provisions were $345 million, compared to $160 million 

in the prior-year period, primarily driven by an increase of 
$174 million due to a reserve build related to macroeconomic 
deterioration and an increase in transfer risk associated with 
exposures outside the U.S. The higher cost of credit was also 
driven by higher net credit losses, primarily reflecting higher 
lending volumes in Mexico Consumer.

risks related to Legacy Franchises’ future results, see

Risks—Country Risk—Russia” and “Forward-Looking

CORPORATE/OTHER 

Activities not assigned to the operating segments (ICG, PBWM and Legacy Franchises) are included in Corporate/Other. Corporate/
Other included certain unallocated costs of global staff functions (including finance, risk, human resources, legal and compliance-
related costs), other corporate expenses and unallocated global operations and technology expenses and income taxes, as well as 
results of Corporate Treasury investment activities and discontinued operations. At March 31, 2023, Corporate/Other had $102 billion 
in assets, including Corporate Treasury investment securities and the Company’s deferred tax assets (DTAs). During the first quarter 
of 2023, Citi placed a $5 billion uninsured deposit with First Republic Bank, classified as Deposits with banks. On May 1, 2023, 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (JPMorgan), as part of its purchase of certain assets and liabilities of First Republic Bank, assumed all of 
the deposits of First Republic Bank. As a result, Citi now has a $5 billion uninsured deposit with JPMorgan.

1Q23 vs. 1Q22
Net income was $255 million, compared to $189 million in the 
prior-year period. The increase in net income was primarily 
driven by higher revenues, partially offset by lower discrete 
income tax benefits, higher cost of credit and higher expenses. 
Revenues were $914 million, compared to $190 million in 

the prior-year period, primarily driven by higher net revenue 
from the investment portfolio, largely due to higher interest 
rates. 

Expenses increased 19%, primarily driven by 
transformation and other risk and control investments, 
partially offset by lower consulting expenses. 

Provisions were $111 million, primarily driven by a 

reserve build related to the uninsured deposit with First 
Republic Bank.
