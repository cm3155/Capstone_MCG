less predefined program expenses. In most of Citi’s partner 
sharing agreements, program expenses include net credit 
losses, which, to the extent that the increase in net credit losses 
reduces Citi’s liability for the partners’ share for a given 
program year, would generally result in lower payments to 
partners in total for that year and vice versa. Further, in some 
instances, other partner payments are based on program sales 
and new account acquisitions. Interchange revenues are 
recognized as earned on a daily basis when Citi’s performance 
obligation to transmit funds to the payment networks has been 
satisfied. Annual card fees, net of origination costs, are 
deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over a 12-
month period. Costs related to card reward programs are 
recognized when the rewards are earned by the cardholders. 
Payments to partners are recognized when incurred.

Deposit-related fees consist of service charges on deposit 
accounts and fees earned from performing cash management 
activities and other deposit account services. Such fees are 
recognized in the period in which the related service is 
provided.

Transactional service fees primarily consist of fees 
charged for processing services such as cash management, 
global payments, clearing, international funds transfer and 
other trade services. Such fees are recognized as/when the 
associated service is satisfied, which normally occurs at the 
point in time the service is requested by the customer and 
provided by Citi.

Insurance distribution revenue consists of commissions 
earned from third-party insurance companies for marketing 
and selling insurance policies on behalf of such entities. Such 
commissions are recognized in Commissions and fees at the 
point in time the associated service is fulfilled, generally when 
the insurance policy is sold to the policyholder. Sales of 
certain insurance products include a portion of variable 
consideration associated with the underlying product. In these 
instances, a portion of the revenue associated with the sale of 
the policy is not recognized until the variable consideration 
becomes fixed and determinable. The Company recognized 
$201 million, $260 million and $290 million of revenue 
related to such variable consideration for the years ended 
December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These 
amounts primarily relate to performance obligations satisfied 
in prior periods.

Insurance premiums consist of premium income from 

insurance policies that Citi has underwritten and sold to 
policyholders.

5.  COMMISSIONS AND FEES; ADMINISTRATION 
AND OTHER FIDUCIARY FEES

Commissions and Fees
The primary components of Commissions and fees revenue are 
investment banking fees, brokerage commissions, credit card 
and bank card income and deposit-related fees. 

Investment banking fees are substantially composed of 
underwriting and advisory revenues. Such fees are recognized 
at the point in time when Citigroup’s performance under the 
terms of a contractual arrangement is completed, which is 
typically at the closing of a transaction. Reimbursed expenses 
related to these transactions are recorded as revenue and are 
included within investment banking fees. In certain instances 
for advisory contracts, Citi will receive amounts in advance of 
the deal’s closing. In these instances, the amounts received 
will be recognized as a liability and not recognized in revenue 
until the transaction closes. For the periods presented, the 
contract liability amount was negligible. 

Out-of-pocket expenses associated with underwriting 
activity are deferred and recognized at the time the related 
revenue is recognized, while out-of-pocket expenses 
associated with advisory arrangements are expensed as 
incurred. In general, expenses incurred related to investment 
banking transactions, whether consummated or not, are 
recorded in Other operating expenses. The Company has 
determined that it acts as principal in the majority of these 
transactions and therefore presents expenses gross within 
Other operating expenses.

Brokerage commissions primarily include commissions 

and fees from the following: executing transactions for clients 
on exchanges and over-the-counter markets; sales of mutual 
funds and other annuity products; and assisting clients in 
clearing transactions, providing brokerage services and other 
such activities. Brokerage commissions are recognized in 
Commissions and fees at the point in time the associated 
service is fulfilled, generally on the trade execution date. Sales 
of certain investment products include a portion of variable 
consideration associated with the underlying product. In these 
instances, a portion of the revenue associated with the sale of 
the product is not recognized until the variable consideration 
becomes fixed and determinable. The Company recognized 
$538 million, $639 million and $495 million of revenue 
related to such variable consideration for the years ended 
December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These 
amounts primarily relate to performance obligations satisfied 
in prior periods.

Credit card and bank card income is primarily composed 
of interchange fees, which are earned by card issuers based on 
purchase sales, and certain card fees, including annual fees. 
Costs related to customer reward programs and certain 
payments to partners (primarily based on program sales, 
profitability and customer acquisitions) are recorded as a 
reduction of credit card and bank card income. Citi’s credit 
card programs have certain partner sharing agreements that 
vary by partner. These partner sharing agreements are subject 
to contractually based performance thresholds that, if met, 
would require Citi to make ongoing payments to the partner. 
The threshold is based on the profitability of a program and is 
generally calculated based on predefined program revenues

(1) Citi’s consumer credit card programs have certain partner sharing agreements that vary by partner. These agreements are subject to contractually based 

performance thresholds that, if met, would require Citi to make ongoing payments to the partner. The threshold is based on the profitability of a program and is 
generally calculated based on predefined program revenues less predefined program expenses. In most of Citi’s partner sharing agreements, program expenses 
include net credit losses and, to the extent that an increase in net credit losses reduces Citi’s liability for the partners’ share for a given program year, would 
generally result in lower payments to partners in total for that year and vice versa. Further, in some instances, other partner payments are based on program sales 
and new account acquisitions.
Includes overdraft fees of $59 million (prior to the elimination of overdraft fees in June 2022), $107 million and $100 million for the years ended December 31, 
2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Overdraft fees are accounted for under ASC 310. Citi eliminated overdraft fees, returned item fees and overdraft protection 
fees beginning in June 2022.

Customers, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Amounts reported in Commissions and fees accounted for under other guidance 
primarily include card-related loan fees, card reward programs and certain partner payments, corporate finance fees, insurance premiums and loan servicing fees.

Administration and Other Fiduciary Fees
Administration and other fiduciary fees revenue is primarily 
composed of custody fees and fiduciary fees.

The custody product is composed of numerous services 
related to the administration, safekeeping and reporting for 
both U.S. and non-U.S. denominated securities. The services 
offered to clients include trade settlement, safekeeping, 
income collection, corporate action notification, record-
keeping and reporting, tax reporting and cash management. 
These services are provided for a wide range of securities, 
including but not limited to equities, municipal and corporate 
bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, money market 
instruments, U.S. Treasuries and agencies, derivative 
instruments, mutual funds, alternative investments and 
precious metals. Custody fees are recognized as or when the 
associated promised service is satisfied, which normally 
occurs at the point in time the service is requested by the 
customer and provided by Citi.

Fiduciary fees consist of trust services and investment 

management services. As an escrow agent, Citi receives, 
safekeeps, services and manages clients’ escrowed assets, such 
as cash, securities, property (including intellectual property), 
contracts or other collateral. Citi performs its escrow agent 
duties by safekeeping the assets during the specified time 
period agreed upon by all parties and therefore earns its 
revenue evenly during the contract duration. 

Investment management services consist of managing 

assets on behalf of Citi’s retail and institutional clients. 
Revenue from these services primarily consists of asset-based 
fees for advisory accounts, which are based on the market 
value of the client’s assets and recognized monthly, when the 
market value is fixed. In some instances, the Company 
contracts with third-party advisors and with third-party 
custodians. The Company has determined that it acts as 
principal in the majority of these transactions and therefore 
presents the amounts paid to third parties gross within Other 
operating expenses.

6.  PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS

Principal transactions revenue consists of realized and 
unrealized gains and losses from trading activities. Trading 
activities include revenues from fixed income, equities, credit 
and commodities products and foreign exchange transactions 
that are managed on a portfolio basis and characterized below 
based on the primary risk managed by each trading desk (as 
such, the trading desks can be periodically reorganized and 
thus the risk categories). Not included in the table below is the 
impact of net interest income related to trading activities, 

which is an integral part of trading activities’ profitability (see 
Note 4 for information about net interest income related to 
trading activities). Principal transactions include CVA (credit 
valuation adjustments) and FVA (funding valuation 
adjustments) on over-the-counter derivatives, and gains 
(losses) on certain economic hedges on loans in ICG. These 
adjustments are discussed further in Note 25. 

In certain transactions, Citi incurs fees and presents these 

fees paid to third parties in operating expenses.

(3) During 2022 and 2021, there were no weighted-average options outstanding. During 2020, weighted-average options to purchase 0.1 million shares of common 
stock were outstanding but not included in the computation of earnings per share because the weighted-average exercise price of $56.25 per share was anti-
dilutive.

(1)   The above tables do not include securities-for-securities lending 

transactions of $4.4 billion and $3.6 billion at December 31, 2022 and 
2021, respectively, where the Company acts as lender and receives 
securities that can be sold or pledged as collateral. In these transactions, 
the Company recognizes the securities received at fair value within 
Other assets and the obligation to return those securities as a liability 
within Brokerage payables. 
(2)  See Note 15 for further information.

The resale and repurchase agreements represent 
collateralized financing transactions. Citi executes these 
transactions primarily through its broker-dealer subsidiaries to 
facilitate customer matched-book activity and to efficiently 
fund a portion of Citi’s trading inventory. Transactions 
executed by Citi’s bank subsidiaries primarily facilitate 
customer financing activity.

To maintain reliable funding under a wide range of 

market conditions, including under periods of stress, Citi 
manages these activities by taking into consideration the 
quality of the underlying collateral and stipulating financing 
tenor. Citi manages the risks in its collateralized financing 
transactions by conducting daily stress tests to account for 
changes in capacity, tenors, haircut, collateral profile and 
client actions. In addition, Citi maintains counterparty 
diversification by establishing concentration triggers and 
assessing counterparty reliability and stability under stress.
It is the Company’s policy to take possession of the 
underlying collateral, monitor its market value relative to the 
amounts due under the agreements and, when necessary, 

190

require prompt transfer of additional collateral in order to 
maintain contractual margin protection. For resale and 
repurchase agreements, when necessary, the Company posts 
additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin 
protection. 

Collateral typically consists of government and 

government-agency securities, corporate and municipal bonds, 
equities and mortgage- and other asset-backed securities.
The resale and repurchase agreements are generally 
documented under industry standard agreements that allow the 
prompt close-out of all transactions (including the liquidation 
of securities held) and the offsetting of obligations to return 
cash or securities by the non-defaulting party, following a 
payment default or other type of default under the relevant 
master agreement. Events of default generally include 
(i) failure to deliver cash or securities as required under the 
transaction, (ii) failure to provide or return cash or securities 
as used for margining purposes, (iii) breach of representation, 
(iv) cross-default to another transaction entered into among the 
parties, or, in some cases, their affiliates and (v) a repudiation 
of obligations under the agreement. The counterparty that 
receives the securities in these transactions is generally 
unrestricted in its use of the securities, with the exception of 
transactions executed on a tri-party basis, where the collateral 
is maintained by a custodian and operational limitations may 
restrict its use of the securities.

A substantial portion of the resale and repurchase 
agreements is recorded at fair value as the Company elected 
the fair value option, as described in Notes 25 and 26. The 
remaining portion is carried at the amount of cash initially 
advanced or received, plus accrued interest, as specified in the 
respective agreements.

The securities borrowing and lending agreements also 
represent collateralized financing transactions similar to the 
resale and repurchase agreements. Collateral typically consists 
of government and government-agency securities and 
corporate debt and equity securities.

Similar to the resale and repurchase agreements, securities 

borrowing and lending agreements are generally documented 
under industry standard agreements that allow the prompt 
close-out of all transactions (including the liquidation of 
securities held) and the offsetting of obligations to return cash 
or securities by the non-defaulting party, following a payment 
default or other default by the other party under the relevant 
master agreement. Events of default and rights to use 
securities under the securities borrowing and lending 
agreements are similar to the resale and repurchase agreements 
referenced above.

A substantial portion of securities borrowing and lending 

agreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or 
received. The remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the 
Company elected the fair value option for certain securities 
borrowed and loaned portfolios, as described in Note 26. With 
respect to securities loaned, the Company receives cash 
collateral in an amount generally in excess of the market value 
of the securities loaned. The Company monitors the market 
value of securities borrowed and securities loaned on a daily 
basis and posts or obtains additional collateral in order to 
maintain contractual margin protection.

 
 
 
The enforceability of offsetting rights incorporated in the 

master netting agreements for resale and repurchase 
agreements, and securities borrowing and lending agreements, 
is evidenced to the extent that (i) a supportive legal opinion 
has been obtained from counsel of recognized standing that 
provides the requisite level of certainty regarding the 
enforceability of these agreements and (ii) the exercise of 
rights by the non-defaulting party to terminate and close out 
transactions on a net basis under these agreements will not be 
stayed or avoided under applicable law upon an event of 
default including bankruptcy, insolvency or similar 
proceeding.

A legal opinion may not have been sought or obtained for 

certain jurisdictions where local law is silent or sufficiently 
ambiguous to determine the enforceability of offsetting rights 
or where adverse case law or conflicting regulation may cast 
doubt on the enforceability of such rights. In some 
jurisdictions and for some counterparty types, the insolvency 

law for a particular counterparty type may be nonexistent or 
unclear as overlapping regimes may exist. For example, this 
may be the case for certain sovereigns, municipalities, central 
banks and U.S. pension plans.

The following tables present the gross and net resale and 
repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending 
agreements and the related offsetting amounts permitted under 
ASC 210-20-45. The tables also include amounts related to 
financial instruments that are not permitted to be offset under 
ASC 210-20-45, but would be eligible for offsetting to the 
extent that an event of default has occurred and a legal opinion 
supporting enforceability of the offsetting rights has been 
obtained. Remaining exposures continue to be secured by 
financial collateral, but the Company may not have sought or 
been able to obtain a legal opinion evidencing enforceability 
of the offsetting right.

12.  BROKERAGE RECEIVABLES AND BROKERAGE 
PAYABLES

The Company has receivables and payables for financial 
instruments sold to and purchased from brokers, dealers and 
customers, which arise in the ordinary course of business. Citi 
is exposed to risk of loss from the inability of brokers, dealers 
or customers to pay for purchases or to deliver the financial 
instruments sold, in which case Citi would have to sell or 
purchase the financial instruments at prevailing market prices. 
Credit risk is reduced to the extent that an exchange or 
clearing organization acts as a counterparty to the transaction 
and replaces the broker, dealer or customer in question.

Citi seeks to protect itself from the risks associated with 

customer activities by requiring customers to maintain margin 
collateral in compliance with regulatory and internal 
guidelines. Margin levels are monitored daily, and customers 
deposit additional collateral as required. Where customers 
cannot meet collateral requirements, Citi may liquidate 
sufficient underlying financial instruments to bring the 
customer into compliance with the required margin level.

Exposure to credit risk is impacted by market volatility, 

which may impair the ability of clients to satisfy their 
obligations to Citi. Credit limits are established and closely 
monitored for customers and for brokers and dealers engaged 
in forwards, futures and other transactions deemed to be credit 
sensitive.

(6) Not included in the balances above is approximately $2 billion of accrued interest receivable at December 31, 2022, which is included in Other assets on the 

Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable for AFS and HTM debt securities, 
consistent with its non-accrual policy, which results in timely write-off of accrued interest. The Company did not reverse through interest income any accrued 
interest receivables for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

(1) The Company invests in mortgage- and asset-backed securities, which are typically issued by VIEs through securitization transactions. The Company’s maximum 
exposure to loss from these VIEs is equal to the carrying amount of the securities, which is reflected in the table above. See Note 22 for mortgage- and asset-
backed securitizations in which the Company has other involvement.
In 2022, Citibank transferred $21.5 billion of agency residential mortgage-backed securities and $165 million of municipal bonds from AFS classification to HTM 
classification in accordance with ASC 320. At the time of transfer, the securities and bonds were in an unrealized loss position of $2.3 billion and $12 million, 
respectively. The loss amounts will remain in AOCI and will be amortized over the remaining life of the securities and bonds.

(2)

At December 31, 2022, the amortized cost of AFS fixed 
income securities for those in a loss position exceeded their 
fair value by $6,604 million. Of the $6,604 million, 
$3,997 million represented unrealized losses on fixed income 
investments that have been in a gross unrealized loss position 
for less than a year and, of these, 73% were rated investment 
grade; and $2,607 million represented unrealized losses on 
fixed income investments that have been in a gross unrealized 
loss position for a year or more and, of these, 99% were rated 
investment grade. Of the $2,607 million, $1,491 million 
represents U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities.

(2) The Company invests in mortgage- and asset-backed securities. These securitizations are generally considered VIEs. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss 

(3)

from these VIEs is equal to the carrying amount of the securities, which is reflected in the table above. See Note 22 for mortgage- and asset-backed securitizations 
in which the Company has other involvement.
In 2022, Citibank transferred $21.5 billion of agency residential mortgage-backed securities and $165 million of municipal bonds from AFS classification to HTM 
classification in accordance with ASC 320. At the time of transfer, the securities and bonds were in an unrealized loss position of $2.3 billion and $12 million, 
respectively. The loss amounts will remain in AOCI and will be amortized over the remaining life of the securities and bonds.

The Company has the positive intent and ability to hold 

these securities to maturity or, where applicable, until the 
exercise of any issuer call option, absent any unforeseen 
significant changes in circumstances, including deterioration 
in credit or changes in regulatory capital requirements.

The net unrealized losses classified in AOCI for HTM 
debt securities primarily relate to debt securities previously 
classified as AFS that were transferred to HTM, and include 
any cumulative fair value hedge adjustments. The net 
unrealized loss amount also includes any non-credit-related 
changes in fair value of HTM debt securities that have 
suffered credit impairment recorded in earnings. The AOCI 
balance related to HTM debt securities is amortized as an 
adjustment of yield, in a manner consistent with the accretion 
of any difference between the carrying value at the transfer 
date and par value of the same debt securities.

Evaluating Investments for Impairment

AFS Debt Securities

Overview—AFS Debt Securities
The Company conducts periodic reviews of all AFS debt 
securities with unrealized losses to evaluate whether the 
impairment resulted from expected credit losses or from other 
factors and to evaluate the Company’s intent to sell such 
securities.

An AFS debt security is impaired when the current fair 

value of an individual AFS debt security is less than its 
amortized cost basis.

The Company recognizes the entire difference between 
amortized cost basis and fair value in earnings for impaired 
AFS debt securities that Citi has an intent to sell or for which 
Citi believes it will more-likely-than-not be required to sell 
prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis. However, for 
those AFS debt securities that the Company does not intend to 
sell and is not likely to be required to sell, only the credit-
related impairment is recognized in earnings by recording an 
allowance for credit losses. Any remaining fair value decline 
for such securities is recorded in AOCI. The Company does 
not consider the length of time that the fair value of a security 
is below its amortized cost when determining if a credit loss 
exists.

For AFS debt securities, credit losses exist where Citi 
does not expect to receive contractual principal and interest 
cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis 
of a security. The allowance for credit losses is limited to the 
amount by which the AFS debt security’s amortized cost basis 
exceeds its fair value. The allowance is increased or decreased 
if credit conditions subsequently worsen or improve. Reversals 
of credit losses are recognized in earnings.

The Company’s review for impairment of AFS debt 

securities generally entails:

•
•

•

identification and evaluation of impaired investments;
consideration of evidential matter, including an evaluation 
of factors or triggers that could cause individual positions 
to qualify as credit impaired and those that would not 
support credit impairment; and
documentation of the results of these analyses, as required 
under business policies.

The sections below describe the Company’s process for 
identifying expected credit impairments for debt security types 
that have the most significant unrealized losses as of 
December 31, 2022.

Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities
Citi records no allowances for credit losses on U.S. 
government-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities, 
because the Company expects to incur no credit losses in the 
event of default due to a history of incurring no credit losses 
and due to the nature of the counterparties.

State and Municipal Securities
The process for estimating credit losses in Citigroup’s AFS 
state and municipal bonds is primarily based on a credit 
analysis that incorporates third-party credit ratings. Citi 
monitors the bond issuers and any insurers providing default 
protection in the form of financial guarantee insurance. The 
average external credit rating, disregarding any insurance, is 
Aa2/AA. In the event of an external rating downgrade or other 
indicator of credit impairment (i.e., based on instrument-
specific estimates of cash flows or probability of issuer 
default), the subject bond is specifically reviewed for adverse 
changes in the amount or timing of expected contractual 
principal and interest payments.

For AFS state and municipal bonds with unrealized losses 

that Citi plans to sell or would more-likely-than-not be 
required to sell prior to recovery of value, the full impairment 
is recognized in earnings. For AFS state and municipal bonds 
where Citi has no intent to sell and it is not more-likely-than-
not that the Company will be required to sell, Citi records an 
allowance for expected credit losses for the amount it expects 
not to collect, capped at the difference between the bond’s 
amortized cost basis and fair value.

Equity Method Investments
Management assesses equity method investments that have 
fair values that are less than their respective carrying values 
for other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). Fair value is 
measured as price multiplied by quantity if the investee has 
publicly listed securities. If the investee is not publicly listed, 
other methods are used (see Note 25).

For impaired equity method investments that Citi plans to 

sell prior to recovery of value or would more-likely-than-not 
be required to sell, with no expectation that the fair value will 
recover prior to the expected sale date, the full impairment is 
recognized as OTTI in Other revenue regardless of severity 
and duration. The measurement of the OTTI does not include 
partial projected recoveries subsequent to the balance sheet 
date.

For impaired equity method investments that management 

does not plan to sell and is not more-likely-than-not to be 
required to sell prior to recovery of value, the evaluation of 
whether an impairment is other-than-temporary is based on 
(i) whether and when an equity method investment will 
recover in value and (ii) whether the investor has the intent 
and ability to hold that investment for a period of time 
sufficient to recover the value. The determination of whether 
the impairment is considered other-than-temporary considers 
the following indicators:

•

•

•

the cause of the impairment and the financial condition 
and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any 
specific events that may influence the operations of the 
issuer;
the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of 
time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in 
market value; and
the length of time and extent to which fair value has been 
less than the carrying value.

Non-Marketable Equity Securities Not Carried at 
Fair Value
Non-marketable equity securities are required to be measured 
at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
unless (i) the measurement alternative is elected or (ii) the 
investment represents Federal Reserve Bank and Federal 
Home Loan Bank stock or certain exchange seats that continue 
to be carried at cost. 

The election to measure a non-marketable equity security 

using the measurement alternative is made on an instrument-
by-instrument basis. Under the measurement alternative, an 
equity security is carried at cost plus or minus changes 
resulting from observable prices in orderly transactions for the 
identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The 
carrying value of the equity security is adjusted to fair value 
on the date of an observed transaction. Fair value may differ 
from the observed transaction price due to a number of factors, 
including marketability adjustments and differences in rights 
and obligations when the observed transaction is not for the 
identical investment held by Citi.

Equity securities under the measurement alternative are 

also assessed for impairment. On a quarterly basis, 
management qualitatively assesses whether each equity 
security under the measurement alternative is impaired. 
Impairment indicators that are considered include, but are not 
limited to, the following:

•

•

•

•

•

a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, 
credit rating, asset quality or business prospects of the 
investee;
a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic 
or technological environment of the investee;
a significant adverse change in the general market 
condition of either the geographical area or the industry in 
which the investee operates;
a bona fide offer to purchase, an offer by the investee to 
sell or a completed auction process for the same or similar 
investment for an amount less than the carrying amount of 
that investment; and
factors that raise significant concerns about the investee’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, such as negative 
cash flows from operations, working capital deficiencies 
or noncompliance with statutory capital requirements or 
debt covenants.

When the qualitative assessment indicates that 
impairment exists, the investment is written down to fair 
value, with the full difference between the fair value of the 
investment and its carrying amount recognized in earnings.
Below is the carrying value of non-marketable equity 
securities measured using the measurement alternative at 
December 31, 2022 and 2021:

A similar impairment analysis is performed for non-

The Company sold and/or reclassified to held-for-sale 
$5.0 billion and $5.9 billion of corporate loans during the 
years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The 
Company did not have significant purchases of corporate loans 
classified as held-for-investment for the years ended 
December 31, 2022 or 2021.

Lease financing 
Citi is a lessor in the power, railcars, shipping and aircraft 
sectors, where the Company has executed operating, direct 
financing and leveraged leases. Citi’s $0.4 billion of lease 
financing receivables, as of December 31, 2022, is composed 
of approximately equal balances of direct financing lease 
receivables and net investments in leveraged leases. Citi uses 
the interest rate implicit in the lease to determine the present 
value of its lease financing receivables. Interest income on 
direct financing and leveraged leases during the year ended 
December 31, 2022 was not material.

The Company’s operating leases, where Citi is a lessor, 
are not significant to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Delinquency Status
Citi generally does not manage corporate loans on a 
delinquency basis. Corporate loans are placed on a cash (non-
accrual) basis when it is determined, based on actual 
experience and a forward-looking assessment of the 
collectability of the loan in full, that the payment of interest or 
principal is doubtful or when interest or principal is 90 
days past due, except when the loan is well collateralized and 
in the process of collection. Any interest accrued on impaired 
corporate loans and leases is reversed at 90 days and charged 
against current earnings, and interest is thereafter included in 
earnings only to the extent actually received in cash. When 
there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of principal, 
all cash receipts are thereafter applied to reduce the recorded 
investment in the loan. While corporate loans are generally 
managed based on their internally assigned risk rating (see 
further discussion below), the following tables present 
delinquency information by corporate loan type. 

14.  LOANS

Citigroup loans are reported in two categories: corporate and 
consumer. These categories are classified primarily according 
to the operating segment and component that manage the loans 
in addition to the nature of the obligor, with corporate loans 
generally made for corporate institutional and public sector 
clients around the world and consumer loans to retail and 
small business customers.

Corporate Loans
Corporate loans represent loans and leases managed by ICG 
and the Mexico SBMM component of Legacy Franchises. The 
following table presents information by corporate loan type:

offices in North America and outside North America is based on the 
domicile of the booking unit. The difference between the domicile of the 
booking unit and the domicile of the managing unit is not material.

(2) Loans secured primarily by real estate.
(3) Corporate loans are net of unearned income of $($797) million and 

($770) million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Unearned 
income on corporate loans primarily represents interest received in 
advance, but not yet earned, on loans originated on a discounted basis.

(4) Not included in the balances above is approximately $2 billion of 

accrued interest receivable at December 31, 2022, which is included in 
Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

(5) Accrued interest receivable considered to be uncollectible is reversed 
through interest income. Amounts reversed were not material for the 
years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

(1) Corporate loans that are 90 days past due are generally classified as non-accrual. Corporate loans are considered past due when principal or interest is 

contractually due but unpaid.

(2) Non-accrual loans generally include those loans that are 90 days or more past due or those loans for which Citi believes, based on actual experience and a forward-

looking assessment of the collectability of the loan in full, that the payment of interest and/or principal is doubtful.

(3) Loans less than 30 days past due are presented as current.
(4) The Total loans column includes loans at fair value, which are not included in the various delinquency columns, and therefore the tables’ total rows will not cross-

foot. 

Citigroup has a risk management process to monitor, 
evaluate and manage the principal risks associated with its 
corporate loan portfolio. As part of its risk management 
process, Citi assigns numeric risk ratings to its corporate loan 
facilities based on quantitative and qualitative assessments of 
the obligor and facility. These risk ratings are reviewed at least 
annually or more often if material events related to the obligor 
or facility warrant. Factors considered in assigning the risk 
ratings include financial condition of the obligor, qualitative 
assessment of management and strategy, amount and sources 
of repayment, amount and type of collateral and guarantee 
arrangements, amount and type of any contingencies 
associated with the obligor and the obligor’s industry and 
geography.

The obligor risk ratings are defined by ranges of default 

probabilities. The facility risk ratings are defined by ranges of 
loss norms, which are the product of the probability of default 
and the loss given default. The investment-grade rating 
categories are similar to the category BBB-/Baa3 and above as 
defined by S&P and Moody’s. Loans classified according to 
the bank regulatory definitions as special mention, 
substandard, doubtful and loss will have risk ratings within the 
non-investment-grade categories.

(1) Recorded investment in a loan includes net deferred loan fees and costs, unamortized premium or discount, less any direct write-downs.
(2) There were no significant revolving line of credit arrangements that converted to term loans during the year.
(3) Held-for-investment loans are accounted for on an amortized cost basis.
(4)
Includes certain short-term loans with less than one year in tenor.
(5) Other includes installment and other, lease financing and loans to government and official institutions. 
(6) Loans at fair value include loans to commercial and industrial, financial institutions, mortgage and real estate and other.

Collateral-dependent loans and leases, where repayment is 

expected to be provided solely by the sale of the underlying 
collateral with no other available and reliable sources of 
repayment, are written down to the lower of carrying value or 
collateral value, less cost to sell. Cash-basis loans are returned 
to an accrual status when all contractual principal and interest 
amounts are reasonably assured of repayment and there is a 
sustained period of repayment performance, generally six 
months, in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan.

(1) The 2021 table does not include loan modifications that meet the TDR relief criteria in the CARES Act or the interagency guidance.
(2) TDRs involving changes in the amount or timing of principal payments may involve principal forgiveness or deferral of periodic and/or final principal payments. 
Because forgiveness of principal is rare for corporate loans, modifications typically have little to no impact on the loans’ projected cash flows and thus little to no 
impact on the allowance established for the loans. Charge-offs for amounts deemed uncollectible may be recorded at the time of the restructuring or may have 
already been recorded in prior periods such that no charge-off is required at the time of the modification.
(3) TDRs involving changes in the amount or timing of interest payments may involve a below-market interest rate.

The following table presents total corporate loans modified in a TDR as well as those TDRs that defaulted and for which the payment 
default occurred within one year of a permanent modification. Default is defined as 60 days past due, except for classifiably managed 
commercial banking loans, where default is defined as 90 days past due.

The tables below present details about these loans, 

including the following loan categories:

•

•

•

•

•

•

Residential first mortgages and Home equity loans in 
North America offices primarily represent secured 
mortgage lending to customers of Retail banking and 
Global Wealth (primarily Private bank and Citigold).
Credit cards in North America offices primarily represent 
unsecured credit card lending to customers of Branded 
cards and Retail services.
Personal, small business and other loans in North America 
are primarily composed of classifiably managed loans to 
customers of Global Wealth (mostly within the Private 
bank) who are typically high credit quality borrowers that 
historically experienced minimal delinquencies and credit 
losses. Loans to these borrowers are generally well 
collateralized in the form of liquid securities and other 
forms of collateral.
Residential mortgage loans in offices outside North 
America primarily represent secured mortgage lending to 
customers of Global Wealth (primarily Private bank and 
Citigold) as well as customers of Legacy Franchises.
Credit cards in offices outside North America primarily 
represent unsecured credit card lending to customers of 
Legacy Franchises, primarily in Asia and Mexico.
Personal, small business and other loans in offices outside 
North America are primarily composed of secured and 
unsecured loans to customers of PBWM and Legacy 
Franchises. A significant portion of PBWM loans is 
classifiably managed and represents loans to high credit 
quality Private bank customers who historically 
experienced minimal delinquencies and credit losses. 
Loans to these borrowers are generally well collateralized 
in the form of liquid securities and other forms of 
collateral. 

Consumer Loans
Consumer loans represent loans and leases managed primarily 
by PBWM and Legacy Franchises (except Mexico SBMM). 
Citigroup has established a risk management process to 
monitor, evaluate and manage the principal risks associated 
with its consumer loan portfolio. Credit quality indicators that 
are actively monitored include delinquency status, consumer 
credit scores under Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) and loan to 
value (LTV) ratios, each as discussed in more detail below.

Delinquency Status
Delinquency status is monitored and considered a key 
indicator of credit quality of consumer loans. Principally, the 
U.S. residential first mortgage loans use the Mortgage Bankers 
Association (MBA) method of reporting delinquencies, which 
considers a loan delinquent if a monthly payment has not been 
received by the end of the day immediately preceding the 
loan’s next due date. All other loans use a method of reporting 
delinquencies that considers a loan delinquent if a monthly 
payment has not been received by the close of business on the 
loan’s next due date.

As a general policy, residential first mortgages, home 
equity loans and installment loans are classified as non-accrual 
when loan payments are 90 days contractually past due. Credit 
cards and unsecured revolving loans generally accrue interest 
until payments are 180 days past due. Home equity loans in 
regulated bank entities are classified as non-accrual if the 
related residential first mortgage is 90 days or more past due. 
Mortgage loans, other than Federal Housing Administration 
(FHA)-insured loans, are classified as non-accrual within 60 
days of notification that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy. 
The policy for re-aging modified U.S. consumer loans to 

current status varies by product. Generally, one of the 
conditions to qualify for these modifications is that a 
minimum number of payments (typically ranging from one to 
three) be made. Upon modification, the loan is re-aged to 
current status. However, re-aging practices for certain open-
ended consumer loans, such as credit cards, are governed by 
Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) 
guidelines. For open-ended consumer loans subject to FFIEC 
guidelines, one of the conditions for a loan to be re-aged to 
current status is that at least three consecutive minimum 
monthly payments, or the equivalent amount, must be 
received. In addition, under FFIEC guidelines, the number of 
times that such a loan can be re-aged is subject to limitations 
(generally once in 12 months and twice in five years). 

Furthermore, FHA and Department of Veterans Affairs 

(VA) loans are modified under those respective agencies’ 
guidelines and payments are not always required in order to 
re-age a modified loan to current.

and $19.8 billion of residential mortgages outside North America related to the Global Wealth business at December 31, 2021.
Includes approximately $0.1 billion and $0.1 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, of home equity loans in process of foreclosure in North 
America.

(9)

(10) Fixed-rate home equity loans and loans extended under home equity lines of credit, which are typically in junior lien positions.
(11) Includes loans related to the Global Wealth business: $34.0 billion in North America, approximately $31.5 billion of which are classifiably managed, and as of 
December 31, 2022 approximately 98% were rated investment grade; and $26.6 billion outside North America, approximately $17.8 billion of which are 
classifiably managed, and as of December 31, 2022 approximately 94% were rated investment grade. The classifiably managed portion of these loans is shown as 
“current” because the delinquency status is not applicable, since these loans are primarily evaluated for credit risk based on their internal risk classification. 
(12) Not included in the balances above is approximately $1 billion of accrued interest receivable at December 31, 2022, which is included in Other assets on the 

Consolidated Balance Sheet, except for credit card loans (which include accrued interest and fees). When a loan becomes non-accrual or, if not subject to a non-
accrual policy, is charged-off per the Company’s charge-off policy, any accrued interest receivable is also reversed against the interest income. During the years 
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company reversed accrued interest of approximately $0.6 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively, primarily related to credit 
card loans.

(13) Consumer loans were net of unearned income of $712 million and $629 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Unearned income on consumer 

loans primarily represents unamortized origination fees and costs, premiums and discounts.

(14) Includes loans related to the Global Wealth business: $37.9 billion in North America, approximately $35.3 billion of which are classifiably managed, and as of 
December 31, 2021 approximately 95% were rated investment grade; and $34.6 billion outside North America, approximately $24.5 billion of which are 
classifiably managed, and as of December 31, 2021 approximately 94% were rated investment grade. The classifiably managed portion of these loans is shown as 
“current” because the delinquency status is not applicable, since these loans are primarily evaluated for credit risk based on their internal risk classification.

Consumer Credit Scores (FICO)
In the U.S., independent credit agencies rate an individual’s 
risk for assuming debt based on the individual’s credit history 
and assign every consumer a Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) 
credit score. These scores are continually updated by the 
agencies based upon an individual’s credit actions (e.g., taking 
out a loan or missed or late payments).

The following tables provide details on the FICO scores 
for Citi’s U.S. consumer loan portfolio based on end-of-period 
receivables by year of origination. FICO scores are updated 
monthly for substantially all of the portfolio or, otherwise, on 
a quarterly basis for the remaining portfolio.

For Citi’s $80.5 billion and $114.3 billion in the consumer 
loan portfolio outside of the U.S. as of December 31, 2022 and 
2021, respectively, various country-specific or regional credit 
risk metrics and acquisition and behavior scoring models are 
leveraged as one of the factors to evaluate the credit quality of 
customers (for additional information on loans outside of the 
U.S., see “Consumer Loans and Ratios Outside of North 
America” below). As a result, details of relevant credit quality 
indicators for those loans are not comparable to the below 
FICO score distribution for the U.S. portfolio.

(1) The FICO bands in the tables are consistent with general industry peer presentations.
(2) FICO scores are updated on either a monthly or quarterly basis. For updates that are made only quarterly, certain current-period loans by year of origination are 
greater than those disclosed in the prior periods. Loans that did not have FICO scores as of the prior period have been updated with FICO scores as they become 
available.

(3) These personal, small business and other loans without a FICO score available include $31.5 billion and $35.3 billion of Private bank loans as of December 31, 

2022 and 2021, respectively, which are classifiably managed within Global Wealth and are primarily evaluated for credit risk based on their internal risk ratings. 
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 98% and 95% of these loans, respectively, were rated investment grade.

(4) FICO scores not available related to loans guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises for which FICO scores are generally not utilized.
(5) Not included in the tables above are $75 million and $313 million of revolving credit card loans outside of the U.S. that were converted to term loans as of 

December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

(6) Excludes $545 million and $517 million of balances related to Canada for December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
(7) Excludes $940 million and $907 million of balances related to Canada for December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Loan to Value (LTV) Ratios—U.S. Consumer Mortgages
LTV ratios (loan balance divided by appraised value) are 
calculated at origination and updated by applying market price 
data.

The following tables provide details on the LTV ratios for 

Citi’s U.S. consumer mortgage portfolios by year of 
origination. LTV ratios are updated monthly using the most 

recent Core Logic Home Price Index data available for 
substantially all of the portfolio applied at the Metropolitan 
Statistical Area level, if available, or the state level if not. The 
remainder of the portfolio is updated in a similar manner using 
the Federal Housing Finance Agency indices.

Impaired Consumer Loans
A loan is considered impaired when Citi believes it is probable 
that all amounts due according to the original contractual 
terms of the loan will not be collected. Impaired consumer 
loans include non-accrual loans, as well as smaller-balance 
homogeneous loans whose terms have been modified due to 
the borrower’s financial difficulties and where Citi has granted 
a concession to the borrower. These modifications may 

include interest rate reductions and/or principal forgiveness. 
Impaired consumer loans exclude smaller-balance 
homogeneous loans that have not been modified and are 
carried on a non-accrual basis.

The following tables present information about impaired 
consumer loans and interest income recognized on impaired 
consumer loans:

(3) Post-modification balances in North America include $5 million of residential first mortgages to borrowers who have gone through Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the 
year ended December 31, 2022. These amounts include $3.8 million of residential first mortgages that were newly classified as TDRs during 2022, based on 
previously received OCC guidance. The remaining amounts were already classified as TDRs before being discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy.

(4) Represents the portion of contractual loan principal that is non-interest bearing, but still due from the borrower. Such deferred principal is charged off at the time 

of permanent modification to the extent that the related loan balance exceeds the underlying collateral value.

(5) Represents the portion of contractual loan principal that is non-interest bearing and, depending upon borrower performance, eligible for forgiveness.
(6) Represents the portion of contractual loan principal that was forgiven at the time of permanent modification.
(7) North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Mexico is included in offices outside North America.
(8)  The above tables reflect activity for restructured loans that were considered TDRs during the year.

year ended December 31, 2021. These amounts include $5 million of residential first mortgages that were newly classified as TDRs during 2021, based on 
previously received OCC guidance. The remaining amounts were already classified as TDRs before being discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy.

2022 Changes in the ACL
The total allowance for credit losses on loans, leases and 
unfunded lending commitments as of December 31, 2022 was 
$19,125 million, an increase from $18,326 million at 
December 31, 2021. The increase in the allowance for credit 
losses on loans, leases and unfunded lending commitments 
was primarily driven by U.S. Cards loan growth and a 
deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions. 

Consumer ACLL
Citi’s total consumer allowance for credit losses on loans 
(ACLL) as of December 31, 2022 was $14,119 million, an 
increase from $14,040 million at December 31, 2021. The 
increase in the ACLL balance was primarily driven by U.S. 
Cards loan growth and a deterioration in macroeconomic 
assumptions, partially offset by the reduction in reserves 
related to COVID-19 uncertainty. 

Corporate ACLL
Citi’s total corporate ACLL as of December 31, 2022 was 
$2,855 million, an increase from $2,415 million at 
December 31, 2021. The increase in the ACLL balance was 
primarily driven by a deterioration in macroeconomic 
assumptions, partially offset by the release of a COVID-19–
related uncertainty reserve. 

ACLUC
As of December 31, 2022, Citi’s total allowance for credit 
losses on unfunded lending commitments (ACLUC), included 
in Other liabilities, was $2,151 million, an increase from 
$1,871 million at December 31, 2021. The increase in the 
ACLUC balance was primarily driven by a deterioration in 
macroeconomic assumptions.

(1)  Represents goodwill allocated to the Asia Consumer banking exit markets upon the signing of the respective sales agreements: in 2021, related to the Australia 

and Philippines consumer banking businesses, which were reclassified as HFS during 2021; in 2022, related to the India, Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, 
Bahrain and Vietnam consumer banking businesses, which were reclassified as HFS during 2022. See Note 2.

(2)  Goodwill impairment of $535 million (approximately $489 million after-tax) was incurred in the Asia Consumer reporting unit of Legacy Franchises in the first 

quarter of 2022, due to the re-segmentation and change of reporting units as well as the sequence of the signing of sale agreements.

As discussed in Note 3, effective January 1, 2022, as part 

of its strategic refresh, Citi made changes to its management 
structure, which resulted in changes in its operating segments 
and reporting units to reflect how the CEO, who is the chief 
operating decision maker, manages the Company, including 
allocating resources and measuring performance. Goodwill 
balances were reallocated across the new reporting units based 
on their relative fair values using the valuation performed as of 
the effective date of the reorganization. Further, the goodwill 
balances associated with certain Asia Consumer businesses 
within the Legacy Franchises operating segment were 
reclassified to HFS as of March 31, 2022 upon the signing of 
the respective sale agreements. See Note 2 for a discussion of 
Citi’s divestiture activities.

The reorganization of Citi’s reporting structure and the 
announced sales of businesses within a reporting unit were 
identified as triggering events for purposes of goodwill 
impairment testing. Consistent with the requirements of ASC 
350, interim goodwill impairment tests were performed that 
resulted in an impairment of $535 million to the Asia 
Consumer reporting unit within the Legacy Franchises 
operating segment, due to the implementation of Citi’s revised 
operating segments and reporting units, as well as the timing 
of mutual execution of sale agreements for Asia consumer 
banking businesses. This impairment was recorded in the first 
quarter of 2022 as an operating expense. There were no 
additional impairment charges incurred as a result of any of 
the other interim goodwill impairment tests performed during 
2022.

For the interim impairment tests performed in the first 
quarter of 2022, the valuation of reporting units used either the 
market approach, income approach, or a combination of both. 
Under the market approach, Citi estimated fair value by 
comparing the business to similar businesses or guideline 

companies whose securities are actively traded in public 
markets. Under the income approach, Citi used a discounted 
cash flow (DCF) model in which cash flows anticipated over 
several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time 
horizon, are discounted to their present value using an 
appropriate rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent 
within the reporting unit. 

The key assumptions used to determine the fair value of 

Citi’s reporting units consisted primarily of significant 
unobservable inputs (Level 3 fair value inputs), including 
discount rates, estimated cash flows, growth rates, earnings 
multiples and/or transaction multiples of similar businesses or 
guideline public companies, and bids from buyers. The DCF 
method employs a capital asset pricing model in estimating the 
discount rate based on several factors, including market 
interest rates, and includes adjustments for market risk and 
company-specific risk. Estimated cash flows are based on 
internally developed estimates and the growth rates are based 
on industry knowledge and historical performance.

Citi had historically performed its annual goodwill 
impairment test as of July 1 each year. During the quarter 
ended September 30, 2022, the Company voluntarily changed 
its annual impairment assessment date from July 1 to October 
1. Based on interim impairment tests performed within the 
period between the previous annual test on July 1, 2021 and 
the annual test to be performed on October 1, 2022, no more 
than 12 months have elapsed between goodwill impairment 
tests of any of Citi’s reporting units. The change in 
measurement date represents a change in method of applying 
an accounting principle. This change is preferable because it 
better aligns the Company’s goodwill impairment testing 
procedures with its annual planning process and with its fiscal 
year-end. Citi continues to monitor each reporting unit for 
triggering events for purposes of goodwill impairment testing. 

227

 
 
 
 
 
 
The change in accounting principle did not result in any delay, 
acceleration or avoidance of an impairment charge.

Citi performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of 
October 1, 2022, which resulted in no impairment of any of 
Citi’s reporting units. While the inherent risk of uncertainty is 
embedded in the key assumptions used in the valuations, the 
economic and business environments continue to evolve as 
management implements its strategic refresh. If management’s 
future estimate of key economic and market assumptions were 
to differ from its current assumptions, Citi could potentially 
experience material goodwill impairment charges in the future.
For additional information regarding Citi’s goodwill 
impairment testing process, see the following Notes to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements: Note 1 for Citi’s 
accounting policy for goodwill and Note 3 for a description of 
Citi’s operating segments.

The Company issues both fixed- and variable-rate debt in a 
range of currencies. It uses derivative contracts, primarily 
interest rate swaps, to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-
rate debt to variable-rate debt. The maturity structure of the 
derivatives generally corresponds to the maturity structure of 
the debt being hedged. In addition, the Company uses other 
derivative contracts to manage the foreign exchange impact of 
certain debt issuances. At December 31, 2022, the Company’s 
overall weighted average interest rate for long-term debt, 
excluding structured notes accounted for at fair value, was 
3.72% on a contractual basis and 4.10% including the effects 
of derivative contracts.

22.  SECURITIZATIONS AND VARIABLE INTEREST 
ENTITIES

Uses of Special Purpose Entities
A special purpose entity (SPE) is an entity designed to fulfill a 
specific limited need of the company that organized it. The 
principal uses of SPEs by Citi are to assist clients in 
securitizing their financial assets and create investment 
products for clients and to obtain liquidity and optimize capital 
efficiency by securitizing certain of Citi’s financial assets. 
SPEs may be organized in various legal forms, including 
trusts, partnerships or corporations. In a securitization, through 
the SPE’s issuance of debt and equity instruments, certificates, 
commercial paper or other notes of indebtedness, the company 
transferring assets to the SPE converts all (or a portion) of 
those assets into cash before they would have been realized in 
the normal course of business. These issuances are recorded 
on the balance sheet of the SPE, which may or may not be 
consolidated onto the balance sheet of the company that 
organized the SPE.

Investors usually have recourse only to the assets in the 
SPE, but may also benefit from other credit enhancements, 
such as a collateral account, a line of credit or a liquidity 
facility, such as a liquidity put option or asset purchase 
agreement. Because of these enhancements, the SPE issuances 
typically obtain a more favorable credit rating than the 
transferor could obtain for its own debt issuances. This results 
in less expensive financing costs than unsecured debt. The 
SPE may also enter into derivative contracts in order to 
convert the yield or currency of the underlying assets to match 
the needs of the SPE investors or to limit or change the credit 
risk of the SPE. Citigroup may be the provider of certain credit 
enhancements as well as the counterparty to any related 
derivative contracts.

Most of Citigroup’s SPEs are variable interest entities 

(VIEs). 

Variable Interest Entities
VIEs are described in Note 1. Investors that finance the VIE 
through debt or equity interests or other counterparties 
providing other forms of support, such as guarantees, certain 
fee arrangements or certain types of derivative contracts, are 
variable interest holders in the entity.

The variable interest holder, if any, that has a controlling 

financial interest in a VIE is deemed to be the primary 
beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE. 

The Company must evaluate each VIE to understand the 
purpose and design of the entity, the role the Company had in 
the entity’s design and its involvement in the VIE’s ongoing 
activities. The Company then must evaluate which activities 
most significantly impact the economic performance of the 
VIE and who has the power to direct such activities.

For those VIEs where the Company determines that it has 
the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact 
the VIE’s economic performance, the Company must then 
evaluate its economic interests, if any, and determine whether 
it could absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially 
be significant to the VIE. When evaluating whether the 
Company has an obligation to absorb losses that could 
potentially be significant, it considers the maximum exposure 
to such loss without consideration of probability. Such 
obligations could be in various forms, including, but not 
limited to, debt and equity investments, guarantees, liquidity 
agreements and certain derivative contracts.

In various other transactions, the Company may (i) act as 

a derivative counterparty (e.g., interest rate swap, cross-
currency swap or purchaser of credit protection under a credit 
default swap or total return swap where the Company pays the 
total return on certain assets to the SPE), (ii) act as underwriter 
or placement agent, (iii) provide administrative, trustee or 
other services or (iv) make a market in debt securities or other 
instruments issued by VIEs. The Company generally considers 
such involvement, by itself, not to be variable interests and 
thus not an indicator of power or potentially significant 
benefits or losses.

certain investment funds for which the Company provides 
investment management services and personal estate 
trusts for which the Company provides administrative, 
trustee and/or investment management services;
certain third-party-sponsored private equity funds to 
which the Company provides secured credit facilities. The 
Company has no decision-making power and does not 
consolidate these funds, some of which may meet the 
definition of a VIE. The Company’s maximum exposure 
to loss is generally limited to a loan or lending-related 
commitment. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the 
Company’s maximum exposure to loss related to these 
transactions was $33.6 billion and $55.6 billion, 
respectively (see Notes 14 and 26 for more information on 
these positions);
certain VIEs structured by third parties in which the 
Company holds securities in inventory, as these 
investments are made on arm’s-length terms; 
certain positions in mortgage- and asset-backed securities 
held by the Company, which are classified as Trading 
account assets or Investments, in which the Company has 
no other involvement with the related securitization entity 
deemed to be significant (see Notes 13 and 25 for more 
information on these positions); 
certain representations and warranties exposures in 
Citigroup residential mortgage securitizations, in which 
the original mortgage loan balances are no longer 
outstanding; and
VIEs such as preferred securities trusts used in connection 
with the Company’s funding activities. The Company 
does not have a variable interest in these trusts.

The asset balances for consolidated VIEs represent the 
carrying amounts of the assets consolidated by the Company. 
The carrying amount may represent the amortized cost or the 
current fair value of the assets depending on the classification 
of the asset (e.g., loan or security) and the associated 
accounting model ascribed to that classification.

The asset balances for unconsolidated VIEs in which the 

Company has significant involvement represent the most 
current information available to the Company. In most cases, 
the asset balances represent an amortized cost basis without 
regard to impairments, unless fair value information is readily 
available to the Company.

The maximum funded exposure represents the balance 
sheet carrying amount of the Company’s investment in the 
VIE. It reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the VIE, 
adjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal payments 
received. The carrying amount may also be adjusted for 
increases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value 
recognized in earnings. The maximum exposure of unfunded 
positions represents the remaining undrawn committed 
amount, including liquidity and credit facilities provided by 
the Company or the notional amount of a derivative 
instrument considered to be a variable interest. In certain 
transactions, the Company has entered into derivative 
instruments or other arrangements that are not considered 
variable interests in the VIE (e.g., interest rate swaps, cross-
currency swaps or where the Company is the purchaser of 
credit protection under a credit default swap or total return 
swap where the Company pays the total return on certain 
assets to the SPE). Receivables under such arrangements are 
not included in the maximum exposure amounts.

Consolidated VIEs
The Company engages in on-balance sheet securitizations, 
which are securitizations that do not qualify for sales 
treatment; thus, the assets remain on Citi’s Consolidated 
Balance Sheet, and any proceeds received are recognized as 
secured liabilities. In general, the third-party investors in the 
obligations of consolidated VIEs have legal recourse only to 
the assets of the respective VIEs and do not have such 
recourse to the Company, except where Citi has provided a 
guarantee to the investors or is the counterparty to certain 
derivative transactions involving the VIE. Thus, Citigroup’s 

maximum legal exposure to loss related to consolidated VIEs 
is significantly less than the carrying value of the consolidated 
VIE assets due to outstanding third-party financing. 
Intercompany assets and liabilities are excluded from Citi’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. All VIE assets are restricted from 
being sold or pledged as collateral. The cash flows from these 
assets are the only source used to pay down the associated 
liabilities, which are non-recourse to Citi’s general assets. See 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet for more information about 
these Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities.

Credit Card Securitizations
The Company securitizes credit card receivables through trusts 
established to purchase the receivables. Citigroup transfers 
receivables into the trusts on a non-recourse basis. Credit card 
securitizations are revolving securitizations: as customers pay 
their credit card balances, the cash proceeds are used to 
purchase new receivables and replenish the receivables in the 
trust.

Substantially all of the Company’s credit card 

securitization activity is through two trusts—Citibank Credit 
Card Master Trust (Master Trust) and Citibank Omni Trust 
(Omni Trust), with the substantial majority through the Master 
Trust. These trusts are consolidated entities because, as 

servicer, Citigroup has the power to direct the activities that 
most significantly impact the economic performance of the 
trusts. Citigroup holds a seller’s interest and certain securities 
issued by the trusts, which could result in exposure to 
potentially significant losses or benefits from the trusts. 
Accordingly, the transferred credit card receivables remain on 
Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet with no gain or loss 
recognized. The debt issued by the trusts to third parties is 
included on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

Citi utilizes securitizations as one of the sources of 

funding for its business in North America. The following table 
reflects amounts related to the Company’s securitized credit 
card receivables:

Managed Loans
After securitization of credit card receivables, the Company 
continues to maintain credit card customer account 
relationships and provides servicing for receivables transferred 
to the trusts. As a result, the Company considers the 
securitized credit card receivables to be part of the business it 
manages. As Citigroup consolidates the credit card trusts, all 
managed securitized card receivables are on-balance sheet.

Funding, Liquidity Facilities and Subordinated Interests
As noted above, Citigroup securitizes credit card receivables 
through two securitization trusts—Master Trust and Omni 
Trust. The liabilities of the trusts are included on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet, excluding those retained by 
Citigroup.

Master Trust Liabilities (at Par Value)
The Master Trust issues fixed- and floating-rate term notes. 
Some of the term notes may be issued to multi-seller 
commercial paper conduits. The weighted average maturity of 
the third-party term notes issued by the Master Trust was 3.5 
years as of December 31, 2022 and 3.6 years as of 
December 31, 2021.

Mortgage Securitizations
Citigroup provides a wide range of mortgage loan products to 
a diverse customer base. Once originated, the Company often 
securitizes these loans through the use of VIEs. These VIEs 
are funded through the issuance of trust certificates backed 
solely by the transferred assets. These certificates have the 
same life as the transferred assets. In addition to providing a 
source of liquidity and less expensive funding, securitizing 
these assets also reduces Citi’s credit exposure to the 
borrowers. These mortgage loan securitizations are primarily 
non-recourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future 
credit losses to the purchasers of the securities issued by the 
trust.

Citi’s U.S. consumer mortgage business generally retains 
the servicing rights and in certain instances retains investment 
securities, interest-only strips and residual interests in future 
cash flows from the trusts and also provides servicing for a 
limited number of ICG securitizations. Citi’s ICG business 
may hold investment securities pursuant to credit risk retention 
rules or in connection with secondary market-making 
activities. 

The Company securitizes mortgage loans generally 
through either a U.S. government-sponsored agency, such as 
Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (U.S. agency-
sponsored mortgages), or private label (non-agency-sponsored 

mortgages) securitization. Citi is not the primary beneficiary 
of its U.S. agency-sponsored mortgage securitization entities 
because Citigroup does not have the power to direct the 
activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the 
entities’ economic performance. Therefore, Citi does not 
consolidate these U.S. agency-sponsored mortgage 
securitization entities. Substantially all of the consumer loans 
sold or securitized through non-consolidated trusts by 
Citigroup are U.S. prime residential mortgage loans. Retained 
interests in non-consolidated agency-sponsored mortgage 
securitization trusts are classified as Trading account assets, 
except for MSRs, which are included in Other assets on 
Citigroup’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Citigroup does not consolidate certain non-agency-
sponsored mortgage securitization entities because Citi is 
either not the servicer with the power to direct the significant 
activities of the entity or Citi is the servicer, but the servicing 
relationship is deemed to be a fiduciary relationship; therefore, 
Citi is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the entity.
In certain instances, the Company has (i) the power to 
direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ 
economic performance and (ii) the obligation to either absorb 
losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially 
significant to its non-agency-sponsored mortgage 
securitization entities and, therefore, is the primary beneficiary 
and, thus, consolidates the VIE.

For non-consolidated mortgage securitization entities 
where the transfer of loans to the VIE meets the conditions for 
sale accounting, Citi recognizes a gain or loss based on the 
difference between the carrying value of the transferred assets 
and the proceeds received (generally cash but may be 
beneficial interests or servicing rights).

Agency and non-agency securitization gains for the year 

ended December 31, 2022 were $1.3 million and $154.8 
million, respectively. 

Agency and non-agency securitization gains for the year 

ended December 31, 2021 were $3.9 million and $493.4 
million, respectively, and $88.4 million and $139.4 million, 
respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)
In connection with the securitization of mortgage loans, Citi’s 
U.S. consumer mortgage business generally retains the 
servicing rights, which entitle the Company to a future stream 
of cash flows based on the outstanding principal balances of 
the loans and the contractual servicing fee. Failure to service 
the loans in accordance with contractual requirements may 
lead to a termination of the servicing rights and the loss of 
future servicing fees.

These transactions create intangible assets referred to as 

MSRs, which are recorded at fair value on Citi’s Consolidated 
Balance Sheet. The fair value of Citi’s capitalized MSRs was 
$665 million and $404 million at December 31, 2022 and 
2021, respectively. The MSRs correspond to principal loan 
balances of $51 billion and $47 billion as of December 31, 
2022 and 2021, respectively. 

The following table summarizes the changes in 

capitalized MSRs:

(1)  Represents changes due to customer payments and passage of time.

The fair value of the MSRs is primarily affected by 
changes in prepayments of mortgages that result from shifts in 
mortgage interest rates. Specifically, higher interest rates tend 
to lead to declining prepayments, which causes the fair value 
of the MSRs to increase. In managing this risk, Citigroup 
economically hedges a significant portion of the value of its 
MSRs through the use of interest rate derivative contracts, 
forward purchase and sale commitments of mortgage-backed 
securities and purchased securities, all classified as Trading 
account assets. 

The Company receives fees during the course of servicing 

previously securitized mortgages. The amounts of these fees

Re-securitizations
The Company engages in re-securitization transactions in 
which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for 
new beneficial interests. Citi did not transfer non-agency 
(private label) securities to re-securitization entities during the 
years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. These securities are 

247

backed by either residential or commercial mortgages and are 
often structured on behalf of clients. 

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Citi held no retained 

interests in private label re-securitization transactions 
structured by Citi. 

The Company also re-securitizes U.S. government-

agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed (agency) securities. 
During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Citi 
transferred agency securities with a fair value of 
approximately $24.1 billion and $46.6 billion, respectively, to 
re-securitization entities. 

As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of Citi-retained 
interests in agency re-securitization transactions structured by 
Citi totaled approximately $1.4 billion (including $802 million 
related to re-securitization transactions executed in 2022) 
compared to $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2021 (including 
$641 million related to re-securitization transactions executed 
in 2021), which is recorded in Trading account assets. The 
original fair values of agency re-securitization transactions in 
which Citi holds a retained interest as of December 31, 2022 
and 2021 were approximately $79.4 billion and $78.4 billion, 
respectively.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not 

consolidate any private label or agency re-securitization 
entities.

Citi-Administered Asset-Backed Commercial Paper 
Conduits
The Company is active in the asset-backed commercial paper 
conduit business as administrator of several multi-seller 
commercial paper conduits and also as a service provider to 
single-seller and other commercial paper conduits sponsored 
by third parties.

Citi’s multi-seller commercial paper conduits are 

designed to provide the Company’s clients access to low-cost 
funding in the commercial paper markets. The conduits 
purchase assets from or provide financing facilities to clients 
and are funded by issuing commercial paper to third-party 
investors. The conduits generally do not purchase assets 
originated by Citi. The funding of the conduits is facilitated by 
the liquidity support and credit enhancements provided by the 
Company.

As administrator to Citi’s conduits, the Company is 
generally responsible for selecting and structuring assets 
purchased or financed by the conduits, making decisions 
regarding the funding of the conduits, including determining 
the tenor and other features of the commercial paper issued, 
monitoring the quality and performance of the conduits’ assets 
and facilitating the operations and cash flows of the conduits. 
In return, the Company earns structuring fees from customers 
for individual transactions and earns an administration fee 
from the conduit, which is equal to the income from the client 
program and liquidity fees of the conduit after payment of 
conduit expenses. This administration fee is fairly stable, since 
most risks and rewards of the underlying assets are passed 
back to the clients. Once the asset pricing is negotiated, most 
ongoing income, costs and fees are relatively stable as a 
percentage of the conduit’s size.

The conduits administered by Citi do not generally invest 
in liquid securities that are formally rated by third parties. The 

 
 
 
 
 
assets are privately negotiated and structured transactions that 
are generally designed to be held by the conduit, rather than 
actively traded and sold. The yield earned by the conduit on 
each asset is generally tied to the rate on the commercial paper 
issued by the conduit, thus passing interest rate risk to the 
client. Each asset purchased by the conduit is structured with 
transaction-specific credit enhancement features provided by 
the third-party client seller, including over-collateralization, 
cash and excess spread collateral accounts, direct recourse or 
third-party guarantees. These credit enhancements are sized 
with the objective of approximating a credit rating of A or 
above, based on Citi’s internal risk ratings. At December 31, 
2022 and 2021, the commercial paper conduits administered 
by Citi had approximately $19.6 billion and $14 billion of 
purchased assets outstanding, respectively, and had 
incremental funding commitments with clients of 
approximately $13.9 billion and $18.3 billion, respectively.
Substantially all of the funding of the conduits is in the 

form of short-term commercial paper. At December 31, 2022 
and 2021, the weighted average remaining lives of the 
commercial paper issued by the conduits were approximately 
64 and 70 days, respectively. 

The primary credit enhancement provided to the conduit 

investors is in the form of transaction-specific credit 
enhancements described above. Each asset purchased by the 
conduit is structured with transaction-specific credit 
enhancement features provided by the third-party client seller, 
including over-collateralization, cash and excess spread 
collateral accounts, direct recourse or third-party guarantees. 
These credit enhancements are sized with the objective of 
approximating a credit rating of A or above, based on Citi’s 
internal risk ratings. In addition to the transaction-specific 
credit enhancements, the conduits, other than the government-
guaranteed loan conduit, have obtained letters of credit from 
the Company, which equal at least 8% to 10% of the conduit’s 
assets with a minimum of $200 million. The letters of credit 
provided by the Company to the conduits total approximately 
$1.9 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $1.3 billion as of 
December 31, 2021. The net result across multiseller conduits 
administered by the Company is that, in the event that 
defaulted assets exceed the transaction-specific credit 
enhancements described above, any losses in each conduit are 
allocated first to the Company and then to the commercial 
paper investors.

Citigroup also provides the conduits with two forms of 
liquidity agreements that are used to provide funding to the 
conduits in the event of a market disruption, among other 
events. Each asset of the conduits is supported by a 
transaction-specific liquidity facility in the form of an asset 
purchase agreement (APA). Under the APA, the Company has 
generally agreed to purchase non-defaulted eligible 
receivables from the conduit at par. The APA is not designed 
to provide credit support to the conduit, as it generally does 
not permit the purchase of defaulted or impaired assets. Any 
funding under the APA will likely subject the underlying 
conduit clients to increased interest costs. In addition, the 
Company provides the conduits with program-wide liquidity 
in the form of short-term lending commitments. Under these 
commitments, the Company has agreed to lend to the conduits 
in the event of a short-term disruption in the commercial paper 

248

market, subject to specified conditions. The Company receives 
fees for providing both types of liquidity agreements and 
considers these fees to be on fair market terms.

Finally, Citi is one of several named dealers in the 
commercial paper issued by the conduits and earns a market-
based fee for providing such services. Along with third-party 
dealers, the Company makes a market in the commercial paper 
and may from time to time fund commercial paper pending 
sale to a third party. On specific dates with less liquidity in the 
market, the Company may hold in inventory commercial paper 
issued by conduits administered by the Company, as well as 
conduits administered by third parties. Separately, in the 
normal course of business, Citi purchases commercial paper, 
including commercial paper issued by Citigroup's conduits. At 
December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company owned $8.6 
billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, of the commercial paper 
issued by its administered conduits. The Company’s 
investments were not driven by market illiquidity and the 
Company is not obligated under any agreement to purchase 
the commercial paper issued by the conduits.

The asset-backed commercial paper conduits are 
consolidated by Citi. The Company has determined that, 
through its roles as administrator and liquidity provider, it has 
the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact 
the entities’ economic performance. These powers include its 
ability to structure and approve the assets purchased by the 
conduits, its ongoing surveillance and credit mitigation 
activities, its ability to sell or repurchase assets out of the 
conduits and its liability management. In addition, as a result 
of all the Company’s involvement described above, it was 
concluded that Citi has an economic interest that could 
potentially be significant. However, the assets and liabilities of 
the conduits are separate and apart from those of Citigroup. 
No assets of any conduit are available to satisfy the creditors 
of Citigroup or any of its other subsidiaries.

Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs)
A collateralized loan obligation (CLO) is a VIE that purchases 
a portfolio of assets consisting primarily of non-investment 
grade corporate loans. CLOs issue multiple tranches of debt 
and equity to investors to fund the asset purchases and pay 
upfront expenses associated with forming the CLO. A third-
party asset manager is contracted by the CLO to purchase the 
underlying assets from the open market and monitor the credit 
risk associated with those assets. Over the term of a CLO, the 
asset manager directs purchases and sales of assets in a 
manner consistent with the CLO’s asset management 
agreement and indenture. In general, the CLO asset manager 
will have the power to direct the activities of the entity that 
most significantly impact the economic performance of the 
CLO. Investors in a CLO, through their ownership of debt 
and/or equity in it, can also direct certain activities of the 
CLO, including removing its asset manager under limited 
circumstances, optionally redeeming the notes, voting on 
amendments to the CLO’s operating documents and other 
activities. A CLO has a finite life, typically 12 years.

Citi serves as a structuring and placement agent with 
respect to the CLOs. Typically, the debt and equity of the 
CLOs are sold to third-party investors. On occasion, certain 
Citi entities may purchase some portion of a CLO’s liabilities 

for investment purposes. In addition, Citi may purchase, 
typically in the secondary market, certain securities issued by 
the CLOs to support its market-making activities.

The Company generally does not have the power to direct 

the activities that most significantly impact the economic 
performance of the CLOs, as this power is generally held by a 
third-party asset manager of the CLO. As such, those CLOs 
are not consolidated.

Asset-Based Financing
The Company provides loans and other forms of financing to 
VIEs that hold assets. Those loans are subject to the same 
credit approvals as all other loans originated or purchased by 
the Company. Financings in the form of debt securities or 
derivatives are, in most circumstances, reported in Trading 
account assets and accounted for at fair value through 
earnings. The Company generally does not have the power to 
direct the activities that most significantly impact these VIEs’ 
economic performance; thus, it does not consolidate them.

The primary types of Citi’s asset-based financings, total 

assets of the unconsolidated VIEs with significant 
involvement and Citi’s maximum exposure to loss are shown

Municipal Securities Tender Option Bond (TOB) Trusts
Municipal TOB trusts may hold fixed- or floating-rate, taxable 
or tax-exempt securities issued by state and local governments 
and municipalities. TOB trusts are typically structured as 
single-issuer entities whose assets are purchased from either 
the Company or from other investors in the municipal 
securities market. TOB trusts finance the purchase of their 
municipal assets by issuing two classes of certificates: long-
dated, floating rate certificates (“Floaters”) that are putable 
pursuant to a liquidity facility and residual interest certificates 
(“Residuals”). The Floaters are purchased by third-party 
investors, typically tax-exempt money market funds. The 
Residuals are purchased by the original owner of the 
municipal securities that are being financed.

From Citigroup’s perspective, there are two types of TOB 

trusts: customer and non-customer. Customer TOB trusts are 
those trusts utilized by customers of the Company to finance 
their securities, generally municipal securities. The Residuals 
issued by these trusts are purchased by the customer being 
financed. Non-customer TOB trusts are generally used by the 
Company to finance its own municipal securities investments; 
the Residuals issued by non-customer TOB trusts are 
purchased by the Company.

With respect to both customer and non-customer TOB 
trusts, Citi may provide remarketing agent services. If Floaters 
are optionally tendered and the Company, in its role as 
remarketing agent, is unable to find a new investor to purchase 
the optionally tendered Floaters within a specified period of 
time, Citigroup may, but is not obligated to, purchase the 
tendered Floaters into its own inventory. The level of the 
Company’s inventory of such Floaters fluctuates. 

For certain customer TOB trusts, Citi may also serve as a 

voluntary advance provider. In this capacity, the Company 
may, but is not obligated to, make loan advances to customer 
TOB trusts to purchase optionally tendered Floaters that have 
not otherwise been successfully remarketed to new investors. 
Such loans are secured by pledged Floaters. As of 
December 31, 2022, Citi had no outstanding voluntary 
advances to customer TOB trusts.

For certain non-customer trusts, the Company also 

provides credit enhancement. At December 31, 2022 and 
2021, none of the municipal bonds owned by non-customer 
TOB trusts were subject to a credit guarantee provided by the 
Company.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Citigroup also provides liquidity services to many 
customer and non-customer trusts. If a trust is unwound early 
due to an event other than a credit event on the underlying 
municipal bonds, the underlying municipal bonds are sold out 
of the trust and bond sale proceeds are used to redeem the 
outstanding trust certificates. If this results in a shortfall 
between the bond sale proceeds and the redemption price of 
the tendered Floaters, the Company, pursuant to the liquidity 
agreement, would be obligated to make a payment to the trust 
to satisfy that shortfall. For certain customer TOB trusts, 
Citigroup has also executed a reimbursement agreement with 
the holder of the Residual, pursuant to which the Residual 
holder is obligated to reimburse the Company for any payment 
the Company makes under the liquidity arrangement. These 
reimbursement agreements may be subject to daily margining 
based on changes in the market value of the underlying 
municipal bonds. In cases where a third party provides 
liquidity to a non-customer TOB trust, a similar 
reimbursement arrangement may be executed, whereby the 
Company (or a consolidated subsidiary of the Company), as 
Residual holder, would absorb any losses incurred by the 
liquidity provider.

For certain other non-customer TOB trusts, Citi serves as 

tender option provider. The tender option provider 
arrangement allows Floater holders to put their interests 
directly to the Company at any time, subject to the requisite 
notice period requirements, at a price of par.

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, liquidity agreements 
provided with respect to customer TOB trusts totaled $1.1 
billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, of which $0.7 billion and 
$0.6 billion, respectively, were offset by reimbursement 
agreements. For the remaining exposure related to TOB 
transactions, where the residual owned by the customer was at 
least 25% of the bond value at the inception of the transaction, 
no reimbursement agreement was executed. 

Citi considers both customer and non-customer TOB 
trusts to be VIEs. Customer TOB trusts are not consolidated 
by the Company, as the power to direct the activities that most 
significantly impact the trust’s economic performance rests 
with the customer Residual holder, which may unilaterally 
cause the sale of the trust’s bonds.

Non-customer TOB trusts generally are consolidated 
because the Company holds the Residual interest and thus has 
the unilateral power to cause the sale of the trust’s bonds.

The Company also provides other liquidity agreements or 

letters of credit to customer-sponsored municipal investment 
funds, which are not variable interest entities, and 
municipality-related issuers that totaled $1.4 billion as of 
December 31, 2022 and $2 billion as of December 31, 2021. 
These liquidity agreements and letters of credit are offset by 
reimbursement agreements with various term-out provisions.

Municipal Investments
Municipal investment transactions include debt and equity 
interests in partnerships that finance the construction and 
rehabilitation of low-income housing, facilitate lending in new 
or underserved markets or finance the construction or 
operation of renewable municipal energy facilities. Citi 
generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and 
earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits and 

250

grants earned from the investments made by the partnership. 
The Company may also provide construction loans or 
permanent loans for the development or operation of real 
estate properties held by partnerships. These entities are 
generally considered VIEs. The power to direct the activities 
of these entities is typically held by the general partner. 
Accordingly, these entities are not consolidated by Citigroup.

Client Intermediation
Client intermediation transactions represent a range of 
transactions designed to provide investors with specified 
returns based on the returns of an underlying security, 
referenced asset or index. These transactions include credit-
linked notes and equity-linked notes. In these transactions, the 
VIE typically obtains exposure to the underlying security, 
referenced asset or index through a derivative instrument, such 
as a total-return swap or a credit-default swap. In turn, the VIE 
issues notes to investors that pay a return based on the 
specified underlying security, referenced asset or index. The 
VIE invests the proceeds in a financial asset or a guaranteed 
insurance contract that serves as collateral for the derivative 
contract over the term of the transaction. The Company’s 
involvement in these transactions includes being the 
counterparty to the VIE’s derivative instruments and investing 
in a portion of the notes issued by the VIE. In certain 
transactions, the investor’s maximum risk of loss is limited 
and the Company absorbs risk of loss above a specified level. 
Citi does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIEs 
that most significantly impact their economic performance and 
thus it does not consolidate them.

Citi’s maximum risk of loss in these transactions is 
defined as the amount invested in notes issued by the VIE and 
the notional amount of any risk of loss absorbed by Citi 
through a separate instrument issued by the VIE. The 
derivative instrument held by the Company may generate a 
receivable from the VIE (e.g., where the Company purchases 
credit protection from the VIE in connection with the VIE’s 
issuance of a credit-linked note), which is collateralized by the 
assets owned by the VIE. These derivative instruments are not 
considered variable interests and any associated receivables 
are not included in the calculation of maximum exposure to 
the VIE.

Investment Funds
The Company is the investment manager for certain 
investment funds and retirement funds that invest in various 
asset classes including private equity, hedge funds, real estate, 
fixed income and infrastructure. Citigroup earns a 
management fee, which is a percentage of capital under 
management, and may earn performance fees. In addition, for 
some of these funds the Company has an ownership interest in 
the investment funds. Citi has also established a number of 
investment funds as opportunities for qualified employees to 
invest in private equity investments. The Company acts as 
investment manager for these funds and may provide 
employees with financing on both recourse and non-recourse 
bases for a portion of the employees’ investment 
commitments.

23.  DERIVATIVES

In the ordinary course of business, Citigroup enters into 
various types of derivative transactions, which include: 

•

•

•

Futures and forward contracts, which are commitments 
to buy or sell at a future date a financial instrument, 
commodity or currency at a contracted price that may be 
settled in cash or through delivery of an item readily 
convertible to cash.
Swap contracts, which are commitments to settle in cash 
at a future date or dates that may range from a few days to 
a number of years, based on differentials between 
specified indices or financial instruments, as applied to a 
notional principal amount.
Option contracts, which give the purchaser, for a 
premium, the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell 
within a specified time a financial instrument, commodity 
or currency at a contracted price that may also be settled 
in cash, based on differentials between specified indices 
or prices.

Swaps, forwards and some option contracts are over-the-
counter (OTC) derivatives that are bilaterally negotiated with 
counterparties and settled with those counterparties, except for 
swap contracts that are novated and “cleared” through central 
counterparties (CCPs). Futures contracts and other option 
contracts are standardized contracts that are traded on an 
exchange with a CCP as the counterparty from the inception of 
the transaction. Citigroup enters into derivative contracts 
relating to interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and other 
market/credit risks for the following reasons:

•

•

Trading Purposes: Citigroup trades derivatives as an 
active market maker. Citigroup offers its customers 
derivatives in connection with their risk management 
actions to transfer, modify or reduce their interest rate, 
foreign exchange and other market/credit risks or for their 
own trading purposes. Citigroup also manages its 
derivative risk positions through offsetting trade activities, 
controls focused on price verification and daily reporting 
of positions to senior managers.
Hedging: Citigroup uses derivatives in connection with its 
own risk management activities to hedge certain risks or 
reposition the risk profile of the Company. Hedging may 
be accomplished by applying hedge accounting in 
accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. For 
example, Citigroup issues fixed-rate long-term debt and 
then enters into a receive-fixed, pay-variable-rate interest 
rate swap with the same tenor and notional amount to 
synthetically convert the interest payments to a net 
variable-rate basis. This strategy is the most common 
form of an interest rate hedge, as it minimizes net interest 
cost in certain yield curve environments. Derivatives are 
also used to manage market risks inherent in specific 
groups of on-balance sheet assets and liabilities, including 
AFS securities, commodities and borrowings, as well as 
other interest-sensitive assets and liabilities. In addition, 
foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge non-U.S.-
dollar-denominated debt, foreign currency-denominated 
AFS securities and net investment exposures. 

251

Derivatives may expose Citigroup to market, credit or 

liquidity risks in excess of the amounts recorded on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Market risk on a derivative 
product is the exposure created by potential fluctuations in 
interest rates, market prices, foreign exchange rates and other 
factors and is a function of the type of product, the volume of 
transactions, the tenor and terms of the agreement and the 
underlying volatility. Credit risk is the exposure to loss in the 
event of nonperformance by the other party to satisfy a 
derivative liability where the value of any collateral held by 
Citi is not adequate to cover such losses. The recognition in 
earnings of unrealized gains on derivative transactions is 
subject to management’s assessment of the probability of 
counterparty default. Liquidity risk is the potential exposure 
that arises when the size of a derivative position may affect the 
ability to monetize the position in a reasonable period of time 
and at a reasonable cost in periods of high volatility and 
financial stress. 

Derivative transactions are customarily documented under 

industry standard master netting agreements, which provide 
that following an event of default, the non-defaulting party 
may promptly terminate all transactions between the parties 
and determine the net amount due to be paid to, or by, the 
defaulting party. Events of default include (i) failure to make a 
payment on a derivative transaction that remains uncured 
following applicable notice and grace periods, (ii) breach of 
agreement that remains uncured after applicable notice and 
grace periods, (iii) breach of a representation, (iv) cross 
default, either to third-party debt or to other derivative 
transactions entered into between the parties, or, in some 
cases, their affiliates, (v) the occurrence of a merger or 
consolidation that results in the creditworthiness of a party 
becoming materially weaker and (vi) the cessation or 
repudiation of any applicable guarantee or other credit support 
document. Obligations under master netting agreements are 
often secured by collateral posted under an industry standard 
credit support annex to the master netting agreement. An event 
of default may also occur under a credit support annex if a 
party fails to make a collateral delivery that remains uncured 
following applicable notice and grace periods. 

The netting and collateral rights incorporated in the 

master netting agreements are considered to be legally 
enforceable if a supportive legal opinion has been obtained 
from counsel of recognized standing that provides (i) the 
requisite level of certainty regarding enforceability and (ii) 
that the exercise of rights by the non-defaulting party to 
terminate and close-out transactions on a net basis under these 
agreements will not be stayed or avoided under applicable law 
upon an event of default, including bankruptcy, insolvency or 
similar proceeding. 

A legal opinion may not be sought for certain jurisdictions 

where local law is silent or unclear as to the enforceability of 
such rights or where adverse case law or conflicting regulation 
may cast doubt on the enforceability of such rights. In some 
jurisdictions and for some counterparty types, the insolvency 
law may not provide the requisite level of certainty. For 
example, this may be the case for certain sovereigns, 
municipalities, central banks and U.S. pension plans. 

Exposure to credit risk on derivatives is affected by 

Information pertaining to Citigroup’s derivatives 

market volatility, which may impair the ability of 
counterparties to satisfy their obligations to the Company. 
Credit limits are established and closely monitored for 
customers engaged in derivatives transactions. Citi considers 
the level of legal certainty regarding enforceability of its 
offsetting rights under master netting agreements and credit 
support annexes to be an important factor in its risk 
management process. Specifically, Citi generally transacts 
much lower volumes of derivatives under master netting 
agreements where Citi does not have the requisite level of 
legal certainty regarding enforceability, because such 
derivatives consume greater amounts of single counterparty 
credit limits than those executed under enforceable master 
netting agreements. 

Cash collateral and security collateral in the form of G10 

government debt securities are often posted by a party to a 
master netting agreement to secure the net open exposure of 
the other party; the receiving party is free to commingle/
rehypothecate such collateral in the ordinary course of its 
business. Nonstandard collateral such as corporate bonds, 
municipal bonds, U.S. agency securities and/or MBS may also 
be pledged as collateral for derivative transactions. Security 
collateral posted to open and maintain a master netting 
agreement with a counterparty, in the form of cash and/or 
securities, may from time to time be segregated in an account 
at a third-party custodian pursuant to a tri-party account 
control agreement.

activities, based on notional amounts, is presented in the table 
below. Derivative notional amounts are reference amounts 
from which contractual payments are derived and do not 
represent a complete measure of Citi’s exposure to derivative 
transactions. Citi’s derivative exposure arises primarily from 
market fluctuations (i.e., market risk), counterparty failure 
(i.e., credit risk) and/or periods of high volatility or financial 
stress (i.e., liquidity risk), as well as any market valuation 
adjustments that may be required on the transactions. 
Moreover, notional amounts do not reflect the netting of 
offsetting trades. For example, if Citi enters into a receive-
fixed interest rate swap with $100 million notional, and offsets 
this risk with an identical but opposite pay-fixed position with 
a different counterparty, $200 million in derivative notionals is 
reported, although these offsetting positions may result in de 
minimis overall market risk. 

In addition, aggregate derivative notional amounts can 

fluctuate from period to period in the normal course of 
business based on Citi’s market share, levels of client activity 
and other factors. All derivatives are recorded in Trading 
account assets/Trading account liabilities on the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet.

(1) Credit derivatives are arrangements designed to allow one party (protection purchaser) to transfer the credit risk of a “reference asset” to another party (protection 
seller). These arrangements allow a protection seller to assume the credit risk associated with the reference asset without directly purchasing that asset. The 
Company enters into credit derivative positions for purposes such as risk management, yield enhancement, reduction of credit concentrations and diversification of 
overall risk.

The following tables present the gross and net fair values 

of the Company’s derivative transactions and the related 
offsetting amounts as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Gross 
positive fair values are offset against gross negative fair values 
by counterparty, pursuant to enforceable master netting 
agreements. Under ASC 815-10-45, payables and receivables 
in respect of cash collateral received from or paid to a given 
counterparty pursuant to a credit support annex are included in 
the offsetting amount if a legal opinion supporting the 
enforceability of netting and collateral rights has been 
obtained. GAAP does not permit similar offsetting for security 
collateral. 

In addition, the following tables reflect rule changes 
adopted by clearing organizations that require or allow entities 
to treat certain derivative assets, liabilities and the related 
variation margin as settlement of the related derivative fair 
values for legal and accounting purposes, as opposed to 
presenting gross derivative assets and liabilities that are 
subject to collateral, whereby the counterparties would also 
record a related collateral payable or receivable. The tables 
also present amounts that are not permitted to be offset, such 
as security collateral or cash collateral posted at third-party 
custodians, but which would be eligible for offsetting to the 
extent that an event of default has occurred and a legal opinion 
supporting enforceability of the netting and collateral rights 
has been obtained.

assessment of effectiveness may exclude changes in the value 
of the hedged item that are unrelated to the risks being hedged 
and the changes in fair value of the derivative associated with 
time value. Citi excludes changes in the cross-currency basis 
associated with cross-currency swaps from the assessment of 
hedge effectiveness and records it in Other comprehensive 
income.

Discontinued Hedge Accounting
A hedging instrument must be highly effective in 
accomplishing the hedge objective of offsetting either changes 
in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item for the risk 
being hedged. Management may voluntarily de-designate an 
accounting hedge at any time, but if a hedging relationship is 
not highly effective, it no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting and must be de-designated. Subsequent changes in 
the fair value of the derivative are recognized in Other revenue 
or Principal transactions, similar to trading derivatives, with 
no offset recorded related to the hedged item.

For fair value hedges, any changes in the carrying value 
of the hedged item remain as part of the basis of the asset or 
liability and are ultimately realized as an element of the yield 
on the item. For cash flow hedges, changes in fair value of the 
end-user derivative remain in Accumulated other 
comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) and are included in the 
earnings of future periods when the forecasted hedged cash 
flows impact earnings. However, if it becomes probable that 
some or all of the hedged forecasted transactions will not 
occur, any amounts that remain in AOCI related to these 
transactions must be immediately reflected in Other revenue.
The foregoing criteria are applied on a decentralized 

basis, consistent with the level at which market risk is 
managed, but are subject to various limits and controls. The 
underlying asset, liability or forecasted transaction may be an 
individual item or a portfolio of similar items.

Fair Value Hedges

Hedging of Benchmark Interest Rate Risk
Citigroup’s fair value hedges, which include hedges of closed 
pools of assets, are primarily hedges of fixed-rate long-term 
debt or assets, such as available-for-sale debt securities or 
loans.

For qualifying fair value hedges of interest rate risk, the 
changes in the fair value of the derivative and the change in 
the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk 
are presented within Interest revenue or Interest expense based 
on whether the hedged item is an asset or a liability. 

For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, 

amounts recognized in Principal transactions in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income include certain derivatives 
not designated in a qualifying hedging relationship. Citigroup 
presents this disclosure by business classification, showing 
derivative gains and losses related to its trading activities 
together with gains and losses related to non-derivative 
instruments within the same trading portfolios, as this 
represents how these portfolios are risk managed. See Note 6 
for further information.

The amounts recognized in Other revenue in the 

Consolidated Statement of Income related to derivatives not 
designated in a qualifying hedging relationship are shown 
below. The table below does not include any offsetting gains 
(losses) on the economically hedged items to the extent that 
such amounts are also recorded in Other revenue:

Accounting for Derivative Hedging
Citigroup accounts for its hedging activities in accordance 
with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. As a general rule, 
hedge accounting is permitted where the Company is exposed 
to a particular risk, such as interest rate or foreign exchange 
risk, that causes changes in the fair value of an asset or 
liability or variability in the expected future cash flows of an 
existing asset, liability or a forecasted transaction that may 
affect earnings.

Derivative contracts hedging the risks associated with 
changes in fair value are referred to as fair value hedges, while 
contracts hedging the variability of expected future cash flows 
are cash flow hedges. Hedges that utilize derivatives or debt 
instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated 
with equity investments in non-U.S.-dollar-functional-
currency foreign subsidiaries (i.e., net investment in a foreign 
operation) are net investment hedges.

To qualify as an accounting hedge under the hedge 
accounting rules (versus an economic hedge where hedge 
accounting is not applied), a hedging relationship must be 
highly effective in offsetting the risk designated as being 
hedged. The hedging relationship must be formally 
documented at inception, detailing the particular risk 
management objective and strategy for the hedge. This 
includes the item and risk(s) being hedged, the hedging 
instrument being used and how effectiveness will be assessed. 
The effectiveness of these hedging relationships is evaluated at 
hedge inception and on an ongoing basis both on a 
retrospective and prospective basis, typically using 
quantitative measures of correlation, with hedge 
ineffectiveness measured and recorded in current earnings. 
Hedge effectiveness assessment methodologies are performed 
in a similar manner for similar hedges, and are used 
consistently throughout the hedging relationships. The

Hedging of Foreign Exchange Risk
Citigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to 
foreign exchange rate movements in available-for-sale debt 
securities and long-term debt that are denominated in 
currencies other than the functional currency of the entity 
holding the securities or issuing the debt. The hedging 
instrument is generally a forward foreign exchange contract or 
a cross-currency swap contract. Changes in the fair value of 
the forward points (i.e., the spot-forward difference) of 
forward contracts are excluded from the assessment of hedge 
effectiveness and are generally reflected directly in earnings 
over the life of the hedge. Citi also excludes changes in the 
fair value of cross-currency basis associated with cross-
currency swaps from the assessment of hedge effectiveness 
and records them in Other comprehensive income.

Hedging of Commodity Price Risk 
Citigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to spot 
price movements in physical commodities inventories. The 
hedging instrument is a futures contract to sell the underlying 
commodity. In this hedge, the change in the carrying value of 
the hedged inventory is reflected in earnings, which offsets the 
change in the fair value of the futures contract that is also 
reflected in earnings. Although the entire change in the fair 
value of the hedging instrument is recorded in earnings, under 
certain hedge programs, Citigroup excludes changes in the fair 
value of the forward points (i.e., spot-forward difference) of 
the futures contract from the assessment of hedge 
effectiveness, and they are generally reflected directly in 
earnings over the life of the hedge. Under other hedge 
programs, Citi excludes changes in the fair value of forward 
points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and records 
them in Other comprehensive income.

directly in earnings under the mark-to-market approach. Amounts related to cross-currency basis, which are recognized in AOCI, are not reflected in the table 
above. The amount of cross-currency basis included in AOCI was $73 million and $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
(3) Amounts related to the forward points (i.e., the spot-forward difference) that are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness reflected directly in earnings 

under the mark-to-market approach or recorded in AOCI under the amortization approach. The year ended December 31, 2022 includes gain (loss) of 
approximately $86 million and $8 million under the mark-to-market approach and amortization approach, respectively.

Cumulative Basis Adjustment
Upon electing to apply ASC 815 fair value hedge accounting, 
the carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted to reflect the 
cumulative changes in the hedged risk. This cumulative basis 
adjustment becomes part of the carrying amount of the hedged 
item until the hedged item is derecognized from the balance 
sheet. The table below presents the carrying amount of Citi’s 
hedged assets and liabilities under qualifying fair value hedges 
at December 31, 2022 and 2021, along with the cumulative 
basis adjustments included in the carrying value of those 
hedged assets and liabilities that would reverse through 
earnings in future periods.

financial assets with a carrying value of $11 billion as of December 31, 
2022) in a last-of-layer hedging relationship.

previously designated as the hedged item in a fair value hedge using the 
last-of-layer approach. The Company designated approximately $6

 For cash flow hedges, the entire change in the fair value 

of the hedging derivative is recognized in AOCI and then 
reclassified to earnings in the same period that the forecasted 
hedged cash flows impact earnings. The pretax change in 
AOCI from cash flow hedges is presented below:

Cash Flow Hedges
Citigroup hedges the variability of forecasted cash flows due 
to changes in contractually specified interest rates associated 
with floating-rate assets/liabilities and other forecasted 
transactions. Variable cash flows from those liabilities are 
synthetically converted to fixed-rate cash flows by entering 
into receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps and 
receive-variable, pay-fixed forward-starting interest rate 
swaps. Variable cash flows associated with certain assets are 
synthetically converted to fixed-rate cash flows by entering 
into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. These cash 
flow hedging relationships use either regression analysis or 
dollar-offset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging 
relationships are highly effective at inception and on an 
ongoing basis.

(1) All amounts reclassified into earnings for interest rate contracts are included in Interest income/Interest expense (Net interest income). For all other hedges, the 

amounts reclassified to earnings are included primarily in Other revenue and Net interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 

The net gain (loss) associated with cash flow hedges 
expected to be reclassified from AOCI within 12 months of 
December 31, 2022 is approximately $(1.7) billion. The 
maximum length of time over which forecasted cash flows are 
hedged is 10 years.

The after-tax impact of cash flow hedges on AOCI is 

shown in Note 20.

Net Investment Hedges
Consistent with ASC 830-20, Foreign Currency Matters—
Foreign Currency Transactions, ASC 815 allows the hedging 
of the foreign currency risk of a net investment in a foreign 
operation. Citigroup uses foreign currency forwards, cross-
currency swaps, options and foreign currency-denominated 
debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk 
associated with Citigroup’s equity investments in several non-
U.S.-dollar-functional-currency foreign subsidiaries. Citi 
records the change in the fair value of these hedging 
instruments and the translation adjustment for the investments 
in these foreign subsidiaries in Foreign currency translation 
adjustment within AOCI.

For derivatives designated as net investment hedges, 
Citigroup follows the forward-rate method outlined in ASC 
815-35-35. According to that method, all changes in fair value, 
including changes related to the forward-rate component of the 
foreign currency forward contracts and the time value of 
foreign currency options, are recorded in Foreign currency 
translation adjustment within AOCI.

For foreign currency-denominated debt instruments that 

are designated as hedges of net investments, the translation 
gain or loss that is recorded in Foreign currency translation 
adjustment is based on the spot exchange rate between the 
functional currency of the respective subsidiary and the U.S. 
dollar, which is the functional currency of Citigroup. 

The pretax gain (loss) recorded in Foreign currency 
translation adjustment within AOCI, related to net investment 
hedges, was $370 million, $855 million and $(600) million for 
the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, 
respectively. The year ended December 31, 2022 includes a 
$36 million pretax loss related to net investment hedges, 
respectively, which were reclassified from AOCI into earnings 
(recorded in Other revenue). 

Economic Hedges
Citigroup often uses economic hedges when hedge accounting 
would be too complex or operationally burdensome. End-user 
derivatives that are economic hedges are carried at fair value, 
with changes in value included in either Principal transactions 
or Other revenue. 

For asset/liability management hedging, fixed-rate long-

term debt is recorded at amortized cost under GAAP.

For other hedges that either do not meet the ASC 815 
hedging criteria or for which management decides not to apply 
ASC 815 hedge accounting, the derivative is recorded at fair 
value on the balance sheet with the associated changes in fair 
value recorded in earnings, while the debt continues to be 
carried at amortized cost. Therefore, current earnings are 
affected by the interest rate shifts and other factors that cause a 
change in the swap’s value, but for which no offsetting change 
in value is recorded on the debt.

Citigroup may alternatively elect to account for the debt at 

fair value under the fair value option. Once the irrevocable 
election is made upon issuance of the debt, the full change in 
fair value of the debt is reported in earnings. The changes in 
fair value of the related interest rate swap are also reflected in 
earnings, which provides a natural offset to the debt’s fair 
value change. To the extent that the two amounts differ 
because the full change in the fair value of the debt includes 

261

risks not offset by the interest rate swap, the difference is 
automatically captured in current earnings.

Additional economic hedges include hedges of the credit 
risk component of commercial loans and loan commitments. 
Citigroup periodically evaluates its hedging strategies in other 
areas and may designate either an accounting hedge or an 
economic hedge after considering the relative costs and 
benefits. Economic hedges are also employed when the 
hedged item itself is marked-to-market through current 
earnings, such as hedges of commitments to originate one- to 
four-family mortgage loans to be HFS and MSRs.

Credit Derivatives
Citi is a market maker and trades a range of credit derivatives. 
Through these contracts, Citi either purchases or writes 
protection on either a single name or a portfolio of reference 
credits. Citi also uses credit derivatives to help mitigate credit 
risk in its corporate and consumer loan portfolios and other 
cash positions and to facilitate client transactions. 

Citi monitors its counterparty credit risk in credit 
derivative contracts. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, 
approximately 98% and 99%, respectively, of the gross 
receivables are from counterparties with which Citi maintains 
master netting agreements, collateral agreements or settles 
daily. A majority of Citi’s top 15 counterparties (by receivable 
balance owed to Citi) are central clearing houses, banks, 
financial institutions or other dealers. Contracts with these 
counterparties do not include ratings-based termination events. 
However, counterparty ratings downgrades may have an 
incremental effect by lowering the threshold at which Citi may 
call for additional collateral. 

The range of credit derivatives entered into includes credit 

default swaps, total return swaps, credit options and credit-
linked notes. 

A credit default swap is a contract in which, for a fee, a 
protection seller agrees to reimburse a protection buyer for any 
losses that occur due to a predefined credit event on a 
reference entity. These credit events are defined by the terms 
of the derivative contract and the reference entity and are 
generally limited to the market standard of failure to pay on 
indebtedness and bankruptcy of the reference entity and, in a 
more limited range of transactions, debt restructuring. Credit 
derivative transactions that reference emerging market entities 
also typically include additional credit events to cover the 
acceleration of indebtedness and the risk of repudiation or a 
payment moratorium. In certain transactions, protection may 
be provided on a portfolio of reference entities or asset-backed 
securities. If there is no credit event, as defined by the specific 
derivative contract, then the protection seller makes no 
payments to the protection buyer and receives only the 
contractually specified fee. However, if a credit event occurs 
as defined in the specific derivative contract sold, the 
protection seller will be required to make a payment to the 
protection buyer. Under certain contracts, the seller of 
protection may not be required to make a payment until a 
specified amount of losses has occurred with respect to the 
portfolio and/or may only be required to pay for losses up to a 
specified amount.

A total return swap typically transfers the total economic 

performance of a reference asset, which includes all associated 

cash flows, as well as capital appreciation or depreciation. The 
protection buyer receives a floating rate of interest and any 
depreciation on the reference asset from the protection seller 
and, in return, the protection seller receives the cash flows 
associated with the reference asset plus any appreciation. 
Thus, according to the total return swap agreement, the 
protection seller will be obligated to make a payment any time 
the floating interest rate payment plus any depreciation of the 
reference asset exceeds the cash flows associated with the 
underlying asset. A total return swap may terminate upon a 
default of the reference asset or a credit event with respect to 
the reference entity, subject to the provisions of the related 
total return swap agreement between the protection seller and 
the protection buyer.

A credit option is a credit derivative that allows investors 

to trade or hedge changes in the credit quality of a reference 
entity. For example, in a credit spread option, the option writer 
assumes the obligation to purchase or sell credit protection on 
the reference entity at a specified “strike” spread level. The 
option purchaser buys the right to sell credit default protection 
on the reference entity to, or purchase it from, the option 
writer at the strike spread level. The payments on credit spread 
options depend either on a particular credit spread or the price 
of the underlying credit-sensitive asset or other reference 
entity. The options usually terminate if a credit event occurs 
with respect to the underlying reference entity. 

A credit-linked note is a form of credit derivative 
structured as a debt security with an embedded credit default 
swap. The purchaser of the note effectively provides credit 
protection to the issuer by agreeing to receive a return that 
could be negatively affected by credit events on the underlying 
reference entity. If the reference entity defaults, the note may 
be cash settled or physically settled by delivery of a debt 
security of the reference entity. Thus, the maximum amount of 
the note purchaser’s exposure is the amount paid for the 
credit-linked note.

Fair values included in the above tables are prior to 
application of any netting agreements and cash collateral. For 
notional amounts, Citi generally has a mismatch between the 
total notional amounts of protection purchased and sold, and it 
may hold the reference assets directly rather than entering into 
offsetting credit derivative contracts as and when desired. The 
open risk exposures from credit derivative contracts are 
largely matched after certain cash positions in reference assets 
are considered and after notional amounts are adjusted, either 
to a duration-based equivalent basis or to reflect the level of 
subordination in tranched structures. The ratings of the credit 
derivatives portfolio presented in the tables and used to 
evaluate payment/performance risk are based on the assigned 
internal or external ratings of the reference asset or entity. 
Where external ratings are used, investment-grade ratings are 
considered to be “Baa/BBB” and above, while anything below 
is considered non-investment grade. Citi’s internal ratings are 
in line with the related external rating system. 

Citigroup evaluates the payment/performance risk of the 

credit derivatives for which it stands as a protection seller 
based on the credit rating assigned to the underlying reference 
credit. Credit derivatives written on an underlying non-
investment-grade reference entity represent greater payment 
risk to the Company. The non-investment-grade category in 
the table above also includes credit derivatives where the 
underlying reference entity has been downgraded subsequent 
to the inception of the derivative. 

The maximum potential amount of future payments under 

credit derivative contracts presented in the table above is 
based on the notional value of the derivatives. The Company 
believes that the notional amount for credit protection sold is 
not representative of the actual loss exposure based on 
historical experience. This amount has not been reduced by the 
value of the reference assets and the related cash flows. In 
accordance with most credit derivative contracts, should a 
credit event occur, the Company usually is liable for the 
difference between the protection sold and the value of the 
reference assets. Furthermore, the notional amount for credit 
protection sold has not been reduced for any cash collateral 
paid to a given counterparty, as such payments would be 
calculated after netting all derivative exposures, including any 
credit derivatives with that counterparty in accordance with a 
related master netting agreement. Due to such netting 
processes, determining the amount of collateral that 
corresponds to credit derivative exposures alone is not 
possible. The Company actively monitors open credit-risk 
exposures and manages this exposure by using a variety of 
strategies, including purchased credit derivatives, cash 
collateral or direct holdings of the referenced assets. This risk 
mitigation activity is not captured in the table above.

Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features in Derivatives
Certain derivative instruments contain provisions that require 
the Company to either post additional collateral or 
immediately settle any outstanding liability balances upon the 
occurrence of a specified event related to the credit risk of the 
Company. These events, which are defined by the existing 
derivative contracts, are primarily downgrades in the credit 
ratings of the Company and its affiliates. 

The fair value (excluding CVA) of all derivative 
instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that 
were in a net liability position at December 31, 2022 and 2021 
was $18 billion and $19 billion, respectively. The Company 
posted $15 billion and $16 billion as collateral for this 
exposure in the normal course of business as of December 31, 
2022 and 2021, respectively.

A downgrade could trigger additional collateral or cash 

settlement requirements for the Company and certain 
affiliates. In the event that Citigroup and Citibank were 
downgraded a single notch by all three major rating agencies 
as of December 31, 2022, the Company could be required to 
post an additional $0.9 billion as either collateral or settlement 
of the derivative transactions. In addition, the Company could 
be required to segregate with third-party custodians collateral 
previously received from existing derivative counterparties in 
the amount of $15.0 million upon the single notch downgrade, 
resulting in aggregate cash obligations and collateral 
requirements of approximately $0.9 billion.

Derivatives Accompanied by Financial Asset Transfers
The Company executes total return swaps that provide it with 
synthetic exposure to substantially all of the economic return 
of the securities or other financial assets referenced in the 
contract. In certain cases, the derivative transaction is 
accompanied by the Company’s transfer of the referenced 
financial asset to the derivative counterparty, most typically in 
response to the derivative counterparty’s desire to hedge, in 
whole or in part, its synthetic exposure under the derivative 
contract by holding the referenced asset in funded form. In 
certain jurisdictions these transactions qualify as sales, 
resulting in derecognition of the securities transferred (see 
Note 1 for further discussion of the related sale conditions for 
transfers of financial assets). For a significant portion of the 
transactions, the Company has also executed another total 
return swap where the Company passes on substantially all of 
the economic return of the referenced securities to a different 
third party seeking the exposure. In those cases, the Company 
is not exposed, on a net basis, to changes in the economic 
return of the referenced securities.

These transactions generally involve the transfer of the 
Company’s liquid government bonds, convertible bonds or 
publicly traded corporate equity securities from the trading 
portfolio and are executed with third-party financial 
institutions. The accompanying derivatives are typically total 
return swaps. The derivatives are cash settled and subject to 
ongoing margin requirements.

When the conditions for sale accounting are met, the 
Company reports the transfer of the referenced financial asset 
as a sale and separately reports the accompanying derivative 
transaction. These transactions generally do not result in a gain 
or loss on the sale of the security, because the transferred 

264

security was held at fair value in the Company’s trading 
portfolio. For transfers of financial assets accounted for as a 
sale by the Company, and for which the Company has retained 
substantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred 
asset through a total return swap executed with the same 
counterparty in contemplation of the initial sale (and still 
outstanding), the asset amounts derecognized and the gross 
cash proceeds received as of the date of derecognition were 
$1.4 billion and $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 
2021, respectively. 

At December 31, 2022, the fair value of these previously 

derecognized assets was $1.4 billion. The fair value of the 
total return swaps as of December 31, 2022 was $27 million 
recorded as gross derivative assets and $32 million recorded as 
gross derivative liabilities. At December 31, 2021 the fair 
value of these previously derecognized assets was $2.9 billion, 
and the fair value of the total return swaps was $13 million 
recorded as gross derivative assets and $58 million recorded as 
gross derivative liabilities. 

The balances for the total return swaps are on a gross 

basis, before the application of counterparty and cash 
collateral netting, and are included primarily as equity 
derivatives in the tabular disclosures in this Note.

265

24.  CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK 

Concentrations of credit risk exist when changes in economic, 
industry or geographic factors similarly affect groups of 
counterparties whose aggregate credit exposure is material in 
relation to Citigroup’s total credit exposure. Although 
Citigroup’s portfolio of financial instruments is broadly 
diversified along industry, product and geographic lines, 
material transactions are completed with other financial 
institutions, particularly in the securities trading, derivatives 
and foreign exchange businesses.

In connection with the Company’s efforts to maintain a 
diversified portfolio, the Company limits its exposure to any 
one geographic region, country or individual creditor and 
monitors this exposure on a continuous basis. At 
December 31, 2022, Citigroup’s most significant 
concentration of credit risk was with the U.S. government and 
its agencies. The Company’s exposure, which primarily results 
from trading assets and investments issued by the U.S. 
government and its agencies, amounted to $431.6 billion and 
$414.5 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
The German, Japanese and United Kingdom governments and 
their agencies, which are rated investment grade by both 
Moody’s and S&P, were the next largest exposures. The 
Company’s exposure to Germany amounted to $48.3 billion 
and $48.9 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, 
respectively. The Company’s exposure to Japan amounted to 
$40.0 billion and $30.1 billion at December 31, 2022 and 
2021, respectively. The Company’s exposure to the United 
Kingdom amounted to $31.7 billion and $31.1 billion at 
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The foreign 
government exposures are composed of investment securities, 
loans and trading assets.

The Company’s exposure to states and municipalities 
amounted to $20.1 billion and $22.0 billion at December 31, 
2022 and 2021, respectively, and was composed of trading 
assets, investment securities, derivatives and lending activities.

25.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement, defines fair value, 
establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value 
and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair 
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date, and 
therefore represents an exit price. Among other things, the 
standard requires the Company to maximize the use of 
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
when measuring fair value.

Under ASC 820-10, the probability of counterparty 
default is factored into the valuation of derivative and other 
positions, and the impact of Citigroup’s own credit risk is also 
factored into the valuation of derivatives and other liabilities 
that are measured at fair value.

Fair Value Hierarchy
ASC 820-10 specifies a hierarchy of inputs based on whether 
the inputs are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs 
are developed using market data and reflect market participant 
assumptions, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s 
market assumptions. These two types of inputs have created 
the following fair value hierarchy:

•

•

•

Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active 
markets.
Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active 
markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments 
in markets that are not active and model-derived 
valuations in which all significant inputs and significant 
value drivers are observable in the market.
Level 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in 
which one or more significant inputs or significant value 
drivers are unobservable.

As required under the fair value hierarchy, the Company 

considers relevant and observable market inputs in its 
valuations where possible. 

The fair value hierarchy classification approach typically 

utilizes rules-based and data-driven selection criteria to 
determine whether an instrument is classified as Level 1, 
Level 2 or Level 3:

•

•

•

The determination of whether an instrument is quoted in 
an active market and therefore considered a Level 1 
instrument is based upon the frequency of observed 
transactions and the quality of independent market data 
available on the measurement date. 
A Level 2 classification is assigned where there is 
observability of prices/market inputs to models, or where 
any unobservable inputs are not significant to the 
valuation. The determination of whether an input is 
considered observable is based on the availability of 
independent market data and its corroboration, for 
example through observed transactions in the market.
Otherwise, an instrument is classified as Level 3.

Determination of Fair Value
For assets and liabilities carried at fair value, the Company 
measures fair value using the procedures set out below, 
irrespective of whether the assets and liabilities are measured 
at fair value as a result of an election, a non-recurring lower-
of-cost-or-market (LOCOM) adjustment, or because they are 
required to be measured at fair value.

When available, the Company uses quoted market prices 
from active markets to determine fair value and classifies such 
items as Level 1. In some specific cases where a market price 
is available, the Company will apply practical expedients 
(such as matrix pricing) to calculate fair value, in which case 
the items may be classified as Level 2.

The Company may also apply a price-based methodology 

that utilizes, where available, quoted prices or other market 
information obtained from recent trading activity in positions 
with the same or similar characteristics to the position being 
valued. If relevant and observable prices are available, those 
valuations may be classified as Level 2. However, when there 
are one or more significant unobservable “price” inputs, those 
valuations will be classified as Level 3. Furthermore, when a 
quoted price is considered stale, a significant adjustment to the 
price of a similar security may be necessary to reflect 
differences in the terms of the actual security or loan being 
valued, or alternatively, when prices from independent sources 
may be insufficient to corroborate a valuation, the “price” 
inputs are considered unobservable and the fair value 
measurements are classified as Level 3.

If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is 
based upon internally developed valuation techniques that use, 
where possible, current market-based parameters, such as 
interest rates, currency rates and option volatilities. Items 
valued using such internally generated valuation techniques 
are classified according to the lowest level input or value 
driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be 
classified as Level 3 even though there may be some 
significant inputs that are readily observable.

Fair value estimates from internal valuation techniques 

are verified, where possible, to prices obtained from 
independent vendors or brokers. Vendors’ and brokers’ 
valuations may be based on a variety of inputs ranging from 
observed prices to proprietary valuation models, and the 
Company assesses the quality and relevance of this 
information in determining the estimate of fair value. The 
following section describes the valuation methodologies used 
by the Company to measure various financial instruments at 
fair value. Where appropriate, the description includes details 
of the valuation models, the key inputs to those models and 
any significant assumptions.

Market Valuation Adjustments
Generally, the unit of account for a financial instrument is the 
individual financial instrument. The Company applies market 
valuation adjustments that are consistent with the unit of 
account, which does not include adjustment due to the size of 
the Company’s position, except as follows. ASC 820-10 
permits an exception, through an accounting policy election, to 
measure the fair value of a portfolio of financial assets and 
financial liabilities on the basis of the net open risk position 
when certain criteria are met. Citi has elected to measure 

267

certain portfolios of financial instruments that meet those 
criteria, such as derivatives, on the basis of the net open risk 
position. The Company applies market valuation adjustments, 
including adjustments to account for the size of the net open 
risk position, consistent with market participant assumptions.
Valuation adjustments are applied to items classified as 
Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy to ensure that the 
fair value reflects the price at which the net open risk position 
could be exited. These valuation adjustments are based on the 
bid/offer spread for an instrument in the market. When Citi 
has elected to measure certain portfolios of financial 
investments, such as derivatives, on the basis of the net open 
risk position, the valuation adjustment may take into account 
the size of the position.

Credit valuation adjustments (CVA) and funding 
valuation adjustments (FVA) are applied to the relevant 
population of over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instruments 
where adjustments to reflect counterparty credit risk, own 
credit risk and term funding risk are required to estimate fair 
value. This principally includes derivatives with a base 
valuation (e.g., discounted using overnight indexed swap 
(OIS)) requiring adjustment for these effects, such as 
uncollateralized interest rate swaps. The CVA represents a 
portfolio-level adjustment to reflect the risk premium 
associated with the counterparty’s (assets) or Citi’s (liabilities) 
non-performance risk. 

expected future cash flows determined in step one. Citi’s 
own credit CVA is determined using Citi-specific CDS 
spreads for the relevant tenor. Generally, counterparty 
CVA is determined using CDS spread indices for each 
credit rating and tenor. For certain identified netting sets 
where individual analysis is practicable (e.g., exposures to 
counterparties with liquid CDSs), counterparty-specific 
CDS spreads are used. For FVA, a term structure of 
spreads is applied to the expected funding exposures (e.g., 
the market liquidity spread used to represent the term 
funding premium associated with certain OTC 
derivatives).

The CVA and FVA are designed to incorporate a market 

view of the credit and funding risk, respectively, inherent in 
the derivative portfolio. However, most unsecured derivative 
instruments are negotiated bilateral contracts and are not 
commonly transferred to third parties. Derivative instruments 
are normally settled contractually or, if terminated early, are 
terminated at a value negotiated bilaterally between the 
counterparties. Thus, the CVA and FVA may not be realized 
upon a settlement or termination in the normal course of 
business. In addition, all or a portion of these adjustments may 
be reversed or otherwise adjusted in future periods in the event 
of changes in the credit or funding risk associated with the 
derivative instruments.

The FVA represents a market funding risk premium

to the fair value of derivative instruments at December 31,

inherent in the uncollateralized portion of a derivative 
portfolio and in certain collateralized derivative portfolios that 
do not include standard credit support annexes (CSAs), such 
as where the CSA does not permit the reuse of collateral 
received. Citi’s FVA methodology leverages the existing CVA 
methodology to estimate a funding exposure profile. The 
calculation of this exposure profile considers collateral 
agreements in which the terms do not permit the Company to 
reuse the collateral received, including where counterparties 
post collateral to third-party custodians. Citi’s CVA and FVA 
methodologies consist of two steps: 

•

•

First, the exposure profile for each counterparty is 
determined using the terms of all individual derivative 
positions and a Monte Carlo simulation or other 
quantitative analysis to generate a series of expected cash 
flows at future points in time. The calculation of this 
exposure profile considers the effect of credit risk 
mitigants and sources of funding, including pledged cash 
or other collateral and any legal right of offset that exists 
with a counterparty through arrangements such as netting 
agreements. Individual derivative contracts that are 
subject to an enforceable master netting agreement with a 
counterparty are aggregated as a netting set for this 
purpose, since it is those aggregate net cash flows that are 
subject to nonperformance risk. This process identifies 
specific, point-in-time future cash flows that are subject to 
nonperformance and term funding risk, rather than using 
the current recognized net asset or liability as a basis to 
measure the CVA and FVA. 
Second, for CVA, market-based views of default 
probabilities derived from observed credit spreads in the 
credit default swap (CDS) market are applied to the

Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and 
Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase
No quoted prices exist for these instruments, since fair value is 
determined using a discounted cash flow technique. Cash 
flows are estimated based on the terms of the contract, taking 
into account any embedded derivatives or other features. 
These cash flows are discounted using interest rates 
appropriate to the maturity of the instrument as well as the 
nature of the underlying collateral. Generally, when such 
instruments are recorded at fair value, they are classified 
within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, as the inputs used in 
the valuation are readily observable. However, certain long-
dated positions are classified within Level 3 of the fair value 
hierarchy.

Trading Account Assets and Liabilities—Trading Securities 
and Trading Loans
When available, the Company uses quoted market prices in 
active markets to determine the fair value of trading securities; 
such items are classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 
Examples include government securities and exchange-traded 
equity securities.

For bonds and secondary market loans traded over the 
counter, the Company generally determines fair value utilizing 
various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows, 
price-based and internal models. Fair value estimates from 
these internal valuation techniques are verified, where 
possible, to prices obtained from independent sources, 
including third-party vendors. A price-based methodology 
utilizes, where available, quoted prices or other market 
information obtained from recent trading activity of assets 
with similar characteristics to the bond or loan being valued. 
The yields used in discounted cash flow models are derived 
from the same price information. Trading securities and loans 
priced using such methods are generally classified as Level 2. 
However, when the primary inputs to the valuation are 
unobservable, or prices from independent sources are 
insufficient to corroborate valuation, a loan or security is 

269

generally classified as Level 3. Fair value estimates from these 
internal valuation techniques are verified, where possible, to 
prices obtained from independent sources, including third-
party vendors. 

When the Company’s principal exit market for a portfolio 

of loans is through securitization, the Company uses the 
securitization price as a key input into the fair value of the 
loan portfolio. The securitization price is determined from the 
assumed proceeds of a hypothetical securitization within the 
current market environment. Where such a price verification is 
possible, loan portfolios are typically classified as Level 2 in 
the fair value hierarchy.

For most of the subprime mortgage backed security 
(MBS) exposures, fair value is determined utilizing observable 
transactions where available, or other valuation techniques 
such as discounted cash flow analysis utilizing valuation 
assumptions derived from similar, more observable securities 
as market proxies. The valuation of certain asset-backed 
security (ABS) CDO positions is inferred through the net asset 
value of the underlying assets of the ABS CDO. 

Trading Account Assets and Liabilities—Derivatives
Exchange-traded derivatives, measured at fair value using 
quoted (i.e., exchange) prices in active markets, where 
available, are classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

Derivatives without a quoted price in an active market and 
derivatives executed over the counter are valued using internal 
valuation techniques. These derivative instruments are 
classified as either Level 2 or Level 3 depending on the 
observability of the significant inputs to the model.

The valuation techniques depend on the type of derivative 

and the nature of the underlying instrument. The principal 
techniques used to value these instruments are discounted cash 
flows and internal models, such as derivative pricing models 
(e.g., Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo simulations). 

The key inputs depend upon the type of derivative and the 

nature of the underlying instrument and include interest rate 
yield curves, foreign exchange rates, volatilities and 
correlation. 

Investments
The investments category includes available-for-sale debt and 
marketable equity securities whose fair values are generally 
determined by utilizing similar procedures described for 
trading securities above or, in some cases, using vendor 
pricing as the primary source.

Also included in investments are nonpublic investments in 

private equity and real estate entities. Determining the fair 
value of nonpublic securities involves a significant degree of 
management judgment, as no quoted prices exist and such 
securities are not generally traded. In addition, there may be 
transfer restrictions on private equity securities. The 
Company’s process for determining the fair value of such 
securities utilizes commonly accepted valuation techniques, 
including guideline public company analysis and comparable 
transactions. In determining the fair value of nonpublic 
securities, the Company also considers events such as a 
proposed sale of the investee company, initial public offerings, 
equity issuances or other observable transactions. Private 

 
 
 
 
equity securities are generally classified as Level 3 of the fair 
value hierarchy.

In addition, the Company holds investments in certain 
alternative investment funds that calculate NAV per share, 
including hedge funds, private equity funds and real estate 
funds. Investments in funds are generally classified as non-
marketable equity securities carried at fair value. The fair 
values of these investments are estimated using the NAV per 
share of the Company’s ownership interest in the funds where 
it is not probable that the investment will be realized at a price 
other than the NAV. Consistent with the provisions of ASU 
2015-07, these investments are categorized within the fair 
value hierarchy and are not included in the tables below. See 
Note 13 for additional information.

Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt
Where fair value accounting has been elected, the fair value of 
non-structured liabilities is determined by utilizing internal 
models using the appropriate discount rate for the applicable 
maturity. Such instruments are classified as Level 2 of the fair 
value hierarchy when all significant inputs are readily 
observable.

The Company determines the fair value of hybrid 

financial instruments, including structured liabilities, using the 
appropriate derivative valuation methodology (described 
above in “Trading Account Assets and Liabilities—
Derivatives”) given the nature of the embedded risk profile. 
Such instruments are classified as Level 2 or Level 3 
depending on the observability of significant inputs to the 
model.

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
The following tables present for each of the fair value 
hierarchy levels the Company’s assets and liabilities that are

instruments (hedging instruments) that may be classified as 
Level 3, but also with financial instruments classified as 
Level 1 or Level 2. The effects of these hedges are presented

Includes positions related to investments in unallocated precious metals, as discussed in Note 26. Also includes physical commodities accounted for at the lower

(3) Amounts exclude $27 million of investments measured at net asset value (NAV) in accordance with ASU 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): 

Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent).

(4) Because the amount of the cash collateral paid/received has not been allocated to the Level 1, 2 and 3 subtotals, these percentages are calculated based on total

Changes in Level 3 Fair Value Category
The following tables present the changes in the Level 3 fair 
value category for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 
2021. The gains and losses presented below include changes in 
the fair value related to both observable and unobservable 
inputs.

The Company often hedges positions with offsetting 
positions that are classified in a different level. For example, 

the gains and losses for assets and liabilities in the Level 3 
category presented in the tables below do not reflect the effect 
of offsetting losses and gains on hedging instruments that may 
be classified in the Level 1 and Level 2 categories. In addition, 
the Company hedges items classified in the Level 3 category 
with instruments also classified in Level 3 of the fair value 
hierarchy. The hedged items and related hedges are presented 
gross in the following tables:

of available-for-sale debt securities are recorded in AOCI, unless related to credit impairment, while gains and losses from sales are recorded in Realized gains 
(losses) from sales of investments in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

(2) Unrealized gains (losses) on MSRs are recorded in Other revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
(3) Represents the amount of total gains or losses for the period, included in earnings (and AOCI for changes in fair value of available-for-sale debt securities and 

DVA on fair value option liabilities), attributable to the change in fair value relating to assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 that are still held at December 31, 
2021.

(4) Total Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities have been netted in these tables for presentation purposes only.

Level 3 Fair Value Transfers 
The following were the significant Level 3 transfers for the 
period December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022:

• During the 12 months ended December 31, 2022, transfers 
of Long-term debt were $9.9 billion from Level 2 to Level 
3. Of the $9.9 billion transfer in, approximately $7.0 billion 
related to interest rate option volatility inputs becoming 
unobservable and/or significant relative to their overall 
valuation, and $2.9 billion related to equity and credit 
derivative inputs (in addition to other volatility inputs, e.g., 
interest rate volatility inputs) becoming unobservable and/
or significant to their overall valuation. In other instances, 
market changes have resulted in some inputs becoming 
more observable, and some unobservable inputs becoming 
less significant to the overall valuation of the instruments 
(e.g., when an option becomes deep-in or deep-out of the 
money). This has resulted in $7.6 billion of certain 
structured long-term debt products being transferred from 
Level 3 to Level 2 during the 12 months ended 
December 31, 2022.

The following were the significant Level 3 transfers for the 
period December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021:

• During the 12 months ended December 31, 2021, transfers 
of Loans of $2.1 billion from Level 3 to Level 2 were 
primarily driven by equity forward and volatility inputs 
that have been assessed as not significant to the overall 
valuation of certain hybrid loan instruments, including 
equity options and long dated equity call spreads.

• During the 12 months ended December 31, 2021, transfers 
of Equity contracts of $1.1 billion from Level 2 to Level 3 
were due to equity forward and volatility inputs becoming 
an unobservable and/or significant input relative to the 
overall valuation of equity options and equity swaps. In 
other instances, market changes have resulted in 
observable equity forward and volatility inputs becoming 
an insignificant input to the overall valuation of the 
instrument (e.g., when an option becomes deep-in or deep-
out of the money). This has resulted in $1.9 billion of 
certain equity contracts being transferred from Level 3 to 
Level 2.

• During the 12 months ended December 31, 2021, transfers 
of Long-term debt were $8.6 billion from Level 2 to Level 
3. Of the $8.6 billion transfer in, approximately $7.2 billion 
related to interest rate option volatility inputs becoming 
unobservable and/or significant relative to their overall 
valuation, and $1.0 billion related to equity volatility inputs 
(in addition to other volatility inputs, e.g., interest rate 
volatility inputs) becoming unobservable and/or significant 
to their overall valuation. In other instances, market 
changes have resulted in some inputs becoming more 
observable, and some unobservable inputs becoming less 
significant to the overall valuation of the instruments (e.g., 
when an option becomes deep-in or deep-out of the 
money). This has resulted in $9.8 billion of certain 
structured long-term debt products being transferred from 
Level 3 to Level 2 during the 12 months ended 
December 31, 2021.

Valuation Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair 
Value Measurements
The Company’s Level 3 inventory consists of both cash 
instruments and derivatives of varying complexity.

The following tables present the valuation techniques 

covering the majority of Level 3 inventory and the most 
significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value 
measurements. Methodologies are applied consistently. 
Changes in listed inputs period versus period represent 

variables that become more, or less, significant, hence their 
addition or removal from the table below. Differences between 
this table and amounts presented in the Level 3 Fair Value 
Rollforward table above represent individually immaterial 
items that have been measured using a variety of valuation 
techniques other than those listed.

Uncertainty of Fair Value Measurements Relating to 
Unobservable Inputs
Valuation uncertainty arises when there is insufficient or 
dispersed market data to allow a precise determination of the 
exit value of a fair-valued position or portfolio in today’s 
market. This is especially prevalent in Level 3 fair value 
instruments, where uncertainty exists in valuation inputs that 
may be both unobservable and significant to the instrument’s 
(or portfolio’s) overall fair value measurement. The 
uncertainties associated with key unobservable inputs on the 
Level 3 fair value measurements may not be independent of 
one another. In addition, the amount and direction of the 
uncertainty on a fair value measurement for a given change in 
an unobservable input depends on the nature of the instrument 
as well as whether the Company holds the instrument as an 
asset or a liability. For certain instruments, the pricing, 
hedging and risk management are sensitive to the correlation 
between various inputs rather than on the analysis and 
aggregation of the individual inputs.

The following section describes some of the most 
significant unobservable inputs used by the Company in 
Level 3 fair value measurements.

Correlation
Correlation is a measure of the extent to which two or more 
variables change in relation to each other. A variety of 
correlation-related assumptions are required for a wide range 
of instruments, including equity and credit baskets, foreign 
exchange options, Credit Index Tranches and many other 
instruments. For almost all of these instruments, correlations 
are not directly observable in the market and must be 
calculated using alternative sources, including historical 
information. Estimating correlation can be especially difficult 
where it may vary over time, and calculating correlation 
information from market data requires significant assumptions 
regarding the informational efficiency of the market (e.g., 
swaption markets). Uncertainty therefore exists when an 
estimate of the appropriate level of correlation as an input into 
some fair value measurements is required.

Changes in correlation levels can have a substantial 

impact, favorable or unfavorable, on the value of an 
instrument, depending on its nature. A change in the default 
correlation of the fair value of the underlying bonds 
comprising a CDO structure would affect the fair value of the 
senior tranche. For example, an increase in the default 
correlation of the underlying bonds would reduce the fair 
value of the senior tranche, because highly correlated 
instruments produce greater losses in the event of default and a 
portion of these losses would become attributable to the senior 
tranche. That same change in default correlation would have a 
different impact on junior tranches of the same structure.

Volatility
Volatility represents the speed and severity of market price 
changes and is a key factor in pricing options. Volatility 
generally depends on the tenor of the underlying instrument 
and the strike price or level defined in the contract. Volatilities 
for certain combinations of tenor and strike are not observable 
and need to be estimated using alternative methods, such as 
comparable instruments, historical analysis or other sources of 

282

market information. This leads to uncertainty around the final 
fair value measurement of instruments with unobservable 
volatilities. 

The general relationship between changes in the value of 

an instrument (or a portfolio) to changes in volatility also 
depends on changes in interest rates and the level of the 
underlying index. Generally, long option positions (assets) 
benefit from increases in volatility, whereas short option 
positions (liabilities) will suffer losses. Some instruments are 
more sensitive to changes in volatility than others. For 
example, an at-the-money option would experience a greater 
percentage change in its fair value than a deep-in-the-money 
option. In addition, the fair value of an option with more than 
one underlying security (e.g., an option on a basket of 
equities) depends on the volatility of the individual underlying 
securities as well as their correlations.

Yield
In some circumstances, the yield of an instrument is not 
observable in the market and must be estimated from historical 
data or from yields of similar securities. This estimated yield 
may need to be adjusted to capture the characteristics of the 
security being valued. Whenever the amount of the adjustment 
is significant to the value of the security, the fair value 
measurement is classified as Level 3.

Adjusted yield is generally used to discount the projected 
future principal and interest cash flows on instruments, such as 
asset-backed securities. Adjusted yield is impacted by changes 
in the interest rate environment and relevant credit spreads. 

Prepayment
Voluntary unscheduled payments (prepayments) change the 
future cash flows for the investor and thereby change the fair 
value of the security. The effect of prepayments is more 
pronounced for residential mortgage-backed securities. 
Prepayment is generally negatively correlated with 
delinquency and interest rate. A combination of low 
prepayments and high delinquencies amplifies each input’s 
negative impact on a mortgage security’s valuation. As 
prepayment speeds change, the weighted average life of the 
security changes, which impacts the valuation either positively 
or negatively, depending upon the nature of the security and 
the direction of the change in the weighted average life.

Recovery
Recovery is the proportion of the total outstanding balance of 
a bond or loan that is expected to be collected in a liquidation 
scenario. For many credit securities (e.g., commercial 
mortgage-backed securities), the expected recovery amount of 
a defaulted property is typically unknown until a liquidation of 
the property is imminent. The assumed recovery of a security 
may differ from its actual recovery that will be observable in 
the future. Generally, an increase in the recovery rate 
assumption increases the fair value of the security. An increase 
in loss severity, the inverse of the recovery rate, reduces the 
amount of principal available for distribution and, as a result, 
decreases the fair value of the security.

The fair value of loans HFS is determined where possible 
using quoted secondary-market prices. If no such quoted price 
exists, the fair value of a loan is determined using quoted 
prices for a similar asset or assets, adjusted for the specific 
attributes of that loan. Fair value for the other real estate 
owned is based on appraisals. For loans whose carrying 
amount is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, 
the fair values depend on the type of collateral. Fair value of 
the collateral is typically estimated based on quoted market 
prices if available, appraisals or other internal valuation 
techniques.

Where the fair value of the related collateral is based on 
an appraised value, the loan is generally classified as Level 3. 
In addition, for corporate loans, appraisals of the collateral are 
often based on sales of similar assets; however, because the 
prices of similar assets require significant adjustments to 
reflect the unique features of the underlying collateral, these 
fair value measurements are generally classified as Level 3.

The fair value of non-marketable equity securities under 
the measurement alternative is based on observed transaction 
prices for the identical or similar investment of the same 
issuer, or an internal valuation technique in the case of an 
impairment. Where there are insufficient market observations 
to conclude the inputs are observable, where significant 
adjustments are made to the observed transaction prices or 
when an internal valuation technique is used, the security is 
classified as Level 3. Fair value may differ from the observed 
transaction price due to a number of factors, including 
marketability adjustments and differences in rights and 
obligations when the observed transaction is not for the 
identical investment held by Citi.

Credit Spread
Credit spread is a component of the security representing its 
credit quality. Credit spread reflects the market perception of 
changes in prepayment, delinquency and recovery rates, 
therefore capturing the impact of other variables on the fair 
value. Changes in credit spread affect the fair value of 
securities differently depending on the characteristics and 
maturity profile of the security. For example, credit spread is a 
more significant driver of the fair value measurement of a 
high-yield bond as compared to an investment-grade bond. 
Generally, the credit spread for an investment-grade bond is 
also more observable and less volatile than its high-yield 
counterpart.

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a 
nonrecurring basis and, therefore, are not included in the 
tables above. These include assets measured at cost that have 
been written down to fair value during the periods as a result 
of an impairment. These also include non-marketable equity 
securities that have been measured using the measurement 
alternative and are either (i) written down to fair value during 
the periods as a result of an impairment or (ii) adjusted upward 
or downward to fair value as a result of a transaction observed 
during the periods for an identical or similar investment in the 
same issuer. In addition, these assets include loans held-for-
sale and other real estate owned that are measured at the lower 
of cost or market value.

Estimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments Not 
Carried at Fair Value
The following tables present the carrying value and fair value 
of Citigroup’s financial instruments that are not carried at fair 
value. The tables below therefore exclude items measured at 
fair value on a recurring basis presented in the tables above.

The disclosure also excludes leases, affiliate investments, 

pension and benefit obligations, certain insurance contracts 
and tax-related items. Also, as required, the disclosure 
excludes the effect of taxes, any premium or discount that 
could result from offering for sale at one time the entire 
holdings of a particular instrument, excess fair value 

associated with deposits with no fixed maturity and other 
expenses that would be incurred in a market transaction. In 
addition, the tables exclude the values of non-financial assets 
and liabilities, as well as a wide range of franchise, 
relationship and intangible values, which are integral to a full 
assessment of Citigroup’s financial position and the value of 
its net assets. 

Fair values vary from period to period based on changes 

in a wide range of factors, including interest rates, credit 
quality and market perceptions of value, and as existing assets 
and liabilities run off and new transactions are entered into.

Includes brokerage payables, separate and variable accounts, short-term borrowings (carried at cost) and other financial instruments included in Other liabilities 
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, for all of which the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

The estimated fair values of the Company’s corporate 
unfunded lending commitments at December 31, 2022 and 
2021 were off-balance sheet liabilities of $13.7 billion and 
$8.1 billion, respectively, substantially all of which are 
classified as Level 3. The Company does not estimate the fair 
values of consumer unfunded lending commitments, which are 
generally cancellable by providing notice to the borrower.

26.  FAIR VALUE ELECTIONS

The Company may elect to report most financial instruments 
and certain other items at fair value on an instrument-by-
instrument basis with changes in fair value reported in 
earnings, other than DVA (see below). The election is made 
upon the initial recognition of an eligible financial asset, 
financial liability or firm commitment or when certain 
specified reconsideration events occur. The fair value election 

may not otherwise be revoked once an election is made. The 
changes in fair value are recorded in current earnings. 
Movements in DVA are reported as a component of AOCI. 
Additional discussion regarding the applicable areas in which 
fair value elections were made is presented in Note 25.

The Company has elected fair value accounting for its 
mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). See Note 22 for additional 
details on Citi’s MSRs.

The following table presents the changes in fair value of those items for which the fair value option has been elected:

Own Debt Valuation Adjustments (DVA)
Own debt valuation adjustments are recognized on Citi’s 
liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected 
using Citi’s credit spreads observed in the bond market. 
Changes in fair value of fair value option liabilities related to 
changes in Citigroup’s own credit spreads (DVA) are reflected 
as a component of AOCI. See Note 20 for additional 
information. 

Among other variables, the fair value of liabilities for 
which the fair value option has been elected (other than non-
recourse debt and similar liabilities) is impacted by the 
narrowing or widening of the Company’s credit spreads. 
The estimated changes in the fair value of these non-
derivative liabilities due to such changes in the Company’s 
own credit spread (or instrument-specific credit risk) were a 
gain of $2,685 million and $296 million for the years ended 
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Changes in fair 
value resulting from changes in instrument-specific credit risk 
were estimated by incorporating the Company’s current credit 
spreads observable in the bond market into the relevant 
valuation technique used to value each liability as described 
above.

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial 
Liabilities

Selected Portfolios of Securities Purchased Under 
Agreements to Resell, Securities Borrowed, Securities Sold 
Under Agreements to Repurchase, Securities Loaned and 
Certain Uncollateralized Short-Term Borrowings
The Company elected the fair value option for certain 
portfolios of fixed income securities purchased under 
agreements to resell and fixed income securities sold under 

agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed, securities 
loaned and certain uncollateralized short-term borrowings held 
primarily by broker-dealer entities in the United States, the 
United Kingdom and Japan. In each case, the election was 
made because the related interest rate risk is managed on a 
portfolio basis, primarily with offsetting derivative 
instruments that are accounted for at fair value through 
earnings. 

Changes in fair value for transactions in these portfolios 

are recorded in Principal transactions. The related interest 
revenue and interest expense are measured based on the 
contractual rates specified in the transactions and are reported 
as Interest revenue and Interest expense in the Consolidated 
Statement of Income.

Certain Loans and Other Credit Products
Citigroup has also elected the fair value option for certain 
other originated and purchased loans, including certain 
unfunded loan products, such as guarantees and letters of 
credit, executed by Citigroup’s lending and trading businesses. 
None of these credit products are highly leveraged financing 
commitments. Significant groups of transactions include loans 
and unfunded loan products that are expected to be either sold 
or securitized in the near term, or transactions where the 
economic risks are hedged with derivative instruments, such 
as purchased credit default swaps or total return swaps where 
the Company pays the total return on the underlying loans to a 
third party. Citigroup has elected the fair value option to 
mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge 
accounting is complex and to achieve operational 
simplifications. Fair value was not elected for most lending 
transactions across the Company.

In addition to the amounts reported above, $729 million

credit products selected for fair value accounting were 
outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Certain Investments in Private Equity and Real Estate 
Ventures 
Citigroup invests in private equity and real estate ventures for 
the purpose of earning investment returns and for capital 
appreciation. The Company has elected the fair value option 
for certain of these ventures, because such investments are 
considered similar to many private equity or hedge fund 
activities in Citi’s investment companies, which are reported 
at fair value. The fair value option brings consistency in the 
accounting and evaluation of these investments. All 
investments (debt and equity) in such private equity and real 
estate entities are accounted for at fair value. These 
investments are classified as Investments on Citigroup’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Changes in the fair values of these investments are 
classified in Other revenue in the Company’s Consolidated 
Statement of Income.

Certain Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale (HFS)
Citigroup has elected the fair value option for certain 
purchased and originated prime fixed-rate and conforming 
adjustable-rate first mortgage loans HFS. These loans are 
intended for sale or securitization and are hedged with 
derivative instruments. The Company has elected the fair 
value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where 
hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational 
simplifications.

Changes in the fair value of funded and unfunded credit 

products are classified in Principal transactions in Citi’s 
Consolidated Statement of Income. Related interest revenue is 
measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported 
as Interest revenue on Trading account assets or loan interest 
depending on the balance sheet classifications of the credit 
products. The changes in fair value for the years ended 
December 31, 2022 and 2021 due to instrument-specific credit 
risk totaled to losses of $155 million and $21 million, 
respectively. Changes in fair value due to instrument-specific 
credit risk are estimated based on changes in borrower-specific 
credit spreads and recovery assumptions.

Certain Investments in Unallocated Precious Metals
Citigroup invests in unallocated precious metals accounts 
(e.g., gold, silver, platinum and palladium) as part of its 
commodity and foreign currency trading activities or to 
economically hedge certain exposures from issuing structured 
liabilities. Under ASC 815, the investment is bifurcated into a 
debt host contract and a commodity forward derivative 
instrument. Citigroup elects the fair value option for the debt 
host contract, and reports the debt host contract within Trading 
account assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
The total carrying amount of debt host contracts across 
unallocated precious metals accounts was approximately $0.3 
billion and $0.3 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, 
respectively. The amounts are expected to fluctuate based on 
trading activity in future periods.

As part of its commodity and foreign currency trading 
activities, Citi trades unallocated precious metals investments 
and executes forward purchase and forward sale derivative 
contracts with trading counterparties. When Citi sells an 
unallocated precious metals investment, Citi’s receivable from 
its depository bank is repaid and Citi derecognizes its 
investment in the unallocated precious metal. The forward 
purchase or sale contract with the trading counterparty indexed 
to unallocated precious metals is accounted for as a derivative, 
at fair value through earnings. As of December 31, 2022, there 
were approximately $18.6 billion and $10.8 billion of notional 
amounts of such forward purchase and forward sale derivative 
contracts outstanding, respectively.

The changes in the fair values of these mortgage loans are 

reported in Other revenue in the Company’s Consolidated 
Statement of Income. There was no net change in fair value 
during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 due to 
instrument-specific credit risk. Changes in fair value due to 
instrument-specific credit risk are estimated based on changes 

in the borrower default, prepayment and recovery forecasts in 
addition to instrument-specific credit spread. Related interest 
income continues to be measured based on the contractual 
interest rates and reported as Interest revenue in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income.

288

 
 
 
Certain Debt Liabilities
The Company has elected the fair value option for certain debt 
liabilities, because these exposures are considered to be 
trading-related positions and, therefore, are managed on a fair 
value basis. These positions are classified as Long-term debt 
on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The portion of the changes in fair value attributable to 
changes in Citigroup’s own credit spreads (DVA) is reflected 
as a component of AOCI while all other changes in fair value 
are reported in Principal transactions. Changes in the fair 
value of these liabilities include accrued interest, which is also 
included in the change in fair value reported in Principal 
transactions.

Certain Non-Structured Liabilities
The Company has elected the fair value option for certain non-
structured liabilities with fixed and floating interest rates. The 
Company has elected the fair value option where the interest 
rate risk of such liabilities may be economically hedged with 
derivative contracts or the proceeds are used to purchase 

financial assets that will also be accounted for at fair value 
through earnings. The elections have been made to mitigate 
accounting mismatches and to achieve operational 
simplifications. These positions are reported in Short-term 
borrowings and Long-term debt on the Company’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. The portion of the changes in fair 
value attributable to changes in Citigroup’s own credit spreads 
(i.e., DVA) is reflected as a component of AOCI while all 
other changes in fair value are reported in Principal 
transactions.

Interest expense on non-structured liabilities is measured 
based on the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest 
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
