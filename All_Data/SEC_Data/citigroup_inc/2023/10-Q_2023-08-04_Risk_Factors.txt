End-of-period loans increased 1% year-over-year, as 
growth in PBWM, reflecting an increase in U.S. Personal 
Banking, was largely offset by declines in ICG and Legacy 
Franchises. End-of-period loans increased 1% sequentially. 

MANAGING GLOBAL RISK

For Citi, effective risk management is of primary importance 
to its overall operations. Accordingly, Citi’s risk management 
process has been designed to monitor, evaluate and manage 
the principal risks it assumes in conducting its activities. 
Specifically, the activities that Citi engages in, and the risks 
those activities generate, must be consistent with Citi’s 
Mission and Value Proposition and the key Leadership 
Principles that support it, as well as Citi’s risk appetite. For 
more information on managing global risk at Citi, see 
“Managing Global Risk” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

CREDIT RISK

For more information on credit risk, including Citi’s credit risk 
management, measurement and stress testing, and Citi’s 
consumer and corporate credit portfolios, see “Credit Risk” 
and “Risk Factors” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

(1) See footnote 2 to the table in “Credit Risk—Consumer Credit—

Consumer Credit Portfolio” below.

Citi’s loan portfolio is well diversified across consumer 
and corporate loans, with an aggregate duration of 1.2 years, 
as a majority of loans are at variable rates.

On an average basis, loans were largely unchanged year-
over-year and sequentially as growth in PBWM was offset by a 
decline in ICG and Legacy Franchises. PBWM average loans 
increased 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by loan growth 
in cards, mortgages and installment lending. ICG average 
loans decreased 6% year-over-year, reflecting actions taken to 
reduce RWA. Legacy Franchises average loans decreased 
14%, primarily reflecting the impact of the continued wind-
downs, particularly in Korea, partially offset by higher lending 
volumes in Mexico Consumer. 

     36

Portfolio Mix—Geography and Counterparty
Citi’s corporate credit portfolio is diverse across geography 
and counterparty. The following table presents the percentage 
of this portfolio by region based on Citi’s internal 
management geography:

The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings 
across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison 
of credit exposure across all lines of business, geographic 
regions and products. Counterparty risk ratings reflect an 
estimated probability of default for a counterparty, and 
internal risk ratings are derived by leveraging validated 
statistical models and scorecards in combination with 
consideration of factors specific to the obligor or market, such 
as management experience, competitive position, regulatory 
environment and commodity prices. Facility risk ratings are 
assigned that reflect the probability of default of the obligor 
and factors that affect the loss given default of the facility, 
such as support or collateral. Internal obligor ratings that 
generally correspond to BBB and above are considered 
investment grade, while those below are considered non-
investment grade.

The following table presents the corporate credit portfolio 

by facility risk rating as a percentage of the total corporate 
credit portfolio:

Note: Total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending 
commitments. 

In addition to the obligor and facility risk ratings assigned 

to all exposures, Citi may classify exposures in the corporate 
credit portfolio. These classifications are consistent with Citi’s 
interpretation of the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of 
criticized exposures, which may categorize exposures as 
special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss.

Risk ratings and classifications are reviewed regularly and 
adjusted as appropriate. The credit review process incorporates 
quantitative and qualitative factors, including financial and 
non-financial disclosures or metrics, idiosyncratic events or 
changes to the competitive, regulatory or macroeconomic 
environment. 

Citi believes the corporate credit portfolio to be 

appropriately rated and classified as of June 30, 2023. Citi has 
taken action to adjust internal ratings and classifications of 
exposures as both the macroeconomic environment and 
obligor-specific factors have changed, particularly where 
additional stress has been seen. 

     37                                                                                                                                                                                                            

     
 
 
 
 
As obligor risk ratings are downgraded, the probability of 

default increases. Downgrades of obligor risk ratings tend to 
result in a higher provision for credit losses. In addition, 
appetite per obligor is reduced consistent with the ratings, and 
downgrades may result in the purchase of additional credit 
derivatives or other risk/structural mitigants to hedge the 
incremental credit risk, or may result in Citi’s seeking to 
reduce exposure to an obligor or an industry sector. Citi will 
continue to review exposures to ensure that the appropriate 
probability of default is incorporated into all risk assessments.
See Note 13 for additional information on Citi’s corporate 

credit portfolio.

(1)  Excludes $0.6 billion and $0.1 billion of funded and unfunded exposure at June 30, 2023, respectively, primarily related to the delinquency-managed loans. 

Funded balances also exclude loans carried at fair value of $5.5 billion at June 30, 2023. 
Includes non-accrual loan exposures and criticized unfunded exposures.

(2) 
(3)  Represents the amount of purchased credit protection in the form of derivatives to economically hedge funded and unfunded exposures. Of the $38.5 billion of 

purchased credit protection, $35.9 billion represents the total notional amount of purchased credit derivatives on individual reference entities. The remaining $2.6 
billion represents the first loss tranche of portfolios of purchased credit derivatives with a total notional of $20.9 billion, where the protection seller absorbs the 
first loss on the referenced loan portfolios.

(4)  Autos total credit exposure includes securitization financing facilities secured by auto loans and leases, extended mainly to the finance company subsidiaries of 
global auto manufacturers, bank subsidiaries and independent auto finance companies, of approximately $16.9 billion ($8.7 billion in funded, with 100% rated 
investment grade) as of June 30, 2023.
In addition to this exposure, Citi has energy-related exposure within the public sector (e.g., energy-related state-owned entities) and the transportation and 
industrials sector (e.g., off-shore drilling entities) included in the table above. As of June 30, 2023, Citi’s total exposure to these energy-related entities was 
approximately $4.8 billion, of which approximately $2.4 billion consisted of direct outstanding funded loans.

(5) 

Exposure to Commercial Real Estate
As of June 30, 2023, Citi’s total credit exposure to commercial 
real estate (CRE) was $66 billion (unchanged from March 31, 
2023), including $8 billion of exposure related to office 
buildings. This total CRE exposure consisted of (i) 
approximately $55 billion related to corporate clients 
(unchanged from March 31, 2023), mainly included in the real 
estate category in the table above, and (ii) approximately $11 
billion related to Private bank clients (unchanged from 
March 31, 2023) within PBWM that is not in the table above 
as they are not considered corporate exposures. 

In addition, as of June 30, 2023, approximately 87% of 

Citi’s total CRE exposure was rated investment grade and 
more than 76% was to borrowers in the U.S.

As of June 30, 2023, the ACLL attributed to the total 

funded CRE exposure (including the Private bank) was 
approximately 1.24%, and there were $160 million of non-
accrual CRE loans.

(1)  Excludes $0.6 billion and $0.1 billion of funded and unfunded exposure at December 31, 2022, respectively, primarily related to the delinquency-managed loans. 

Funded balances also exclude loans carried at fair value of $5.1 billion at December 31, 2022. 
Includes non-accrual loan exposures and criticized unfunded exposures.

(2) 
(3)  Represents the amount of purchased credit protection in the form of derivatives to economically hedge funded and unfunded exposures. Of the $39.8 billion of 

purchased credit protection, $36.6 billion represents the total notional amount of purchased credit derivatives on individual reference entities. The remaining $3.2 
billion represents the first loss tranche of portfolios of purchased credit derivatives with a total notional of $27.6 billion, where the protection seller absorbs the 
first loss on the referenced loan portfolios.

(4)  Autos total credit exposure includes securitization financing facilities secured by auto loans and leases, extended mainly to the finance company subsidiaries of 
global auto manufacturers, bank subsidiaries and independent auto finance companies, of approximately $17.4 billion ($10.3 billion in funded, with more than 
99% rated investment grade) as of December 31, 2022.
In addition to this exposure, Citi has energy-related exposure within the public sector (e.g., energy-related state-owned entities) and the transportation and 
industrials sector (e.g., off-shore drilling entities) included in the table above. As of December 31, 2022, Citi’s total exposure to these energy-related entities was 
approximately $4.7 billion, of which approximately $2.4 billion consisted of direct outstanding funded loans.

Credit Risk Mitigation
As part of its overall risk management activities, Citigroup 
uses credit derivatives and other risk mitigants to hedge 
portions of the credit risk in its corporate credit portfolio, in 
addition to outright asset sales. Citi may enter into partial-term 
hedges as well as full-term hedges. In advance of the 
expiration of partial-term hedges, Citi will determine, among 
other factors, the economic feasibility of hedging the 
remaining life of the instrument. The results of the mark-to-
market and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives 
are reflected primarily in Principal transactions in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income.

At June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023 and Dec 31, 2022, ICG 
had economic hedges on the corporate credit portfolio of $38.5 
billion, $39.8 billion and $39.8 billion, respectively. Citi’s 
expected credit loss model used in the calculation of its ACL 
does not include the favorable impact of credit derivatives and 
other mitigants that are marked-to-market. In addition, the 
reported amounts of direct outstandings and unfunded lending 
commitments in the tables above do not reflect the impact of 
these hedging transactions. The credit protection was 
economically hedging underlying ICG corporate credit 
portfolio exposures with the following risk rating distribution:

(1) End-of-period loans include interest and fees on credit cards.
(2) Asia Consumer loan balances, reported within Legacy Franchises, exclude any loans reclassified to held-for-sale (HFS) as of the date Citi enters into a sale 

agreement for the respective Asia Consumer banking business. These reclassified HFS loans are instead reported in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet until sale closing. The remaining Asia Consumer loan portfolios—China, Korea, Russia and Poland—are held-for-investment and included in end-of-period 
consumer loans for all periods presented. All HFS portfolios were reclassified prior to the end of 1Q22 except for a $1.8 billion portfolio, which was moved to 
HFS in 1Q23.

(3) Consists of $99.5 billion, $98.9 billion, $98.2 billion, $99.3 billion and $94.6 billion of loans in North America as of June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023, December 
31, 2022, September 30, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. For additional information on the credit quality of the Global Wealth portfolio, see Note 13.
(4) Consists of $51.0 billion, $51.0 billion, $51.0 billion, $51.8 billion and $54.2 billion of loans outside North America as of June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023, 

December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively.

(5) See Note 13 for details on loan-to-value ratios for the portfolios and FICO scores for the U.S. portfolio.
(6) At June 30, 2023, includes approximately $48 billion of classifiably managed loans. Over 90% of these loans are fully collateralized (consisting primarily of 

marketable investment securities, commercial real estate and limited partner capital commitments in private equity) and have experienced very low historical net 
credit losses (NCLs). As discussed below, approximately 97% of the classifiably managed portion of these loans are investment grade. See “Consumer Loan 
Delinquencies Amounts and Ratios” below for details on the delinquency-managed portfolio.
(7) Asia Consumer also includes loans and leases in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.
(8) Primarily consists of certain North America consumer mortgages.

Consumer Credit Trends

Personal Banking and Wealth Management (PBWM)

Personal Banking and Wealth Management

As indicated above, PBWM consists of U.S. Personal Banking 
and Global Wealth Management (Global Wealth). U.S. 
Personal Banking provides card products through Branded 
cards and Retail services, and also includes mortgages and 
home equity, small business and personal consumer loans 
through Citi’s Retail banking network. The Retail bank is 
concentrated in six major U.S. metropolitan areas. Global 
Wealth provides investment services, cards, mortgages and 
personal, small business and other consumer loans through the 
Private bank, Wealth at Work and Citigold. 

As of June 30, 2023, 44% of PBWM consumer loans 
consisted of U.S. cards loans. U.S. cards net credit losses 
represented approximately 93% of total PBWM losses. 

As shown in the chart above, the second quarter of 2023 
net credit loss rate in PBWM increased quarter-over-quarter 
and year-over-year, driven by a continued increase in net flow 
rates, primarily reflecting ongoing normalization from recent 
low levels in U.S. cards.

PBWM’s 90+ days past due delinquency rate was broadly 
stable quarter-over-quarter, and increased year-over-year. The 
year-over-year increase was largely driven by a continued 
increase in net flow rates, primarily reflecting the ongoing 
normalization in U.S. cards.

Branded Cards

U.S. Personal Banking’s Branded cards portfolio includes 

proprietary and co-branded cards. 

As shown in the chart above, the second quarter of 2023 

net credit loss rate in Branded cards increased quarter-over-
quarter and year-over-year, driven by a continued increase in 
net flow rates, primarily reflecting ongoing normalization 
toward pre-pandemic levels from recent low levels (for 
example, the 4Q’19 and 1Q’20 net credit loss rates were 
3.10% and 3.40%, respectively).

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-

over-quarter and year-over-year, also driven by a continued 
increase in net flow rates, primarily reflecting the ongoing 
normalization toward pre-pandemic levels from recent low 
levels (for example, the 4Q’19 and 1Q’20 90+ days past due 
delinquency rates were 0.95% and 1.01%, respectively). 

Retail Services

U.S. Personal Banking’s Retail services partners directly 

with more than 20 retailers and dealers to offer private label 
and co-branded cards. Retail services’ target market focuses 
on select industry segments such as home improvement, 
specialty retail, consumer electronics and fuel. Retail services 
continually evaluates opportunities to add partners within 
target industries that have strong loyalty, lending or payment 
programs and growth potential.

As shown in the chart above, the second quarter of 2023 

net credit loss rate in Retail services increased quarter-over-
quarter and year-over-year, driven by a continued increase in 
net flow rates, primarily reflecting the ongoing normalization 
toward pre-pandemic levels from recent low levels (for 
example, the 4Q’19 and 1Q’20 net credit loss rates were 
5.05% and 5.35%, respectively). 

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate was broadly 
stable quarter-over-quarter, and increased year-over-year. The 
year-over-year increase was driven by a continued increase in 
net flow rates, primarily reflecting the ongoing normalization 
(for example, the 4Q’19 and 1Q’20 90+ days past due 
delinquency rates were 1.91% and 1.96%, respectively).

For additional information on cost of credit, loan 

delinquency and other information for Citi’s cards portfolios, 
see each respective business’s results of operations above and 
Note 13.

     43                                                                                                                                                                                                            

classifiably managed loans are primarily evaluated for credit 
risk based on their internal risk rating, of which 97% is rated 
investment grade. While the delinquency rate in the chart 
above is calculated only for the delinquency-managed 
portfolio, the net credit loss rate is calculated using net credit 
losses for both the delinquency and classifiably managed 
portfolios.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss and 90+ 

days past due delinquency rates in Global Wealth for the 
second quarter of 2023 were broadly stable quarter-over-
quarter and year-over-year. The low levels of net credit losses 
and the 90+ days past due delinquency rate continued to 
reflect the strong credit profiles of the portfolios. 

Legacy Franchises

Asia(1) Consumer

(1) Asia Consumer includes Legacy Franchises activities in certain EMEA 

countries for all periods presented.

Asia Consumer provides credit cards, consumer 
mortgages and small business and personal loans. Asia 
Consumer also includes loans and leases in certain EMEA 
countries for all periods presented.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 

Asia Consumer (for the remaining consumer banking 
portfolios held-for-investment (China, Korea, Russia and 
Poland)) for the second quarter of 2023 increased quarter-
over-quarter and year-over-year. The increases were primarily 
driven by lower average loans due to the ongoing wind-downs 
of the remaining businesses, particularly Korea, and the 
reclassification of a portfolio to HFS in the first quarter of 
2023.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate was unchanged 

quarter-over-quarter and increased year-over-year, mainly 
driven by lower loans due to the ongoing wind-downs of the 
remaining businesses and the reclassification of a portfolio to 
HFS in the first quarter of 2023. The overall performance of 
the remaining Asia Consumer portfolios continues to reflect 
the strong credit profiles of the customer segments.

Retail Banking

U.S. Personal Banking’s Retail banking portfolio consists 
primarily of consumer mortgages (including home equity) and 
unsecured lending products, such as small business loans and 
personal loans. The portfolio is generally delinquency 
managed, where Citi evaluates credit risk based on FICO 
scores, delinquencies and the value of underlying collateral. 
The consumer mortgages in this portfolio have historically 
been extended to high credit quality customers, generally with 
loan-to-value ratios that are less than or equal to 80% on first 
and second mortgages. For additional information, see “Loan-
to-Value (LTV) Ratios” in Note 13.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 

Retail banking for the second quarter of 2023 decreased 
quarter-over-quarter, due to a decrease in overdraft losses, and 
decreased year-over-year, primarily driven by the impact of 
industry-wide episodic overdraft losses in the prior-year 
period.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily driven by 
lower delinquencies in U.S. mortgages, which reflected the 
lasting effects of government stimulus, unemployment 
benefits and consumer relief programs.

Global Wealth

As discussed above, the Global Wealth credit portfolio 
primarily consists of consumer mortgages, cards and other 
lending products extended to customer segments that range 
from the affluent to ultra-high-net-worth through the Private 
bank, Wealth at Work and Citigold. These customer segments 
represent a target market that is characterized by historically 
low default rates and delinquencies. 

As of June 30, 2023, approximately $48 billion, or 32%, 

of the portfolio was classifiably managed and primarily 
consisted of margin lending, commercial real estate, 
subscription credit finance and other lending programs. These 

     44                                                                                                                                                                                                            

 
Mexico Consumer

Mexico Consumer operates in Mexico through 

Citibanamex and provides cards, consumer mortgages and 
small business and personal loans. Mexico Consumer serves a 
more mass-market segment in Mexico and focuses on 
developing multiproduct relationships with customers.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 
Mexico Consumer for the second quarter of 2023 decreased 
quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to higher recoveries in the 
second quarter of 2023, and increased year-over-year, 
primarily driven by the gradual normalization of loss rates 
after peak losses experienced during the pandemic.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-

over-quarter and year-over-year, driven by the gradual 
normalization of delinquency rates after peak delinquencies 
during the pandemic.

For additional information on cost of credit, loan 
delinquency and other information for Citi’s consumer loan 
portfolios, see each respective business’s results of operations 
above and Note 13.

presentations. 

The FICO distribution of both card portfolios trended up 

from the prior quarter, reflecting seasonal portfolio quality 
improvements, and declined from the prior year, reflecting the 
ongoing normalization in net credit loss and delinquency rates 
in both portfolios. The FICO distribution continued to reflect 
strong underlying credit quality and benefits from the 
continued impacts of government stimulus, unemployment

(1) End-of-period (EOP) loans include interest and fees on credit cards.
(2) The ratios of 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due are calculated based on EOP loans, net of unearned income.
(3) The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios for Retail banking exclude loans guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies since the 

potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) 
were $73 million ($0.5 billion), $80 million ($0.6 billion) and $119 million ($0.7 billion) at June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The 
amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans) were $68 
million, $57 million and $72 million at June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The EOP loans in the table include the guaranteed loans.

(4) The 90+ days past due balances for Branded cards and Retail services are generally still accruing interest. Citi’s policy is generally to accrue interest on credit card 

loans until 180 days past due, unless notification of bankruptcy filing has been received earlier.

(5) Excludes EOP classifiably managed Private bank loans. These loans are not included in the delinquency numerator, denominator and ratios. 
(6) These loans are evaluated for non-accrual status and write-off primarily based on their internal risk classification and not solely on their delinquency status, and 
therefore delinquency metrics are excluded from this table. As of June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, 97%, 93% and 94% of Global Wealth 
classifiably managed loans were rated investment grade. For additional information on the credit quality of the Global Wealth portfolio, including classifiably 
managed portfolios, see “Consumer Credit Trends” above.

(7) Asia Consumer includes delinquencies and loans in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.

     46                                                                                                                                                                                                            

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(8) Citi has entered into agreements to sell certain Asia consumer banking businesses. Accordingly, the loans of these businesses have been reclassified as HFS in 

Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and hence the loans and related delinquencies and ratios are not included in this table. The reclassifications 
commenced as follows: Bahrain, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam in 1Q22 (Bahrain, Malaysia and Thailand closed in 4Q22; India and 
Vietnam closed in 1Q23). In addition, a portfolio was reclassified to HFS in the first quarter of 2023. See Note 2 for additional information.

(9) The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are primarily related to U.S. mortgages guaranteed by U.S. 
government-sponsored agencies since the potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the U.S. agencies. The amounts excluded for 90+ days past due and 
(EOP loans) were $77 million ($0.2 billion), $81 million ($0.3 billion) and $84 million ($0.2 billion) at June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, 
respectively. The amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP 
loans) were $31 million, $30 million and $27 million at June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The EOP loans in the table include the 
guaranteed loans.

(4) Approximately $8 million, $11 million and $50 million in NCLs relating to certain Asia Consumer businesses classified as held-for-sale in Other assets and Other 
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet were recorded as a reduction in revenue (Other revenue) in 2Q23, 1Q23 and 2Q22, respectively. Accordingly, these 
NCLs are not included in this table. See Note 2 for additional information regarding businesses held-for-sale.

(1) North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Mexico is included in offices outside North America. The classification of corporate loans between 

offices in North America and outside North America is based on the domicile of the booking unit. The difference between the domicile of the booking unit and the 
domicile of the managing unit is not material.

(2) Loans secured primarily by real estate.
(3) Consumer loans are net of unearned income of $769 million, $748 million, $712 million, $671 million and $631 million at June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023, 

December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. Unearned income on consumer loans primarily represents unamortized origination fees 
and costs, premiums and discounts. 

(4) Corporate loans include Mexico SBMM loans and are net of unearned income of $(795) million, $(801) million, $(797) million, $(750) million and $(759) million 
at June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. Unearned income on corporate loans primarily 
represents interest received in advance, but not yet earned, on loans originated on a discounted basis.

(5) Because loans carried at fair value do not have an ACLL, they are excluded from the ACLL ratio calculation.

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets 
For additional information on Citi’s non-accrual loans and 
assets, see “Non-Accrual Loans and Assets” in Citi’s 2022 
Form 10-K.

Non-Accrual Loans
The table below summarizes Citigroup’s non-accrual loans as 
of the periods indicated. Non-accrual loans may still be current 
on interest payments. In situations where Citi reasonably 
expects that only a portion of the principal owed will 
ultimately be collected, all payments received are reflected as 
a reduction of principal and not as interest income. For all 
other non-accrual loans, cash interest receipts are generally 
recorded as revenue.

(1) Corporate loans are placed on non-accrual status based upon a review by Citigroup’s risk officers. Corporate non-accrual loans may still be current on interest 

payments. With limited exceptions, the following practices are applied for consumer loans: consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are placed on 
non-accrual status at 90 days past due and are charged off at 120 days past due; residential mortgage loans are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and 
written down to net realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent with industry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest on credit card loans until such 
loans are charged off, which typically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency. As such, the non-accrual loan disclosures do not include credit card loans. The 
balances above represent non-accrual loans within Corporate loans and Consumer loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

(2) Approximately 51%, 61%, 50%, 68% and 52% of Citi’s corporate non-accrual loans were performing at June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, 

September 30, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively.

(3) The June 30, 2023 total corporate non-accrual loans represented 0.44% of total corporate loans.
(4)  Asia Consumer includes balances in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.

Modified Loans
On January 1, 2023, Citi adopted ASU 2022-02, which 
eliminated the accounting and disclosure requirements for 
TDRs (see Note 1 for additional information). See Note 13 for 
information on loan modifications during the six months 
ended June 30, 2023.

Note: The amounts shown in the table above are presented on an average basis. For securities, the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be 
realized and, therefore, exclude any securities that are encumbered and incorporate any haircuts applicable under the U.S. LCR rule. The table above incorporates 
various restrictions that could limit the transferability of liquidity between legal entities, including Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.
(1)  Foreign government debt includes securities issued or guaranteed by foreign sovereigns, agencies and multilateral development banks. Foreign government debt 

securities are held largely to support local liquidity requirements and Citi’s local franchises and principally include government bonds from Japan, Korea, Mexico, 
India and Singapore. 

The table above includes average amounts of HQLA held 
at Citigroup’s operating entities that are eligible for inclusion 
in the calculation of Citigroup’s consolidated Liquidity 
Coverage ratio (LCR), pursuant to the U.S. LCR rules. These 
amounts include the HQLA needed to meet the minimum 
requirements at these entities as well as any amounts in excess 
of these minimums that are available to be transferred to other 
entities within Citigroup. Citigroup’s total average HQLA as 
of the second quarter of 2023 remained largely unchanged 
sequentially. 

As of June 30, 2023, Citigroup had approximately $993 
billion of available liquidity resources to support client and 
business needs, including end-of-period HQLA ($591 billion); 
additional unencumbered HQLA, including excess liquidity 
held at bank entities that is non-transferable to other entities 
within Citigroup ($212 billion); and unused borrowing 
capacity from available assets not already accounted for within 
Citi’s HQLA to support additional advances from the Federal 
Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and the Federal Reserve Bank 
discount window ($190 billion).

Short-Term Liquidity Measurement: Liquidity Coverage 
Ratio (LCR)
In addition to internal 30-day liquidity stress testing performed 
for Citi’s major entities, operating subsidiaries and countries, 
Citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the LCR. The 
table below details the components of Citi’s LCR calculation 
and HQLA in excess of net outflows for the periods indicated:

Note: The amounts are presented on an average basis.

As of June 30, 2023, Citigroup’s average LCR decreased, 

from the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The decrease was 
primarily driven by the reduction in unsecured long-term debt. 
In addition, considering Citi’s total available liquidity 

resources at quarter end of $993 billion, Citi maintained 
approximately $501 billion of excess liquidity above the 
stressed average net outflow of approximately $492 billion, 
shown in the LCR table above.

     54                                                                                                                                                                                                            

 
 
 
 
Citi’s deposit base is spread across a diversified set of 

countries, industries, clients and currencies. 

On an average basis, deposits increased 1% year-over-
year and were down 2% sequentially. The year-over-year 
increase primarily reflected an increase in Corporate/Other 
and ICG, partially offset by a decline in PBWM. Corporate/
Other average deposits increased $12 billion year-over-year, 
primarily driven by the issuance of institutional certificates of 
deposit. ICG average deposits increased 1% year-over-year, 
driven by TTS. PBWM average deposits decreased 1% year-
over-year, largely reflecting the reallocation of deposits to 
higher-yielding investments. Legacy Franchises average 
deposits were largely unchanged year-over-year. The quarter-
over-quarter decrease was largely driven by TTS, reflecting 
some non-operational outflows as expected in light of 
quantitative tightening, and Corporate/Other. Despite this 
decline, TTS had strong growth in operating accounts as the 
business continued to attract new clients and deepen existing 
relationships. 

End-of-period deposits were largely unchanged year-over-

year, as an increase in institutional certificates of deposit in 
Corporate/Other was offset by a decrease in ICG, driven by 
Securities services. End-of-period deposits decreased 1% 
sequentially, reflecting seasonal activity in TTS and Global 
Wealth. 

The majority of Citi’s $1.3 trillion of end-of-period 
deposits are institutional (approximately $818 billion), and 
span approximately 90 countries. A large majority of these 
institutional deposits are within TTS, and of these, 
approximately 80% are from clients that use all three TTS 
integrated services: payments and collections, liquidity 
management and working capital solutions. In addition, nearly 
80% of TTS deposits are from clients that have a greater than 
15-year relationship with Citi. Over the past year, TTS 
deposits grew at a faster rate than total Citi deposits on both an 
average and end-of-period basis. Citi also has a strong 
consumer and wealth deposit base, with $427 billion of U.S. 
Retail banking and Global Wealth deposits as of end-of-
period, which are diversified across the Private bank, Citigold, 
Retail banking and Wealth at Work. As of year-end 2022, 
approximately 75% of U.S. Citigold clients have been with 
Citi for more than 10 years and approximately 50% of Private 
bank ultra-high-net-worth clients have been with Citi for more 
than 10 years. U.S. Personal Banking deposits are spread 
across six core urban centers.

Long-Term Liquidity Measurement: Net Stable Funding 
Ratio (NSFR)
As previously disclosed, the U.S. banking agencies adopted a 
rule to assess the availability of a bank’s stable funding against 
a required level. 

The rule became effective beginning July 1, 2021, while 

public disclosure of the ratio is required to occur on a 
semiannual basis beginning as of June 30, 2023. Citi was in 
compliance with the rule as of June 30, 2023.

Select Balance Sheet Items
This section provides details of select liquidity-related 
liabilities reported on Citigroup’s Consolidated Balance Sheet 
on an average and end-of-period basis.

Cash and Investments
The table below details average and end-of-period Cash and 
due from banks, Deposits with banks (collectively cash) and 
Investment securities. Citi’s investment portfolio consists 
largely of highly liquid U.S. Treasury, U.S. agency and other 
sovereign bonds, with an aggregate duration of less than three 
years. At June 30, 2023, Citi’s EOP cash and Investment 
securities comprised approximately 33% of Citigroup’s total 
assets:

Citigroup. Certain Citigroup consolidated hedging activities are also 
included in this line.

(2) Local country and other includes debt issued by Citi’s affiliates in 
support of their local operations. Within non-bank, certain secured 
financing is also included.

(3) Predominantly credit card securitizations, primarily backed by Branded 

cards receivables.

Citi’s total long-term debt outstanding increased 7% year-
over-year, largely driven by the issuance of customer-related 
debt at the non-bank entities and increased FHLB borrowings 
at the bank. The increase was partially offset by the decline in 
senior benchmark debt at the non-bank entities, as well as 
lower securitizations at the bank. Sequentially, long-term debt 
outstanding decreased 2%, largely driven by a decline in 
senior benchmark debt at the non-bank entities. 

As part of its liability management, Citi has considered, 

and may continue to consider, opportunities to redeem or 
repurchase its long-term debt pursuant to open market 
purchases, tender offers or other means. Such redemptions and 
repurchases help reduce Citi’s overall funding costs. During 
the second quarter of 2023, Citi redeemed or repurchased an 
aggregate of approximately $8.9 billion of its outstanding 
long-term debt. 

Long-Term Debt 

Weighted Average Maturity (WAM) 
The following table presents Citigroup and its affiliates’ 
(including Citibank) WAM of unsecured long-term debt 
issued with a remaining life greater than one year:

The WAM is calculated based on the contractual maturity 

of each security. For securities that are redeemable prior to 
maturity at the option of the holder, the WAM is calculated 
based on the earliest date an option becomes exercisable.

Long-Term Debt Outstanding
Citi’s long-term debt outstanding at the Citigroup parent 
company includes benchmark senior and subordinated debt 
and what Citi refers to as customer-related debt, consisting of 
structured notes, such as equity- and credit-linked notes, as 
well as non-structured notes. Citi’s issuance of customer-
related debt is generally driven by customer demand and 
complements benchmark debt issuance as a source of funding 
for Citi’s non-bank entities. Citi’s long-term debt at the bank 
includes bank notes, FHLB advances and securitizations.

Short-Term Borrowings
Citi’s short-term borrowings of $40 billion as of the second 
quarter of 2023 was largely unchanged both year-over-year 
and sequentially (see Note 17 for further information on 
Citigroup’s and its affiliates’ outstanding short-term 
borrowings).

Secured Funding Transactions and Short-Term 
Borrowings
Citi supplements its primary sources of funding with short-
term financings that generally include (i) secured funding 
transactions consisting of securities loaned or sold under 
agreements to repurchase, i.e., repos, and (ii) to a lesser extent, 
short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper and 
borrowings from the FHLB and other market participants. 

Secured Funding Transactions
Secured funding is primarily accessed through Citi’s broker-
dealer subsidiaries, with a smaller portion executed through 
Citi’s bank entities to efficiently fund both (i) secured lending 
activity and (ii) a portion of the securities inventory held in the 
context of market making and customer activities. Secured 
funding transactions are predominantly collateralized by 
government debt securities. Generally, changes in the level of 
Citi’s secured funding are primarily due to fluctuations in 
secured lending activity in the matched book (as described 
below) and changes in securities inventory. In order to 
maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market 
conditions, Citi manages risks related to its secured funding by 
establishing secured funding limits and conducting daily stress 
tests that account for risks related to capacity, tenor, haircut, 
collateral type, counterparty and client actions. 

Secured funding of $260 billion as of June 30, 2023 
increased 31% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, largely 
driven by additional financing to support increases in trading-
related assets within Citi’s broker-dealer subsidiaries. As of 
the quarter ended June 30, 2023, on an average basis, secured 
funding was $262 billion. The portion of secured funding in 
the broker-dealer subsidiaries that funds secured lending is 
commonly referred to as “matched book” activity and is 
primarily secured by high-quality liquid securities such as U.S. 
Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities and foreign 
government debt securities. Other “matched book” activity is 
secured by less liquid securities, including equity securities, 
corporate bonds and asset-backed securities, the tenor of 
which is generally equal to or longer than the tenor of the 
corresponding assets. As indicated above, the remaining 
portion of secured funding is used to fund securities inventory 
held in the context of market making and customer activities.

     58                                                                                                                                                                                                            

Credit Ratings
The table below presents the ratings for Citigroup and 
Citibank as of June 30, 2023. While not included in the table

Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades
Ratings downgrades by Fitch, Moody’s or S&P could 
negatively impact Citigroup’s and/or Citibank’s funding and 
liquidity due to reduced funding capacity, including derivative 
triggers, which could take the form of cash obligations and 
collateral requirements.

For additional information on the impact of credit rating 

changes on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see “Risk 
Factors—Liquidity Risks” and “Credit Ratings” in Citi’s 2022 
Form 10-K.

Citigroup Inc. and Citibank—Potential Derivative Triggers
As of June 30, 2023, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-
notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of 
Citigroup Inc. across all three major rating agencies could 
impact Citigroup’s funding and liquidity due to derivative 
triggers by approximately $0.4 billion, compared to $0.3 
billion as of March 31, 2023. Other funding sources, such as 
secured funding transactions and other margin requirements, 
for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be 
adversely affected.

As of June 30, 2023, Citi estimates that a hypothetical 
one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of 
Citibank across all three major rating agencies could impact 
Citibank’s funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by 
approximately $0.4 billion, compared to $0.3 billion as of 
March 31, 2023. Other funding sources, such as secured 
funding transactions and other margin requirements, for which 
there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely 
impacted.

In total, as of June 30, 2023, Citi estimates that a one-
notch downgrade of Citigroup Inc. and Citibank across all 
three major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate 
cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately 
$0.8 billion, compared to $0.6 billion as of March 31, 2023 
(see also Note 21). As detailed under “High-Quality Liquid 
Assets (HQLA)” above, Citigroup has various liquidity 
resources available to its bank and non-bank entities in part as 
a contingency for the potential events described above.

Citibank—Additional Potential Impacts
In addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a 
potential downgrade of Citibank’s senior debt/long-term rating 
across any of the three major rating agencies could also have 
an adverse impact on the commercial paper/short-term rating 
of Citibank. Citibank has provided liquidity commitments to 
consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits, 
primarily in the form of asset purchase agreements. As of 
June 30, 2023, Citibank had liquidity commitments of 
approximately $10.9 billion to consolidated asset-backed 
commercial paper conduits, which was largely unchanged 
from March 31, 2023 (see Note 20 for additional information).
In addition to the above-referenced liquidity resources of 

certain Citibank entities, Citibank could reduce the funding 
and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades 
described above through mitigating actions, including 
repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial 
paper conduits. In the event of the potential downgrades 
described above, Citi believes that certain corporate customers 
could reevaluate their deposit relationships with Citibank. This 
reevaluation could result in clients adjusting their 
discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository 
institution, which could potentially reduce certain deposit 
levels at Citibank. However, Citi could choose to adjust 
pricing, offer alternative deposit products to its existing 
customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers, in 
addition to the mitigating actions referenced above.

MARKET RISK

Market risk arises from both Citi’s trading and non-trading 
portfolios. For additional information on market risk and 
market risk management at Citi, see “Market Risk—
Overview” and “Risk Factors” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

Market Risk of Non-Trading Portfolios
Market risk from non-trading portfolios stems predominantly 
from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and 
foreign exchange rates on Citi’s net interest income and on 
Citi’s Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) 
from its investment securities portfolios. Market risk from 
non-trading portfolios also includes the potential impact of 
changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital invested in 
foreign currencies.

Banking Book Interest Rate Risk 
For interest rate risk purposes, Citi’s non-trading portfolios are 
referred to as the Banking Book. Management of interest rate 
risk in the Banking Book is governed by Citi’s Non-Trading 
Market Risk Policy. Management’s Asset & Liability 
Committee (ALCO) establishes Citi’s risk appetite and related 
limits for interest rate risk in the Banking Book, which are 
subject to approval by Citigroup’s Board of Directors. 
Corporate Treasury is responsible for the day-to-day 
management of Citi’s Banking Book interest rate risk as well 
as periodically reviewing it with the ALCO. Citi’s Banking 
Book interest rate risk management is also subject to 
independent oversight from the second line of defense team 
reporting to the Chief Risk Officer.

Changes in interest rates impact Citi’s net income, AOCI 

and CET1. These changes primarily affect Citi’s Banking 
Book through net interest income, due to a variety of risk 
factors, including:

•

•
•

•

Differences in timing and amounts of the maturity or 
repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet 
instruments;
Changes in the level and/or shape of interest rate curves;
Client behavior in response to changes in interest rates 
(e.g., mortgage prepayments, deposit betas); and
Changes in the maturity of instruments resulting from 
changes in the interest rate environment.

As part of their ongoing activities, Citi’s businesses 
generate interest rate-sensitive positions from their client-
facing products, such as loans and deposits. The component of 
this interest rate risk that can be hedged is transferred via 
Citi’s funds transfer pricing process to Corporate Treasury. 
Corporate Treasury uses various tools to manage the total 
interest rate risk position within the established risk appetite 
and target Citi’s desired risk profile, including its investment 
securities portfolio, company-issued debt and interest rate 
derivatives. 

In addition, Citi uses multiple metrics to measure its 
Banking Book interest rate risk. Interest Rate Exposure (IRE) 
is a key metric that analyzes the impact of a range of scenarios 
on Citi’s Banking Book net interest income and certain other 
interest rate-sensitive income versus a base case. IRE does not 
represent a forecast of Citi’s net interest income.

The scenarios, methodologies and assumptions used in 

this analysis are periodically evaluated and enhanced in 
response to changes in the market environment, changes in 
Citi’s balance sheet composition, enhancements in Citi’s 
modeling and other factors.

Since the third quarter of 2022, Citi has employed 

enhanced IRE methodologies and changes to certain 
assumptions. The changes included, among other things, 
assumptions around the projected balance sheet and revisions 
to the treatment of certain business contributions (notably 
accrual positions in ICG’s Markets businesses). These changes 
resulted in a higher impact to Citi’s net interest income over a 
12-month period.

Under the enhanced methodology, Citi utilizes the most 
recent quarter-end balance sheet, assuming no changes to its 
composition and size over the forecasted horizon (holding the 
balance sheet static). The forecasts incorporate expectations 
and assumptions of deposit pricing, loan spreads and mortgage 
prepayment behavior implied by the interest rate curves in 
each scenario. The base case scenario reflects the market 
implied forward interest rates, and sensitivity scenarios 
assume instantaneous shocks to the base case. The forecasts do 
not assume Citi takes any risk-mitigating actions in response 
to changes in the interest rate environment. Certain interest 
rates are subject to flooring assumptions in downward rate 
scenarios. Deposit pricing sensitivities (i.e., deposit betas), are 
informed by historical and expected behavior. Actual deposit 
pricing could differ from the assumptions used in these 
forecasts.

Citi’s IRE analysis primarily reflects the impacts from the 

following Banking Book assets and liabilities: loans, client 
deposits, Citi’s deposits with other banks, investment 
securities, long-term debt, any related interest rate hedges and 
the funds transfer pricing of positions in total trading and 
credit portfolio value at risk (VAR). It excludes impacts from 
any positions that are included in total trading and credit 
portfolio VAR.

In addition to IRE, Citi analyzes economic value 
sensitivity (EVS) as a longer-term interest rate risk metric. 
EVS is a net present value (NPV)–based measure of the 
lifetime cash flows of Citi’s Banking Book. It estimates the 
interest rate sensitivity of the Banking Book’s economic value 
from longer-term assets being potentially funded with shorter-
term liabilities, or vice versa. Citi manages EVS within risk 
limits approved by Citigroup’s Board of Directors that are 
aligned with Citi’s interest rate risk appetite.

     60                                                                                                                                                                                                            

Interest Rate Risk of Investment Portfolios—Impact on 
AOCI
Citi also measures the potential impacts of changes in interest 
rates on the value of its AOCI, which can in turn impact Citi’s 
common equity and tangible common equity. This will impact 
Citi’s CET1 and other regulatory capital ratios. Citi seeks to 
manage its exposure to changes in the market level of interest 
rates, while limiting the potential impact on its AOCI and 
regulatory capital position.

AOCI at risk is managed as part of the Company-wide 
interest rate risk position. AOCI at risk considers potential 

changes in AOCI (and the corresponding impact on the CET1 
Capital ratio) relative to Citi’s capital generation capacity. 

Citi uses 100 basis point (bps) shocks in each scenario to 

reflect its net interest income sensitivity to unanticipated 
changes in market interest rates, as potential monetary policy 
decisions and changes in economic conditions may be 
reflected in current market implied forward rates. The 
following table presents the 12-month estimated impact to 
Citi’s net interest income, AOCI and the CET1 Capital ratio, 
each assuming an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 bps 
increase in interest rates:

(3)

The “All other currencies” of $1,468 million as of 
June 30, 2023 in the table above includes the impact from the 
following top six non-U.S. dollar currencies, which represents 
nearly 50% of the total non-U.S. dollar currency impact: 
approximately $0.2 billion from British pound sterling, and 
approximately $0.1 billion each from Japanese yen, Singapore 
dollar, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee and Swiss franc. These 
impacts per currency are generally in the same direction 
(estimated positive impact in the +100 bps shock scenario) and 
not offsetting.

Citi’s balance sheet is asset sensitive (assets reprice faster 

than liabilities), resulting in higher net interest income in 
increasing interest rate scenarios. The estimated impact to 
Citi’s net interest income in a 100 bps upward rate shock 
scenario as of the second quarter of 2023 decreased quarter-
over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily due to changes in 
deposit composition and levels, partially offset by hedging 
actions. At progressively higher interest rate levels, the 
marginal net interest income benefit is lower, as Citi assumes 
it will pass on a larger share of rate changes to depositors (i.e., 
higher betas), further reducing Citi’s IRE sensitivity. 
Currency-specific interest rate changes and balance sheet 
factors may drive quarter-to-quarter volatility in Citi’s 
estimated IRE.

In a 100 bps upward rate shock scenario, Citi expects that 

the approximate $1.4 billion initial negative impact to AOCI 
could potentially be offset in shareholders’ equity through the 
expected recovery of the impact on AOCI through accretion of 
Citi’s investment portfolio and expected net interest income 
benefit over a period of approximately six months.

     61                                                                                                                                                                                                            

 
 
 
 
 
 
Scenario Analysis
The following table presents the estimated impact to Citi’s net 
interest income, AOCI and CET1 Capital ratio (on a fully 
implemented basis) under six different scenarios of changes in 
interest rates for the U.S. dollar and all other currencies in 
which Citi has invested capital as of June 30, 2023. The 
interest rate scenarios are also impacted by convexity related 
to mortgage products.

Note: Each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur instantaneously. Changes in interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and the 10-year rate are 
interpolated. The interest rate exposure in the table above assumes no change in deposit size or mix from the baseline forecast included in the different interest scenarios 
presented. As a result, in higher interest rate scenarios, customer activity resulting in a shift from non-interest-bearing and low interest rate deposit products to higher-
yielding deposits would reduce the expected benefit to net interest income. Conversely, in lower interest rate scenarios, customer activity resulting in a shift from 
higher-yielding deposits to non-interest-bearing and low interest rate deposit products would reduce the expected decrease to net interest income.
(1) Scenario 1 includes the impact from the following top six non-U.S. dollar currencies, which represents nearly 50% of the total non-U.S. dollar currency impact: 

approximately $0.2 billion from British pound sterling, and approximately $0.1 million each from Japanese yen, Singapore dollar, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee and 
Swiss franc. These impacts per currency are generally in the same direction (estimated positive impact in the +100 bps shock scenario) and not offsetting.
Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.

(2)

As shown in the table above, the estimated impact to 
Citi’s net interest income is larger under Scenario 2 than 
Scenario 3, as Citi’s Banking Book has relatively higher 
interest rate exposure to the short end of the yield curve. For 
non-U.S. dollar currencies, exposure to downward rate shocks 
is smaller in magnitude as a result of Citi’s flooring 
assumption, given low rate levels for certain non-U.S. dollar 
currencies.

The magnitude of the impact to AOCI is greater under 

Scenario 2 compared to Scenario 3. This is because the 
combination of changes to Citi’s investment portfolio, 
partially offset by changes related to Citi’s pension liabilities, 
results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at 
shorter- and intermediate-term maturities.

     62                                                                                                                                                                                                            

 
 
 
 
Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates—Impacts on AOCI 
and Capital
As of June 30, 2023, Citi estimates that an unanticipated 
parallel instantaneous 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar 
against all of the other currencies in which Citi has invested 
capital could reduce Citi’s tangible common equity (TCE) by 
approximately $1.7 billion, or 0.96%, as a result of changes to 
Citi’s CTA in AOCI, net of hedges. This impact would be 
primarily due to changes in the value of the Mexican peso, 
Euro and Indian rupee.

This impact is also before any mitigating actions Citi may 

take, including ongoing management of its foreign currency 
translation exposure. Specifically, as currency movements 
change the value of Citi’s net investments in foreign currency-
denominated capital, these movements also change the value 
of Citi’s risk-weighted assets denominated in those currencies.

due to changes in FX translation, net of hedges (bps)

This, coupled with Citi’s foreign currency hedging strategies, 
such as foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency 
forwards and other currency hedging instruments, lessens the 
impact of foreign currency movements on Citi’s CET1 Capital 
ratio. Changes in these hedging strategies, as well as hedging 
costs, divestitures and tax impacts, can further affect the actual 
impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital 
compared to an unanticipated parallel shock, as described 
above.

The effect of Citi’s ongoing management strategies with 

respect to quarterly changes in foreign exchange rates, and the 
quarterly impact of these changes on Citi’s TCE and CET1 
Capital ratio, are shown in the table below. See Note 18 for 
additional information on the changes in AOCI.

Interest revenue and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments primarily related to the tax-exempt bond portfolio and certain tax-advantaged 
loan programs (based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%) of $13 million, $44 million and $44 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, 
March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively. 
Interest expense associated with certain hybrid financial instruments, which are classified as Long-term debt and accounted for at fair value, is reported together 
with any changes in fair value as part of Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income and is therefore not reflected in Interest expense in the 
table above.

(3) The average rate on interest revenue and net interest margin reflects the taxable equivalent gross-up adjustment. See footnote 1 above.
(4) Citi’s NIM is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets.

Interest revenue and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments discussed in the table above.

Citi’s net interest income in the second quarter of 2023 
increased 16% to $13.9 billion versus the prior-year period. As 
presented in the table above, Citi’s net interest income on a 
taxable equivalent basis also increased 16% year-over-year, or 
$1.9 billion. The increase was driven by higher net interest 
income in non-ICG Markets, which increased 12%, and ICG 
Markets, which increased 46%. The increase in net interest 
income in non-ICG Markets primarily reflected higher interest 
rates, growth in U.S. cards interest-earning balances and 
higher income from Citi’s investment portfolio, partially offset 
by the reduction from the exited markets and continued wind-
downs in Legacy Franchises. The increase in ICG Markets net 
interest income was primarily driven by higher interest rates as 
well as a change in the mix of trading positions in support of 
client activity.

Citi’s net interest margin was 2.48% on a taxable 

equivalent basis in the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 7 
basis points from the prior quarter, primarily driven by the 
benefits of dividend seasonality in ICG Markets and higher 
interest rates, partially offset by a mix shift to higher cost 
deposits.

Market Risk of Trading Portfolios

Value at Risk (VAR)
Citi believes its VAR model is conservatively calibrated to incorporate fat-tail scaling and the greater of short-term (approximately the 
most recent month) and long-term (18 months for commodities and three years for others) market volatility. As of June 30, 2023, Citi 
estimates that the conservative features of the VAR calibration contribute an approximate 48% add-on to what would be a VAR 
estimated under the assumption of stable and perfectly, normally distributed markets. As of March 31, 2023, the add-on was 65%.

As presented in the table below, Citi’s average trading VAR for the second quarter of 2023 decreased 3% quarter-over-quarter, 

primarily from inventory changes in ICG Markets businesses.

(1)  Covariance adjustment (also known as diversification benefit) equals the difference between the total VAR and the sum of the VARs tied to each risk type. The 
benefit reflects the fact that the risks within individual and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VAR on a given day will be 
lower than the sum of the VARs relating to each risk type. The determination of the primary drivers of changes to the covariance adjustment is made by an 
examination of the impact of both model parameter and position changes.

(2)  The total trading VAR includes mark-to-market and certain fair value option trading positions in ICG, with the exception of hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value 

option loans and all CVA exposures. Available-for-sale and accrual exposures are not included.

(3)  The specific risk-only component represents the level of equity and fixed income issuer-specific risk embedded in VAR. 
(4)  The credit portfolio is composed of mark-to-market positions associated with non-trading business units, with the CVA relating to derivative counterparties and all 

associated CVA hedges. FVA and DVA are not included. The credit portfolio also includes hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value option loans and hedges to the 
leveraged finance pipeline within capital markets origination in ICG.

Regulatory VAR Back-testing
In accordance with Basel III, Citi is required to perform back-
testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR 
model. Regulatory VAR back-testing is the process in which 
the daily one-day VAR, at a 99% confidence interval, is 
compared to the buy-and-hold profit and loss (i.e., the profit 
and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of 
the day and re-priced the following day). Buy-and-hold profit 
and loss represents the daily mark-to-market profit and loss 
attributable to price movements in covered positions from the 
close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and 
loss excludes realized trading revenue, net interest, fees and 
commissions, intra-day trading profit and loss and changes in 
reserves.

Based on a 99% confidence level, Citi would expect two 

to three days in any one year where buy-and-hold losses 
exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the conservative 
calibration of Citi’s VAR model (as a result of taking the 
greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-tail scaling 
of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer exceptions under 
normal and stable market conditions. Periods of unstable 
market conditions could increase the number of back-testing 
exceptions.

As of June 30, 2023, there was one back-testing exception 

observed for Citi’s Regulatory VAR in the last 12 months.

 OTHER RISKS
For additional information regarding other risks, including 
Citi’s management of other risks, see “Managing Global Risk
—Other Risks” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

LIBOR Transition Risk 
The USD LIBOR bank panel ended on June 30, 2023. The 
overnight and 12-month USD LIBOR settings have now 
permanently ceased, and the Financial Conduct Authority is 
requiring ICE Benchmark Administration to continue 
publishing one-, three- and six-month USD LIBOR settings 
using a synthetic methodology, which is based on the relevant 
CME Term SOFR Reference Rate plus the respective ISDA 
fixed spread adjustment. These synthetic settings are 
permanently unrepresentative of the underlying markets they 
previously sought to measure and are expected to cease on 
September 30, 2024. 

As of June 30, 2023, Citi has transitioned nearly all of its 

USD LIBOR-referencing contracts to SOFR plus a credit 
spread adjustment. Remediation was accomplished through a 
range of methods. With respect to derivatives, most bilateral 
contracts were remediated through adherence to the ISDA 
IBOR Fallbacks Protocols or bilateral amendments, and 
cleared contracts were remediated through conversions 
completed by central counterparty clearing houses. Most loan 
contracts were remediated through amendments that provided 
for either an immediate transition to SOFR or a transition on 
the first interest payment date immediately following June 30, 
2023. With respect to securities, contracts governed by U.S. 
law transitioned to SOFR by operation of law pursuant to the 
Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act or pursuant to Citi’s 
exercise of discretion as the determining person with the 
authority to select a replacement rate. Securities contracts not 
governed by U.S. law were primarily remediated through 
consent solicitations or Citi’s exercise of discretion as the 
determining person with the authority to select a replacement 
rate. 

As of June 30, 2023, there were a de minimis number of 

unremediated USD LIBOR-referencing contracts. Most of 
these contracts relate to non-U.S.-law-governed securities and 
loans that will temporarily utilize synthetic LIBOR. Citi will 
continue to focus on remediating its remaining unremediated 
contracts. 

For additional information about Citi’s actions to address 

a transition away from and discontinuance of LIBOR, see 
“Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—LIBOR Transition 
Risk” in Citi’s First Quarter of 2023 Form 10-Q and 2022 
Form 10-K. For information about Citi’s LIBOR transition 
risks, see “Risk Factors—Other Risks” in the 2022 Form 10-
K.

Country Risk

Top 25 Country Exposures
The following table presents Citi’s top 25 exposures by 
country (excluding the U.S.) as of June 30, 2023. (Including 
the U.S., Citi’s top 25 exposures by country would represent 
approximately 98% of Citi’s exposure to all countries as of 
June 30, 2023.)

For purposes of the table, loan amounts are reflected in 
the country where the loan is booked, which is generally based 
on the domicile of the borrower. For example, a loan to a 
Chinese subsidiary of a Switzerland-based corporation will 
generally be categorized as a loan in China. In addition, Citi 
has developed regional booking centers in certain countries, 

most significantly in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland, 
in order to more efficiently serve its corporate customers. As 
an example, with respect to the U.K., only 41% of corporate 
loans presented in the table below are to U.K. domiciled 
entities (42% for unfunded commitments), with the balance of 
the loans predominately to European domiciled counterparties. 
Approximately 90% of the total U.K. funded loans and 90% of 
the total U.K. unfunded commitments were investment grade 
as of June 30, 2023. 

Trading account assets and investment securities are 
generally categorized based on the domicile of the issuer of 
the security of the underlying reference entity. For additional 
information on the assets included in the table, see the 
footnotes to the table below.

Russia 

Introduction
In Russia, Citi’s remaining wind-down operations are 
conducted through both its ICG and Legacy Franchises 
segments. 

As previously disclosed, as of March 31, 2023, Citi ended 

nearly all of the institutional banking services it offered in 
Russia, with the remaining services only those necessary to 
fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations. In 
addition, Legacy Franchises reduced its loan portfolios in 
Russia by approximately 75%, primarily driven by loan 
portfolio sales and the signing of a credit card referral 
agreement. Citi has ceased soliciting any new business or new 
clients in Russia. Citi will continue to manage its existing 
legal and regulatory commitments and obligations, as well as 
support its employees, during this period. For additional 
information, see “Citi’s Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations” 
below.

Citi continues to monitor the war in Ukraine, related 
sanctions and economic conditions and continues to mitigate 
its Russia exposures and risks as appropriate. 

For additional information about Citi’s risks related to its 
Russia exposures, see “Forward-Looking Statements” below 
and “Risk Factors—Market-Related Risk,” “—Operational 
Risks” and “—Other Risks” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

(1) 
(2)  Reverse repurchase agreements are shown gross of collateral and are included in net MTM on derivatives/repos in the table above, as netting of collateral for 

Russia-related reverse repurchase agreements was removed in the second quarter of 2022. This removal was due to the inability to conclude, with a well-founded 
basis, the enforceability of contractual rights in the Russian legal system in the event of a counterparty default, given the geopolitical uncertainty caused by the 
war in Ukraine.

(3)  Unfunded exposure consists of unfunded corporate lending commitments, letters of credit and other contingencies. 
(4)  Cash on deposit and placements are primarily with the Central Bank of Russia.
(5)  Represents dividends received by Citi in its role as custodian for investor clients in Russia, which Citi is required by local regulation to hold at the Deposit 

Insurance Agency (DIA). In accordance with a Central Bank of Russia regulatory requirement, all balances in the National Settlements Depository were 
transferred to the DIA. Citi is unable to remit these funds to clients due to restrictions imposed by the Russian government.

(6)  The majority of AO Citibank’s third-party exposures was funded with the dividends under footnote 5 and domestic deposit liabilities from both corporate and 

personal banking clients.

(7)  Citigroup’s CTA loss included in its AOCI related to its indirect subsidiary, AO Citibank, is excluded from the above table, because the CTA loss is not held in 

AO Citibank and would be recognized in Citigroup’s earnings only upon either the substantial liquidation or a loss of control of AO Citibank. Citi has separately 
described these risks in “Deconsolidation Risk” below.

     73                                                                                                                                                                                                            

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During the second quarter of 2023, Citi’s Russia-related 

exposures increased by $0.5 billion, as shown in the table 
above. The increase in exposure was driven by $1.7 billion of 
dividends that Citi received as custodian for investor clients in 
Russia and is unable to remit due to Russian regulatory 
restrictions (trapped dividends), partially offset by deposit 
outflows as well as a $0.6 billion depreciation of the ruble 
against the U.S. dollar. A portion ($1 billion, net of ruble 
depreciation) of these dividends were placed in reverse 
repurchase agreements. Roughly 65% of Citi’s remaining 
Russia exposures are the trapped dividends discussed above.

Citi’s continued risk mitigation efforts have included ICG 

borrower paydowns and limiting extensions of new credit. 

Citi’s net investment in Russia was approximately $1.1 
billion as of June 30, 2023 (compared to $1.2 billion at March 
31, 2023). Citi hedges its ruble/USD spot FX exposure in 
AOCI through the purchase of FX derivatives. The ongoing 
mark-to-market of the hedging derivatives is also reported in 
AOCI. When the ruble depreciates against the USD, the USD 
equivalent value of Citigroup’s investment in AO Citibank 
also declines. This change in value is offset by the change in 
value of the hedging instrument (FX derivative). Going 
forward, Citi may record devaluations on its net ruble-
denominated assets in earnings, without the benefit from a 
change in the fair value of derivative positions used to 
economically hedge the exposures. 

Earnings and Other Impacts on Citi’s Businesses
Citi’s ICG, PBWM and Legacy Franchises segments and 
Corporate/Other have been impacted by various 
macroeconomic factors and volatilities, including Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine and its direct and indirect impact on the 
European and global economies. For a broader discussion of 
these factors and volatilities on Citi’s businesses, see 
“Executive Summary” and each business’s results of 
operations above. 

As of June 30, 2023, Citigroup’s ACL included a $0.2 
billion remaining credit reserve for Citi’s direct and indirect 
Russian counterparties (unchanged from March 31, 2023).

Citi’s Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations
During 2022, Citi disclosed its decision to wind down its 
Russia consumer, local commercial and institutional banking 
businesses, including actively pursuing portfolio sales. In 
connection with this wind-down, Citi currently expects to 
incur approximately $180 million (compared to $210 million 
at March 31, 2023) in total estimated charges ($40 million in 
ICG and $140 million in Legacy Franchises, excluding the 
impact from any portfolio sales), largely driven by 
restructuring, vendor termination fees and other related 
charges. Citi’s previously disclosed referral agreement with a 
Russian bank to settle a portfolio of ruble-denominated credit 
card loans, subject to customer consent, was signed in May 
2023 and is in the execution phase. The outstanding amount 
with Citi is to be settled upon referral and refinancing. As a 
result, the credit card loans will remain held-for-investment 
and are not transferred to held-for-sale. For additional 
information about Citi’s continued efforts to reduce its 
operations and exposure in Russia, see Note 2 and “Risk 

Factors” and “Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—Country 
Risk—Russia” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

Deconsolidation Risk
Citi’s remaining operations in Russia subject it to various 
risks, including, among others, foreign currency volatility, 
including appreciation or devaluation; restrictions arising from 
retaliatory Russian laws and regulations on the conduct of its 
business; sanctions or asset freezes; or other deconsolidation 
events (for additional information, see “Risk Factors—Other 
Risks” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K). Examples of triggers that 
may result in deconsolidation of AO Citibank include 
voluntary or forced sale of ownership or loss of control due to 
actions of relevant governmental authorities, including 
expropriation (i.e., the entity becomes subject to the complete 
control of a government, court, administrator, trustee or 
regulator); revocation of banking license; and loss of ability to 
elect a board of directors or appoint members of senior 
management. As of June 30, 2023, Citi continued to 
consolidate AO Citibank because none of the deconsolidation 
factors were triggered.

In the event Citi deems there is a loss of control, for 
example, through expropriation of AO Citibank Russia, Citi’s 
foreign entity in Russia, Citi would be required to (i) write off 
the net investment of approximately $1.1 billion (compared to 
$1.2 billion as of March 31, 2023), (ii) recognize a CTA loss 
of approximately $1.6 billion (compared to $1.4 billion as of 
March 31, 2023) through earnings and (iii) recognize a loss of 
$0.4 billion (unchanged from March 31, 2023) on 
intercompany liabilities owed by AO Citibank to other Citi 
entities outside Russia. In the sole event of a substantial 
liquidation, as opposed to a loss of control, Citi would be 
required to recognize the CTA loss of approximately $1.6 
billion through earnings and would evaluate its remaining net 
investment as circumstances evolve.

Citi as Paying Agent for Russian-related Clients
Citi serves or served as paying agent on bonds issued by 
various entities in Russia, including Russian corporate clients. 
Citi’s role as paying agent is administrative. In this role, Citi 
acts as an agent of its client, the bond issuer, receiving interest 
and principal payments from the bond issuer and then making 
payments to international central securities depositories (e.g., 
Depository Trust Company, Euroclear, Clearstream). The 
international central securities depositories (ICSDs) make 
payments to those participants or account holders (e.g., broker/
dealers) that have clients who are investors in the applicable 
bonds (i.e., bondholders). As a paying agent, Citi generally 
does not have information about the identity of the 
bondholders. As a result of sanctions or other governmental 
requirements and prohibitions, Citi may be exposed to risks 
due to its responsibilities for receiving and processing 
payments on behalf of its clients. To mitigate operational and 
sanctions risks, Citi has established policies, procedures and 
controls for client relationships and payment processing to 
help ensure compliance with U.S., U.K., EU and other 
jurisdictions’ sanctions laws.

These processes may require Citi to delay or withhold the 

processing of payments as a result of sanctions on the bond 
issuer. Citi is also prevented from making payments to 

     74                                                                                                                                                                                                            

impact on Citi’s operations in Russia, Ukraine and elsewhere, 
as well as the war’s broader geopolitical, macroeconomic and 
reputational impacts. In addition to receiving regular briefings 
from management, the full Board has routinely been invited to 
attend portions of the RMC meetings for discussions related to 
the war in Ukraine, including with respect to Citi’s risk 
exposures and stress testing. The reports to the Board and its 
Committees from senior management who represent the 
impacted businesses and the EMEA region, Independent Risk 
Management, Finance, Independent Compliance Risk 
Management, including those individuals responsible for 
sanctions compliance, and Human Resources, have included 
detailed information regarding financial impacts, impacts on 
capital, cybersecurity, strategic considerations, sanctions 
compliance, employee assistance and reputational risks, 
enabling the Board and its Committees to properly exercise 
their oversight responsibilities. In addition, senior 
management has also provided updates to Citi’s Executive 
Management Team and the Board, outside of formal meetings, 
regarding Citi’s Russia-related risks, including with respect to 
cybersecurity matters.

Ukraine
Citi has continued to operate in Ukraine throughout the war 
through its ICG businesses, serving the local subsidiaries of 
multinationals, along with local financial institutions and the 
public sector. Citi employs approximately 230 people in 
Ukraine and their safety continues to be Citi’s top priority. All 
of Citi’s domestic operations in Ukraine are conducted 
through a subsidiary of Citibank, which uses the Ukrainian 
hryvnia as its functional currency. Citi’s exposures in Ukraine 
are not significant enough to be included in the “Top 25 
Country Exposures” table above. As of June 30, 2023, Citi had 
$1.3 billion of direct exposures related to Ukraine, compared 
to $1.2 billion as of March 31, 2023. The increase in 
exposures reflected a $0.1 billion increase in deposits.

accounts on behalf of bondholders should the ICSDs disclose 
to Citi the presence of sanctioned bondholders. In both 
instances, Citi is generally required to segregate, restrict or 
block the funds until applicable sanctions are lifted or the 
payment is otherwise authorized under applicable law.

Reputational Risks
Citi has continued its efforts to enhance and protect its 
reputation with its colleagues, clients, customers, investors, 
regulators and the public. Citi’s response to the war in 
Ukraine, including any action or inaction, may have a negative 
impact on Citi’s reputation with some or all of these parties.
For example, Citi is exposed to reputational risk as a 
result of its current presence in Russia and association with 
Russian individuals or entities, whether subject to sanctions or 
not, including Citi’s inability to support its global clients in 
Russia, which could adversely affect its broader client 
relationships and businesses; current involvement in 
transactions or supporting activities involving Russian assets 
or interests; failure to correctly interpret and apply laws and 
regulations, including those related to sanctions; perceived 
misalignment of Citi’s actions to its stated strategy in Russia; 
and the reputational impact from Citi’s activity and 
engagement with Ukraine or with non-Russian clients exiting 
their Russia businesses. Citi has considered the potential for 
reputation risk and taken actions to mitigate such risks. Citi 
established a Russia Special Review Process with 
management’s Reputation Risk Committee with oversight for 
significant Russia-related reputation risks and completed a 
number of reputation risk reviews of matters with a Russian 
nexus.

While Citi announced its intention to wind down its 
businesses in Russia, Citi will continue to manage those 
operations during the wind-down process and will be required 
to maintain certain limited operations to fulfill its remaining 
legal and regulatory obligations. Also, sanctions and sanctions 
compliance are highly complex and may change over time and 
result in increased operational risk. Failure to fully comply 
with relevant sanctions or the application of sanctions where 
they should not be applied may negatively impact Citi’s 
reputation. In addition, Citi currently performs services for, 
conducts business with or deals in non-sanctioned Russian-
owned businesses and Russian assets. This has attracted, and 
will likely continue to attract, negative attention, despite the 
previously disclosed plan to wind down nearly all its activities 
in the country, cessation of new business and client 
originations, and reduction of other exposures.

Citi’s continued presence or divestiture of businesses in 

Russia could also increase its susceptibility to cyberattacks 
that could negatively impact its relationships with clients and

Board’s Role in Overseeing Related Risks
The Citi Board of Directors (Board) and the Board’s Risk 
Management Committee (RMC) and its other Committees 
have received and continue to receive regular reports from 
senior management regarding the war in Ukraine and its

Citi may economically hedge the foreign currency risk in 

its net ARS-denominated assets to the extent possible and 
prudent using non-deliverable forward (NDF) derivative 
instruments that are primarily executed outside of Argentina. 
As of June 30, 2023, the international NDF market had very 
limited liquidity, resulting in Citi’s inability to economically 
hedge substantially all of its ARS exposure. Accordingly, and 
to the extent that Citi does not execute NDF contracts for this 
unhedged exposure in the future, Citi would record 
devaluations on its net ARS-denominated assets in earnings, 
without any benefit from a change in the fair value of 
derivative positions used to economically hedge the exposure. 
Citi continually evaluates its economic exposure to its 
Argentine counterparties and reserves for changes in credit 
risk and records mark-to-market adjustments for relevant 
market risks associated with its Argentine assets. Citi believes 
it has established an appropriate ACL on its Argentine loans, 
and appropriate fair value adjustments on Argentine assets and 
liabilities measured at fair value, for credit and sovereign risks 
under U.S. GAAP as of June 30, 2023. However, Citi may 
need to record additional reserves in the future, resulting in 
higher ICG cost of credit, should there be an increase in 
transfer risk associated with its Argentine exposures. For 
additional information on Citi’s emerging markets risks, 
including those related to its Argentine exposures, see “Risk 
Factors—Strategic Risks” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

Argentina
Citi operates in Argentina through its ICG businesses. As of 
June 30, 2023, Citi’s net investment in its Argentine 
operations was approximately $1.9 billion (compared to $1.8 
billion at March 31, 2023). Under U.S. GAAP, Citi uses the 
U.S. dollar as the functional currency for its operations in 
countries such as Argentina that are deemed highly 
inflationary. Citi therefore records the impact of exchange rate 
fluctuations on its net Argentine peso (ARS)–denominated 
assets directly in earnings. Accordingly, Citi seeks to reduce 
its overall ARS exposure in Argentina while complying with 
local capital and currency exposure limitations. As of June 30, 
2023, Citi’s net ARS exposure was approximately $1.6 billion, 
which decreased from the prior quarter as a result of Citi 
purchasing approximately $300 million of certain local 
government bonds during the second quarter that are indexed 
to the higher of the U.S. dollar exchange rate or the local 
inflation index. Such bonds may reduce the impact to Citi of a 
potential currency devaluation in the future, although it 
remains unclear how effective Citi’s strategies to reduce its 
ARS exposure may be.

As previously disclosed, the Central Bank of Argentina 
has continued to maintain certain capital and currency controls 
that generally restrict Citi’s ability to access U.S. dollars in 
Argentina and remit earnings from its Argentine operations. 
As a result, Citi’s net investment in its Argentine operations is 
likely to continue to increase as Citi generates net income in 
its Argentine franchise and its earnings cannot be remitted. 
Due to the currency controls implemented by the Central Bank 
of Argentina, certain indirect foreign exchange mechanisms 
have developed that some Argentine entities may use to obtain 
U.S. dollars, generally at rates that are significantly higher 
than Argentina’s official exchange rate. Citibank Argentina is 
precluded from accessing these alternative mechanisms, and 
these exchange mechanisms cannot be used to remeasure 
Citi’s net monetary assets into the U.S. dollar under U.S. 
GAAP. Citibank Argentina therefore uses Argentina’s official 
market exchange rate to remeasure its net ARS assets into the 
U.S. dollar, which was 256.7 ARS to 1 U.S. dollar as of June 
30, 2023. However, if Argentina’s official exchange rate 
converges with the approximate rate implied by the indirect 
foreign exchange mechanisms, Citi could incur a significant 
loss on its capital in Argentina. Current macroeconomic 
conditions in the country, along with sustained high inflation 
and low international reserves held by the Central Bank of 
Argentina, may result in an accelerated or steep depreciation 
of the official exchange rate in the near term. Citi cannot 
predict future fluctuations in Argentina’s official market 
exchange rate or to what extent Citi may be able to access U.S. 
dollars at the official exchange rate in the future.
