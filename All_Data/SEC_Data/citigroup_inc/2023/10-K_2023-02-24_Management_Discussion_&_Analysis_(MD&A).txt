INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS GROUP 

Institutional Clients Group (ICG) includes Services, Markets and Banking (for additional information on these businesses, see 
“Citigroup Operating Segments” above). ICG provides corporate, institutional and public sector clients around the world with a full 
range of wholesale banking products and services, including fixed income and equity sales and trading, foreign exchange, prime 
brokerage, derivative services, equity and fixed income research, corporate lending, investment banking and advisory services, cash 
management, trade finance and securities services. ICG transacts with clients in both cash instruments and derivatives, including fixed 
income, foreign currency, equity and commodity products. 

ICG’s revenue is generated primarily from fees and spreads associated with these activities. ICG earns fee income for assisting 
clients with transactional services and clearing and providing brokerage and investment banking services and other such activities. 
Such fees are recognized at the point in time when Citigroup’s performance under the terms of a contractual arrangement is 
completed, which is typically at the trade/execution date or closing of a transaction. Revenue generated from these activities is 
recorded in Commissions and fees and Investment banking fees. Revenue is also generated from assets under custody and 
administration, which is recognized as/when the associated promised service is satisfied, which normally occurs at the point in time 
the service is requested by the customer and provided by Citi. Revenue generated from these activities is primarily recorded in 
Administration and other fiduciary fees. For additional information on these various types of revenues, see Note 5.

In addition, as a market maker, ICG facilitates transactions, including holding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns 

the differential between the price at which it buys and sells the products. These price differentials and the unrealized gains and losses 
on the inventory are recorded in Principal transactions. Mark-to-market gains and losses on certain credit derivatives (used to 
economically hedge the corporate loan portfolio) are also recorded in Principal transactions (for additional information on Principal 
transactions revenue, see Note 6). Other primarily includes realized gains and losses on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, gains 
and losses on equity securities not held in trading accounts and other non-recurring gains and losses. Interest income earned on assets 
held, less interest paid on long- and short-term debt, secured funding transactions and customers deposits, is recorded as Net interest 
income.

The amount and types of Markets revenues are impacted by a variety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity; changes in 

market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as well as their 
implied volatilities; investor confidence and other macroeconomic conditions. Assuming all other market conditions do not change, 
increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in increases in revenues. However, changes in market conditions 
can significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads and the fair value of product inventory. For example, a decrease in 
market liquidity may increase bid/offer spreads, decrease client activity levels and widen credit spreads on product inventory 
positions. ICG’s management of the Markets businesses involves daily monitoring and evaluation of the above factors at the trading 
desk as well as the country level.

In the Markets businesses, client revenues are those revenues directly attributable to client transactions at the time of inception, 

including commissions, interest or fees earned. Client revenues do not include the results of client facilitation activities (e.g., holding 
product inventory in anticipation of client demand) or the results of certain economic hedging activities.

ICG’s international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 95 
countries and jurisdictions. As previously disclosed, Citi intends to end nearly all of the institutional banking services it offers in 
Russia by the end of the first quarter of 2023. Going forward, Citi’s only operations in Russia will be those necessary to fulfill its 
remaining legal and regulatory obligations. At this time, the estimated cost to be incurred in relation to this action is approximately 
$80 million (excluding the impact from any portfolio sales), primarily through 2024. For additional information about Citi’s continued 
efforts to reduce its operations and exposure in Russia, see “Legacy Franchises” and “Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—Country 
Risk—Russia” below.

At December 31, 2022, ICG had $1.7 trillion in assets and $845 billion in deposits. Securities services managed $22.2 trillion in 

assets under custody and administration at December 31, 2022, of which Citi provided both custody and administrative services to 
certain clients related to $1.9 trillion of such assets. Managed assets under trust were $4.0 trillion at December 31, 2022. For additional 
information on these operations, see “Administration and Other Fiduciary Fees” in Note 5.

(1)  Citi assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items. For example, securities that generate Net 
interest income may be risk managed by derivatives that are recorded in Principal transactions revenue within Non-interest revenue. For a description of the 
composition of these revenue line items, see Notes 4, 5 and 6.

(2)  Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. Gain (loss) on 

loan hedges include the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. The fixed premium 
costs of these hedges are netted against the corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. Citigroup’s results of operations excluding the 
impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.

The discussion of the results of operations for ICG below excludes (where noted) the impact of any gain (loss) on hedges of accrual 
loans, which are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.

2022 vs. 2021
Net income of $10.7 billion decreased 25%, primarily driven 
by substantially higher cost of credit and higher expenses, 
partially offset by higher revenues.

Revenues increased 3% (including gain (loss) on loan 
hedges), primarily reflecting higher Services and Markets 
revenues, partially offset by lower Banking revenues. Services 
revenues were up 27%, driven by higher revenues in both TTS 
and Securities services. Markets revenues were up 7%, 
primarily driven by higher Fixed income markets revenues, 
partially offset by lower Equity markets revenues and the 
impact of business actions taken to reduce RWA.

Banking revenues were down 35% (39% excluding the 

impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges), reflecting lower 
revenues in both Investment banking and Corporate lending.
Citi expects that revenues in its Markets and Investment 
banking businesses will continue to reflect the overall market 
environment during 2023. 

Within Services:

•

•

TTS revenues increased 32%, driven by 46% growth in 
net interest income and 10% growth in non-interest 
revenue, driven by deepening of existing client relations 
and gaining new clients across segments. The increase in 
net interest income was driven by both the cash and trade 
businesses, reflecting benefits from higher interest rates, 
balance sheet optimization, higher average deposits and 
higher average loans. Average deposits grew 1%, as 
volume growth was partially offset by the impact of 
foreign exchange translation. Average loans grew 11%, 
primarily driven by the strength in trade flows in Asia and 
Latin America, partially offset by loan sales in North 
America. Strong non-interest revenues growth across both 
cash and trade businesses reflected client engagement and 
growth from underlying drivers, including higher U.S. 
dollar clearing volumes (up 2%), cross-border flows (up 
11%) and commercial card spend (up 49%).
Securities services revenues increased 15%, primarily 
driven by an increase in net interest income, reflecting 
higher interest rates across currencies as well as the 
impact of foreign exchange translation. Non-interest 
revenues decreased 1%, due to the impact of foreign 
exchange translation and lower fees in the custody 
business tied to lower assets under custody and 
administration (decline of 7%), driven by declines in 
global financial markets. The decline in non-interest 
revenues was partially offset by continued elevated levels 
of corporate activity in issuer services and new client 
onboarding of $1.2 trillion in assets under custody and 
administration. Average deposits declined 7%, due to 
clients seeking higher rate alternatives.

Within Markets:

•

Fixed income markets revenues increased 13%, driven by 
growth in rates and currencies across all regions, due to 
strong corporate and investor client engagement, partially 

15

•

•

offset by a decline in spread products, primarily driven by 
North America. 
Rates and currencies revenues increased 34%, reflecting 
increased market volatility, driven by rising interest rates 
and quantitative tightening, as central banks responded to 
elevated levels of inflation. Spread products and other 
fixed income revenues decreased 31%, due to continued 
lower client activity across spread products and a 
challenging credit market due to widening spreads for 
most of the year. The decline in spread products and other 
fixed income revenues was partially offset by strength in 
commodities, particularly with corporate clients, as the 
business assisted those clients in managing risk associated 
with the increased volatility. 
Equity markets revenues decreased 9%, driven by equity 
derivatives, primarily reflecting lower activity by both 
corporate and institutional clients compared to a strong 
prior year. The lower revenues also reflected a decline in 
equity cash, driven by lower client activity. 

Within Banking:

•

•

Investment banking revenues were down 53%, reflecting 
a significant decline in the overall market wallet and loss 
in wallet share, as heightened macroeconomic uncertainty 
and volatility continued to impact client activity. 
Advisory revenues decreased 24%, reflecting a decline in 
North America and EMEA, driven by the decline in the 
market wallet as well as loss in wallet share. Equity and 
debt underwriting revenues decreased 73% and 56% 
respectively, reflecting a decline in North America, 
EMEA and Asia and driven by the decline in the market 
wallet as well as wallet share loss. The decline in debt 
underwriting revenues also reflected markdowns on loan 
commitments and losses on loan sales.
Corporate lending revenues increased 8%, including the 
impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges. Excluding the 
impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges, revenues decreased 
8%, primarily driven by the impacts of foreign currency 
translation, higher cost of funds and higher hedging costs. 

Expenses were up 10%, primarily driven by continued 
investment in Citi’s transformation, business-led investments 
and volume-related expenses, partially offset by a Revlon-
related wire transfer recovery, the impact of foreign exchange 
translation and productivity savings. 

Provisions were $911 million, compared to a benefit of 
$2.5 billion in the prior year, driven by an ACL build, partially 
offset by lower net credit losses.

Net credit losses declined to $152 million, compared to 

$356 million in the prior year, driven by improvements in 
portfolio credit quality.

The ACL build was $759 million, compared to a release 
of $2.8 billion in the prior year. The ACL build was primarily 
driven by a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions. For 
additional information on Citi’s ACL, see “Significant 
Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” below.

MANAGING GLOBAL RISK 

Overview
For Citi, effective risk management is of primary importance 
to its overall operations. Accordingly, Citi has established an 
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework to ensure 
that all of Citi’s risks are managed appropriately and 
consistently across the Company and at an aggregate, 
enterprise-wide level. Citi’s culture drives a strong risk and 
control environment, and is at the heart of the ERM 
Framework, underpinning the way Citi conducts business. The 
activities that Citi engages in, and the risks those activities 
generate, must be consistent with Citi’s Mission and Value 
Proposition and the key Leadership Principles that support it, 
as well as Citi’s risk appetite. As discussed above, Citi also 
continues its efforts to comply with the FRB and OCC consent 
orders, relating principally to various aspects of risk 
management, compliance, data quality management and 
governance, and internal controls (see “Citi’s Consent Order 
Compliance” and “Risk Factors—Compliance Risks” above).
Under Citi’s Mission and Value Proposition, which was 
developed by its senior leadership and distributed throughout 
the Company, Citi strives to serve its clients as a trusted 
partner by responsibly providing financial services that enable 
growth and economic progress while earning and maintaining 
the public’s trust by constantly adhering to the highest ethical 
standards. As such, Citi asks all colleagues to ensure that their 
decisions pass three tests: they are in Citi’s clients’ best 
interests, create economic value and are always systemically 
responsible. 

As discussed in “Human Capital Resources and 

Management” above, Citi has designed Leadership Principles 
that represent the qualities, behaviors and expectations all 
employees must exhibit to deliver on Citi’s mission of 
enabling growth and economic progress. The Leadership 
Principles inform Citi’s ERM Framework and will contribute 
to creating a culture that drives client, control and operational 
excellence. Citi colleagues share a common responsibility to 
uphold these leadership principles and hold themselves to the 
highest standards of ethics and professional behavior in 
dealing with Citi’s clients, business colleagues, shareholders, 
communities and each other.

Citi’s ERM Framework details the principles used to 
support effective enterprise-wide risk management across the 
end-to-end risk management lifecycle. The ERM Framework 
covers the risk management roles and responsibilities of the 
Citigroup Board of Directors (the Board), Citi’s Executive 
Management Team (see “Risk Governance—Executive 
Management Team” below) and employees across the lines of 
defense. The underlying pillars of the framework encompass:

•

•

Culture—the core principles and behaviors that underpin 
a strong culture of risk awareness, in line with Citi’s 
Mission and Value Proposition, and Leadership 
Principles;
Governance—the committee structure and reporting 
arrangements that support the appropriate oversight of 
risk management activities at the Board and Executive 
Management Team levels;

60

•

•

Risk Management—the end-to-end risk management 
cycle including the identification, measurement, 
monitoring, controlling and reporting of all risks 
including top, material, growing, idiosyncratic and 
emerging risks, and aggregated to an enterprise-wide 
level; and
Enterprise Programs—the key risk management 
programs performed across the risk management lifecycle 
for all risk categories; these programs also outline the 
specific roles played by each of the lines of defense in 
these processes.

Each of these pillars is underpinned by supporting 
capabilities, which are the infrastructure, people, technology 
and data, and modelling and analytical capabilities that are in 
place to enable the execution of the ERM Framework.

Citi’s approach to risk management requires that its risk-
taking be consistent with its risk appetite. The risk appetite is 
the aggregate level and types of risk Citi is willing to take or 
tolerate in order to meet its strategic objectives and business 
plan. Citi’s risk appetite framework is the overall firm-wide 
approach, including policies, processes, controls and systems 
through which the risk appetite is established, communicated 
and monitored. In addition, underlying risk limits and 
thresholds are designed to control concentrations and 
operationalize risk appetite.

Citi’s risks are generally categorized and summarized as 

follows:

•

•

Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the decline in 
credit quality (or downgrade risk) or failure of a borrower, 
counterparty, third party or issuer to honor its financial or 
contractual obligations.
Liquidity risk is the risk that Citi will not be able to 
efficiently meet both expected and unexpected current and 
future cash flow and collateral needs without adversely 
affecting either daily operations or financial conditions of 
Citi. 

•

• Market risk (Trading and Non-Trading): Market risk of 
trading portfolios is the risk of loss arising from changes 
in the value of Citi’s assets and liabilities resulting from 
changes in market variables, such as interest rates, 
exchange rates, equity and commodity prices or credit 
spreads. Market risk of non-trading portfolios is the risk 
to current or projected financial condition and resilience 
arising from movements in interest rates resulting from 
repricing risk, basis risk, yield curve risk and options risk.
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from 
inadequate or failed internal processes, people and 
systems, or from external events. It includes legal risk, 
which is the risk of loss (including litigation costs, 
settlements and regulatory fines) resulting from Citi’s 
failure to comply with laws, regulations, prudent ethical 
standards or contractual obligations in any aspect of Citi’s 
business, but excludes strategic and reputation risks (see 
below).
Compliance risk is the risk to current or projected 
financial condition and resilience arising from violations 
of laws, rules or regulations, or from non-conformance 

•

•

•

with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures 
or ethical standards. 
Reputation risk is the risk to current or projected financial 
conditions and resilience from negative opinion held by 
stakeholders. 
Strategic risk is the risk of a sustained impact (not 
episodic impact) to Citi’s core strategic objectives as 
measured by impacts on anticipated earnings, market 
capitalization or capital, arising from the external factors 
affecting the Company’s operating environment; as well 
as the risks associated with defining the strategy and 
executing the strategy, which are identified, measured and 
managed as part of the Strategic Risk Framework at the 
Enterprise Level.

Citi uses a lines of defense model as a key component of 
its ERM Framework to manage its risks. As discussed below, 
the lines of defense model brings together risk-taking, risk 
oversight and risk assurance under one umbrella and provides 
an avenue for risk accountability of first line of defense, a 
construct for effective challenge by the second line of defense 
(Independent Risk Management and Independent Compliance 
Risk Management), and empowers independent risk assurance 
by the third line of defense (Internal Audit). In addition, the 
lines of defense model includes organizational units tasked 
with supporting a strong control environment (“enterprise 
support functions”). The first, second and third lines of 
defense, along with enterprise support functions, have distinct 
roles and responsibilities and are empowered to perform 
relevant risk management processes and responsibilities in 
order to manage Citi’s risks in a consistent and effective 
manner.

First Line of Defense: Front Line Units and Front Line 
Unit Activities
Citi’s first line of defense owns the risks and associated 
controls inherent in, or arising from, the execution of its 
business activities and is responsible for identifying, 
measuring, monitoring, controlling and reporting those risks 
consistent with Citi’s strategy, Mission and Value Proposition, 
Leadership Principles and risk appetite. 

Front line units are responsible and held accountable for 
managing the risks associated with their activities within the 
boundaries set by independent risk management. They are also 
responsible for designing and implementing effective internal 
controls and maintaining processes for managing their risk 
profile, including through risk mitigation, so that it remains 
consistent with Citi’s established risk appetite.

Front line unit activities are considered part of the first 

line of defense and are subject to the oversight and challenge 
of independent risk management. 

The first line of defense is composed of Citi’s Business 

Management, Regional Management, certain Corporate 
Functions (Enterprise Operations and Technology, Chief 
Administrative Office, Global Public Affairs, Office of the 
Citibank Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Finance), as well 
as other front line unit activities. Front line units may also 
include enterprise support units and/or conduct enterprise 
support activities—see “Enterprise Support Functions” below.

Second Line of Defense: Independent Risk Management 
Independent risk management units are independent of the 
first line of defense. They are responsible for overseeing the 
risk-taking activities of the first line of defense and 
challenging the first line of defense in the execution of its risk 
management responsibilities. They are also responsible for 
independently identifying, measuring, monitoring, controlling 
and reporting aggregate risks and for setting standards for the 
management and oversight of risk. Independent risk 
management is composed of Independent Risk Management 
(IRM) and Independent Compliance Risk Management 
(ICRM), which are led by the Group Chief Risk Officer 
(CRO) and Group Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) who have 
unrestricted access to the Board and its Risk Management 
Committee to facilitate the ability to execute their specific 
responsibilities pertaining to escalation to the Board.

Independent Risk Management
The IRM organization sets risk and control standards for the 
first line of defense and actively manages and oversees 
aggregate credit, market (trading and non-trading), liquidity, 
strategic, operational and reputation risks across Citi, 
including risks that span categories, such as concentration risk, 
country risk and climate risk. 

IRM is organized to align to risk categories, legal entities/
regions and Company-wide, cross-risk functions or processes. 
Each of these units reports to a member of the Risk 
Management Executive Council, who are all direct reports to 
the Citigroup CRO.

Independent Compliance Risk Management 
The ICRM organization actively oversees compliance risk 
across Citi, sets compliance risk and control standards for the 
first line of defense to manage compliance risk and promotes 
business conduct and activity that is consistent with Citi’s 
Mission and Value Proposition and the compliance risk 
appetite. Citi’s objective is to embed an enterprise-wide 
compliance risk management framework and culture that 
identifies, measures, monitors, controls and escalates 
compliance risk across Citi. 

ICRM is aligned by product line, function and geography 

to provide compliance risk management advice and credible 
challenge on day-to-day matters and strategic decision-making 
for key initiatives. ICRM also has program-level Enterprise 
Compliance units responsible for setting standards and 
establishing priorities for program-related compliance efforts. 
These Compliance Risk Management heads report directly to 
the CCO. The CCO reports to Citi’s General Counsel and 
ICRM is organizationally part of the Global Legal Affairs & 
Compliance group. In addition, the CCO has matrix reporting 
into the CRO and is part of the Risk Management Executive 
Council.

Third Line of Defense: Internal Audit
Internal Audit is independent of the first line, second line and 
enterprise support functions. The role of Internal Audit is to 
provide independent, objective, reliable, valued and timely 
assurance to the Board, its Audit Committee, Citi senior 
management and regulators over the effectiveness of 
governance, risk management and controls that mitigate 

61

current and evolving risks and enhance the control culture 
within Citi. The Citi Chief Auditor manages Internal Audit 
and reports functionally to the Chairman of the Citi Audit 
Committee and administratively to the Citi Chief Executive 
Officer. The Citi Chief Auditor has unrestricted access to the 
Board and the Board Audit Committee to address risks and 
issues identified through Internal Audit’s activities. 

Enterprise Support Functions
Enterprise support functions engage in activities that support 
safety and soundness across Citi. These functions provide 
advisory services and/or design, implement, maintain and 
oversee Company-wide programs that support Citi in 
maintaining an effective control environment. 

Enterprise support functions are composed of Human 
Resources and Legal (including Citi Security and Investigative 
Services). Front line units may also include enterprise support 
units and/or conduct enterprise support activities (e.g., the 
Controllers Group within Finance). 

Enterprise support functions, units and activities are 
subject to the relevant Company-wide independent oversight 
processes specific to the risks for which they are accountable 
(e.g., operational risk, compliance risk, reputation risk).

Risk Governance
Citi’s ERM Framework encompasses risk management 
processes to address risks undertaken by Citi through 
identification, measurement, monitoring, controlling and 
reporting of all risks. The ERM Framework integrates these 
processes with appropriate governance to complement Citi’s 
commitment to maintaining strong and consistent risk 
management practices.

Board Oversight
The Board is responsible for oversight of Citi and holds the 
Executive Management Team accountable for implementing 
the ERM Framework, meeting strategic objectives within 
Citi’s risk appetite.

Executive Management Team
The Board delegates authority to an Executive Management 
Team for directing and overseeing day-to-day management of 
Citi. The Executive Management Team is led by the Citigroup 
CEO and provides oversight of group activities, both directly 
and through authority delegated to committees it has 
established to oversee the management of risk, to ensure 
continued alignment with Citi’s risk strategy.

Board and Executive Management Committees
The Board executes its responsibilities either directly or 
through its committees. The Board has delegated authority to 
the following Board standing committees to help fulfill its 
oversight and risk management responsibilities:

•

Risk Management Committee (RMC): assists the Board in 
fulfilling its responsibility with respect to (i) oversight of 
Citi’s risk management framework, including the 
significant policies and practices used in managing credit, 
market, liquidity, strategic, operational, compliance, 
reputation and certain other risks, including those 
pertaining to capital management, and (ii) performance 

62

•

•

•

•

oversight of the Global Risk Review—credit, capital and 
collateral review functions.
Audit Committee: provides oversight of Citi’s financial 
reporting and internal control risk, as well as Internal 
Audit and Citi’s external independent accountants.
Compensation, Performance Management and Culture 
Committee: provides oversight of compensation of Citi’s 
employees and Citi management’s sustained focus on 
fostering a principled culture of sound ethics, responsible 
conduct and accountability within the organization.
Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee: 
provides oversight of reputational issues, Environmental, 
Social and Governance (ESG) and sustainability matters, 
and legal and regulatory compliance risks as they relate to 
corporate governance matters.
Technology Committee: assists the Board in fulfilling its 
responsibility with respect to oversight of (i) Citigroup’s 
technology strategy and operating plan and the 
development of Citi’s target operating model and 
architecture, (ii) technology-based risk management, 
including Cyber Security, (iii) technology-related 
resource and talent planning and (iv) third-party 
management policies, practices and standards.

In addition to the above, the Board has established the 
following ad hoc committee: 

•

Transformation Oversight Committee: provides oversight 
of the actions of Citi’s management to develop and 
execute a transformation of Citi’s risk and control 
environment pursuant to the recent regulatory consent 
orders (for additional information see “Citi’s Consent 
Order Compliance” above).

The Executive Management Team has established five 
standing committees that cover the primary risks to which Citi 
(i.e., Group) is exposed. These consist of:

•

•

•

•

Group Strategic Risk Committee (GSRC): provides 
governance oversight of Citi’s management actions to 
adequately identify, monitor, report, manage and escalate 
all material strategic risks facing Citi. 
Citigroup Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO): 
responsible for governance over management’s Liquidity 
Risk and Market Risk (non-trading) management and for 
monitoring and influencing the balance sheet, investment 
securities and capital management activities of Citigroup.
Group Risk Management Committee (GRMC): the 
primary senior executive level committee responsible for 
(i) overseeing the execution of Citigroup’s ERM 
Framework, (ii) monitoring Citi’s risk profile at an 
aggregate level inclusive of individual risk categories, (iii) 
ensuring that Citi’s risk profile remains consistent with its 
approved risk appetite and (iv) discussing material and 
emerging risk issues facing the Company. The Committee 
also provides comprehensive Group-wide coverage of all 
risk categories, including Credit Risk and Market Risk 
(trading).
Group Business Risk and Control Committee (GBRCC): 
provides governance oversight of Citi’s Compliance and 
Operational Risks. 

 
•

Group Reputation Risk Committee (GRRC): provides 
governance oversight for Reputation Risk management 
across Citi.

In addition to the Executive Management committees 
listed above, management may establish ad-hoc committees in 
response to regulatory feedback or to manage additional 
activities when deemed necessary.

The figure below illustrates the reporting lines between the Board and Executive Management committees:

Credit exposures are generally reported in notional terms 

for accrual loans, reflecting the value at which the loans as 
well as other off-balance sheet commitments are carried on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Credit exposure arising from 
capital markets activities is generally expressed as the current 
mark-to-market, net of margin, reflecting the net value owed 
to Citi by a given counterparty. 

The credit risk associated with Citi’s credit exposures is a 
function of the idiosyncratic creditworthiness of the obligor, as 
well as the terms and conditions of the specific obligation. Citi 
assesses the credit risk associated with its credit exposures on 
a regular basis through its allowance for credit losses (ACL) 
process (see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant 
Estimates—Allowance for Credit Losses” below and Notes 1 
and 15), as well as through regular stress testing at the 
company, business, geography and product levels. These 
stress-testing processes typically estimate potential 
incremental credit costs that would occur as a result of either 
downgrades in the credit quality or defaults of the obligors or 
counterparties. See Note 14 for additional information on 
Citi’s credit risk management. 

CREDIT RISK

Overview
Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the decline in 
credit quality of a client, customer or counterparty (or 
downgrade risk) or the failure of a borrower, counterparty, 
third party or issuer to honor its financial or contractual 
obligations. Credit risk is one of the most significant risks Citi 
faces as an institution. For additional information, see “Risk 
Factors—Credit Risk” above. Credit risk arises in many of 
Citigroup’s business activities, including:

•
•
•
•

consumer, commercial and corporate lending; 
capital markets derivative transactions; 
structured finance; and 
securities financing transactions (repurchase and reverse 
repurchase agreements, and securities loaned and 
borrowed).

Credit risk also arises from clearing and settlement 
activities, when Citi transfers an asset in advance of receiving 
its counter-value or advances funds to settle a transaction on 
behalf of a client. Concentration risk, within credit risk, is the 
risk associated with having credit exposure concentrated 
within a specific client, industry, region or other category.

Citi has an established framework in place for managing 

credit risk across all businesses that includes a defined risk 
appetite, credit limits and credit policies. Citi’s credit risk 
management framework also includes policies and procedures 
to manage problem exposures.

To manage concentration risk, Citi has in place a 
framework consisting of industry limits, single-name 
concentrations for each business and across Citigroup and a 
specialized product limit framework.

CORPORATE CREDIT
Consistent with its overall strategy, Citi’s corporate clients are 
typically corporations that value the depth and breadth of 
Citi’s global network. Citi aims to establish relationships with 
these clients whose needs encompass multiple products, 
including cash management and trade services, foreign 
exchange, lending, capital markets and M&A advisory.

Corporate Credit Portfolio
The following table details Citi’s corporate credit portfolio within ICG and the Mexico SBMM component of Legacy Franchises 
(excluding certain loans managed on a delinquency basis, loans carried at fair value and loans held-for-sale), and before consideration 
of collateral or hedges, by remaining tenor for the periods indicated:

and counterparty. The following table shows the percentage of 
this portfolio by region based on Citi’s internal management

The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings 
across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison 
of credit exposure across all lines of business, geographic 
regions and products. Counterparty risk ratings reflect an 
estimated probability of default for a counterparty, and 
internal risk ratings are derived by leveraging validated 
statistical models and scorecards in combination with 
consideration of factors specific to the obligor or market, such 
as management experience, competitive position, regulatory 
environment and commodity prices. Facility risk ratings are 
assigned that reflect the probability of default of the obligor 
and factors that affect the loss given default of the facility, 
such as support or collateral. Internal obligor ratings that 
generally correspond to BBB and above are considered 
investment grade, while those below are considered non-
investment grade.

by facility risk rating as a percentage of the total corporate

Note: Total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending 
commitments. 

In addition to the obligor and facility risk ratings assigned 

to all exposures, Citi may classify exposures in the corporate 
credit portfolio. These classifications are consistent with Citi’s 
interpretation of the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of 
criticized exposures, which may categorize exposures as 
special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss.

Risk ratings and classifications are reviewed regularly and 
adjusted as appropriate. The credit review process incorporates 
quantitative and qualitative factors, including financial and 
non-financial disclosures or metrics, idiosyncratic events or 
changes to the competitive, regulatory or macroeconomic 
environment. This includes but is not limited to exposures in 
those sectors significantly impacted by the COVID-19 

 
 
 
pandemic (including consumer retail, commercial real estate 
and transportation). 

Citi believes the corporate credit portfolio to be 

appropriately rated and classified as of December 31, 2022. 
Citigroup has taken action to adjust internal ratings and 
classifications of exposures as both the macroeconomic 
environment and obligor-specific factors have changed, 
particularly where additional stress has been seen. 

As obligor risk ratings are downgraded, the probability of 

default increases. Downgrades of obligor risk ratings tend to 
result in a higher provision for credit losses. In addition, 
downgrades may result in the purchase of additional credit 
derivatives or other risk mitigants to hedge the incremental 
credit risk, or may result in Citi’s seeking to reduce exposure 
to an obligor or an industry sector. Citi will continue to review 
exposures to ensure that the appropriate probability of default 
is incorporated into all risk assessments.

See Note 14 for additional information on Citi’s corporate 

credit portfolio.

(1)  Excludes $0.6 billion and $0.1 billion of funded and unfunded exposure at December 31, 2022, respectively, primarily related to the delinquency-managed loans 

and unearned income. Funded balances also exclude loans carried at fair value of $5.1 billion at December 31, 2022. 
Includes non-accrual loan exposures and criticized unfunded exposures.

(2) 
(3)  Represents the amount of purchased credit protection in the form of derivatives to economically hedge funded and unfunded exposures. Of the $39.8 billion of 

purchased credit protection, $36.6 billion represents the total notional amount of purchased credit derivatives on individual reference entities. The remaining $3.2 
billion represents the first loss tranche of portfolios of purchased credit derivatives with a total notional of $27.6 billion, where the protection seller absorbs the 
first loss on the referenced loan portfolios.

(4)  Autos total credit exposure includes securitization financing facilities secured by auto loans and leases, extended mainly to the finance company subsidiaries of 
global auto manufacturers, bank subsidiaries and independent auto finance companies, of approximately $17.4 billion ($10.3 billion in funded, with more than 
99% rated investment grade) as of December 31, 2022.
In addition to this exposure, Citi has energy-related exposure within the public sector (e.g., energy-related state-owned entities) and the transportation and 
industrials sector (e.g., off-shore drilling entities) included in the table above. As of December 31, 2022, Citi’s total exposure to these energy-related entities was

(1)  Excludes $0.6 billion and $0.1 billion of funded and unfunded exposure at December 31, 2021, respectively, primarily related to the delinquency-managed loans 

and unearned income. Funded balances also excludes loans carried at fair value of $6.1 billion at December 31, 2021. 
Includes non-accrual loan exposures and criticized unfunded exposures.

(2) 
(3)  Represents the amount of purchased credit protection in the form of derivatives to economically hedge funded and unfunded exposures. Of the $39.3 billion of 

purchased credit protection, $36.0 billion represents the total notional amount of purchased credit derivatives on individual reference entities. The remaining $3.3 
billion represents the first loss tranche of portfolios of purchased credit derivatives with a total notional of $28.4 billion, where the protection seller absorbs the 
first loss on the referenced loan portfolios.

(4)  Autos total credit exposure includes securitization financing facilities secured by auto loans and leases, extended mainly to the finance company subsidiaries of 

(5) 

global auto manufacturers, bank subsidiaries and independent auto finance companies, of approximately $17.9 billion ($6.5 billion in funded, with more than 99% 
rated investment grade) at December 31, 2021.
In addition to this exposure, Citi has energy-related exposure within the public sector (e.g., energy-related state-owned entities) and the transportation and 
industrials sector (e.g., off-shore drilling entities) included in the table above. As of December 31, 2021, Citi’s total exposure to these energy-related entities was 
approximately $5.1 billion, of which approximately $2.6 billion consisted of direct outstanding funded loans.

Credit Risk Mitigation
As part of its overall risk management activities, Citigroup 
uses credit derivatives and other risk mitigants to hedge 
portions of the credit risk in its corporate credit portfolio, in 
addition to outright asset sales. Citi may enter into partial-term 
hedges as well as full-term hedges. In advance of the 
expiration of partial-term hedges, Citi will determine, among 
other factors, the economic feasibility of hedging the 
remaining life of the instrument. The results of the mark-to-
market and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives 
are reflected primarily in Principal transactions in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income.

At December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022 and 

December 31, 2021, ICG had economic hedges on the 
corporate credit portfolio of $39.8 billion, $36.5 billion and 
$39.3 billion, respectively. Citi’s expected credit loss model 
used in the calculation of its ACL does not include the 
favorable impact of credit derivatives and other mitigants that 
are marked-to-market. In addition, the reported amounts of 
direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments in the 
tables above do not reflect the impact of these hedging 
transactions. The credit protection was economically hedging 
underlying ICG corporate credit portfolio exposures with the 
following risk rating distribution:

PBWM fulfills a broad spectrum of customer financial needs, 
with U.S. Personal Banking providing retail banking, credit 
card, personal loan, mortgage and small business banking, and 
Global Wealth offering wealth management lending and other 
products globally to affluent to ultra-high-net-worth customer 
segments through the Private bank, Wealth at Work and 
Citigold. PBWM’s retail banking products include a generally 
prime portfolio built through well-defined lending parameters 
within Citi’s risk appetite framework. 

Legacy Franchises also provides such activities in its 

remaining markets through Asia Consumer and Mexico 
Consumer. The Legacy Franchises consumer credit 
information discussed below reflects only those exit market 
portfolios that remained held-for-investment (versus held-for-
sale) as of each period. The Philippines was reclassified to 
held-for-sale as of 4Q21, followed by Malaysia, Thailand, 
Indonesia, Vietnam, Taiwan, India and Bahrain in 1Q22. As a 
result, China, Korea, Russia and Poland were the only 
portfolios that remained held-for-investment and are reflected 
in the discussion below as of 4Q22.

(1) End-of-period loans include interest and fees on credit cards.
(2) Legacy Franchises—4Q22 Asia Consumer loan balances exclude approximately $12 billion of loans ($9 billion of retail banking loans and $3 billion of credit 
card loan balances) reclassified to held-for-sale (HFS) (in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet) as a result of Citi’s signed agreements to sell its 
consumer banking businesses in four countries: Indonesia, Vietnam, Taiwan and India, which were reclassified to HFS starting 1Q22. (See Legacy Franchises 
above and Note 2 for additional information.) The Malaysia, Thailand and Bahrain sales closed during the fourth quarter of 2022 and were also reclassified to HFS 
starting 1Q22. The Philippines consumer banking business was reclassified to HFS from 4Q21 until the closing of its sale on August 1, 2022. Accordingly, loans 
from these sold businesses are excluded from the Asia Consumer loan balances as of the end of such periods.

(3) Consists of $98.2 billion, $99.3 billion, $94.6 billion, $94.1 billion and $92.7 billion of loans in North America as of December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022, 

June 30, 2022, March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. For additional information on the credit quality of the Global Wealth portfolio, see Note 14.

2022, June 30, 2022, March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

(5) See Note 14 for details on loan-to-value ratios for the portfolios and FICO scores for the U.S. portfolio.
(6) At December 31, 2022, includes approximately $49 billion of classifiably managed loans. Over 90% of these loans are fully collateralized (consisting primarily of 
marketable investment securities, commercial real estate and limited partner capital commitments in private equity) and have experienced very low historical 
NCLs. As discussed below, approximately 95% of the classifiably managed portion of these loans are investment grade. See “Consumer Loan Delinquencies 
Amounts and Ratios” below for details on the delinquency-managed portfolio.

(7) Asia Consumer also includes loans and leases in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.

Consumer Credit Trends

Personal Banking and Wealth Management (PBWM)

Personal Banking and Wealth Management

U.S. Personal Banking’s Branded cards portfolio includes 

proprietary and co-branded cards. 

As shown in the chart above, the fourth quarter of 2022 
net credit loss rate in Branded cards increased quarter-over-
quarter and year-over-year, driven by an increase in net flow 
rates, primarily reflecting ongoing normalization from 
historically low levels.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-
over-quarter and year-over year, also driven by an increase in 
net flow rates, primarily reflecting the ongoing normalization.

Retail Services

As indicated above, PBWM consists of U.S. Personal Banking 
and Global Wealth Management (Global Wealth). U.S. 
Personal Banking provides card products through Branded 
cards and Retail services, and also includes mortgages and 
home equity, small business and personal consumer loans 
through Citi’s Retail banking network. The Retail bank is 
concentrated in six major U.S. metropolitan areas. Global 
Wealth provides investment services, cards, mortgages and 
personal, small business and other consumer loans through the 
Private bank, Wealth at Work and Citigold. 

As of December 31, 2022, approximately 45% of PBWM 
consumer loans consisted of Branded cards and Retail services 
card loans, which generally drives the overall credit 
performance of PBWM, as U.S. Cards net credit losses 
represent approximately 90% of total PBWM losses. 

As shown in the chart above, the fourth quarter of 2022 
net credit loss rate in PBWM increased quarter-over-quarter 
and year-over-year, driven by an increase in net flow rates, 
primarily reflecting ongoing normalization from historically 
low levels in U.S. Cards.

PBWM’s 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, also driven by an 
increase in net flow rates, primarily reflecting the ongoing 
normalization in U.S. Cards.

Branded Cards

U.S. Personal Banking’s Retail services partners directly 

with more than 20 retailers and dealers to offer private label 
and co-branded cards. Retail services’ target market focuses 
on select industry segments such as home improvement, 
specialty retail, consumer electronics and fuel. Retail services 
continually evaluates opportunities to add partners within 
target industries that have strong loyalty, lending or payment 
programs and growth potential.

As shown in the chart above, the fourth quarter of 2022 
net credit loss rate in Retail services increased quarter-over-
quarter and year-over-year, driven by an increase in net flow 
rates, primarily reflecting the ongoing normalization from 
historically low levels.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-
over-quarter and year-over-year, also driven by an increase in 
net flow rates, primarily reflecting the ongoing normalization. 

For additional information on cost of credit, loan 

delinquency and other information for Citi’s cards portfolios,

(1)  Asia Consumer includes Legacy Franchises activities in certain EMEA 

countries for all periods presented.

As shown in the chart above, the fourth quarter of 2022 

net credit loss rate in Asia Consumer for the remaining 
portfolios held-for-investment (China, Korea, Russia and 
Poland) increased quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by 
lower average loans due to the ongoing wind-down of the 
businesses, particularly in Korea (decline of $1.5 billion) and 
the sale of the personal loan portfolio in Russia in the fourth 
quarter of 2022. The net credit loss rate increased year-over-
year, primarily driven by lower average loans due to the 
ongoing wind-down of the businesses, particularly in Korea 
(decline of $7.8 billion) and the sale of the personal loan 
portfolio in Russia, partially offset by the reclassification of 
loans to held-for-sale during 2022.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate was largely 
unchanged quarter-over-quarter and decreased year-over-year, 
mainly driven by the impact of the Asia Consumer held-for-
sale reclassifications, partially offset by the effect of declining 
loans due to the ongoing wind-down of the businesses, 
including the sale of the personal loan portfolio in Russia.

The performance of Asia Consumer’s portfolios continues 

to reflect the strong credit profiles in the region’s target 
customer segments.

Mexico Consumer

U.S. Personal Banking’s Retail banking portfolio consists 
primarily of consumer mortgages (including home equity) and 
unsecured lending products, such as small business loans and 
personal loans. The portfolio is generally delinquency 
managed, where Citi evaluates credit risk based on FICO 
scores, delinquencies and the value of underlying collateral. 
The consumer mortgages in this portfolio have historically 
been extended to high credit quality customers, generally with 
loan-to-value ratios that are less than or equal to 80% on first 
and second mortgages. For additional information, see “Loan-
to-Value (LTV) Ratios” in Note 14.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 
Retail banking for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased slightly 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily driven by 
the continued impact of industry-wide episodic overdraft 
losses.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily driven by 
U.S. mortgages, which reflected the lasting effects of 
government stimulus, unemployment benefits and consumer 
relief programs.

Global Wealth

As discussed above, the Global Wealth credit portfolio 
primarily consists of consumer mortgages, cards and other 
lending products extended to customer segments that range 
from the affluent to ultra-high-net-worth through the Private 
bank, Wealth at Work and Citigold. These customer segments 
represent a target market that is characterized by historically 
low default rates and delinquencies. 

As of December 31, 2022, approximately $49 billion, or 
33%, of the portfolio was classifiably managed and primarily 
consisted of margin lending, commercial real estate, 
subscription credit finance and other lending programs. These 
classifiably managed loans are primarily evaluated for credit 
risk based on their internal risk rating, of which 95% is rated 
investment grade. While the delinquency rate in the chart 
above is calculated only for the delinquency-managed 
portfolio, the net credit loss rate is calculated using net credit 
losses for both the delinquency and classifiably managed 
portfolios.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate and 

90+ days past due delinquency rate were broadly stable 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, reflecting the strong 
credit profiles of the portfolios. The net credit loss rate 
increased slightly quarter-over-quarter, due to a classifiably 
managed loan charge-off. The low levels of net credit losses

Mexico Consumer operates in Mexico through 

Citibanamex and provides credit cards, consumer mortgages 
and small business and personal loans. Mexico Consumer 
serves a more mass-market segment in Mexico and focuses on 
developing multiproduct relationships with customers.

As shown in the chart above, the fourth quarter of 2022 

net credit loss rate in Mexico Consumer decreased quarter-
over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily driven by the 
impact of the charge-off of peak delinquencies in early 2021, 
which resulted in lower delinquencies, leading to lower net 
credit losses in the current quarter. 

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate was largely 
unchanged quarter-over-quarter and decreased year-over-year, 
primarily driven by the impact of the charge-off of peak 
delinquencies and higher payment rates.

For additional information on cost of credit, loan 
delinquency and other information for Citi’s consumer loan 
portfolios, see each respective business’s results of operations 
above and Note 14.

U.S. Cards FICO Distribution
The following tables show the current FICO score 
distributions for Citi’s Branded cards and Retail services 
portfolios based on end-of-period receivables. FICO scores are 
updated monthly for substantially all of the portfolio and on a 
quarterly basis for the remaining portfolio.

(1) The FICO bands in the tables are consistent with general industry peer 

presentations. 

The FICO distribution of both cards portfolios shifted 
slightly lower across the credit bands from the prior quarter 
and the prior year consistent with the ongoing normalization in 
net credit loss and delinquency rates in the portfolios. The 
FICO distribution continues to reflect strong underlying credit 
quality and a benefit from the continued impacts of 
government stimulus, unemployment benefits and customer 
relief programs. See Note 14 for additional information on 
FICO scores.

(1) End-of-period (EOP) loans include interest and fees on credit cards.
(2) The ratios of 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due are calculated based on EOP loans, net of unearned income.
(3) The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios for Retail banking exclude loans guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies since the 

potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) 
were $89 million ($0.6 billion), $185 million ($1.1 billion) and $171 million ($0.7 billion) at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The amounts 
excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans) were $70 million, 
$74 million and $98 million at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The EOP loans in the table include the guaranteed loans.

(4) The 90+ days past due balances for Branded cards and Retail services are generally still accruing interest. Citi’s policy is generally to accrue interest on credit card 

loans until 180 days past due, unless notification of bankruptcy filing has been received earlier.

(5) Excludes EOP classifiably managed Private bank loans. These loans are not included in the delinquency numerator, denominator and ratios.
(6) These loans are evaluated for non-accrual status and write-off primarily based on their internal risk classification and not solely on their delinquency status, and 

therefore delinquency metrics are excluded from this table. As of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, 96%, 94% and 92% of Global Wealth classifiably managed 
loans were rated investment grade. For additional information on the credit quality of the Global Wealth portfolio, including classifiably managed portfolios, see 
“Consumer Credit Trends” above.

(7) Asia Consumer includes delinquencies and loans in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.

(8) Citi recently entered into agreements to sell certain Asia consumer banking businesses. Accordingly, the loans of these businesses have been reclassified as HFS 

in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and hence the loans and related delinquencies and ratios are not included in this table. The reclassifications 
commenced as follows: Australia (3Q21, and closed on June 1, 2022), the Philippines (4Q21, and closed on August 1, 2022) and Bahrain, India, Indonesia, 
Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam (1Q22) (Bahrain, Malaysia and Thailand closed in 4Q22). See Note 2 for additional information. 

(9) The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are primarily related to U.S. mortgages guaranteed by U.S. 
government-sponsored agencies since the potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the U.S. agencies. The amounts excluded for 90+ days past due and 
(EOP loans) were $90 million ($0.3 billion), $138 million ($0.4 billion) and $183 million ($0.5 billion) at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The 
amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans) were $37 
million, $35 million and $73 million at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The EOP loans in the table include the guaranteed loans.

(1)  North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Mexico is included in offices outside North America. The classification of corporate loans between 

offices in North America and outside North America is based on the domicile of the booking unit. The difference between the domicile of the booking unit and the 
domicile of the managing unit is not material.

(2)  Loans secured primarily by real estate.
(3)  Consumer loans are net of unearned income of $712 million, $629 million, $692 million, $732 million and $703 million at December 31, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019 

and 2018, respectively. Unearned income on consumer loans primarily represents unamortized origination fees and costs, premiums and discounts. 

(4)  Corporate loans include Mexico SBMM loans and are net of unearned income of $(797) million, $(770) million, $(787) million, $(763) million and $(817) million 
at December 31, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Unearned income on corporate loans primarily represents interest received in advance, but not yet 
earned, on loans originated on a discounted basis.

(5)  Because loans carried at fair value do not have an ACLL, they are excluded from the ACLL ratio calculation.

(1) On January 1, 2020, Citi adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 326, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (CECL). The ASC introduces a new credit 
loss methodology requiring earlier recognition of credit losses while also providing additional disclosure about credit risk. On January 1, 2020, Citi recorded a 
$4.1 billion, or an approximate 29%, pretax increase in the Allowance for credit losses, along with a $3.1 billion after-tax decrease in Retained earnings and a 
deferred tax asset increase of $1.0 billion. This transition impact reflects (i) a $4.9 billion build to the consumer ACL due to longer estimated tenors than under the 
incurred loss methodology under prior U.S. GAAP, net of recoveries, and (ii) a $0.8 billion decrease to the corporate ACL due to shorter remaining tenors, 
incorporation of recoveries and use of more specific historical loss data based on an increase in portfolio segmentation across industries and geographies. See Note 
1 for further discussion on the impact of Citi’s adoption of CECL.

(2) Citi had a change in accounting related to its variable post-charge-off third-party collection costs that was recorded as an adjustment to its January 1, 2020 opening 

(3)

(4)

(8)

allowance for credit losses on loans of $443 million. See Note 1.
Includes all adjustments to the allowance for credit losses, such as changes in the allowance from acquisitions, dispositions, securitizations, FX translation, 
purchase accounting adjustments, etc.
2022 includes an approximate $350 million reclass related to the announced sales of Citi’s consumer banking businesses in Thailand, India, Malaysia, Taiwan, 
Indonesia, Bahrain and Vietnam. Also includes a decrease of approximately $100 million related to FX translation.
2021 includes an approximate $280 million reclass related to Citi’s agreement to sell its Australia consumer banking business and an approximate $90 million 
reclass related to Citi’s agreement to sell its Philippines consumer banking business. Those ACLL were reclassified to Other assets during 2021. 2021 also 
includes a decrease of approximately $134 million related to FX translation.
2020 includes reductions of approximately $4 million related to the transfer to HFS of various real estate loan portfolios. In addition, 2020 includes an increase of 
approximately $97 million related to FX translation.
2019 includes reductions of approximately $42 million related to the sale or transfer to HFS of various loan portfolios. In addition, 2019 includes a reduction of 
approximately $60 million related to FX translation.
2018 includes reductions of approximately $201 million related to the sale or transfer to HFS of various loan portfolios, which include approximately $106 million 
related to the transfer of various real estate loan portfolios to HFS. 

(9) December 31, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018 exclude $5.4 billion, $6.1 billion, $6.9 billion, $4.1 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively, of loans that are carried 

at fair value.

(10) 2020 corporate ACLUC includes a non-provision transfer of $68 million, representing reserves on performance guarantees. The reserves on these contracts were 

reclassified out of the ACL on unfunded lending commitments and into other liabilities.

(11) Represents additional credit reserves recorded as Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
(12) Beginning in 2020, under CECL, the ACLL represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio and troubled debt restructurings. See 

“Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” and Note 1 below. Attribution of the ACLL is made for analytical purposes only and the entire ACLL 
is available to absorb credit losses in the overall portfolio. Prior to 2020, the ACLL represented management’s estimate of probable losses inherent in the 
portfolio, as well as probable losses related to large individually evaluated impaired loans and TDRs.

(2)

Includes both Branded cards and Retail services. As of December 31, 2022, the $11.4 billion of ACLL represented approximately 43 months of coincident net 
credit loss coverage (based on 4Q22 NCLs). As of December 31, 2022, Branded cards ACLL as a percentage of EOP loans was 6.2% and Retail services ACLL as 
a percentage of EOP loans was 10.3%. As of December 31, 2021, the $10.8 billion of ACLL represented approximately 63 months of coincident net credit loss 
coverage (based on 4Q21 NCLs). The decrease in the coincident coverage ratio at December 31, 2022 was primarily due to the relatively higher levels of NCLs in 
4Q22 versus 4Q21. As of December 31, 2021, Branded cards ACLL as a percentage of EOP loans was 7.1% and Retail services ACLL as a percentage of EOP 
loans was 10.0%.
Includes residential mortgages, retail loans and personal, small business and other loans, including those extended through the Private bank network.

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets and Renegotiated Loans
There is a certain amount of overlap among non-accrual loans 
and assets and renegotiated loans. The following summary 
provides a general description of each category.

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets:

•

•

•

•

•

Corporate and consumer (including commercial banking) 
non-accrual status is based on the determination that 
payment of interest or principal is doubtful.
A corporate loan may be classified as non-accrual and still 
be performing under the terms of the loan structure. Non-
accrual loans may still be current on interest payments. 
Citi’s corporate non-accrual loans were $1.1 billion, $1.5 
billion and $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2022, 
September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 
Of these, approximately 50%, 68% and 56% were 
performing at December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022 
and December 31, 2021, respectively.
Consumer non-accrual status is generally based on aging, 
i.e., the borrower has fallen behind on payments.
Consumer mortgage loans, other than Federal Housing 
Administration (FHA) insured loans, are classified as 
non-accrual within 60 days of notification that the 
borrower has filed for bankruptcy. In addition, home 
equity loans are classified as non-accrual if the related 
residential first mortgage loan is 90 days or more past 
due.
North America Branded cards and Retail services are not 
included because, under industry standards, credit card 
loans accrue interest until such loans are charged off, 
which typically occurs at 180 days of contractual 
delinquency.

Renegotiated Loans:

•

•

Includes both corporate and consumer loans whose terms 
have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring 
(TDR).
Includes both accrual and non-accrual TDRs.

Non-Accrual Loans
The table below summarizes Citigroup’s non-accrual loans as 
of the periods indicated. Non-accrual loans may still be current 
on interest payments. In situations where Citi reasonably 
expects that only a portion of the principal owed will 
ultimately be collected, all payments received are reflected as 
a reduction of principal and not as interest income. For all 
other non-accrual loans, cash interest receipts are generally 
recorded as revenue.

(1) Corporate loans are placed on non-accrual status based upon a review by Citigroup’s risk officers. Corporate non-accrual loans may still be current on interest 

payments. With limited exceptions, the following practices are applied for consumer loans: consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are placed on 
non-accrual status at 90 days past due and are charged off at 120 days past due; residential mortgage loans are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and 
written down to net realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent with industry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest on credit card loans until such 
loans are charged off, which typically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency. As such, the non-accrual loan disclosures do not include credit card loans. The 
balances above represent non-accrual loans within Corporate loans and Consumer loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

(2) The December 31, 2022 total corporate non-accrual loans represented 0.39% of total corporate loans. 
(3)  Asia Consumer includes balances in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.

LIQUIDITY RISK 

Overview
Adequate and diverse sources of funding and liquidity are 
essential to Citi’s businesses. Funding and liquidity risks arise 
from several factors, many of which are mostly or entirely 
outside Citi’s control, such as disruptions in the financial 
markets, changes in key funding sources, credit spreads, 
changes in Citi’s credit ratings and macroeconomic, 
geopolitical and other conditions. For additional information, 
see “Risk Factors—Liquidity Risks” above.

Citi’s funding and liquidity management objectives are 

aimed at (i) funding its existing asset base, (ii) growing its 
core businesses, (iii) maintaining sufficient liquidity, 
structured appropriately, so that Citi can operate under a 
variety of adverse circumstances, including potential 
Company-specific and/or market liquidity events in varying 
durations and severity, and (iv) satisfying regulatory 
requirements, including, but not limited to, those related to 
resolution planning (for additional information, see 
“Resolution Plan” and “Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity 
(TLAC)” below). Citigroup’s primary liquidity objectives are 
established by entity, and in aggregate, across two major 
categories:

•

•

Citibank (including Citibank Europe plc, Citibank 
Singapore Ltd. and Citibank (Hong Kong) Ltd.); and
Citi’s non-bank and other entities, including the parent 
holding company (Citigroup Inc.), Citi’s primary 
intermediate holding company (Citicorp LLC), Citi’s 
broker-dealer subsidiaries (including Citigroup Global 
Markets Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Limited and 
Citigroup Global Markets Japan Inc.) and other bank and 
non-bank subsidiaries that are consolidated into Citigroup 
(including Citibanamex).

At an aggregate Citigroup level, Citi’s goal is to maintain 
sufficient funding in amount and tenor to fully fund customer 
assets and to provide an appropriate amount of cash and high-
quality liquid assets (as discussed below), even in times of 
stress, in order to meet its payment obligations as they come 
due. The liquidity risk management framework provides that 
in addition to the aggregate requirements, certain entities be 
self-sufficient or net providers of liquidity, including in 
conditions established under their designated stress tests.

Citi’s primary funding sources include (i) corporate and 

consumer deposits via Citi’s bank subsidiaries, including 
Citibank, N.A. (Citibank), (ii) long-term debt (primarily senior 
and subordinated debt) mainly issued by Citigroup Inc., as the 
parent, and Citibank, and (iii) stockholders’ equity. These 
sources may be supplemented by short-term borrowings, 
primarily in the form of secured funding transactions.

Citi’s funding and liquidity framework, working in 
concert with overall asset/liability management, ensures that 
there is sufficient liquidity and tenor in the overall liability 
structure (including funding products) of the Company relative 
to the liquidity requirements of Citi’s assets. This reduces the 

risk that liabilities will become due before assets mature or are 
monetized. The Company holds excess liquidity, primarily in 
the form of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA), as presented in 
the table below. 

Citi’s liquidity is managed centrally by Corporate 
Treasury, in conjunction with regional and in-country 
treasurers with oversight provided by Independent Risk 
Management and various Asset & Liability Committees 
(ALCOs) at the individual entity, region, country and business 
levels. Pursuant to this approach, Citi’s HQLA are managed 
with emphasis on asset/liability management and entity-level 
liquidity adequacy throughout Citi.

Citi’s CRO and CFO co-chair Citigroup’s ALCO, which 

includes Citi’s Treasurer and other senior executives. The 
ALCO sets the strategy of the liquidity portfolio and monitors 
portfolio performance (for additional information about the 
ALCO, see “Risk Governance—Board and Executive 
Management Committees” above). Significant changes to 
portfolio asset allocations are approved by the ALCO. Citi 
also has other ALCOs, which are established at various 
organizational levels to ensure appropriate oversight for 
individual entities, countries, franchise businesses and regions, 
serving as the primary governance committees for managing 
Citi’s balance sheet and liquidity.

As a supplement to ALCO, Citi’s Funding and Liquidity 
Risk Committee (FLRC) is focused on funding and liquidity 
risk matters. The FLRC reviews and discusses the funding and 
liquidity risk profile of, as well as risk management practices 
for, Citigroup and Citibank and reports its findings and 
recommendations to each relevant ALCO as appropriate.

Liquidity Monitoring and Measurement

Stress Testing 
Liquidity stress testing is performed for each of Citi’s major 
entities, operating subsidiaries and countries. Stress testing 
and scenario analyses are intended to quantify the potential 
impact of an adverse liquidity event on the balance sheet and 
liquidity position, in order to have sufficient liquidity on hand 
to manage through such an event. These scenarios include 
assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources, 
market triggers (such as credit ratings), potential uses of 
funding and macroeconomic, geopolitical and other 
conditions. These conditions include expected and stressed 
market conditions as well as Company-specific events.

Liquidity stress tests are performed to ascertain potential 
mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety 
of time horizons and over different stressed conditions. To 
monitor the liquidity of an entity, these stress tests and 
potential mismatches are calculated on a daily basis. 

Given the range of potential stresses, Citi maintains 

contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for 
individual entities. These plans specify a wide range of readily 
available actions for a variety of adverse market conditions or 
idiosyncratic stresses.

Note: The amounts shown in the table above are presented on an average basis. For securities, the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be 
realized and, therefore, exclude any securities that are encumbered and incorporate any haircuts applicable under the U.S. LCR rule. The table above incorporates 
various restrictions that could limit the transferability of liquidity between legal entities, including Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.
(1)   Foreign government debt includes securities issued or guaranteed by foreign sovereigns, agencies and multilateral development banks. Foreign government debt 

securities are held largely to support local liquidity requirements and Citi’s local franchises and principally include government bonds from Japan, Korea, Mexico, 
Singapore and Hong Kong.

The table above includes average amounts of HQLA held at 
Citigroup’s operating entities that are eligible for inclusion in 
the calculation of Citigroup’s consolidated Liquidity Coverage 
ratio (LCR), pursuant to the U.S. LCR rules. These amounts 
include the HQLA needed to meet the minimum requirements 
at these entities as well as any amounts in excess of these 
minimums that are available to be transferred to other entities 
within Citigroup. Citigroup’s average HQLA increased 
quarter-over-quarter as of the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily 
driven by wholesale unsecured debt issuances. 

As of December 31, 2022, Citigroup had approximately 
$1,045 billion of available liquidity resources to support client 
and business needs, including end-of-period HQLA assets; 
additional unencumbered securities, including excess liquidity 
held at bank entities that is non-transferable to other entities 
within Citigroup; available assets not already accounted for 
within Citi’s HQLA to support the Federal Home Loan Bank 
(FHLB); and Federal Reserve Bank discount window 
borrowing capacity.

Short-Term Liquidity Measurement: Liquidity Coverage 
Ratio (LCR)
In addition to internal 30-day liquidity stress testing performed 
for Citi’s major entities, operating subsidiaries and countries, 
Citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the LCR.

The LCR is calculated by dividing HQLA by estimated 
net outflows assuming a stressed 30-day period, with the net 
outflows determined by standardized stress outflow and inflow 
rates prescribed in the LCR rule. The outflows are partially 
offset by contractual inflows from assets maturing within 30 
days. Similar to outflows, the inflows are calculated based on 
prescribed factors to various asset categories, such as retail 
loans as well as unsecured and secured wholesale lending. The 
minimum LCR requirement is 100%.

The table below details the components of Citi’s LCR 

calculation and HQLA in excess of net outflows for the 
periods indicated:

issuances.

Long-Term Liquidity Measurement: Net Stable Funding 
Ratio (NSFR) 
As previously disclosed, the U.S. banking agencies adopted a 
rule to assess the availability of a bank’s stable funding against 
a required level. 

In general, a bank’s available stable funding includes 
portions of equity, deposits and long-term debt, while its 
required stable funding will be based on the liquidity 
characteristics of its assets, derivatives and commitments. 
Standardized weightings are required to be applied to the 
various asset and liability classes. The ratio of available stable 
funding to required stable funding is required to be greater 
than 100%. 

The rule became effective beginning July 1, 2021, while 

public disclosure requirements to report the ratio will occur on 
a semiannual basis beginning June 30, 2023. Citi was in 
compliance with the rule as of December 31, 2022.

Loans
As part of its funding and liquidity objectives, Citi seeks to 
fund its existing asset base appropriately as well as maintain 
sufficient liquidity to grow its PBWM and ICG businesses, 
including its loan portfolio. Citi maintains a diversified 
portfolio of loans to its consumer and institutional clients. The 
table below details the average loans, by business and/or 
segment, and the total Citigroup end-of-period loans for each

End-of-period loans decreased 2% year-over-year, largely 
driven by lower balances in Legacy Franchises and the impact 
of foreign exchange translation. End-of-period loans increased 
2% sequentially.

On an average basis, loans declined 2% year-over-year 

and were largely unchanged sequentially. The year-over-year 
decline was primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange 
translation and lower balances in Legacy Franchises, which 
more than offset growth in PBWM. The decline in Legacy 
Franchises primarily reflected the reclassification of loans to 
Other assets to reflect held-for-sale accounting as a result of 

88

the signing of sale agreements for consumer franchises, as 
well as the impact of the ongoing Korea and Russia wind-
downs. 

Average PBWM loans as of the fourth quarter of 2022 
increased 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by Branded 
cards and Retail services. 

Average ICG loans as of the fourth quarter of 2022 
decreased 1% year-over-year, primarily driven by RWA 
optimization efforts within Banking, which more than offset 
growth in Services from trade finance in TTS.

End-of-period deposits increased 4% year-over-year, 

largely driven by Treasury and trade solutions in ICG, 
partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation. 
End-of-period deposits increased 5% sequentially.

On an average basis, deposits declined 1% year-over-year 

and increased 3% sequentially. The year-over-year decline 
primarily reflected the impact of foreign exchange translation 
and a decline in Legacy Franchises, partially offset by growth 
in Corporate/Other. The decline in Legacy Franchises was 
due to the impact of held-for-sale accounting as a result of the 
signing of sale agreements for consumer franchises, as well as 
the ongoing Korea and Russia wind-downs. ICG average 
deposits were largely unchanged year-over-year. PBWM 
average deposits decreased 1% year-over-year, driven by 
modest decreases in both U.S. Personal Banking and Global 
Wealth. Corporate/Other average deposits increased $25 
billion year-over-year, due to the issuance of institutional 
certificates of deposit as Citi continues to diversify its funding 
profile.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Long-Term Debt
Long-term debt (generally defined as debt with original 
maturities of one year or more) represents the most significant 
component of Citi’s funding for the Citigroup parent company 
and Citi’s non-bank subsidiaries and is a supplementary source 
of funding for the bank entities. 

Long-term debt is an important funding source due in part 

to its multiyear contractual maturity structure. The weighted-
average maturity of unsecured long-term debt issued by 
Citigroup and its affiliates (including Citibank) with a 
remaining life greater than one year was approximately 7.6 
years as of December 31, 2022, compared to 8.6 years as of 
the prior year and 7.8 years as of the prior quarter. The 
weighted-average maturity is calculated based on the 
contractual maturity of each security. For securities that are 
redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the holder, the 
weighted-average maturity is calculated based on the earliest 
date an option becomes exercisable.

Citi’s long-term debt outstanding at the Citigroup parent 

company includes benchmark senior and subordinated debt 
and what Citi refers to as customer-related debt, consisting of 
structured notes, such as equity- and credit-linked notes, as 
well as non-structured notes. Citi’s issuance of customer-
related debt is generally driven by customer demand and 
complements benchmark debt issuance as a source of funding 
for Citi’s non-bank entities. Citi’s long-term debt at the bank 
includes bank notes, FHLB advances and securitizations.

Note: Amounts represent the current value of long-term debt on Citi’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet that, for certain debt instruments, includes 
consideration of fair value, hedging impacts and unamortized discounts and 
premiums.
(1) Non-bank includes long-term debt issued to third parties by the parent 

holding company (Citigroup) and Citi’s non-bank subsidiaries (including 
broker-dealer subsidiaries) that are consolidated into Citigroup. As of 
December 31, 2022, non-bank included $84.2 billion of long-term debt 
issued by Citi’s broker-dealer and other subsidiaries that are 
consolidated into Citigroup. Certain Citigroup consolidated hedging 
activities are also included in this line.

(2) Local country and other includes debt issued by Citi’s affiliates in 
support of their local operations. Within non-bank, certain secured 
financing is also included.

(3) Predominantly credit card securitizations, primarily backed by Branded 

cards receivables.

Citi’s total long-term debt outstanding increased 7% year-
over-year, primarily driven by an increase in customer-related 
debt at the non-bank entities. Sequentially, long-term debt 
outstanding also increased 7%, largely driven by an increase in 
customer-related debt and benchmark senior debt at the non-
bank entities.

As part of its liability management, Citi has considered, 

and may continue to consider, opportunities to redeem or 
repurchase its long-term debt pursuant to open market 
purchases, tender offers or other means. Such redemptions and 
repurchases help reduce Citi’s overall funding costs. During 
2022, Citi redeemed or repurchased an aggregate of 
approximately $20.8 billion of its outstanding long-term debt.

Citigroup made an initial contribution of assets, 
including certain high-quality liquid assets and 
inter-affiliate loans (Contributable Assets), to 
Citicorp, and Citicorp became the business-as-
usual funding vehicle for Citigroup’s operating 
material legal entities;
Citigroup will be obligated to continue to transfer 
Contributable Assets to Citicorp over time, subject 
to certain amounts retained by Citigroup to, among 
other things, meet Citigroup’s near-term cash 
needs; 
in the event of a Citigroup bankruptcy, Citigroup 
will be required to contribute most of its remaining 
assets to Citicorp; and

(iv)

the obligations of both Citigroup and Citicorp under the 
Citi Support Agreement, as well as the Contributable 
Assets, are secured pursuant to a security agreement.

The Citi Support Agreement provides two mechanisms, 
besides Citicorp’s issuing of dividends to Citigroup, pursuant 
to which Citicorp will be required to transfer cash to Citigroup 
during business as usual so that Citigroup can fund its debt 
service as well as other operating needs: (i) one or more 
funding notes issued by Citicorp to Citigroup and (ii) a 
committed line of credit under which Citicorp may make loans 
to Citigroup. 

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)
U.S. GSIBs are required to maintain minimum levels of TLAC 
and eligible LTD, each set by reference to the GSIB’s 
consolidated risk-weighted assets (RWA) and total leverage 
exposure. The intended purpose of the requirements is to 
facilitate the orderly resolution of U.S. GSIBs under the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act. For 
additional information, including Citi’s TLAC and LTD 
amounts and ratios, see “Capital Resources—Current 
Regulatory Capital Standards” above.

Resolution Plan
Citigroup is required under Title I of the Dodd-Frank Wall 
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-
Frank Act) and the rules promulgated by the FDIC and Federal 
Reserve Board (FRB) to periodically submit a plan for Citi’s 
rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code 
in the event of material financial distress or failure. Citigroup 
will alternate between submitting a full resolution plan and a 
targeted resolution plan on a biennial cycle.

On November 22, 2022, the FRB and FDIC issued 
feedback on the resolution plans filed on July 1, 2021 by the 
eight U.S. global systemically important banks (GSIBs), 
including Citigroup. The FRB and FDIC identified one 
shortcoming, but no deficiencies, in Citigroup’s 2021 
resolution plan regarding data integrity and data quality 
management issues. For additional information on Citi’s 
resolution plan submissions, see “Risk Factors—Strategic 
Risks” above. 

Under Citi’s preferred “single point of entry” resolution 

plan strategy, only Citigroup, the parent holding company, 
would enter into bankruptcy, while Citigroup’s material legal 
entities (as defined in the public section of its 2021 resolution 
plan, which can be found on the FRB’s and FDIC’s websites) 
would remain operational outside of any resolution or 
insolvency proceedings. Citigroup’s resolution plan has been 
designed to minimize the risk of systemic impact to the U.S. 
and global financial systems, while maximizing the value of 
the bankruptcy estate for the benefit of Citigroup’s creditors, 
including its unsecured long-term debt holders. 

In addition, in line with the FRB’s final total loss-
absorbing capacity (TLAC) rule, Citigroup believes it has 
developed the resolution plan so that Citigroup’s shareholders 
and unsecured creditors—including its unsecured long-term 
debt holders—bear any losses resulting from Citigroup’s 
bankruptcy. Accordingly, any value realized by holders of its 
unsecured long-term debt may not be sufficient to repay the 
amounts owed to such debt holders in the event of a 
bankruptcy or other resolution proceeding of Citigroup.

The FDIC has also indicated that it was developing a 

single point of entry strategy to implement the Orderly 
Liquidation Authority under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act, 
which provides the FDIC with the ability to resolve a firm 
when it is determined that bankruptcy would have serious 
adverse effects on financial stability in the U.S.

As previously disclosed, in response to feedback received 
from the FRB and FDIC, Citigroup took the following actions:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

Citicorp LLC (Citicorp), an existing wholly owned 
subsidiary of Citigroup, was established as an 
intermediate holding company (an IHC) for certain of 
Citigroup’s operating material legal entities;
Citigroup executed an inter-affiliate agreement with 
Citicorp, Citigroup’s operating material legal entities 
and certain other affiliated entities pursuant to which 
Citicorp is required to provide liquidity and capital 
support to Citigroup’s operating material legal entities 
in the event Citigroup were to enter bankruptcy 
proceedings (Citi Support Agreement); 
pursuant to the Citi Support Agreement:

91

The remainder of the secured funding activity in the 
broker-dealer subsidiaries serves to fund securities inventory 
held in the context of market making and customer activities. 
To maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market 
conditions, including under periods of stress, Citi manages 
these activities by taking into consideration the quality of the 
underlying collateral and establishing minimum required 
funding tenors. The weighted average maturity of Citi’s 
secured funding of less liquid securities inventory was greater 
than 110 days as of December 31, 2022.

Citi manages the risks in its secured funding by 

conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in 
capacity, tenor, haircut, collateral profile and client actions. In 
addition, Citi maintains counterparty diversification by 
establishing concentration triggers and assessing counterparty 
reliability and stability under stress. Citi generally sources 
secured funding from more than 150 counterparties.

Short-Term Borrowings
Citi’s short-term borrowings of $47 billion as of the fourth 
quarter of 2022 increased 68% year-over-year, reflecting an 
increase in FHLB advances and commercial paper issuance, as 
Citi continues to diversify its funding profile, and decreased 
1% sequentially, driven by normal business activity (see Note 
18 for further information on Citigroup’s and its affiliates’ 
outstanding short-term borrowings).

SECURED FUNDING TRANSACTIONS AND SHORT-
TERM BORROWINGS 
Citi supplements its primary sources of funding with short-
term financings that generally include (i) secured funding 
transactions consisting of securities loaned or sold under 
agreements to repurchase, i.e., repos, and (ii) to a lesser extent, 
short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper and 
borrowings from the FHLB and other market participants. 

Secured Funding Transactions
Secured funding is primarily accessed through Citi’s broker-
dealer subsidiaries to fund efficiently both (i) secured lending 
activity and (ii) a portion of the securities inventory held in the 
context of market making and customer activities. Citi also 
executes a smaller portion of its secured funding transactions 
through its bank entities, which are typically collateralized by 
government debt securities. Generally, daily changes in the 
level of Citi’s secured funding are primarily due to 
fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book 
(as described below) and securities inventory. 

Secured funding of $202 billion as of December 31, 2022 

increased 6% from the prior year and was unchanged 
sequentially, driven by normal business activity. The average 
balance for secured funding was approximately $205 billion 
for the quarter ended December 31, 2022.

The portion of secured funding in the broker-dealer 
subsidiaries that funds secured lending is commonly referred 
to as “matched book” activity. The majority of this activity is 
secured by high-quality liquid securities such as U.S. Treasury 
securities, U.S. agency securities and foreign government debt 
securities. Other secured funding is secured by less liquid 
securities, including equity securities, corporate bonds and 
asset-backed securities, the tenor of which is generally equal 
to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding matched book 
assets.

92

CREDIT RATINGS
Citigroup’s funding and liquidity, funding capacity, ability to 
access capital markets and other sources of funds, the cost of 
these funds and its ability to maintain certain deposits are 
partially dependent on its credit ratings. 

The table below shows the ratings for Citigroup and 
Citibank as of December 31, 2022. While not included in the 
table below, the long-term and short-term ratings of Citigroup 
Global Markets Holding Inc. (CGMHI) were A+/F1 at Fitch 
Ratings, A2/P-1 at Moody’s Investors Service and A/A-1 at 
S&P Global Ratings as of December 31, 2022.

Ratings as of December 31, 2022

Fitch Ratings (Fitch)

Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s)

S&P Global Ratings (S&P)

Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades
Ratings downgrades by Fitch, Moody’s or S&P could 
negatively impact Citigroup’s and/or Citibank’s funding and 
liquidity due to reduced funding capacity, including derivative 
triggers, which could take the form of cash obligations and 
collateral requirements.

The following information is provided for the purpose of 

analyzing the potential funding and liquidity impact to 
Citigroup and Citibank of a hypothetical simultaneous ratings 
downgrade across all three major rating agencies. This 
analysis is subject to certain estimates, estimation 
methodologies, judgments and uncertainties. Uncertainties 
include potential ratings limitations that certain entities may 
have with respect to permissible counterparties, as well as 
general subjective counterparty behavior. For example, certain 
corporate customers and markets counterparties could re-
evaluate their business relationships with Citi and limit 
transactions in certain contracts or market instruments with 
Citi. Changes in counterparty behavior could impact Citi’s 
funding and liquidity, as well as the results of operations of 
certain of its businesses. The actual impact to Citigroup or 
Citibank is unpredictable and may differ materially from the 
potential funding and liquidity impacts described below. For 
additional information on the impact of credit rating changes 
on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see “Risk Factors—
Liquidity Risks” above.

Citigroup Inc. and Citibank—Potential Derivative Triggers
As of December 31, 2022, Citi estimates that a hypothetical 
one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of 
Citigroup Inc. across all three major rating agencies could 
impact Citigroup’s funding and liquidity due to derivative 
triggers by approximately $0.5 billion, compared to $0.6 
billion as of September 30, 2022. Other funding sources, such 
as secured financing transactions and other margin 
requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could 
also be adversely affected.

As of December 31, 2022, Citi estimates that a 
hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-
term rating of Citibank across all three major rating agencies 
could impact Citibank’s funding and liquidity due to 
derivative triggers by approximately $0.4 billion, compared to 
$0.8 billion as of September 30, 2022. Other funding sources, 
such as secured financing transactions and other margin 
requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could 
also be adversely affected.

In total, as of December 31, 2022, Citi estimates that a 
one-notch downgrade of Citigroup Inc. and Citibank across all 
three major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate 
cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately 
$0.9 billion, compared to $1.4 billion as of September 30, 
2022 (see also Note 23). As detailed under “High-Quality 
Liquid Assets (HQLA)” above, Citigroup has various liquidity 
resources available to its bank and non-bank entities in part as 
a contingency for the potential events described above.
In addition, a broad range of mitigating actions are 
currently included in Citigroup’s and Citibank’s contingency 
funding plans. For Citigroup, these mitigating factors include, 
but are not limited to, accessing surplus funding capacity from 
existing clients, tailoring levels of secured lending and 
adjusting the size of select trading books and collateralized 
borrowings at certain Citibank subsidiaries. Mitigating actions 
available to Citibank include, but are not limited to, selling or 
financing highly liquid government securities, tailoring levels 
of secured lending, adjusting the size of select trading assets, 
reducing loan originations and renewals, raising additional 
deposits or borrowing from the FHLB or central banks. Citi 
believes these mitigating actions could substantially reduce the 
funding and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades 
described above.

 
Citibank—Additional Potential Impacts 
In addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a 
potential downgrade of Citibank’s senior debt/long-term rating 
across any of the three major rating agencies could also have 
an adverse impact on the commercial paper/short-term rating 
of Citibank. Citibank has provided liquidity commitments to 
consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits, 
primarily in the form of asset purchase agreements. As of 
December 31, 2022, Citibank had liquidity commitments of 
approximately $11.0 billion to consolidated asset-backed 
commercial paper conduits, compared to $9.1 billion as of 
December 31, 2021 (see Note 22 for additional information).
In addition to the above-referenced liquidity resources of 

certain Citibank entities, Citibank could reduce the funding 
and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades 
described above through mitigating actions, including 
repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial 
paper conduits. In the event of the potential downgrades 
described above, Citi believes that certain corporate customers 
could re-evaluate their deposit relationships with Citibank. 
This re-evaluation could result in clients adjusting their 
discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository 
institution, which could potentially reduce certain deposit 
levels at Citibank. However, Citi could choose to adjust 
pricing, offer alternative deposit products to its existing 
customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers, in 
addition to the mitigating actions referenced above.

MARKET RISK

OVERVIEW
Market risk is the potential for losses arising from changes in 
the value of Citi’s assets and liabilities resulting from changes 
in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange 
rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as 
well as their implied volatilities. Market risk arises from both 
Citi’s trading and non-trading portfolios. For additional 
information on market risk and market risk management at 
Citi, see “Risk Factors” above.

Each business is required to establish, with approval from 
Citi’s market risk management, a market risk limit framework 
for identified risk factors that clearly defines approved risk 
profiles and is within the parameters of Citi’s overall risk 
appetite. These limits are monitored by the Risk organization, 
including various regional, legal entity and business Risk 
Management committees, Citi’s country and business Asset & 
Liability Committees and the Citigroup Risk Management and 
Asset & Liability Committees. In all cases, the businesses are 
ultimately responsible for the market risks taken and for 
remaining within their defined limits.

MARKET RISK OF NON-TRADING PORTFOLIOS 
Market risk from non-trading portfolios stems predominantly 
from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and 
foreign exchange rates on Citi’s net interest income and on 
Citi’s Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) 
from its investment securities portfolios. Market risk from 
non-trading portfolios also includes the potential impact of 
changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital invested in 
foreign currencies. 

Banking Book Interest Rate Risk 
For interest rate risk purposes, Citi’s non-trading portfolios are 
referred to as the Banking Book. Management of interest rate 
risk in the Banking Book is governed by Citi’s Non-Trading 
Market Risk Policy. Management’s Asset & Liability 
Committee (ALCO) establishes Citi’s risk appetite and related 
limits for interest rate risk in the Banking Book, which are 
subject to approval by Citigroup’s Board of Directors. 
Corporate Treasury is responsible for the day-to-day 
management of Citi’s Banking Book interest rate risk as well 
as periodically reviewing it with the ALCO. Citi’s Banking 
Book interest rate risk management is also subject to 
independent oversight from Treasury Risk Management, a 
second line of defense team reporting to the Treasury Chief 
Risk Officer.

Changes in interest rates impact Citi’s net income, AOCI 

and CET1. These changes primarily affect Citi’s Banking 
Book through net interest income, due to a variety of risk 
factors, including:

•

•
•

Differences in timing and amounts of the maturity or 
repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet 
instruments;
Changes in level and/or shape of interest rate curves;
Client behavior in response to changes in interest rate 
(e.g., mortgage prepayments, deposit betas); and

95

•

Changes in maturity of instruments resulting from 
changes in interest rate environment.

As part of their ongoing activities, Citi’s businesses generate 
interest rate-sensitive positions from their client-facing 
products, such as loans and deposits. The component of this 
interest rate risk that can be hedged is transferred via Citi’s 
funds transfer pricing process to Corporate Treasury. 
Corporate Treasury uses various tools to manage the total 
interest rate risk position within the established risk appetite 
and target Citi’s desired risk profile, including its investment 
securities portfolio, company-issued debt and interest rate 
derivatives. 

In addition, Citi uses multiple metrics to measure its 
Banking Book interest rate risk. Interest Rate Exposure (IRE) 
is a key metric that analyzes the impact of a range of scenarios 
on Citi’s Banking Book net interest income and certain other 
interest rate-sensitive income versus a base case. IRE does not 
represent a forecast of Citi’s net interest income.

The scenarios, methodologies and assumptions used in 

this analysis are periodically evaluated and enhanced in 
response to changes in the market environment, changes in 
Citi’s balance sheet composition, enhancements in Citi’s 
modeling and other factors.

Since the third quarter of 2022, Citi has employed 

enhanced IRE methodologies and changes to certain 
assumptions. The changes included, among other things, 
assumptions around the projected balance sheet and revisions 
to the treatment of certain business contributions (notably 
accrual positions in ICG’s Markets businesses). These changes 
resulted in a higher impact to Citi’s net interest income over a 
12-month period.

Under the enhanced methodology, Citi utilizes the most 
recent quarter-end balance sheet, assuming no changes to its 
composition and size over the forecasted horizon (holding the 
balance sheet static). The forecasts incorporate expectations 
and assumptions of deposit pricing, loan spreads and mortgage 
prepayment behavior implied by the interest rate curves in 
each scenario. The base case scenario reflects the market 
implied forward interest rates, and sensitivity scenarios 
assume instantaneous shocks to the base case. The forecasts do 
not assume Citi takes any risk-mitigating actions in response 
to changes in the interest rate environment. Certain interest 
rates are subject to flooring assumptions in downward rate 
scenarios. Deposit pricing sensitivities, (i.e., deposit betas), are 
informed by historical and expected behavior. Actual deposit 
pricing could differ from the assumptions used in these 
forecasts.

Citi’s IRE analysis primarily reflects the impacts from the 

following Banking Book assets and liabilities: loans, client 
deposits, Citi’s deposits with other banks, investment 
securities, long-term debt, any related interest rate hedges and 
the funds transfer pricing of positions in total trading and 
credit portfolio VAR. It excludes impacts from any positions 
that are included in total trading and credit portfolio VAR.

Interest Rate Risk of Investment Portfolios—Impact 
on AOCI
Citi also measures the potential impacts of changes in interest 
rates on the value of its AOCI, which can in turn impact Citi’s 
common equity and tangible common equity. This will impact 
Citi’s CET1 and other regulatory capital ratios. Citi seeks to 
manage its exposure to changes in the market level of interest 
rates, while limiting the potential impact on its AOCI and 
regulatory capital position.

AOCI at risk is managed as part of the Company-wide 
interest rate risk position. AOCI at risk considers potential 
changes in AOCI (and the corresponding impact on the CET1 
Capital ratio) relative to Citi’s capital generation capacity.
The following table presents the 12-month estimated 
impact to Citi’s net interest income, AOCI and the CET1 
Capital ratio, each assuming an unanticipated parallel 
instantaneous 100 basis point (bps) increase in interest rates:

(3)

Citi’s balance sheet is asset sensitive (assets reprice faster than 
liabilities), resulting in higher net interest income in increasing 
interest rate scenarios. The estimated impact to Citi’s net 
interest income in a 100 bps upward rate shock scenario as of 
December 31, 2022 decreased quarter-over-quarter and year-
over-year, primarily reflecting the net impact of lower 
expected gains due to U.S. dollar interest rate moves that have 
already been realized and changes in Citi’s balance sheet. At 
progressively higher interest rate levels, the marginal net 
interest income benefit is lower, as Citi assumes it will pass on 
a larger share of rate changes to depositors (i.e., higher betas), 
further reducing Citi’s IRE sensitivity. Currency-specific 
interest rate changes and balance sheet factors may drive 
quarter-to-quarter volatility in Citi’s estimated IRE.

In a 100 bps upward rate shock scenario, Citi expects that 

the approximate $1.1 billion initial negative impact to AOCI 
could potentially be offset in shareholders’ equity through the 
expected recovery of the impact on AOCI through accretion of 
Citi’s investment portfolio and expected net interest income 
benefit over a period of approximately four months.

Scenario Analysis
The following table presents the estimated impact to Citi’s net 
interest income, AOCI and the CET1 Capital ratio (on a fully 
implemented basis) under five different scenarios of changes 
in interest rate for the U.S. dollar and all other currencies in 
which Citi has invested capital as of December 31, 2022. The 
100 bps downward rate scenarios are impacted by the low 
level of interest rates in several countries and the assumption 
that market interest rates, as well as rates paid to depositors 
and charged to borrowers, do not fall below zero (i.e., the 
“flooring assumption”). The rate scenarios are also impacted 
by convexity related to mortgage products.

Note: Each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur instantaneously. Changes in interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and the 10-year rate are 
interpolated. 
(1)

Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.

As shown in the table above, the estimated impact to 
Citi’s net interest income remains larger under Scenario 2 than 
Scenario 3, as Citi’s Banking Book has relatively higher 
interest rate exposure to the short end of the yield curve. For 
U.S. dollars, exposure to downward rate shocks is larger in 
magnitude than to upward rate shocks. This is because of the 
lower benefit to net interest income from Citi’s deposit base at 
higher rate levels, as well as the prepayment effects on 
mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. For other 
currencies, exposure to downward rate shocks is smaller in 
magnitude as a result of Citi’s flooring assumption, given low 
rate levels for certain non-U.S. dollar currencies.

The magnitude of the impact to AOCI is greater under 
Scenario 2 as compared to Scenario 3. This is because the 
combination of changes to Citi’s investment portfolio, 
partially offset by changes related to Citi’s pension liabilities, 
results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at 
shorter- and intermediate-term maturities.

97

 
 
 
 
Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates—Impacts on AOCI 
and Capital
As of December 31, 2022, Citi estimates that an unanticipated 
parallel instantaneous 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar 
against all of the other currencies in which Citi has invested 
capital could reduce Citi’s tangible common equity (TCE) by 
approximately $1.7 billion, or 1.0%, as a result of changes to 
Citi’s CTA in AOCI, net of hedges. This impact would be 
primarily due to changes in the value of the Mexican peso, 
Euro, Singapore dollar and Indian rupee.

This impact is also before any mitigating actions Citi may 

take, including ongoing management of its foreign currency 
translation exposure. Specifically, as currency movements 
change the value of Citi’s net investments in foreign currency-
denominated capital, these movements also change the value 
of Citi’s risk-weighted assets denominated in those currencies. 
This, coupled with Citi’s foreign currency hedging strategies, 
such as foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency 
forwards and other currency hedging instruments, lessens the 
impact of foreign currency movements on Citi’s CET1 Capital 
ratio. Changes in these hedging strategies, as well as hedging 
costs, divestitures and tax impacts, can further affect the actual 
impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital 
as compared to an unanticipated parallel shock, as described 
above.

The effect of Citi’s ongoing management strategies with 

respect to quarterly changes in foreign exchange rates, and the 
quarterly impact of these changes on Citi’s TCE and CET1 
Capital ratio, are shown in the table below. See Note 20 for 
additional information on the changes in AOCI.

Interest revenue and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments primarily related to the tax-exempt bond portfolio and certain tax-advantaged 
loan programs (based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%) of $165 million, $192 million and $196 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
Interest expense associated with certain hybrid financial instruments, which are classified as Long-term debt and accounted for at fair value, is reported together
with any changes in fair value as part of Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income and is therefore not reflected in Interest expense in the 
table above.

Interest revenue and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments discussed in the table above.

Citi’s net interest income in the fourth quarter of 2022 was 
$13.3 billion (also $13.3 billion on a taxable equivalent basis), 
an increase of $2.5 billion versus the prior year, primarily 
driven by non-ICG Markets (approximately $2.2 billion), as 
ICG Markets was largely unchanged (up approximately $0.3 
billion across fixed income markets and equity markets). The 
increase in net interest income in non-ICG Markets was 
primarily driven by higher interest rates. Citi’s net interest 
margin was 2.39% on a taxable equivalent basis in the fourth 
quarter of 2022, an increase of eight basis points from the 
prior quarter, also largely driven by higher interest rates.

Citi’s net interest income for 2022 increased 15%, or 
approximately $6.2 billion, to $48.7 billion ($48.8 billion on a 
taxable equivalent basis) versus the prior year. The increase 
was primarily due to an increase in non-ICG Markets net 
interest income, largely reflecting higher interest rates and 
higher loan balances in PBWM. In 2022, Citi’s net interest 
margin increased to 2.25% on a taxable equivalent basis, 
compared to 1.99% in 2021, primarily driven by higher 
interest rates and a mix-shift in balances.

Interest revenue and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments primarily related to the tax-exempt bond portfolio and certain tax-advantaged 
loan programs (based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%) of $165 million, $192 million and $196 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Market Risk of Trading Portfolios
Trading portfolios include positions resulting from market-
making activities, hedges of certain available-for-sale (AFS) 
debt securities, the CVA relating to derivative counterparties 
and all associated hedges, fair value option loans and hedges 
of the loan portfolio within capital markets origination in ICG.

The market risk of Citi’s trading portfolios is monitored 
using a combination of quantitative and qualitative measures, 
including, but not limited to, factor sensitivities, value at risk 
(VAR) and stress testing. Each trading portfolio across Citi’s 
businesses has its own market risk limit framework 
encompassing these measures and other controls, including 
trading mandates, new product approval, permitted product 
lists and pre-trade approval for larger, more complex and less 
liquid transactions.

The following chart of total daily trading-related revenue 
(loss) captures trading volatility and shows the number of days 
in which revenues for Citi’s trading businesses fell within 
particular ranges. Trading-related revenue includes trading, net 
interest and other revenue associated with Citi’s trading 
businesses. It excludes DVA, FVA and CVA adjustments 
incurred due to changes in the credit quality of counterparties, 
as well as any associated hedges of that CVA. In addition, it 
excludes fees and other revenue associated with capital 
markets origination activities. Trading-related revenues are 
driven by both customer flows and the changes in valuation of 
the trading inventory. As shown in the chart below, positive 
trading-related revenue was achieved for 95.4% of the trading 
days in 2022.

Daily Trading-Related Revenue (Loss)(1)—12 Months Ended December 31, 2022
In millions of dollars

(1)   Reflects the effects of asymmetrical accounting for economic hedges of certain AFS debt securities. Specifically, the change in the fair value of hedging 

derivatives is included in trading-related revenue, while the offsetting change in the fair value of hedged AFS debt securities is included in AOCI and not reflected 
above.

106

Factor Sensitivities
Factor sensitivities are expressed as the change in the value of 
a position for a defined change in a market risk factor, such as 
a change in the value of a U.S. Treasury Bond for a one-basis-
point change in interest rates. Citi’s Global Market Risk 
function, within the Independent Risk Management 
organization, works to ensure that factor sensitivities are 
calculated, monitored and limited for all material risks taken in 
the trading portfolios.

Value at Risk (VAR)
VAR estimates, at a 99% confidence level, the potential 
decline in the value of a position or a portfolio under normal 
market conditions assuming a one-day holding period. VAR 
statistics, which are based on historical data, can be materially 
different across firms due to differences in portfolio 
composition, VAR methodologies and model parameters. As a 
result, Citi believes VAR statistics can be used more 
effectively as indicators of trends in risk-taking within a firm, 
rather than as a basis for inferring differences in risk-taking 
across firms.

Citi uses a single, independently approved Monte Carlo 

simulation VAR model (see “VAR Model Review and 
Validation” below), which has been designed to capture 
material risk sensitivities (such as first- and second-order 

sensitivities of positions to changes in market prices) of 
various asset classes/risk types (such as interest rate, credit 
spread, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks). Citi’s 
VAR includes positions that are measured at fair value; it does 
not include investment securities classified as AFS or HTM. 
See Note 13 for information on these securities.

Citi believes its VAR model is conservatively calibrated 

to incorporate fat-tail scaling and the greater of short-term 
(approximately the most recent month) and long-term (18 
months for commodities and three years for others) market 
volatility. The Monte Carlo simulation involves approximately 
550,000 market factors, making use of approximately 480,000 
time series, with sensitivities updated daily, volatility 
parameters updated intra-monthly and correlation parameters 
updated monthly. The conservative features of the VAR 
calibration contribute an approximate 46% add-on to what 
would be a VAR estimated under the assumption of stable and 
perfectly, normally distributed markets. 

As presented in the table below, Citi’s average trading 
VAR increased $22 million from 2021 to 2022, mainly due to 
increased market volatility. Citi’s average trading and credit 
portfolio VAR increased $23 million from 2021 to 2022 in 
line with trading VAR.

benefit reflects the fact that the risks within individual and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VAR on a given day will be 
lower than the sum of the VARs relating to each risk type. The determination of the primary drivers of changes to the covariance adjustment is made by an 
examination of the impact of both model parameter and position changes.

(2)  The total trading VAR includes mark-to-market and certain fair value option trading positions in ICG, with the exception of hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value 

option loans and all CVA exposures. Available-for-sale and accrual exposures are not included.

(3)   The specific risk-only component represents the level of equity and fixed income issuer-specific risk embedded in VAR. 
(4)   The credit portfolio is composed of mark-to-market positions associated with non-trading business units, the CVA relating to derivative counterparties and all 

associated CVA hedges. FVA and DVA are not included. The credit portfolio also includes hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value option loans and hedges to the 
leveraged finance pipeline within capital markets origination in ICG.

VAR Model Review and Validation
Generally, Citi’s VAR review and model validation process 
entails reviewing the model framework, major assumptions 
and implementation of the mathematical algorithm. In 
addition, product-specific back-testing on portfolios is 
periodically completed as part of the ongoing model 
performance monitoring process and reviewed with Citi’s U.S. 
banking regulators. Furthermore, Regulatory VAR back-
testing (as described below) is performed against buy-and-
hold profit and loss on a monthly basis for multiple sub-
portfolios across the organization (trading desk level, ICG 
operating segment and Citigroup) and the results are shared 
with U.S. banking regulators.

Material VAR model and assumption changes must be 

independently validated within Citi’s Independent Risk 
Management organization. All model changes, including those 
for the VAR model, are validated by the model validation 
group within Citi’s Model Risk Management. In the event of 
significant model changes, parallel model runs are undertaken 
prior to implementation. In addition, significant model and 
assumption changes are subject to the periodic reviews and 
approval by Citi’s U.S. banking regulators.

Citi uses the same independently validated VAR model 
for both Regulatory VAR and Risk Management VAR (i.e., 
total trading and total trading and credit portfolios VARs) and, 
as such, the model review and validation process for both 
purposes is as described above.

Regulatory VAR, which is calculated in accordance with 
Basel III, differs from Risk Management VAR due to the fact 
that certain positions included in Risk Management VAR are 
not eligible for market risk treatment in Regulatory VAR. The 

108

composition of Risk Management VAR is discussed under 
“Value at Risk” above. The applicability of the VAR model 
for positions eligible for market risk treatment under U.S. 
regulatory capital rules is periodically reviewed and approved 
by Citi’s U.S. banking regulators.

In accordance with Basel III, Regulatory VAR includes 
all trading book-covered positions and all foreign exchange 
and commodity exposures. Pursuant to Basel III, Regulatory 
VAR excludes positions that fail to meet the intent and ability 
to trade requirements and are therefore classified as non-
trading book and categories of exposures that are specifically 
excluded as covered positions. Regulatory VAR excludes 
CVA on derivative instruments and DVA on Citi’s own fair 
value option liabilities. CVA hedges are excluded from 
Regulatory VAR and included in credit risk-weighted assets as 
computed under the Advanced Approaches for determining 
risk-weighted assets.

Regulatory VAR Back-Testing
In accordance with Basel III, Citi is required to perform back-
testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR 
model. Regulatory VAR back-testing is the process in which 
the daily one-day VAR, at a 99% confidence interval, is 
compared to the buy-and-hold profit and loss (i.e., the profit 
and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of 
the day and re-priced the following day). Buy-and-hold profit 
and loss represents the daily mark-to-market profit and loss 
attributable to price movements in covered positions from the 
close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and 
loss excludes realized trading revenue, net interest, fees and 
commissions, intra-day trading profit and loss and changes in 
reserves.

Based on a 99% confidence level, Citi would expect two 

to three days in any one year where buy-and-hold losses 
exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the conservative 
calibration of Citi’s VAR model (as a result of taking the 
greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-tail scaling 
of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer exceptions under 
normal and stable market conditions. Periods of unstable 
market conditions could increase the number of back-testing 
exceptions.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The following graph shows the daily buy-and-hold profit 
and loss associated with Citi’s covered positions compared to 
Citi’s one-day Regulatory VAR during 2022. During 2022, 
one back-testing exception was observed at the Citigroup 
level.

The difference between the 48.3% of days with buy-and-
hold gains for Regulatory VAR back-testing and the 95.4% of 
days with trading, net interest and other revenue associated 
with Citi’s trading businesses, shown in the histogram of daily 
trading-related revenue below, reflects, among other things, 
that a significant portion of Citi’s trading-related revenue is 
not generated from daily price movements on these positions 
and exposures, as well as differences in the portfolio 
composition of Regulatory VAR and Risk Management VAR.

(1)   Buy-and-hold profit and loss, as defined by the banking regulators under Basel III, represents the daily mark-to-market revenue movement attributable to the 
trading position from the close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue and net interest intra-day trading 
profit and loss on new and terminated trades, as well as changes in reserves. Therefore, it is not comparable to the trading-related revenue presented in the chart of 
daily trading-related revenue above.

Stress Testing
Citi performs market risk stress testing on a regular basis to 
estimate the impact of extreme market movements. It is 
performed on individual positions and trading portfolios, as 
well as in aggregate, inclusive of multiple trading portfolios. 
Citi’s market risk management, after consultations with the 
businesses, develops both systemic and specific stress 
scenarios, reviews the output of periodic stress testing 
exercises and uses the information to assess the ongoing 
appropriateness of exposure levels and limits. Citi uses two 
complementary approaches to market risk stress testing across 
all major risk factors (i.e., equity, foreign exchange, 
commodity, interest rate and credit spreads): top-down 
systemic stresses and bottom-up business-specific stresses. 
Systemic stresses are designed to quantify the potential impact 
of extreme market movements on an institution-wide basis, 
and are constructed using both historical periods of market 
stress and projections of adverse economic scenarios. 
Business-specific stresses are designed to probe the risks of 
particular portfolios and market segments, especially those 
risks that are not fully captured in VAR and systemic stresses.
The systemic stress scenarios and business-specific stress 
scenarios at Citi are used in several reports reviewed by senior 
management and also to calculate internal risk capital for 
trading market risk. In general, changes in market values are 
defined over a one-year horizon. For the most liquid positions 
and market factors, changes in market values are defined over 
a shorter two-month horizon. The limited set of positions and 
market factors whose market value changes are defined over a 
two-month horizon are those that in management’s judgment 
have historically remained very liquid during financial crises, 
even as the trading liquidity of most other positions and 
market factors materially declined.

OPERATIONAL RISK 

Overview
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or 
failed internal processes or systems, including human error or 
misjudgment, or from external events. This includes legal risk, 
which is the risk of loss (including litigation costs, settlements 
and regulatory fines) resulting from the failure of Citi to 
comply with laws, regulations, prudent ethical standards and 
contractual obligations in any aspect of its businesses, but 
excludes strategic and reputation risks. Citi also recognizes the 
impact of operational risk on the reputation risk associated 
with Citi’s business activities. 

Operational risk is inherent in Citi’s global business 
activities, as well as related support functions, and can result 
in losses. Citi maintains a comprehensive Company-wide risk 
taxonomy to classify operational risks that it faces using 
standardized definitions across Citi’s Operational Risk 
Management Framework (see discussion below). This 
taxonomy also supports regulatory requirements and 
expectations inclusive of those related to U.S. Basel III, 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), 
Heightened Standards for Large Financial Institutions and 
Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing (DFAST). 

Citi manages operational risk consistent with the overall 
framework described in “Managing Global Risk—Overview” 
above. Citi’s goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate 
levels relative to the characteristics of its businesses, the 
markets in which it operates, its capital and liquidity and the 
competitive, economic and regulatory environment. This 
includes effectively managing operational risk and 
maintaining or reducing operational risk exposures within 
Citi’s operational risk appetite.

Citi’s Independent Operational Risk Management group 

has established a global Operational Risk Management 
Framework with policies and practices for identification, 
measurement, monitoring, managing and reporting operational 
risks and the overall operating effectiveness of the internal 
control environment. As part of this framework, Citi has 
defined its operational risk appetite and established a 
manager’s control assessment (MCA) process for self-
identification of significant operational risks, assessment of 
the performance of key controls and mitigation of residual risk 
above acceptable levels. 

Each Citi operating segment must implement operational 

risk processes consistent with the requirements of this 
framework. This includes:

understanding the operational risks they are exposed to;
designing controls to mitigate identified risks;
establishing key indicators;

•
•
•
• monitoring and reporting whether the operational risk 

•

•

•

exposures are in or out of their operational risk appetite;
having processes in place to bring operational risk 
exposures within acceptable levels; 
periodically estimating and aggregating the operational 
risks they are exposed to; and
ensuring that sufficient resources are available to 
actively improve the operational risk environment and 
mitigate emerging risks.

111

Citi considers operational risks that result from the 
introduction of new or changes to existing products, or result 
from significant changes in its organizational structures, 
systems, processes and personnel. 

Citi has a governance structure for the oversight of 

operational risk exposures through Business Risk and Controls 
Committees (BRCCs), which include a Citigroup Global 
BRCC as well as business, functions, regional and country 
BRCCs. BRCCs provide escalation channels for senior 
management to review operational risk exposures including 
breaches of operational risk appetite, key indicators, 
operational risk events and control issues. Membership 
includes senior business and functions leadership as well as 
members of the second line of defense.

In addition, Independent Risk Management, including the 
Operational Risk Management group, works proactively with 
Citi’s businesses and functions to drive a strong and embedded 
operational risk management culture and framework across 
Citi. The Operational Risk Management group actively 
challenges business and functions implementation of the 
Operational Risk Management Framework requirements and 
the quality of operational risk management practices and 
outcomes.

Information about businesses’ key operational risks, 
historical operational risk losses and the control environment 
is reported by each major business segment and functional 
area. Citi’s operational risk profile and related information is 
summarized and reported to senior management, as well as to 
the Audit and Risk Committees of Citi’s Board of Directors by 
the Head of Operational Risk Management.

Operational risk is measured through Operational Risk 

Capital and Operational Risk Regulatory Capital for the 
Advanced Approaches under Basel III. Projected operational 
risk losses under stress scenarios are estimated as a required 
part of the FRB’s CCAR process. 

For additional information on Citi’s operational risks, see 

“Risk Factors—Operational Risk” above.

Cybersecurity Risk 

Overview
Cybersecurity risk is the business risk associated with the 
threat posed by a cyberattack, cyber breach or the failure to 
protect Citi’s most vital business information assets or 
operations, resulting in a financial or reputational loss (for 
additional information, see the operational processes and 
systems and cybersecurity risk factors in “Risk Factors—
Operational Risks” above). With an evolving threat landscape, 
ever-increasing sophistication of threat actor tactics, 
techniques and procedures, and use of new technologies to 
conduct financial transactions, Citi and its clients, customers 
and third parties are and will continue to be at risk from 
cyberattacks and information security incidents. Citi 
recognizes the significance of these risks and, therefore, 
leverages a threat-focused strategy to protect against, detect 
and respond to, and recover from cyberattacks. Further, Citi 
actively participates in financial industry, government and 
cross-sector knowledge-sharing groups to enhance individual 
and collective cybersecurity preparedness and resilience. 

Risk Management
Citi’s technology and cybersecurity risk management program 
is built on three lines of defense. Citi’s first line of defense 
under the Office of the Chief Information Security Officer 
provides frontline business, operational and technical controls 
and capabilities to protect against cybersecurity risks, and to 
respond to cyber incidents and data breaches. Citi manages 
these threats through state-of-the-art Fusion Centers, which 
serve as central commands for monitoring and coordinating 
responses to cyber threats. The enterprise information security 
team is responsible for infrastructure defense and security 
controls, performing vulnerability assessments and third-party 
information security assessments, employee awareness and 
training programs and security incident management. In each 
case the team works in coordination with a network of 
information security officers who are embedded within the 
businesses and functions globally. 

Citi’s Operational Risk Management-Technology and 

Cyber (ORM-T/C) and Independent Compliance Risk 
Management-Technology and Information Security (ICRM-T) 
groups serve as the second line of defense, and actively 
evaluate, anticipate and challenge Citi’s risk mitigation 
practices and capabilities. Citi seeks to proactively identify 
and remediate technology and cybersecurity risks before they 
materialize as incidents that negatively affect business 
operations. Accordingly, the ORM-T/C team independently 
challenges and monitors capabilities in accordance with Citi’s 
defined Technology and Cyber Risk Appetite statements. To 
address evolving cybersecurity risks and corresponding 
regulations, ORM-T/C and ICRM-T teams collectively also 
monitor cyber legal and regulatory requirements, identify and 
define emerging risks, execute strategic cyber threat 
assessments, perform new products and initiative reviews, 
perform data management risk oversight and conduct cyber 
risk assurance reviews (inclusive of third-party assessments). 
In addition, ORM-T/C employs tools and oversees and 
challenges metrics that are both tailored to cybersecurity and 
technology and aligned with Citi’s overall operational risk 
management framework to effectively track, identify and 
manage risk.

Internal audit serves as the third line of defense and 
independently provides assurance on how effectively the 
organization as a whole manages cybersecurity risk. Citi also 
has multiple senior committees such as the Information 
Security Risk Committee (ISRC), which governs enterprise-
level risk tolerance inclusive of cybersecurity risk.

Board Oversight
Citi’s Board of Directors and/or one or more Board 
Committees provides oversight of management’s efforts to 
mitigate cybersecurity risk and respond to cyber incidents. The 
Board and/or one or more Board Committees receives regular 
reports on cybersecurity and engages in discussions 
throughout the year with management and subject-matter 
experts on the effectiveness of Citi’s overall cybersecurity 
program. The Board and/or one or more Board Committees 
also obtains updates on Citi’s inherent cybersecurity risks and 
Citi’s road map and progress for addressing these risks. 
Moreover, Citi’s Board and its committee members 
receive contemporaneous reporting on significant cyber events 

including response, legal obligations, and outreach and 
notification to regulators, and customers when needed, as well 
as guidance to management as appropriate. On an annual 
basis, the Board’s Risk Management Committee approved a 
standalone Cybersecurity Risk Appetite Statement against 
which Citi’s performance is measured quarterly. For additional 
information on the Board’s oversight of cybersecurity risk 
management, see Citi’s upcoming 2023 Proxy Statement to be 
filed with the SEC in March 2023. 

COMPLIANCE RISK
Compliance risk is the risk to current or projected financial 
condition and resilience arising from violations of laws, rules, 
or regulations, or from non-conformance with prescribed 
practices, internal policies and procedures or ethical standards. 
Compliance risk exposes Citi to fines, civil money penalties, 
payment of damages and the voiding of contracts. Compliance 
risk can result in diminished reputation, harm to Citi’s 
customers, limited business opportunities and lessened 
expansion potential. It encompasses the risk of noncompliance 
with all laws and regulations, as well as prudent ethical 
standards and some contractual obligations. It could also 
include exposure to litigation (known as legal risk) from all 
aspects of traditional and non-traditional banking.

Citi seeks to operate with integrity, maintain strong 

ethical standards and adhere to applicable policies and 
regulatory and legal requirements. Citi must maintain and 
execute a proactive Compliance Risk Management (CRM) 
Framework (as set forth in the CRM Policy) that is designed to 
manage compliance risk effectively across Citi, with a view to 
fundamentally strengthen the compliance risk management 
culture across the lines of defense taking into account Citi’s 
risk governance framework and regulatory requirements. 
Independent Compliance Risk Management’s (ICRM) primary 
objectives are to:

•

Drive and embed a culture of compliance and control 
throughout Citi;

• Maintain and oversee an integrated CRM Framework that 
facilitates enterprise-wide compliance with local, national 
or cross-border laws, rules or regulations, Citi’s internal 
policies, standards and procedures and relevant standards 
of conduct;
Assess compliance risks and issues across product lines, 
functions and geographies, supported by globally 
consistent systems and compliance risk management 
processes; and
Provide compliance risk data aggregation and reporting 
capabilities.

•

•

Citi carries out its objectives and fulfills its 

responsibilities through the CRM Framework, which is 
composed of the following integrated key activities, to 
holistically manage compliance risk:

• Management of Citi’s compliance with laws, rules and 
regulations by identifying and analyzing changes, 
assessing the impact, and implementing appropriate 
policies, processes and controls;

112

•

Developing and providing compliance training to ensure 
colleagues are aware of and understand the key laws, 
rules and regulations;

• Monitoring the Compliance Risk Appetite, which is 

•

•

articulated through qualitative compliance risk statements 
describing Citi’s appetite for certain types of risk and 
quantitative measures to monitor the Company’s 
compliance risk exposure;
Executing Compliance Risk Assessments, the results of 
which inform Compliance Risk Monitoring and testing of 
compliance risks and controls in assessing conformance 
with laws, rules, regulations and internal policies; and
Issue identification, escalation and remediation to drive 
accountability, including measurement and reporting of 
compliance risk metrics against established thresholds in 
support of the CRM Policy and Compliance Risk 
Appetite.

To anticipate, control and mitigate compliance risk, Citi 
has established the CRM Policy to achieve standardization and 
centralization of methodologies and processes, and to enable 
more consistent and comprehensive execution of compliance 
risk management. 

Citi has a commitment, as well as an obligation, to 
identify, assess and mitigate compliance risks associated with 
its businesses and functions. ICRM is responsible for 
oversight of Citi’s CRM Policy, while all businesses and 
global control functions are responsible for managing their 
compliance risks and operating within the Compliance Risk 
Appetite. 

As discussed above, Citi is working to address the FRB 

and OCC consent orders, which include improvements to 
Citi’s CRM Framework and its enterprise-wide application 
(for additional information regarding the consent orders, see 
“Citi’s Consent Order Compliance” above).

REPUTATION RISK 
Citi’s reputation is a vital asset in building trust and Citi is 
diligent in enhancing and protecting its reputation with its key 
stakeholders. To support this, Citi has developed a reputation 
risk framework. Under this framework, Citigroup and 
Citibank, N.A. have implemented a risk appetite statement and 
related key indicators to monitor corporate activities and 
operations relative to Citi’s risk appetite. The framework also 
requires that business segments and regions escalate potential 
material reputation risks that require review or mitigation 
through a Reputation Risk Committee or equivalent.

The Reputation Risk Committees, which are composed of 
Citi’s senior executives, govern the process by which material 
reputation risks are identified, measured, monitored, 
controlled and reported. The Reputation Risk Committees 
determine the appropriate actions to be taken in line with risk 
appetite and regulatory expectations, while promoting a 
culture of risk awareness and high standards of integrity and 
ethical behavior across the Company, consistent with Citi’s 
Mission and Value Proposition. The Citigroup Reputation 
Risk Committee may escalate reputation risks to the 
Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee or 
other appropriate committee of the Citigroup Board of 
Directors. 

113

Every Citi employee is responsible for safeguarding Citi’s 

reputation, guided by Citi’s Code of Conduct. Colleagues are 
expected to exercise sound judgment and common sense in 
decisions and actions. They are also expected to promptly 
escalate all issues that present material reputation risk in line 
with policy.

STRATEGIC RISK
As discussed above, strategic risk is the risk of a sustained 
impact (not episodic impact) to Citi’s core strategic objectives 
as measured by impacts on anticipated earnings, market 
capitalization, or capital, arising from external factors 
affecting the Company’s operating environment, as well as the 
risks associated with defining the strategy and executing the 
strategy, which are identified, measured and managed as part 
of the Strategic Risk Framework at the Enterprise Level. 

In this context, external factors affecting Citi’s operating 

environment are the economic environment, geopolitical/
political landscape, industry/competitive landscape, societal 
trends, customer/client behavior, regulatory/legislative 
environment and trends related to investors/shareholders.

Citi’s Executive Management Team is responsible for the 
development and execution of Citi’s strategy. This strategy is 
translated into forward-looking plans (collectively Citi’s 
Strategic Plan) that are then cascaded across the organization. 
Citi’s Strategic Plan is presented to the Board on an annual 
basis, and is aligned with risk appetite thresholds and includes 
a risk assessment as required by internal frameworks. It is also 
aligned with limit requirements for capital allocation. 
Governance and oversight of strategic risk is facilitated by 
internal committees on a group-wide basis as well as strategic 
committees at the operating segment and regional levels.

Citi works to ensure that strategic risks are adequately 
considered and addressed across its various risk management 
activities, and that strategic risks are assessed in the context of 
Citi’s risk appetite. Citi conducts a top-down, bottom-up risk 
identification process to identify risks, including strategic 
risks. Business segments undertake a quarterly risk 
identification process to systematically identify and document 
all material risks faced by Citi. Independent Risk Management 
oversees the risk identification process through regular 
reviews and coordinates identification and monitoring of top 
risks. In addition, Citi performs a quarterly Risk Assessment 
of the Plan (RAOP) and continuously monitors risks 
associated with its execution of strategy. Independent Risk 
Management also manages strategic risk by monitoring risk 
appetite thresholds in conjunction with various strategic risk 
committees, which are part of the governance structure that 
Citi has in place to manage its strategic risks. 

For additional information on Citi’s strategic risks, see 

“Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” above.

Climate Risk
Climate change presents immediate and long-term risks to Citi 
and its clients and customers, with the risks expected to 
increase over time. Climate risk refers to the risk of loss 
arising from climate change and comprises both physical risk 
and transition risk. Physical risk considers how chronic and 
acute climate change (e.g., increased storms, drought, fires, 
floods) can directly damage physical assets (e.g., real estate, 

crops) or otherwise impact their value or productivity. 
Transition risk considers how changes in policy, technology, 
business practices and market preferences to address climate 
change (e.g., carbon pricing policies, power generation shifts 
from fossil fuels to renewable energy) can lead to changes in 
the value of assets, commodities and companies.

sustainable finance and actively engage with regulators on 
these topics.

For additional information about sustainability and other 

ESG matters at Citi, see “Sustainability and Other ESG 
Matters” above.

Climate risk is an overarching risk that can act as a driver 

OTHER RISKS

of other categories of risk, such as credit risk from obligors 
exposed to high climate risk, strategic risks if Citi fails to 
consider transition risk in client selection, reputational risk 
from increased stakeholder concerns about financing high-
carbon industries and operational risk from physical risks to 
Citi’s facilities and personnel. Citi’s focus on climate risk 
continues to increase, driven by materiality of strategic, 
reputational and financial risk considerations. Citi continues to 
make progress toward embedding these considerations into its 
overarching risk management approach. For additional 
information on climate risk, see “Risk Factors—Strategic 
Risks” above.

Citi reviews factors related to climate risk under its 
Environmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM) Policy, 
which includes a focus on climate risk related to financed 
projects and clients in high-carbon sectors. Considering the 
credit risk of stranded assets, as well as the reputational risks 
associated with the coal sector due to its high-carbon 
emissions, Citi’s ESRM Policy includes a prohibition on all 
project-related financing of new coal-fired power plants and 
new or expanding thermal coal mines, as well as timetables to 
reduce financing of companies with high exposure to coal-
fired power and coal mining that do not pursue low-carbon 
transition in the coming years. These sector approaches set 
clear expectations for clients and help address certain climate 
risk-driven credit risk concerns while reducing reputation risk.
Citi continues to explore and test methodologies for 

quantifying how climate risks could impact the individual 
credit profiles of its clients across various sectors. To assist in 
embedding climate risk assessments in its credit assessment 
process, Citi has developed sector-specific climate risk 
assessments. Such climate risk assessments are designed to 
supplement publicly available client disclosures and data 
provided from third-party vendors and facilitate conversations 
with clients on their most material climate risks and 
management plans for adaptation and mitigation. Citi’s 
assessments consider sectors that have been identified as 
higher climate risk by its risk identification process. This will 
help Citi better understand its clients’ businesses and climate-
related risks. Citi’s Net Zero plan is leading to the further 
integration of climate risk discussions into client engagement 
and client selection.

Citi continues to develop globally consistent principles 
and approaches for managing climate risk across the Company 
through the implementation of its Climate Risk Management 
Framework. Through this implementation, climate risk is 
being embedded into relevant policies and processes over 
time.

Furthermore, Citi continues to participate in financial 
industry initiatives and develop and pilot new methodologies 
and approaches for measuring and assessing the potential 
financial risks of climate change. Citi also continues to 
monitor regulatory developments on climate risk and

LIBOR Transition Risk
As previously disclosed, the LIBOR administrator ceased 
publication of non-USD LIBOR and one-week and two-month 
USD LIBOR on a permanent or representative basis on 
December 31, 2021, with plans for all other USD LIBOR 
tenors to permanently cease or become non-representative 
after June 30, 2023. As a result, Citi ceased entering into new 
contracts referencing USD LIBOR as of January 1, 2022, 
other than for limited circumstances where regulators 
recognized that it may be appropriate for banks to enter into 
new USD LIBOR contracts, including with respect to market-
making, hedging or novations of USD transactions executed 
before January 1, 2022. (For information about risks to Citi 
from a transition away from and discontinuation of LIBOR or 
any other benchmark rates, see “Risk Factors—Other Risks” 
above.)

During 2022, Citi continued its efforts to manage its 
LIBOR transition risks. Citi has been focused on further 
reducing its LIBOR exposure and remediating its remaining 
outstanding LIBOR-linked contracts. In addition, Citi has 
continued to monitor and engage on legislative, regulatory and 
other initiatives and developments related to LIBOR transition 
matters. 

As of December 31, 2022, Citi had a USD LIBOR-linked 

gross notional exposure of approximately $7.1 trillion that 
matures after the LIBOR cessation date of June 30, 2023, of 
which approximately $7 trillion relates to derivatives. This 
derivatives exposure includes (i) bilateral derivatives with a 
gross notional of approximately $2.5 trillion of which 96% is 
already remediated through inclusion of ISDA fallbacks and 
(ii) cleared derivatives with a gross notional of approximately 
$4.5 trillion that will be covered by the Central Counterparty 
Clearing House (CCP) conversions planned for the second 
quarter of 2023. 

The remaining gross notional of approximately $0.15 
trillion relates to cash products (e.g., loans, debt securities, 
preferred stock and securitizations), which Citi continues to 
address through active conversion or insertion of robust 
contract fallback language or is covered by legislative 
solutions such as the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act 
(see the discussion below). Due to rounding, USD LIBOR-
linked derivatives and cash products exposure may not sum to 
total USD LIBOR-linked gross notional exposure.

In the U.S., the LIBOR Act provides for the use of a 
statutory replacement for the overnight, one-month, three-
month, six-month and 12-month tenors of USD LIBOR in all 
contracts governed by U.S. law that lack adequate fallback 
provisions. As required by the LIBOR Act, each proposed 
replacement rate, which differs depending on product type, is 
based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). 
Citi’s USD LIBOR-linked securities and contracts that do not 
have adequate fallbacks as described in the LIBOR Act and 

that are governed by U.S. law will fall within the application 
of the LIBOR Act. As a result, USD LIBOR in these contracts 
will be replaced with SOFR plus the applicable spread 
adjustment. 

Citi is focused on remediating contracts that reference the 

USD LIBOR Ice Swap Rate and non-U.S. law contracts, 
which are not covered by the LIBOR Act. As of December 31, 
2022, Citi had a USD LIBOR Ice Swap Rate gross notional 
exposure of approximately $0.17 trillion. This includes 
approximately $0.16 trillion of bilateral derivatives, of which 
79% has already been remediated through inclusion of ISDA 
fallbacks, and approximately $0.01 trillion of debt securities 
that Citi is addressing through its remediation action plans. 
The USD LIBOR Ice Swap Rate is a separate rate from USD 
LIBOR and is not included in the USD LIBOR-linked gross 
notional exposure. 

On November 23, 2022, the FCA proposed the 

publication of one-, three- and six-month USD LIBOR on a 
synthetic basis through September 2024, which would provide 
additional time for non-U.S.-law-governed contracts and any 
contracts that reference the USD LIBOR Ice Swap Rate to be 
remediated or mature. 

Further, Citi continued to engage with regulators, 
financial accounting bodies and others on LIBOR transition 
matters. This included participating in a number of working 
groups, including the Alternative Reference Rates Committee 
(ARRC) convened by the FRB, to promote and advance 
development of SOFR and seek to identify and address 
potential challenges from LIBOR transition.

Citi has also continued to use alternative reference rates in 

certain newly issued financial instruments. Citi has issued 
floating rate benchmark and customer-related debt linked to 
SOFR and originated and arranged loans linked to SOFR. 
Citi’s derivatives contracts are predominantly linked to SOFR 
and other global alternative reference rates. Citi also provides 
term SOFR-linked products to clients in accordance with 
industry best practices and recommendations.

Country Risk 

Top 25 Country Exposures
The following table presents Citi’s top 25 exposures by 
country (excluding the U.S.) as of December 31, 2022. 
(Including the U.S., the total exposure as of December 31, 
2022 to the top 25 countries would represent approximately 
98% of Citi’s exposure to all countries.) 

For purposes of the table, loan amounts are reflected in 
the country where the loan is booked, which is generally based 
on the domicile of the borrower. For example, a loan to a 
Chinese subsidiary of a Switzerland-based corporation will 
generally be categorized as a loan in China. In addition, Citi 
has developed regional booking centers in certain countries, 
most significantly in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland, 

in order to more efficiently serve its corporate customers. As 
an example, with respect to the U.K., only 38% of corporate 
loans presented in the table below are to U.K. domiciled 
entities (40% for unfunded commitments), with the balance of 
the loans predominately to European domiciled counterparties. 
Approximately 90% of the total U.K. funded loans and 89% of 
the total U.K. unfunded commitments were investment grade 
as of December 31, 2022. 

Trading account assets and investment securities are 
generally categorized based on the domicile of the issuer of 
the security of the underlying reference entity. For additional 
information on the assets included in the table, see the 
footnotes to the table below.

Russia

Introduction
In Russia, Citi has operated through both its ICG and Legacy 
Franchises segments. Citi continues to closely monitor the 
war in Ukraine, related sanctions and economic conditions and 
continues to mitigate its Russia exposures and risks as 
appropriate.

As previously disclosed, Citi intends to wind down nearly 
all of its consumer, local commercial and institutional banking 
businesses in the country. As a result, Citi has ceased 
soliciting any new business or new clients in Russia. Citi will 
continue to manage its existing legal and regulatory 
commitments and obligations, as well as support its 

employees, during this period. For additional information, see 
“Citi’s Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations” below.

For additional information about Citi’s risks related to its 
Russia exposures, see “Risk Factors—Market-Related Risk,” 
“—Operational Risks” and “—Other Risks” above.

Impact of Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine on Citi’s Businesses

Russia-related Balance Sheet Exposures 
Citi’s domestic operations in Russia are conducted through a 
subsidiary of Citibank, AO Citibank, which uses the Russian 
ruble as its functional currency.

(1) 

Investment securities include debt securities available-for-sale (AFS), recorded at fair market value, primarily local government debt securities. There were no 
impairment losses recognized during the third and fourth quarters of 2022.

(2)  Net mark-to-market (MTM) on OTC derivatives and securities lending/borrowing transactions (repos). Effective from 2Q22, reverse repurchase agreements have 

been shown gross of collateral and reclassified to net MTM on derivatives/repos in the table above, as netting of collateral for Russia-related reverse repurchase 
agreements was removed. This removal was due to the inability to conclude, with a well-founded basis, the enforceability of contractual rights in the Russian legal 
system in the event of a counterparty default, given the geopolitical uncertainty caused by the war in Ukraine. As this exposure was already included in Total 
third-party exposure, the Total Russia exposure was not impacted by this reclassification.

(3)  Unfunded exposure consists of unfunded corporate lending commitments, letters of credit and other contingencies. 
(4)  Cash on deposit and placements are primarily with the Central Bank of Russia.
(5)  Represents dividends received by Citi in its role as custodian for investor clients in Russia. Citi is unable to remit these funds to clients due to restrictions imposed 

by the Russian government.

(6)  The majority of AO Citibank’s third-party exposures was funded with domestic deposit liabilities from both corporate and personal banking clients.
(7)  Citigroup’s CTA loss included in its AOCI related to its indirect subsidiary, AO Citibank, is excluded from the above table, because the CTA loss is not held in 
AO Citibank and would be recognized in Citigroup’s earnings upon either the substantial liquidation or a loss of control of AO Citibank. Citi has separately 
described these risks in “Deconsolidation Risk” below.

117

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During the fourth quarter of 2022, Citi continued to 
reduce its operations in Russia and Russia-related exposures, 
resulting in a net decrease in total Russia exposure of $0.4 
billion, shown in the table above, as well as a change in the 
composition of its exposure as mitigation efforts have reduced 
Citi’s third-party credit risk. The sequential decline in 
exposure was driven by a $1.3 billion decrease due to 
depreciation of the ruble against the U.S. dollar and a $0.9 
billion decrease due to loan repayments and sales, partially 
offset by a $1.8 billion increase in local currency terms, driven 
by dividends received by Citi as custodian for investor clients 
in Russia that Citi is unable to remit due to restrictions 
imposed by the Russian government.

Citi’s continued risk mitigation efforts include ICG 
borrower paydowns and limiting extensions of new credit. 
ICG’s credit exposure also reflected a shift to a higher 
proportion of stronger credit names, including a higher 
proportion of subsidiaries of multinational companies that are 
headquartered outside of Russia, primarily in the U.S. and 
Europe. The decline in overall exposure was also driven by a 
reduction in exposures to Russian counterparties not held by 
AO Citibank.

Citi’s net investment in Russia was approximately $1.2 
billion as of December 31, 2022 (compared to $1.3 billion as 
of September 30, 2022). The decrease was primarily driven by 
a $0.2 billion decrease due to depreciation of the ruble against 
the U.S. dollar, partially offset by an increase of $0.1 billion in 
retained earnings. A portion of Citi’s net investment was 
hedged for foreign currency depreciation as of December 31, 
2022, using forward foreign exchange contracts executed with 
international peer banks. 

Earnings and Other Impacts on Citi’s Businesses
Citi’s ICG, PBWM and Legacy Franchises segments and 
Corporate/Other have been impacted by various 
macroeconomic factors and volatilities, including Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine and its direct and indirect impact on the 
European and global economies. For a broader discussion of 
these factors and volatilities on Citi’s businesses, see 
“Executive Summary” and each business’s results of 
operations above. 

As of December 31, 2022, Citigroup’s ACL included a 

$0.3 billion remaining credit reserve for Citi’s direct and 
indirect Russian counterparties (down from $0.5 billion at 
September 30, 2022).

Citi’s Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations 
In August 2022, Citi disclosed its decision to wind down its 
Russia consumer and local commercial banking businesses, 
including actively pursuing portfolio sales. In connection with 
the wind-down plan, Citi incurred $22 million (excluding the 
impact from any portfolio sales) of costs in 2022.

In October 2022, Citi announced that it will be ending 

nearly all of the institutional banking services it offers in 
Russia by the end of the first quarter of 2023. Going forward, 
Citi’s only operations in Russia will be those necessary to 
fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations.

On October 28, 2022, Citi entered into an agreement to 

sell a portfolio of ruble-denominated personal installment 
loans, totaling approximately $240 million in outstanding loan 

118

balances as of the fourth quarter of 2022, to Uralsib, a Russian 
commercial bank. Citi closed the sale in December 2022 and 
incurred a pretax net loss of approximately $12 million as a 
result. In connection with the portfolio sale, Citi also entered 
into a referral agreement to settle to Uralsib a portfolio of 
ruble-denominated credit card loans, subject to customer 
consents. The outstanding card loans balance was 
approximately $219 million as of the fourth quarter of 2022. 
Citi will refer credit card customers, who at the customers’ 
sole discretion will be eligible to refinance their outstanding 
card loan balances with Uralsib.

At this time, Citi expects to incur estimated costs of 
approximately $190 million in connection with its consumer 
and institutional wind-down plans in Russia, primarily through 
2024 ($80 million in ICG and $110 million in Legacy 
Franchises). For additional information, see “Institutional 
Clients Group” and “Legacy Franchises” above.

Deconsolidation Risk
Citi’s operations in Russia subject it to various risks, 
including, among others, foreign currency volatility, including 
appreciations or devaluations; restrictions arising from 
retaliatory Russian laws and regulations on the conduct of its 
business; sanctions or asset freezes; or other deconsolidation 
events (for additional information, see “Risk Factors—Other 
Risks” above). Examples of triggers that may result in 
deconsolidation of AO Citibank include voluntary or forced 
sale of ownership or loss of control due to actions of relevant 
governmental authorities, including expropriation (i.e., the 
entity becomes subject to the complete control of a 
government, court, administrator, trustee or regulator); 
revocation of banking license; and loss of ability to elect a 
board of directors or appoint members of senior management. 
As of December 31, 2022, Citi continued to consolidate AO 
Citibank because none of the deconsolidation factors were 
triggered.

In the event of a loss of control of AO Citibank, Citi 

would be required to (i) write off the net investment of 
approximately $1.2 billion (compared to $1.3 billion as of 
September 30, 2022), (ii) recognize a CTA loss of 
approximately $1.3 billion through earnings (compared to $1.0 
billion as of September 30, 2022) and (iii) recognize a loss of 
$0.5 billion (compared to $0.3 billion as of September 30, 
2022) on intercompany liabilities owed by AO Citibank to 
other Citi entities outside Russia. In the sole event of a 
substantial liquidation, as opposed to a loss of control, Citi 
would be required to recognize the CTA loss of approximately 
$1.3 billion through earnings and would evaluate its remaining 
net investment as circumstances evolve.

Citi as Paying Agent for Russian-related Clients
Citi serves or served as paying agent on bonds issued by 
various entities in Russia, including Russian corporate clients. 
Citi’s role as paying agent is administrative. In this role, Citi 
acts as an agent of its client, the bond issuer, receiving interest 
and principal payments from the bond issuer and then making 
payments to international central securities depositories (e.g., 
Depository Trust Company, Euroclear, Clearstream). The 
international central securities depositories (ICSDs) make 
payments to those participants or account holders (e.g., broker/

in the country, cessation of new business and client 
originations, and reduction of other exposures.

Citi’s continued presence or divestiture of businesses in 

Russia could also increase its susceptibility to cyberattacks 
that could negatively impact its relationships with clients and 
customers, harm its reputation, increase its compliance costs 
and adversely affect its business operations and results of 
operations. For additional information on operational and 
cyber risks, see “Risk Factors—Operational Risk” above.

Board’s Role in Overseeing Related Risks
The Citi Board of Directors (Board) and the Board’s Risk 
Management Committee (RMC) and its other Committees 
have received and continue to receive regular reports from 
senior management regarding the war in Ukraine and its 
impact on Citi’s operations in Russia, Ukraine and elsewhere, 
as well as the war’s broader geopolitical, macroeconomic and 
reputational impacts. In addition to receiving regular briefings 
from management, the full Board has routinely been invited to 
attend portions of the RMC meetings for discussions related to 
the war in Ukraine, including with respect to Citi’s risk 
exposures and stress testing. The reports to the Board and its 
Committees from senior management who represent the 
impacted businesses and the EMEA region, Independent Risk 
Management, Finance, Independent Compliance Risk 
Management, including those individuals responsible for 
sanctions compliance, and Human Resources, have included 
detailed information regarding financial impacts, impacts on 
capital, cybersecurity, strategic considerations, sanctions 
compliance, employee assistance and reputational risks, 
enabling the Board and its Committees to properly exercise 
their oversight responsibilities. In addition, senior 
management has also provided updates to Citi’s Executive 
Management Team and the Board, outside of formal meetings, 
regarding Citi’s Russia-related risks, including with respect to 
cybersecurity matters.

dealers) that have clients who are investors in the applicable 
bonds (i.e., bondholders). As a paying agent, Citi generally 
does not have information about the identity of the 
bondholders. Citi may be exposed to risks due to its 
responsibilities for receiving and processing payments on 
behalf of its clients as a result of sanctions or other 
governmental requirements and prohibitions. To mitigate 
operational and sanctions risks, Citi has established policies, 
procedures and controls for client relationships and payment 
processing to help ensure compliance with U.S., U.K., EU and 
other jurisdictions’ sanctions laws.

These processes may require Citi to delay or withhold the 

processing of payments as a result of sanctions on the bond 
issuer. Citi is also prevented from making payments to 
accounts on behalf of bondholders should the ICSDs disclose 
to Citi the presence of sanctioned bondholders. In both 
instances, Citi is generally required to segregate, restrict or 
block the funds until applicable sanctions are lifted or the 
payment is otherwise authorized under applicable law.

Reputational Risks
Citi has continued its efforts to enhance and protect its 
reputation with its colleagues, clients, customers, investors, 
regulators and the public. Citi’s response to the war in 
Ukraine, including any action or inaction, may have a negative 
impact on Citi’s reputation with some or all of these parties.
For example, Citi is exposed to reputational risk as a 
result of its current presence in Russia and association with 
Russian individuals or entities, whether subject to sanctions or 
not, including Citi’s inability to support its global clients in 
Russia, which could adversely affect its broader client 
relationships and businesses; current involvement in 
transactions or supporting activities involving Russian assets 
or interests; failure to correctly interpret and apply laws and 
regulations, including those related to sanctions; perceived 
misalignment of Citi’s actions to its stated strategy in Russia; 
and the reputational impact from Citi’s activity and 
engagement with Ukraine or with non-Russian clients exiting 
their Russia businesses. Citi has considered the potential for 
reputation risk and taken actions to mitigate such risks. Citi 
established a Russia Special Review Process with 
management’s Reputation Risk Committee with oversight for 
significant Russia-related reputation risks and completed a 
number of reputation risk reviews of matters with a Russian 
nexus.

While Citi announced its intention to wind down its 
businesses in Russia, Citi will continue to manage those 
operations during the wind-down process and will be required 
to maintain certain limited operations to fulfill its remaining 
legal and regulatory obligations. Also, sanctions and sanctions 
compliance are highly complex and may change over time and 
result in increased operational risk. Failure to fully comply 
with relevant sanctions or the application of sanctions where 
they should not be applied may negatively impact Citi’s 
reputation. In addition, Citi currently performs services for, 
conducts business with or deals in non-sanctioned Russian-
owned businesses and Russian assets. This has attracted, and 
will likely continue to attract, negative attention, despite the 
previously disclosed plan to wind down nearly all its activities 

119

Ukraine
Citi has continued to operate in Ukraine throughout the war 
through its ICG businesses, serving the local subsidiaries of 
multinationals, along with local financial institutions and the 
public sector. Citi employs approximately 230 people in 
Ukraine and their safety is Citi’s top priority.

All of Citi’s domestic operations in Ukraine are 

conducted through a subsidiary of Citibank, which uses the 
Ukrainian hryvnia as its functional currency. Citi’s exposures 
in Ukraine are not significant enough to be included in the 
“Top 25 Country Exposures” table above. As of December 31, 
2022, these exposures amounted to $1.0 billion, unchanged 
from September 30, 2022, and were exclusively composed of 
third-party assets held on the Citi Ukraine subsidiary.

Argentina
Citi operates in Argentina through its ICG businesses. As of 
December 31, 2022, Citi’s net investment in its Argentine 
operations was approximately $1.7 billion. Under U.S. GAAP, 
Citi uses the U.S. dollar as the functional currency for its 
operations in countries that are deemed highly inflationary. 
Citi uses Argentina’s official market exchange rate to 
remeasure its net Argentine peso-denominated assets into the 
U.S. dollar. As of December 31, 2022, the official Argentine 
peso exchange rate against the U.S. dollar was 177.15.

As previously disclosed, the Central Bank of Argentina 
has continued to maintain certain capital and currency controls 
that restrict Citi’s ability to access U.S. dollars in Argentina 
and remit earnings from its Argentine operations. As a result, 
Citi’s net investment in its Argentine operations is likely to 
continue to increase as Citi generates net income in its 
Argentine franchise and its earnings cannot be remitted.

Due to the currency controls implemented by the Central 

Bank of Argentina, certain indirect foreign exchange 
mechanisms have developed that some Argentine entities may 
use to obtain U.S. dollars, generally at rates that are 
significantly higher than Argentina’s official exchange rate. 
Citibank Argentina is precluded from accessing these 
alternative mechanisms, and these exchange mechanisms 
cannot be used to remeasure Citi’s net monetary assets into the 
U.S. dollar under U.S. GAAP. However, if Argentina’s 
official exchange rate converges with the approximate rate 
implied by the indirect foreign exchange mechanisms, Citi 
could incur a loss on its capital in Argentina. Citi cannot 
predict future fluctuations in Argentina’s official market 
exchange rate or to what extent Citi may be able to access U.S. 
dollars at the official exchange rate in the future.

Citi economically hedges the foreign currency risk in its 
net Argentine peso-denominated assets to the extent possible 
and prudent using non-deliverable forward (NDF) derivative 
instruments that are primarily executed outside of Argentina. 
As of December 31, 2022, the international NDF market had 
very limited liquidity, resulting in Citi’s inability to 
economically hedge its Argentine peso exposure. Accordingly, 
and to the extent that Citi does not execute NDF contracts for 
this unhedged exposure in the future, Citi would record 
devaluations on its net Argentine peso-denominated assets in 
earnings, without any benefit from a change in the fair value 
of derivative positions used to economically hedge the 
exposure. 

120

Citi continually evaluates its economic exposure to its 
Argentine counterparties and reserves for changes in credit 
risk and records mark-to-market adjustments for relevant 
market risks associated with its Argentine assets. Citi believes 
it has established an appropriate ACL on its Argentine loans, 
and appropriate fair value adjustments on Argentine assets and 
liabilities measured at fair value, for credit and sovereign risks 
under U.S. GAAP as of December 31, 2022. However, U.S. 
regulatory agencies may require Citi to record additional 
reserves in the future, increasing ICG’s cost of credit, based on 
the perceived country risk associated with its Argentine 
exposures. 

For additional information on Citi’s emerging markets 
risks, including those related to its Argentine exposures, see 
“Risk Factors” above.

FFIEC—Cross-Border Claims on Third Parties and Local 
Country Assets
Citi’s cross-border disclosures are presented below, based on 
the country exposure bank regulatory reporting guidelines of 
the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council 
(FFIEC). The following summarizes some of the key FFIEC 
reporting guidelines:

•

•

•

•

•

Amounts are based on the domicile of the ultimate 
obligor, counterparty, collateral (only including qualifying 
liquid collateral), issuer or guarantor, as applicable (e.g., a 
security recorded by a Citi U.S. entity but issued by the 
U.K. government is considered U.K. exposure; a loan 
recorded by a Citi Mexico entity to a customer domiciled 
in Mexico where the underlying collateral is held in 
Germany is considered German exposure). 
Amounts do not consider the benefit of collateral received 
for secured financing transactions (i.e., repurchase 
agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and securities 
loaned and borrowed) and are reported based on notional 
amounts. 
Netting of derivative receivables and payables, reported at 
fair value, is permitted, but only under a legally binding 
netting agreement with the same specific counterparty, 
and does not include the benefit of margin received or 
hedges.
Credit default swaps (CDS) are included based on the 
gross notional amount sold and purchased and do not 
include any offsetting CDS on the same underlying entity. 
Loans are reported without the benefit of hedges.

Given the requirements noted above, Citi’s FFIEC cross-
border exposures and total outstandings tend to fluctuate, in 
some cases significantly, from period to period. As an 
example, because total outstandings under FFIEC guidelines 
do not include the benefit of margin or hedges, market 
volatility in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and credit 
spreads may cause significant fluctuations in the level of total 
outstandings, all else being equal.

The tables below show each country whose total outstandings exceeded 0.75% of total Citigroup assets:
