MANAGING GLOBAL RISK

For Citi, effective risk management is of primary importance 
to its overall operations. Accordingly, Citi’s risk management 
process has been designed to monitor, evaluate and manage 
the principal risks it assumes in conducting its activities. 
Specifically, the activities that Citi engages in, and the risks 
those activities generate, must be consistent with Citi’s 
Mission and Value Proposition and the key Leadership 
Principles that support it, as well as Citi’s risk appetite. For 
more information on managing global risk at Citi, see 
“Managing Global Risk” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

CREDIT RISK

For more information on credit risk, including Citi’s credit risk 
management, measurement and stress testing, and Citi’s 
consumer and corporate credit portfolios, see “Credit Risk” 
and “Risk Factors” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

(1) See footnote 2 to the table in “Credit Risk—Consumer Credit—

Consumer Credit Portfolio” below.

On an average basis, loans increased 1% both year-over-
year and sequentially as growth in PBWM was largely offset 
by a decline in ICG and Legacy Franchises. PBWM average 
loans increased 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by loan 
growth in cards, mortgages and installment lending. ICG 
average loans decreased 4% year-over-year, reflecting actions 
taken to reduce RWA. Legacy Franchises average loans 
decreased 5%, primarily reflecting the impact of the continued 
wind-downs, particularly in Korea and China, partially offset 
by higher lending volumes in Mexico Consumer. 

End-of-period loans increased 3% year-over-year, as 
growth in PBWM, reflecting an increase in U.S. Personal 
Banking, was partially offset by declines in ICG and Legacy 
Franchises. End-of-period loans increased 1% sequentially.

Portfolio Mix—Geography and Counterparty
Citi’s corporate credit portfolio is diverse across geography 
and counterparty. The following table presents the percentage 
of this portfolio by region based on Citi’s internal 
management geography:

The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings 
across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison 
of credit exposure across all lines of business, geographic 
regions and products. Counterparty risk ratings reflect an 
estimated probability of default for a counterparty, and 
internal risk ratings are derived by leveraging validated 
statistical models and scorecards in combination with 
consideration of factors specific to the obligor or market, such 
as management experience, competitive position, regulatory 
environment and commodity prices. Facility risk ratings are 
assigned that reflect the probability of default of the obligor 
and factors that affect the loss given default of the facility, 
such as support or collateral. Internal obligor ratings that 
generally correspond to BBB and above are considered 
investment grade, while those below are considered non-
investment grade.

The following table presents the corporate credit portfolio 

by facility risk rating as a percentage of the total corporate 
credit portfolio:

Note: Total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending 
commitments. 

In addition to the obligor and facility risk ratings assigned 

to all exposures, Citi may classify exposures in the corporate 
credit portfolio. These classifications are consistent with Citi’s 
interpretation of the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of 
criticized exposures, which may categorize exposures as 
special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss.

Risk ratings and classifications are reviewed regularly and 
adjusted as appropriate. The credit review process incorporates 
quantitative and qualitative factors, including financial and 
non-financial disclosures or metrics, idiosyncratic events or 
changes to the competitive, regulatory or macroeconomic 
environment. 

Citi believes the corporate credit portfolio to be 

appropriately rated and classified as of September 30, 2023. 
Citi has taken action to adjust internal ratings and 
classifications of exposures as both the macroeconomic 
environment and obligor-specific factors have changed, 
particularly where additional stress has been seen. 

39

     
 
 
 
 
As obligor risk ratings are downgraded, the probability of 

default increases. Downgrades of obligor risk ratings tend to 
result in a higher provision for credit losses. In addition, 
appetite per obligor is reduced consistent with the ratings, and 
downgrades may result in the purchase of additional credit 
derivatives or other risk/structural mitigants to hedge the 
incremental credit risk, or may result in Citi’s seeking to 
reduce exposure to an obligor or an industry sector. Citi will 
continue to review exposures to ensure that the appropriate 
probability of default is incorporated into all risk assessments.
See Note 13 for additional information on Citi’s corporate 

credit portfolio.

(4)  Autos total credit exposure includes securitization financing facilities secured by auto loans and leases, extended mainly to the finance company subsidiaries of 
global auto manufacturers, bank subsidiaries and independent auto finance companies, of approximately $18.3 billion ($10.8 billion in funded, with 100% rated 
investment grade) as of September 30, 2023.
In addition to this exposure, Citi has energy-related exposure within the public sector (e.g., energy-related state-owned entities) and the transportation and 
industrials sector (e.g., off-shore drilling entities) included in the table above. As of September 30, 2023, Citi’s total exposure to these energy-related entities was 
approximately $5.0 billion, of which approximately $2.6 billion consisted of direct outstanding funded loans.
Includes $0.8 billion and $0.1 billion of funded and unfunded exposure at September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily related to commercial credit card 
delinquency-managed loans. 

(6) 

Exposure to Commercial Real Estate
As of September 30, 2023, Citi’s total credit exposure to 
commercial real estate (CRE) was $66 billion (unchanged 
from June 30, 2023), including $8 billion of exposure related 
to office buildings. This total CRE exposure consisted of (i) 
approximately $54 billion related to corporate clients 
(unchanged from June 30, 2023), mainly included in the real 
estate category in the table above, and (ii) approximately $11 
billion related to Private bank clients (unchanged from 
June 30, 2023) within PBWM that is not in the table above as 
they are not considered corporate exposures. 

41

In addition, as of September 30, 2023, approximately 86% 

of Citi’s total CRE exposure was rated investment grade and 
more than 76% was to borrowers in the U.S.

As of September 30, 2023, the ACLL attributed to the 

total funded CRE exposure (including the Private bank) was 
approximately 1.45%, and there were $743 million of non-
accrual CRE loans.

Credit Risk Mitigation
As part of its overall risk management activities, Citigroup 
uses credit derivatives, both partial- and full-term, and other 
risk mitigants to economically hedge portions of the credit risk 
in its corporate credit portfolio, in addition to outright asset 
sales. In advance of the expiration of partial-term economic 
hedges, Citi will determine, among other factors, the economic 
feasibility of hedging the remaining life of the instrument. The 
results of the mark-to-market and any realized gains or losses 
on credit derivatives are reflected primarily in Principal 
transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

At September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and December 31, 

2022, ICG had economic hedges on the corporate credit 
portfolio of $36.0 billion, $38.5 billion and $39.8 billion, 
respectively. Citi’s expected credit loss model used in the 
calculation of its ACL does not include the favorable impact 
of credit derivatives and other mitigants that are marked-to-
market. In addition, the reported amounts of direct 
outstandings and unfunded lending commitments in the tables 
above do not reflect the impact of these hedging transactions. 
The credit protection was economically hedging underlying 
ICG corporate credit portfolio exposures with the following 
risk rating distribution:

(1) End-of-period loans include interest and fees on credit cards.
(2) Asia Consumer loan balances, reported within Legacy Franchises, exclude any loans reclassified to held-for-sale (HFS) as of the date Citi enters into a sale 

agreement for the respective Asia Consumer banking business. These reclassified HFS loans are instead reported in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet until sale closing. The remaining Asia Consumer loan portfolios—China, Korea, Russia and Poland—are held-for-investment and included in end-of-period 
consumer loans for all periods presented. All HFS portfolios were reclassified prior to the end of 1Q22 except for a $1.8 billion portfolio, which was moved to 
HFS in 1Q23 and subsequently sold in 2Q23.

(3) Consists of $101.1 billion, $99.5 billion, $98.9 billion, $98.2 billion and $99.3 billion of loans in North America as of September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023, March 
31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively. For additional information on the credit quality of the Global Wealth portfolio, see Note 13.

(4) Consists of $49.5 billion, $51.0 billion, $51.0 billion, $51.0 billion and $51.8 billion of loans outside North America as of September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023, 

March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively.

(5) See Note 13 for details on loan-to-value ratios for the portfolios and FICO scores for the U.S. portfolio.
(6) At September 30, 2023, includes approximately $47 billion of classifiably managed loans. Over 90% of these loans are fully collateralized (consisting primarily of 

marketable investment securities, commercial real estate and limited partner capital commitments in private equity) and have experienced very low historical net 
credit losses (NCLs). As discussed below, approximately 95% of the classifiably managed portion of these loans are investment grade. See “Consumer Loan 
Delinquencies Amounts and Ratios” below for details on the delinquency-managed portfolio.
(7) Asia Consumer also includes loans and leases in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.

Consumer Credit Trends

Personal Banking and Wealth Management (PBWM)

Personal Banking and Wealth Management

Branded Cards

As indicated above, PBWM consists of U.S. Personal Banking 
and Global Wealth Management (Global Wealth). U.S. 
Personal Banking provides card products through Branded 
cards and Retail services, and also provides mortgages and 
home equity, small business and personal consumer loans 
through Citi’s Retail banking network. The Retail bank is 
concentrated in six major U.S. metropolitan areas. Global 
Wealth provides investment services, cards, mortgages and 
personal, small business and other consumer loans through the 
Private bank, Wealth at Work and Citigold. 

As of September 30, 2023, 45% of PBWM consumer 
loans consisted of U.S. cards loans. U.S. cards net credit losses 
represented approximately 94% of total PBWM losses. 

As shown in the chart above, the third quarter of 2023 net 

credit loss rate in PBWM increased quarter-over-quarter and 
year-over-year, largely driven by a continued increase in net 
flow rates (due to certain loans migrating into later-stage 
delinquency buckets), primarily reflecting the ongoing 
normalization in Branded cards and Retail services, including 
macroeconomic pressures related to the higher inflationary 
and interest rate environment. 

PBWM’s 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, largely driven by a 
continued increase in net flow rates (due to certain loans 
migrating into later-stage delinquency buckets), primarily 
reflecting the ongoing normalization in Branded cards and 
Retail services, including the macroeconomic pressures related 
to the higher inflationary and interest rate environment.

U.S. Personal Banking’s Branded cards portfolio includes 

proprietary and co-branded cards. 

As shown in the chart above, the third quarter of 2023 net 

credit loss rate and 90+ days past due delinquency rate in 
Branded cards increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-
year, largely driven by a continued increase in net flow rates 
(due to certain loans migrating into later-stage delinquency 
buckets), primarily reflecting ongoing normalization, 
including macroeconomic pressures related to the higher 
inflationary and interest rate environment. 

Retail Services

U.S. Personal Banking’s Retail services partners directly 

with more than 20 retailers and dealers to offer private label 
and co-branded cards. Retail services’ target market focuses 
on select industry segments such as home improvement, 
specialty retail, consumer electronics and fuel. Retail services 
continually evaluates opportunities to add partners within 
target industries that have strong loyalty, lending or payment 
programs and growth potential.

As shown in the chart above, the third quarter of 2023 net 

credit loss rate and 90+ days past due delinquency rate in 
Retail services increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-
year, largely driven by a continued increase in net flow rates 
(due to certain loans migrating into later-stage delinquency 
buckets), primarily reflecting the ongoing normalization, 
including macroeconomic pressures related to the higher 
inflationary and interest rate environment.

For additional information on cost of credit, loan 

delinquency and other information for Citi’s cards portfolios, 
see each respective business’s results of operations above and 
Note 13.

portfolio, the net credit loss rate is calculated using net credit 
losses for both the delinquency and classifiably managed 
portfolios. For more information on Citi’s total commercial 
real estate exposure, see “Exposure to Commercial Real 
Estate” within the Corporate Credit section.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss and 90+ 

days past due delinquency rates in Global Wealth for the third 
quarter of 2023 were broadly stable quarter-over-quarter and 
year-over-year. The low levels of net credit losses and the 90+ 
days past due delinquency rate continued to reflect the strong 
credit profiles of the Global Wealth portfolios. 

Legacy Franchises

Asia Consumer

Asia Consumer provides credit cards, consumer 
mortgages and small business and personal loans. Asia 
Consumer also includes loans and leases in certain EMEA 
countries for all periods presented. As discussed above, as of 
the third quarter of 2023, Asia Consumer includes only the 
loan balances of the remaining consumer banking portfolios 
held-for-investment (China, Korea, Russia and Poland).

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 

Asia Consumer for the third quarter of 2023 decreased 
quarter-over-quarter, driven by higher recoveries, and 
increased year-over-year, primarily driven by lower average 
loans due to the ongoing wind-downs of the remaining 
consumer businesses, particularly Korea, and the 
reclassification of the portfolio to HFS in the first quarter of 
2023 (subsequently sold in the second quarter of 2023).

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate was broadly 
stable quarter-over-quarter and increased year-over-year. The 
year-over-year increase was mainly driven by lower loans due 
to the ongoing wind-downs.

Retail Banking

U.S. Personal Banking’s Retail banking portfolio consists 
primarily of consumer mortgages (including home equity) and 
unsecured lending products, such as small business loans and 
personal loans. The portfolio is generally delinquency 
managed, where Citi evaluates credit risk based on FICO 
scores, delinquencies and the value of underlying collateral. 
The consumer mortgages in this portfolio have historically 
been extended to high credit quality customers, generally with 
loan-to-value ratios that are less than or equal to 80% on first 
and second mortgages. For additional information, see “Loan-
to-Value (LTV) Ratios” in Note 13.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 
Retail banking for the third quarter of 2023 was unchanged 
quarter-over-quarter, and increased year-over-year, primarily 
driven by growth and seasoning of the personal loans 
portfolio. 

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate was broadly 
stable quarter-over-quarter, and decreased year-over-year, 
primarily driven by lower delinquencies in U.S. mortgages. 

Global Wealth

As discussed above, the Global Wealth credit portfolios 

primarily consist of consumer mortgages, cards and other 
lending products extended to customer segments that range 
from the affluent to ultra-high-net-worth through the Private 
bank, Wealth at Work and Citigold. These customer segments 
represent a target market that is characterized by historically 
low default rates and delinquencies. 

As of September 30, 2023, approximately $47 billion, or 
31%, of the portfolio was classifiably managed and primarily 
consisted of margin lending, commercial real estate, 
subscription credit finance and other lending programs. These 
classifiably managed loans are primarily evaluated for credit 
risk based on their internal risk rating, of which 95% is rated 
investment grade. While the delinquency rate in the chart 
above is calculated only for the delinquency-managed 

46

Mexico Consumer

Mexico Consumer operates in Mexico through 

Citibanamex and provides cards, consumer mortgages and 
small business and personal loans. Mexico Consumer serves a 
more mass-market segment in Mexico and focuses on 
developing multiproduct relationships with customers.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 

Mexico Consumer for the third quarter of 2023 increased 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily driven by 
the ongoing normalization of loss rates after peak losses 
experienced during the pandemic.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased 

quarter-over-quarter, driven by the sale of delinquent loans of 
a portfolio segment, and increased year-over-year, driven by 
the ongoing normalization of delinquency rates after peak 
delinquencies experienced during the pandemic.

For additional information on cost of credit, loan 
delinquency and other information for Citi’s consumer loan 
portfolios, see each respective business’s results of operations 
above and Note 13.

The FICO distribution continued to reflect strong underlying 
credit quality and benefits from the continued impacts of prior 
government stimulus, unemployment benefits and customer 
relief programs. See Note 13 for additional information on

(1) End-of-period (EOP) loans include interest and fees on credit cards.
(2) The ratios of 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due are calculated based on EOP loans, net of unearned income.
(3) The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios for Retail banking exclude loans guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies since the 

potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) 
were $61 million ($0.5 billion), $73 million ($0.5 billion) and $96 million ($0.6 billion) at September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, 
respectively. The amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP 
loans) were $70 million, $68 million and $67 million at September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. The EOP loans in the table 
include the guaranteed loans.

(4) The 90+ days past due balances for Branded cards and Retail services are generally still accruing interest. Citi’s policy is generally to accrue interest on credit card 

loans until 180 days past due, unless notification of bankruptcy filing has been received earlier.

(5) Excludes EOP classifiably managed Private bank loans. These loans are not included in the delinquency numerator, denominator and ratios. 
(6) These loans are evaluated for non-accrual status and write-off primarily based on their internal risk classification and not solely on their delinquency status, and 

therefore delinquency metrics are excluded from this table. As of September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, 95%, 97% and 95% of Global 
Wealth classifiably managed loans were rated investment grade. For additional information on the credit quality of the Global Wealth portfolio, including 
classifiably managed portfolios, see “Consumer Credit Trends” above.

(7) Asia Consumer includes delinquencies and loans in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.

(8) Citi has entered into agreements to sell certain Asia Consumer banking businesses. Accordingly, the loans of these businesses have been reclassified as HFS in 

Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and hence the loans and related delinquencies and ratios are not included in this table. The reclassifications 
commenced as follows: Bahrain, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam in 1Q22 (Bahrain, Malaysia and Thailand closed in 4Q22; India and 
Vietnam closed in 1Q23 and Taiwan closed in 3Q23). In addition, a portfolio was reclassified to HFS in the first quarter of 2023 and subsequently sold in the 
second quarter of 2023. See Note 2 for additional information.

(9) The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are primarily related to U.S. mortgages guaranteed by U.S. 
government-sponsored agencies since the potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the U.S. agencies. The amounts excluded for 90+ days past due and 
(EOP loans) were $67 million ($0.2 billion), $77 million ($0.2 billion) and $95 million ($0.3 billion) at September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 
2022, respectively. The amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due 
EOP loans) were $36 million, $31 million and $31 million at September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. The EOP loans in the table 
include the guaranteed loans.

(1) North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Mexico is included in offices outside North America. The classification of corporate loans between 

offices in North America and outside North America is based on the domicile of the booking unit. The difference between the domicile of the booking unit and the 
domicile of the managing unit is not material.

(2) Loans secured primarily by real estate.
(3) Consumer loans are net of unearned income of $789 million, $769 million, $748 million, $712 million and $671 million at September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023, 
March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively. Unearned income on consumer loans primarily represents unamortized origination 
fees and costs, premiums and discounts.

(4) Corporate loans include Mexico SBMM loans and are net of unearned income of $(806) million, $(795) million, $(801) million, $(797) million and $(750) million 
at September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively. Unearned income on corporate loans primarily 
represents interest received in advance, but not yet earned, on loans originated on a discounted basis. 

(5) Because loans carried at fair value do not have an ACLL, they are excluded from the ACLL ratio calculation.

(1) On January 1, 2023, Citi adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-02, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): TDRs and Vintage 

Disclosures. The ASU eliminated the accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure the ACLL for TDRs using a 
discounted cash flow (DCF) approach. On January 1, 2023, Citi recorded a $352 million decrease in the Allowance for loan losses, along with a $290 million

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets 
For additional information on Citi’s non-accrual loans and 
assets, see “Non-Accrual Loans and Assets” in Citi’s 2022 
Form 10-K.

Non-Accrual Loans
The table below summarizes Citigroup’s non-accrual loans as 
of the periods indicated. Non-accrual loans may still be current 
on interest payments. In situations where Citi reasonably 
expects that only a portion of the principal owed will 
ultimately be collected, all payments received are reflected as 
a reduction of principal and not as interest income. For all 
other non-accrual loans, cash interest receipts are generally 
recorded as revenue.

Citi’s non-accrual loans increased $695 million, or 27%, 

from June 30, 2023, primarily driven by the downgrade of two 
corporate loans in North America and EMEA.

(1) Corporate loans are placed on non-accrual status based upon a review by Citigroup’s risk officers. Corporate non-accrual loans may still be current on interest 

payments. With limited exceptions, the following practices are applied for consumer loans: consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are placed on 
non-accrual status at 90 days past due and are charged off at 120 days past due; residential mortgage loans are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and 
written down to net realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent with industry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest on credit card loans until such 
loans are charged off, which typically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency. As such, the non-accrual loan disclosures do not include credit card loans. The 
balances above represent non-accrual loans within Corporate loans and Consumer loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

(2) Approximately 62%, 51%, 61%, 50% and 68% of Citi’s corporate non-accrual loans were performing at September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023, 

December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively.

(3) The September 30, 2023 total corporate non-accrual loans represented 0.68% of total corporate loans.
(4)  Asia Consumer includes balances in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.

Modified Loans
On January 1, 2023, Citi adopted ASU 2022-02, which 
eliminated the accounting and disclosure requirements for 
TDRs (see Note 1 for additional information). See Note 13 for 
information on loan modifications during the nine months 
ended September 30, 2023.

Note: The amounts shown in the table above are presented on an average basis. For securities, the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be 
realized and, therefore, exclude any securities that are encumbered and incorporate any haircuts applicable under the U.S. LCR rule. The table above incorporates 
various restrictions that could limit the transferability of liquidity between legal entities, including Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.
(1)  Foreign government debt includes securities issued or guaranteed by foreign sovereigns, agencies and multilateral development banks. Foreign government debt 

securities are held largely to support local liquidity requirements and Citi’s local franchises and principally include government bonds from Japan, Korea, Mexico, 
India and Hong Kong. 

The table above includes average amounts of HQLA held 
at Citigroup’s operating entities that are eligible for inclusion 
in the calculation of Citigroup’s consolidated Liquidity 
Coverage ratio (LCR), pursuant to the U.S. LCR rules. These 
amounts include the HQLA needed to meet the minimum 
requirements at these entities as well as any amounts in excess 
of these minimums that are available to be transferred to other 
entities within Citigroup. The decrease in Citi’s average 
HQLA from the second quarter of 2023 was primarily driven 
by the reduction in the Available cash component of average 
HQLA, due to a reduction in deposits. 

As of September 30, 2023, Citigroup had approximately 
$937 billion of available liquidity resources to support client 
and business needs, including end-of-period HQLA ($558 
billion); additional unencumbered HQLA, including excess 
liquidity held at bank entities that is non-transferable to other 
entities within Citigroup ($203 billion); and unused borrowing 
capacity from available assets not already accounted for within 
Citi’s HQLA to support additional advances from the Federal 
Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and the Federal Reserve Bank 
discount window ($176 billion).

Short-Term Liquidity Measurement: Liquidity Coverage 
Ratio (LCR)
In addition to internal 30-day liquidity stress testing performed 
for Citi’s major entities, operating subsidiaries and countries, 
Citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the LCR. The 
table below details the components of Citi’s LCR calculation 
and HQLA in excess of net outflows for the periods indicated:

Note: The amounts are presented on an average basis.

As of September 30, 2023, Citigroup’s average LCR 
decreased 2% from the quarter ended June 30, 2023, primarily 
driven by the reduction in the Available cash component of 
average HQLA, due to a reduction in deposits. 

In addition, considering Citi’s total available liquidity 

resources at quarter end of $937 billion, Citi maintained 
approximately $452 billion of excess liquidity above the 
stressed average net outflow of approximately $485 billion, 
shown in the LCR table above.

Long-Term Liquidity Measurement: Net Stable Funding 
Ratio (NSFR)
As previously disclosed, the U.S. banking agencies adopted a 
rule to assess the availability of a bank’s stable funding against 
a required level. 

The rule became effective July 1, 2021, with public 
disclosure of the NSFR required on a semiannual basis 
beginning June 30, 2023. Citi made the required disclosure 
and was in compliance with the rule as of September 30, 2023.

Select Balance Sheet Items
This section provides details of select liquidity-related assets 
and liabilities reported on Citigroup’s Consolidated Balance 
Sheet on an average and end-of-period basis.

Cash and Investments
The table below details average and end-of-period Cash and 
due from banks, Deposits with banks (collectively cash) and 
Investment securities. Citi’s investment portfolio consists 
largely of highly liquid U.S. Treasury, U.S. agency and other 
sovereign bonds, with an aggregate duration of less than three 
years. At September 30, 2023, Citi’s EOP cash and Investment 
securities comprised approximately 32% of Citigroup’s total 
assets:

Citi’s deposit base is spread across a diversified set of 

countries, industries, clients and currencies. 

On an average basis, deposits were largely unchanged 
year-over-year, as a modest increase in Legacy Franchises 
was offset by a decline in PBWM, and declined 2% 
sequentially. The increase in Legacy Franchises average 
deposits year-over-year was primarily driven by the impact of 
FX translation in Mexico Consumer/SBMM. PBWM average 
deposits decreased 2% year-over-year, largely reflecting 
clients putting cash to work in investments on Citi’s platform. 
ICG and Corporate/Other average deposits were largely 
unchanged year-over-year. The quarter-over-quarter decrease 
in average deposits was largely driven by Services, reflecting 
the impact of monetary tightening. 

End-of-period deposits decreased 3% year-over-year, 
largely due to a reduction in Services, reflecting monetary 
tightening, a shift of deposits to higher-yielding investments in 
Global Wealth and a reduction of institutional certificates of 
deposit in Corporate/Other. End-of-period deposits decreased 
4% sequentially, driven by ICG, PBWM and Legacy 
Franchises, partially offset by Corporate/Other. 

The majority of Citi’s $1.3 trillion of end-of-period 
deposits are institutional (approximately $782 billion), and 
span approximately 90 countries. A large majority of these 
institutional deposits are within TTS, and of these, 
approximately 80% are from clients that use all three TTS 
integrated services: payments and collections, liquidity 
management and working capital solutions. In addition, nearly 
80% of TTS deposits are from clients that have a greater than 
15-year relationship with Citi. On an average basis, TTS grew 
deposits year-over-year at a faster rate than total Citi. Citi also 
has a strong consumer and wealth deposit base, with $416 
billion of U.S. Personal Banking and Global Wealth end-of-
period deposits, which are diversified across the Private bank, 
Citigold, Retail banking and Wealth at Work. As of August 
2023, approximately 80% of U.S. Citigold deposit balances 
are with clients who have been with Citi for more than 10 
years and approximately 60% of Private bank ultra-high-net-
worth deposit balances are with clients who have been with 
Citi for more than 10 years. U.S. Personal Banking deposits 
are spread across six core urban centers.

Weighted Average Maturity (WAM) 
The following table presents Citigroup and its affiliates’ 
(including Citibank) WAM of unsecured long-term debt 
issued with a remaining life greater than one year:

broker-dealer subsidiaries) that are consolidated into Citigroup. As of 
September 30, 2023, non-bank included $90.6 billion of long-term debt 
issued by Citi’s broker-dealer and other subsidiaries that are 
consolidated into Citigroup. Certain Citigroup consolidated hedging 
activities are also included in this line.

(2) Local country and other includes debt issued by Citi’s affiliates in 
support of their local operations. Within non-bank, certain secured 
financing is also included.

cards receivables.

Citi’s total long-term debt outstanding increased 9% year-
over-year, largely driven by issuance of customer-related debt 
at the non-bank entities, as well as increased senior benchmark 
debt and FHLB borrowings at the bank. The increase was 
partially offset by a decline in senior benchmark debt at the 
non-bank entities, as well as lower securitizations at the bank. 
Sequentially, long-term debt outstanding was largely 
unchanged, reflecting a decline in customer-related debt at the 
non-bank, offset by an increase in senior benchmark debt at 
the bank. 

As part of its liability management, Citi has considered, 

and may continue to consider, opportunities to redeem or 
repurchase its long-term debt pursuant to open market 
purchases, tender offers or other means. Such redemptions and 
repurchases help reduce Citi’s overall funding costs. During 
the third quarter of 2023, Citi redeemed or repurchased an 
aggregate of approximately $5.7 billion of its outstanding 
long-term debt.

of each security. For securities that are redeemable prior to 
maturity where the option is not held by the issuer, the WAM 
is calculated based on the earliest date an option becomes 
exercisable.

Long-Term Debt Outstanding
Citi’s long-term debt outstanding at the Citigroup parent 
company includes benchmark senior and subordinated debt 
and what Citi refers to as customer-related debt, consisting of 
structured notes, such as equity- and credit-linked notes, as 
well as non-structured notes. Citi’s issuance of customer-
related debt is generally driven by customer demand and 
complements benchmark debt issuance as a source of funding 
for Citi’s non-bank entities. Citi’s long-term debt at the bank 
includes bank notes, FHLB advances and securitizations.

Short-Term Borrowings
Citi’s short-term borrowings of $43 billion as of the third 
quarter of 2023 decreased 9% year-over-year and increased 
7% sequentially, driven by higher commercial paper (see Note 
17 for further information on Citigroup’s and its affiliates’ 
outstanding short-term borrowings).

Secured Funding Transactions and Short-Term 
Borrowings
Citi supplements its primary sources of funding with short-
term financings that generally include (i) secured funding 
transactions consisting of securities loaned or sold under 
agreements to repurchase, i.e., repos, and (ii) to a lesser extent, 
short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper and 
borrowings from the FHLB and other market participants. 

Secured Funding Transactions
Secured funding is primarily accessed through Citi’s broker-
dealer subsidiaries, with a smaller portion executed through 
Citi’s bank entities to efficiently fund both (i) secured lending 
activity and (ii) a portion of the securities inventory held in the 
context of market making and customer activities. Secured 
funding transactions are predominantly collateralized by 
government debt securities. Generally, changes in the level of 
Citi’s secured funding are primarily due to fluctuations in 
secured lending activity in the matched book (as described 
below) and changes in securities inventory. In order to 
maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market 
conditions, Citi manages risks related to its secured funding by 
establishing secured funding limits and conducting daily stress 
tests that account for risks related to capacity, tenor, haircut, 
collateral type, counterparty and client actions. 

Secured funding of $257 billion as of September 30, 2023 

increased 27% year-over-year, largely driven by additional 
financing to support increases in trading-related assets within 
Citi’s broker-dealer subsidiaries. As of the quarter ended 
September 30, 2023, on an average basis, secured funding was 
$275 billion. The portion of secured funding in the broker-
dealer subsidiaries that funds secured lending is commonly 
referred to as “matched book” activity and is primarily secured 
by high-quality liquid securities such as U.S. Treasury 
securities, U.S. agency securities and foreign government debt 
securities. Other “matched book” activity is secured by less 
liquid securities, including equity securities, corporate bonds 
and asset-backed securities, the tenor of which is generally 
equal to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding assets. 
As indicated above, the remaining portion of secured funding 
is used to fund securities inventory held in the context of 
market making and customer activities.

Credit Ratings
The table below presents the ratings for Citigroup and 
Citibank as of September 30, 2023. While not included in the 
table below, the long-term and short-term ratings of Citigroup 
Global Markets Holdings Inc. (CGMHI) were A+/F1 at Fitch, 
A2/P-1 at Moody’s Investors Service and A/A-1 at S&P 
Global Ratings as of September 30, 2023.

Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades
Ratings downgrades by Fitch, Moody’s or S&P could 
negatively impact Citigroup’s and/or Citibank’s funding and 
liquidity due to reduced funding capacity, including derivative 
triggers, which could take the form of cash obligations and 
collateral requirements.

For additional information on the impact of credit rating 

changes on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see “Risk 
Factors—Liquidity Risks” and “Credit Ratings” in Citi’s 2022 
Form 10-K.

Citigroup Inc. and Citibank—Potential Derivative Triggers
As of September 30, 2023, Citi estimates that a hypothetical 
one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of 
Citigroup Inc. across all three major rating agencies could 
impact Citigroup’s funding and liquidity due to derivative 
triggers by approximately $0.3 billion, compared to $0.4 
billion as of June 30, 2023. Other funding sources, such as 
secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, 
for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be 
adversely affected.

As of September 30, 2023, Citi estimates that a 
hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-
term rating of Citibank across all three major rating agencies 
could impact Citibank’s funding and liquidity due to 
derivative triggers by approximately $0.4 billion, compared to 
$0.4 billion as of June 30, 2023. Other funding sources, such 
as secured funding transactions and other margin 
requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could 
also be adversely impacted.

In total, as of September 30, 2023, Citi estimates that a 

one-notch downgrade of Citigroup and Citibank across all 
three major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate 
cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately 
$0.7 billion, compared to $0.8 billion as of June 30, 2023 (see 
also Note 19). As detailed under “High-Quality Liquid Assets” 
above, Citigroup has various liquidity resources available to 
its bank and non-bank entities in part as a contingency for the 
potential events described above.

Citibank—Additional Potential Impacts
In addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a 
potential downgrade of Citibank’s senior debt/long-term rating 
across any of the three major rating agencies could also have 
an adverse impact on the commercial paper/short-term rating 
of Citibank. Citibank has provided liquidity commitments to 
consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits, 
primarily in the form of asset purchase agreements. As of 
September 30, 2023, Citibank had liquidity commitments of 
approximately $11.0 billion to consolidated asset-backed 
commercial paper conduits, which was largely unchanged 
from June 30, 2023 (see Note 20 for additional information).

In addition to the above-referenced liquidity resources of 

certain Citibank entities, Citibank could reduce the funding 
and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades 
described above through mitigating actions, including 
repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial 
paper conduits. In the event of the potential downgrades 
described above, Citi believes that certain corporate customers 
could reevaluate their deposit relationships with Citibank. This 
reevaluation could result in clients adjusting their 
discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository 
institution, which could potentially reduce certain deposit 
levels at Citibank. However, Citi could choose to adjust 
pricing, offer alternative deposit products to its existing 
customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers, in 
addition to the mitigating actions referenced above.

MARKET RISK

Market risk arises from both Citi’s trading and non-trading 
portfolios. For additional information on market risk and 
market risk management at Citi, see “Market Risk—
Overview” and “Risk Factors” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

Market Risk of Non-Trading Portfolios
Market risk from non-trading portfolios stems predominantly 
from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and 
foreign exchange rates on Citi’s net interest income and on 
Citi’s Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) 
from its investment securities portfolios. Market risk from 
non-trading portfolios also includes the potential impact of 
changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital invested in 
foreign currencies.

Banking Book Interest Rate Risk 
For interest rate risk purposes, Citi’s non-trading portfolios are 
referred to as the Banking Book. Management of interest rate 
risk in the Banking Book is governed by Citi’s Non-Trading 
Market Risk Policy. Management’s Asset & Liability 
Committee (ALCO) establishes Citi’s risk appetite and related 
limits for interest rate risk in the Banking Book, which are 
subject to approval by Citigroup’s Board of Directors. 
Corporate Treasury is responsible for the day-to-day 
management of Citi’s Banking Book interest rate risk as well 
as periodically reviewing it with the ALCO. Citi’s Banking 
Book interest rate risk management is also subject to 
independent oversight from the second line of defense team 
reporting to the Chief Risk Officer.

Changes in interest rates impact Citi’s net income, AOCI 

and CET1. These changes primarily affect Citi’s Banking 
Book through net interest income, due to a variety of risk 
factors, including:

•

•
•

•

Differences in timing and amounts of the maturity or 
repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet 
instruments;
Changes in the level and/or shape of interest rate curves;
Client behavior in response to changes in interest rates 
(e.g., mortgage prepayments, deposit betas); and
Changes in the maturity of instruments resulting from 
changes in the interest rate environment.

As part of their ongoing activities, Citi’s businesses 
generate interest rate-sensitive positions from their client-
facing products, such as loans and deposits. The component of 
this interest rate risk that can be hedged is transferred via 
Citi’s funds transfer pricing process to Corporate Treasury. 
Corporate Treasury uses various tools to manage the total 
interest rate risk position within the established risk appetite 
and target Citi’s desired risk profile, including its investment 
securities portfolio, company-issued debt and interest rate 
derivatives. 

In addition, Citi uses multiple metrics to measure its 
Banking Book interest rate risk. Interest Rate Exposure (IRE) 
is a key metric that analyzes the impact of a range of scenarios 
on Citi’s Banking Book net interest income and certain other 
interest rate-sensitive income versus a base case. IRE does not 
represent a forecast of Citi’s net interest income.

The scenarios, methodologies and assumptions used in 

this analysis are periodically evaluated and enhanced in 
response to changes in the market environment, changes in 
Citi’s balance sheet composition, enhancements in Citi’s 
modeling and other factors.

Since the third quarter of 2022, Citi has employed 

enhanced IRE methodologies and changes to certain 
assumptions. The changes included, among other things, 
assumptions around the projected balance sheet and revisions 
to the treatment of certain business contributions (notably 
accrual positions in ICG’s Markets businesses). These changes 
resulted in a higher impact to Citi’s net interest income over a 
12-month period.

Under the enhanced methodology, Citi utilizes the most 
recent quarter-end balance sheet, assuming no changes to its 
composition and size over the forecasted horizon (holding the 
balance sheet static). The forecasts incorporate expectations 
and assumptions of deposit pricing, loan spreads and mortgage 
prepayment behavior implied by the interest rate curves in 
each scenario. The base case scenario reflects the market-
implied forward interest rates, and sensitivity scenarios 
assume instantaneous shocks to the base case. The forecasts do 
not assume Citi takes any risk-mitigating actions in response 
to changes in the interest rate environment. Certain interest 
rates are subject to flooring assumptions in downward rate 
scenarios. Deposit pricing sensitivities (i.e., deposit betas), are 
informed by historical and expected behavior. Actual deposit 
pricing could differ from the assumptions used in these 
forecasts.

Citi’s IRE analysis primarily reflects the impacts from the 

following Banking Book assets and liabilities: loans, client 
deposits, Citi’s deposits with other banks, investment 
securities, long-term debt, any related interest rate hedges and 
the funds transfer pricing of positions in total trading and 
credit portfolio value at risk (VAR). It excludes impacts from 
any positions that are included in total trading and credit 
portfolio VAR.

In addition to IRE, Citi analyzes economic value 
sensitivity (EVS) as a longer-term interest rate risk metric. 
EVS is a net present value (NPV)–based measure of the 
lifetime cash flows of Citi’s Banking Book. It estimates the 
interest rate sensitivity of the Banking Book’s economic value 
from longer-term assets being potentially funded with shorter-
term liabilities, or vice versa. Citi manages EVS within risk 
limits approved by Citigroup’s Board of Directors that are 
aligned with Citi’s risk appetite.

62

Interest Rate Risk of Investment Portfolios—Impact on 
AOCI
Citi also measures the potential impacts of changes in interest 
rates on the value of its AOCI, which can in turn impact Citi’s 
common equity and tangible common equity. This will impact 
Citi’s CET1 and other regulatory capital ratios. Citi seeks to 
manage its exposure to changes in the market level of interest 
rates, while limiting the potential impact on its AOCI and 
regulatory capital position.

AOCI at risk is managed as part of the Company-wide 
interest rate risk position. AOCI at risk considers potential 

changes in AOCI (and the corresponding impact on the CET1 
Capital ratio) relative to Citi’s capital generation capacity. 

Citi uses 100 basis point (bps) shocks in each scenario to 

reflect its net interest income sensitivity to unanticipated 
changes in market interest rates, as potential monetary policy 
decisions and changes in economic conditions may be 
reflected in current market-implied forward rates. The 
following table presents the 12-month estimated impact to 
Citi’s net interest income, AOCI and the CET1 Capital ratio, 
each assuming an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 bps 
increase in interest rates:

The All other currencies of $1,214 million as of 
September 30, 2023 in the table above includes the impact 
from the following top five non-U.S. dollar currencies, which 
represents approximately 50% of the total non-U.S. dollar 
currency impact: approximately $0.2 billion from the Japanese 
yen, and approximately $0.1 billion each from the Singapore 
dollar, Swiss franc, Indian rupee and British pound sterling. 
These impacts per currency are generally in the same direction 
(estimated positive impact in the +100 bps shock scenario) and 
not offsetting.

Citi’s balance sheet is asset sensitive (assets reprice faster 

than liabilities), resulting in higher net interest income in 
increasing interest rate scenarios. The estimated impact to 
Citi’s net interest income in a 100 bps upward rate shock 
scenario as of the third quarter of 2023 decreased quarter-
over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily due to changes in 
deposit composition and levels, partially offset by hedging 
actions. At progressively higher interest rate levels, the 
marginal net interest income benefit is lower, as Citi assumes 
it will pass on a larger share of rate changes to depositors (i.e., 
higher betas), further reducing Citi’s IRE sensitivity. 
Currency-specific interest rate changes and balance sheet 
factors may drive quarter-to-quarter volatility in Citi’s 
estimated IRE.

In a 100 bps upward rate shock scenario, Citi expects that 

the approximate $0.8 billion initial negative impact to AOCI 
could potentially be offset in shareholders’ equity through the 
expected recovery of the impact on AOCI through accretion of 
Citi’s investment portfolio and expected net interest income 
benefit over a period of approximately four months.

Scenario Analysis
The following table presents the estimated impact to Citi’s net 
interest income, AOCI and CET1 Capital ratio (on a fully 
implemented basis) under six different scenarios of changes in 
interest rates for the U.S. dollar and all other currencies in 
which Citi has invested capital as of September 30, 2023. The 
interest rate scenarios are also impacted by convexity related 
to mortgage products.

Note: Each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur instantaneously. Changes in interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and the 10-year rate are 
interpolated. The interest rate exposure in the table above assumes no change in deposit size or mix from the baseline forecast included in the different interest scenarios 
presented. As a result, in higher interest rate scenarios, customer activity resulting in a shift from non-interest-bearing and low interest rate deposit products to higher-
yielding deposits would reduce the expected benefit to net interest income. Conversely, in lower interest rate scenarios, customer activity resulting in a shift from 
higher-yielding deposits to non-interest-bearing and low interest rate deposit products would reduce the expected decrease to net interest income.
(1) Scenario 1 includes the impact from the following top five non-U.S. dollar currencies, which represents approximately 50% of the total non-U.S. dollar currency 

impact: approximately $0.2 billion from the Japanese yen, and approximately $0.1 billion each from the Singapore dollar, Swiss franc, Indian rupee and British 
pound sterling. These impacts per currency are generally in the same direction (estimated positive impact in the +100 bps shock scenario) and not offsetting.

(2)

As shown in the table above, the estimated impact to 
Citi’s net interest income is larger under Scenario 2 than 
Scenario 3, as Citi’s Banking Book has relatively higher 
interest rate exposure to the short end of the yield curve. For 
non-U.S. dollar currencies, exposure to downward rate shocks 
is smaller in magnitude as a result of Citi’s flooring 
assumption, given low rate levels for certain non-U.S. dollar 
currencies.

The magnitude of the impact to AOCI is greater under 

Scenario 2 compared to Scenario 3. This is because the 
combination of changes to Citi’s investment portfolio, 
partially offset by changes related to Citi’s pension liabilities, 
results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at 
shorter- and intermediate-term maturities.

Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates—Impacts on AOCI 
and Capital
As of September 30, 2023, Citi estimates that an unanticipated 
parallel instantaneous 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar 
against all of the other currencies in which Citi has invested 
capital could reduce Citi’s tangible common equity (TCE) by 
approximately $1.7 billion, or 0.96%, as a result of changes to 
Citi’s CTA in AOCI, net of hedges. This impact would be 
primarily due to changes in the value of the Mexican peso, 
Euro and Indian rupee.

This impact is also before any mitigating actions Citi may 

take, including ongoing management of its foreign currency 
translation exposure. Specifically, as currency movements 
change the value of Citi’s net investments in foreign currency-
denominated capital, these movements also change the value 
of Citi’s risk-weighted assets denominated in those currencies.

Change in FX spot rate(1)
Change in TCE due to FX translation, net of hedges

As a percentage of TCE

Estimated impact to CET1 Capital ratio (on a fully implemented basis) 
due to changes in FX translation, net of hedges (bps)

This, coupled with Citi’s foreign currency hedging strategies, 
such as foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency 
forwards and other currency hedging instruments, lessens the 
impact of foreign currency movements on Citi’s CET1 Capital 
ratio. Changes in these hedging strategies, as well as hedging 
costs, divestitures and tax impacts, can further affect the actual 
impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital 
compared to an unanticipated parallel shock, as described 
above.

The effect of Citi’s ongoing management strategies with 

respect to quarterly changes in foreign exchange rates, and the 
quarterly impact of these changes on Citi’s TCE and CET1 
Capital ratio, are shown in the table below. See Note 18 for 
additional information on the changes in AOCI.

Interest revenue and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments primarily related to the tax-exempt bond portfolio and certain tax-advantaged 
loan programs of $23 million, $13 million and $46 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. 
Interest expense associated with certain hybrid financial instruments, which are classified as Long-term debt and accounted for at fair value, is reported together 
with any changes in fair value as part of Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income and is therefore not reflected in Interest expense in the 
table above.

(3) The average rate on interest revenue and net interest margin reflects the taxable equivalent gross-up adjustment. See footnote 1 above.
(4) Citi’s NIM is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets.

Interest revenue and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments discussed in the table above.

Citi’s net interest income in the third quarter of 2023 
increased 10% to $13.8 billion versus the prior-year period. As 
presented in the table above, Citi’s net interest income on a 
taxable equivalent basis also increased 10% year-over-year, or 
$1.2 billion. The increase was driven by higher net interest 
income in non-ICG Markets, which increased 8%, and ICG 
Markets, which increased 28%. The increase in net interest 
income in non-ICG Markets primarily reflected higher interest 
rates and growth in U.S. cards interest-earning balances, 
partially offset by a reduction in net interest income due to the 
exited markets and continued wind-downs in Legacy 
Franchises. The increase in ICG Markets net interest income 
was primarily driven by higher interest rates as well as a 
change in the mix of trading positions in support of client 
activity.

Citi’s net interest margin was 2.49% on a taxable 
equivalent basis in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 1 
basis point from the prior quarter, primarily driven by 
beneficial balance sheet mix changes and higher interest rates, 
largely offset by the absence of the benefit of dividend 
seasonality in ICG Markets in the prior quarter.

the impact of ASC 210-20-45.

(6) The fair value carrying amounts of derivative contracts are reported net, pursuant to ASC 815-10-45, in Non-interest-earning assets and Other non-interest-

(7)

bearing liabilities.
Interest expense on Trading account liabilities of ICG is reported as a reduction of Interest revenue. Interest revenue and Interest expense on cash collateral 
positions are reported in interest on Trading account assets and Trading account liabilities, respectively.

Market Risk of Trading Portfolios

Value at Risk (VAR)
Citi believes its VAR model is conservatively calibrated to incorporate fat-tail scaling and the greater of short-term (approximately the 
most recent month) and long-term (18 months for commodities and three years for others) market volatility. As of September 30, 
2023, Citi estimates that the conservative features of the VAR calibration contribute an approximate 32% add-on to what would be a 
VAR estimated under the assumption of stable and perfectly, normally distributed markets. As of June 30, 2023, the add-on was 48%.
As presented in the table below, Citi’s average trading VAR for the third quarter of 2023 decreased 13% quarter-over-quarter, 

primarily from inventory changes in ICG Markets businesses and updates to reflect changes in volatilities.

(1)  Covariance adjustment (also known as diversification benefit) equals the difference between the total VAR and the sum of the VARs tied to each risk type. The 
benefit reflects the fact that the risks within individual and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VAR on a given day will be 
lower than the sum of the VARs relating to each risk type. The determination of the primary drivers of changes to the covariance adjustment is made by an 
examination of the impact of both model parameter and position changes.

(2)  The total trading VAR includes mark-to-market and certain fair value option trading positions in ICG, with the exception of hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value 

option loans and all CVA exposures. Available-for-sale and accrual exposures are not included.

(3)  The specific risk-only component represents the level of equity and fixed income issuer-specific risk embedded in VAR. 
(4)  The credit portfolio is composed of mark-to-market positions associated with non-trading business units, with the CVA relating to derivative counterparties and all 

associated CVA hedges. FVA and DVA are not included. The credit portfolio also includes hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value option loans and hedges to the 
leveraged finance pipeline within capital markets origination in ICG.

Regulatory VAR Back-testing
In accordance with Basel III, Citi is required to perform back-
testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR 
model. Regulatory VAR back-testing is the process in which 
the daily one-day VAR, at a 99% confidence interval, is 
compared to the buy-and-hold profit and loss (i.e., the profit 
and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of 
the day and re-priced the following day). Buy-and-hold profit 
and loss represents the daily mark-to-market profit and loss 
attributable to price movements in covered positions from the 
close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and 
loss excludes realized trading revenue, net interest, fees and 
commissions, intra-day trading profit and loss and changes in 
reserves.

Based on a 99% confidence level, Citi would expect two 

to three days in any one year where buy-and-hold losses 
exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the conservative 
calibration of Citi’s VAR model (as a result of taking the 
greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-tail scaling 
of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer exceptions under 
normal and stable market conditions. Periods of unstable 
market conditions could increase the number of back-testing 
exceptions.

As of September 30, 2023, there were two back-testing 

exceptions observed for Citi’s Regulatory VAR in the last 12 
months.

Country Risk

Top 25 Country Exposures
The following table presents Citi’s top 25 exposures by 
country (excluding the U.S.) as of September 30, 2023. 
(Including the U.S., Citi’s top 25 exposures by country would 
represent approximately 98% of Citi’s exposure to all 
countries as of September 30, 2023.)

For purposes of the table, loan amounts are reflected in 
the country where the loan is booked, which is generally based 
on the domicile of the borrower. For example, a loan to a 
Chinese subsidiary of a Switzerland-based corporation will 
generally be categorized as a loan in China. In addition, Citi 
has developed regional booking centers in certain countries, 

most significantly in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland, 
in order to more efficiently serve its corporate customers. As 
an example, with respect to the U.K., only 39% of corporate 
loans presented in the table below are to U.K. domiciled 
entities (39% for unfunded commitments), with the balance of 
the loans predominately to European domiciled counterparties. 
Approximately 89% of the total U.K. funded loans and 90% of 
the total U.K. unfunded commitments were investment grade 
as of September 30, 2023. 

Trading account assets and investment securities are 
generally categorized based on the domicile of the issuer of 
the security of the underlying reference entity. For additional 
information on the assets included in the table, see the 
footnotes to the table below.

Russia 

Introduction
In Russia, Citi’s remaining operations are conducted through 
both ICG and Legacy Franchises. 

As part of previously disclosed plans, Citi has ended 
nearly all of the institutional banking services it offered in 
Russia, with the remaining services only those necessary to 
fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations. In 
addition, Citi has significantly reduced its Legacy Franchises 
loan portfolio in Russia since September 2022, largely due to 
loan portfolio sales and its entry into a credit card referral 
agreement with a Russian bank. Citi has ceased soliciting any 
new business or new clients in Russia. Citi will continue to 
manage its existing legal and regulatory commitments and 
obligations, as well as support its employees, during this 
period. For additional information, see “Citi’s Wind-Down of 
Its Russia Operations” below.

Citi continues to monitor the war in Ukraine, related 
sanctions and economic conditions and continues to mitigate 
its Russia exposures and risks as appropriate. 

For additional information about Citi’s risks related to its 
Russia exposures, see “Forward-Looking Statements” below 
and “Risk Factors—Market-Related Risk,” “—Operational 
Risks” and “—Other Risks” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

(1) 
(2)  Reverse repurchase agreements are shown gross of collateral and are included in net MTM on derivatives/repos in the table above, as netting of collateral for 

Russia-related reverse repurchase agreements was removed in the second quarter of 2022. This removal was due to the inability to conclude, with a well-founded 
basis, the enforceability of contractual rights in the Russian legal system in the event of a counterparty default, given the geopolitical uncertainty caused by the 
war in Ukraine.

(3)  Unfunded exposure consists of unfunded corporate lending commitments, letters of credit and other contingencies. 
(4)  Cash on deposit and placements are primarily with the Central Bank of Russia and foreign financial institutions.
(5)  Represents dividends received by Citi in its role as custodian for investor clients in Russia, which Citi is required by local regulation to hold at the Deposit 

Insurance Agency. Citi is unable to remit these funds to clients due to restrictions imposed by the Russian government.

(6)  The majority of AO Citibank’s third-party exposures was funded with the dividends under footnote 5 and domestic deposit liabilities from both corporate and 

personal banking clients.

(7)  Citigroup’s CTA loss included in its AOCI related to its indirect subsidiary, AO Citibank, is excluded from the above table, because the CTA loss is not held in 

AO Citibank and would be recognized in Citigroup’s earnings only upon either the substantial liquidation or a loss of control of AO Citibank. Citi has separately 
described these risks in “Deconsolidation Risk” below.

75

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During the third quarter of 2023, Citi’s Russia-related 
exposures decreased by $0.7 billion, as shown in the table 
above. The decrease in exposure was driven by a $0.7 billion 
depreciation of the ruble against the U.S. dollar. During the 
period, inflows from dividends received from Russian 
corporations on behalf of Citi’s clients were fully offset by 
deposit outflows and tax payments to local authorities. 
Approximately 68% of Citi’s remaining exposures in Russia 
are trapped dividends that Citi cannot remit to its clients due to 
restrictions imposed by the Russian government, of which 
$3.5 billion is held with the Deposit Insurance Agency as of 
September 30, 2023.

Citi’s net investment in Russia was approximately $1.0 

billion as of September 30, 2023 (down slightly from $1.1 
billion as of June 30, 2023). Citi hedges its ruble/USD spot FX 
exposure in AOCI through the purchase of FX derivatives. The 
ongoing mark-to-market of the hedging derivatives is also 
reported in AOCI. When the ruble depreciates against the 
USD, the USD equivalent value of Citigroup’s investment in 
AO Citibank also declines. This change in value is offset by 
the change in value of the hedging instrument (FX derivative). 
Going forward, Citi may record devaluations on its net ruble-
denominated assets in earnings, without the benefit from a 
change in the fair value of derivative positions used to 
economically hedge the exposures. 

Earnings and Other Impacts on Citi’s Businesses
Citi’s ICG, PBWM and Legacy Franchises segments and 
Corporate/Other have been impacted by various 
macroeconomic factors and volatilities, including Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine and its direct and indirect impact on the 
European and global economies. For a broader discussion of 
these factors and volatilities on Citi’s businesses, see 
“Executive Summary” and each business’s results of 
operations above. 

As of September 30, 2023, Citigroup’s ACL included a 
$0.1 billion remaining credit reserve for Citi’s direct Russian 
counterparties (compared to $0.2 billion at June 30, 2023).

Citi’s Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations
In August 2022, Citi disclosed its decision to wind down its 
Russia consumer, local commercial and institutional banking 
businesses, including actively pursuing portfolio sales. In 
connection with this wind-down, Citi has incurred 
approximately $55 million to-date in charges, largely from 
restructuring, vendor termination fees and other related 
charges. Citi expects to incur an additional approximate 
$85 million in estimated charges (approximately $10 million 
in ICG and $65 million in Legacy Franchises, and $10 million 
in Corporate/Other excluding the impact from any portfolio 
sales). This estimate was revised down during the third quarter 
from $180 million at June 30, 2023. During the third quarter, 
as part of the previously disclosed cards referral agreement 
with a Russian bank, approximately $26 million of credit card 
receivables was settled upon referral and refinanced. For 
additional information about Citi’s continued efforts to reduce 
its operations and exposure in Russia, see Note 2 and “Risk 
Factors” and “Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—Country 
Risk—Russia” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

Deconsolidation Risk
Citi’s remaining operations in Russia subject it to various 
risks, including, among others, foreign currency volatility, 
including appreciation or devaluation; restrictions arising from 
retaliatory Russian laws and regulations on the conduct of its 
business; sanctions or asset freezes; or other deconsolidation 
events (for additional information, see “Risk Factors—Other 
Risks” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K). Examples of triggers that 
may result in deconsolidation of AO Citibank include 
voluntary or forced sale of ownership or loss of control due to 
actions of relevant governmental authorities, including 
expropriation (i.e., the entity becomes subject to the complete 
control of a government, court, administrator, trustee or 
regulator); revocation of banking license; and loss of ability to 
elect a board of directors or appoint members of senior 
management. As of September 30, 2023, Citi continued to 
consolidate AO Citibank because none of the deconsolidation 
factors were triggered.

In the event Citi deems there is a loss of control, for 
example, through expropriation of AO Citibank Russia, Citi’s 
foreign entity in Russia, Citi would be required to (i) write off 
the net investment of approximately $1.0 billion (down 
slightly from $1.1 billion as of June 30, 2023), (ii) recognize a 
CTA loss of approximately $1.6 billion (compared to $1.6 
billion as of June 30, 2023) through earnings and (iii) 
recognize a loss of $0.6 billion (compared to $0.4 billion as of 
June 30, 2023) on intercompany liabilities owed by AO 
Citibank to other Citi entities outside Russia. In the sole event 
of a substantial liquidation, as opposed to a loss of control, 
Citi would be required to recognize the CTA loss of 
approximately $1.6 billion through earnings and would 
evaluate its remaining net investment as circumstances evolve.

Citi as Paying Agent for Russia-related Clients
Citi serves or served as paying agent on bonds issued by 
various entities in Russia, including Russian corporate clients. 
Citi’s role as paying agent is administrative. In this role, Citi 
acts as an agent of its client, the bond issuer, receiving interest 
and principal payments from the bond issuer and then making 
payments to international central securities depositories (e.g., 
Depository Trust Company, Euroclear, Clearstream). The 
international central securities depositories (ICSDs) make 
payments to those participants or account holders (e.g., broker/
dealers) that have clients who are investors in the applicable 
bonds (i.e., bondholders). As a paying agent, Citi generally 
does not have information about the identity of the 
bondholders. Citi may be exposed to risks due to its 
responsibilities for receiving and processing payments on 
behalf of its clients as a result of sanctions or other 
governmental requirements and prohibitions. To mitigate 
operational and sanctions risks, Citi has established policies, 
procedures and controls for client relationships and payment 
processing to help ensure compliance with U.S., U.K., EU and 
other jurisdictions’ sanctions laws.

These processes may require Citi to delay or withhold the 

processing of payments as a result of sanctions on the bond 
issuer. Citi is also prevented from making payments to 
accounts on behalf of bondholders should the ICSDs disclose 
to Citi the presence of sanctioned bondholders. In both 
instances, Citi is generally required to segregate, restrict or 

76

Board’s Role in Overseeing Related Risks
The Citi Board of Directors (Board) and the Board’s Risk 
Management Committee (RMC) and its other Committees 
have received and continue to receive regular reports from 
senior management regarding the war in Ukraine and its 
impact on Citi’s operations in Russia, Ukraine and elsewhere, 
as well as the war’s broader geopolitical, macroeconomic and 
reputational impacts. In addition to receiving regular briefings 
from management, the full Board has routinely been invited to 
attend portions of the RMC meetings for discussions related to 
the war in Ukraine, including with respect to Citi’s risk 
exposures and stress testing. The reports to the Board and its 
Committees from senior management who represent the 
impacted businesses and the EMEA region, Independent Risk 
Management, Finance, Independent Compliance Risk 
Management, including those individuals responsible for 
sanctions compliance, and Human Resources, have included 
detailed information regarding financial impacts, impacts on 
capital, cybersecurity, strategic considerations, sanctions 
compliance, employee assistance and reputational risks, 
enabling the Board and its Committees to properly exercise 
their oversight responsibilities. In addition, senior 
management has also provided updates to Citi’s Executive 
Management Team and the Board, outside of formal meetings, 
regarding Citi’s Russia-related risks, including with respect to 
cybersecurity matters.

Ukraine
Citi has continued to operate in Ukraine throughout the war 
through its ICG businesses, serving the local subsidiaries of 
multinationals, along with local financial institutions and the 
public sector. Citi employs approximately 230 people in 
Ukraine and their safety is Citi’s top priority. All of Citi’s 
domestic operations in Ukraine are conducted through a 
subsidiary of Citibank, which uses the Ukrainian hryvnia as its 
functional currency. Citi’s exposures in Ukraine are not 
significant enough to be included in the “Top 25 Country 
Exposures” table above. As of September 30, 2023, Citi had 
$1.5 billion of direct exposures related to Ukraine, compared 
to $1.3 billion as of June 30, 2023. The increase in exposures 
reflected a $0.2 billion increase in deposits.

block the funds until applicable sanctions are lifted or the 
payment is otherwise authorized under applicable law.

Reputational Risks
Citi has continued its efforts to enhance and protect its 
reputation with its colleagues, clients, customers, investors, 
regulators and the public. Citi’s response to the war in 
Ukraine, including any action or inaction, may have a negative 
impact on Citi’s reputation with some or all of these parties.
For example, Citi is exposed to reputational risk as a 
result of its current presence in Russia and association with 
Russian individuals or entities, whether subject to sanctions or 
not, including Citi’s inability to support its global clients in 
Russia, which could adversely affect its broader client 
relationships and businesses; current involvement in 
transactions or supporting activities involving Russian assets 
or interests; failure to correctly interpret and apply laws and 
regulations, including those related to sanctions; perceived 
misalignment of Citi’s actions to its stated strategy in Russia; 
and the reputational impact from Citi’s activity and 
engagement with Ukraine or with non-Russian clients exiting 
their Russia businesses. Citi has considered the potential for 
reputation risk and taken actions to mitigate such risks. Citi 
established a Russia Special Review Process with 
management’s Reputation Risk Committee with oversight for 
significant Russia-related reputation risks and completed a 
number of reputation risk reviews of matters with a Russian 
nexus.

While Citi announced its intention to wind down its 
businesses in Russia, Citi will continue to manage those 
operations during the wind-down process and will be required 
to maintain certain limited operations to fulfill its remaining 
legal and regulatory obligations. Also, sanctions and sanctions 
compliance are highly complex and may change over time and 
result in increased operational risk. Failure to fully comply 
with relevant sanctions or the application of sanctions where 
they should not be applied may negatively impact Citi’s 
reputation. In addition, Citi currently performs services for, 
conducts business with or deals in non-sanctioned Russian-
owned businesses and Russian assets. This has attracted, and 
will likely continue to attract, negative attention, despite the 
previously disclosed plan to wind down nearly all its activities 
in the country, cessation of new business and client 
originations, and reduction of other exposures.

Citi’s continued presence or divestiture of businesses in 

Russia could also increase its susceptibility to cyberattacks 
that could negatively impact its relationships with clients and 
customers, harm its reputation, increase its compliance costs 
and adversely affect its business operations and results of 
operations. For additional information on operational and 
cyber risks, see “Risk Factors—Operational Risk” in Citi’s 
2022 Form 10-K.
