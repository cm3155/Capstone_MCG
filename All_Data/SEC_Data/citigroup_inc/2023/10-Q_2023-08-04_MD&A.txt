Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
Citi prepares its financial statements in accordance with U.S. 
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and also 
presents certain non-GAAP financial measures (non-GAAP 
measures) that exclude certain items or otherwise include 
components that differ from the most directly comparable 
measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-
GAAP measures are provided as additional useful information 
to assess Citi’s financial condition and results of operations, 
including providing an additional meaningful depiction of 
underlying fundamentals of period-to-period operating results. 
These non-GAAP measures are not intended as a substitute for 
GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or 
calculated the same way as non-GAAP measures with similar 
names used by other companies.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Second Quarter of 2023—Results Continued to Benefit 
from Diversified Business Model and Strong Balance Sheet
As described further throughout this Executive Summary, 
during the second quarter of 2023:

•

•

•

•

•

•

Citi’s revenues decreased 1% versus the prior-year period, 
both on a reported basis and excluding divestiture-related 
impacts (see “Legacy Franchises” below). The decrease 
in revenues was primarily driven by lower non-interest 
revenues, mainly offset by higher net interest income. 
Citi’s expenses increased 9% versus the prior-year period, 
both on a reported basis and excluding divestiture-related 
impacts (see “Legacy Franchises” below), largely driven 
by continued investments in risk and controls, business-
led and enterprise-led investments, volume growth and 
macroeconomic factors, including inflation, as well as 
severance costs. The expense increase was partially offset 
by productivity savings and an expense reduction from 
the exited markets and continued wind-downs (see 
“Expenses” below).
Citi’s cost of credit was $1.8 billion versus $1.3 billion in 
the prior-year period. The increase was primarily driven 
by higher net credit losses, reflecting the continued 
normalization in net credit losses in Branded cards and 
Retail services.
Citi returned $2.0 billion to common shareholders in the 
form of dividends and share repurchases. As previously 
disclosed, in July 2023 Citi’s Board of Directors declared 
a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.53 per share for 
the third quarter of 2023, up from $0.51 in the previous 
quarter. Citi intends to maintain a quarterly common 
dividend of at least $0.53 per share, subject to financial 
and macroeconomic conditions, as well as Board of 
Directors approval. 
Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio under 
the Basel III Standardized Approach increased to 13.4% 
as of June 30, 2023, compared to 12.0% as of June 30, 
2022 (see “Capital Resources” below). This compares to 
Citi’s required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 12.0% as 
of January 1, 2023 under the Basel III Standardized 
Approach. As previously disclosed, on October 1, 2023, 
Citi’s required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio will increase 
to 12.3% from 12.0% under the Standardized Approach 
reflecting the increase in the Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) 
requirement to 4.3% from 4.0% (see “Capital Resources
—Stress Capital Buffer” below).
In May 2023, Citi announced that it intends to pursue an 
initial public offering (IPO) of its consumer, small 
business and middle-market banking operations in 
Mexico, following the planned separation from Citi’s 
Institutional Clients Group (ICG) and Private bank 
businesses in Mexico, both of which will remain part of 
Citi. 

• Citi continued to make progress on its other consumer 
banking business divestitures in the second quarter of 
2023, including working toward the closing of its Taiwan 
and Indonesia sale transactions in the second half of 2023, 
as well as progressing with the continued wind-downs of 
the Korea and China consumer banking businesses and the 
Russia consumer, local commercial and institutional 
businesses. In addition, Citi intends to restart the exit 
process for the consumer banking business in Poland later 
in 2023, subject to market conditions.

Second Quarter of 2023 Results Summary

Citigroup
Citigroup reported net income of $2.9 billion, or $1.33 per 
share, compared to net income of $4.5 billion, or $2.19 per 
share in the prior-year period. The decrease in net income was 
primarily driven by the higher expenses and the higher cost of 
credit, as well as the lower revenues. Citigroup’s effective tax 
rate was approximately 27% in the current quarter versus 20% 
in the prior-year period, largely driven by the geographic mix 
of earnings (see “Income Taxes” below). Earnings per share 
(EPS) decreased 39% from the prior-year period, reflecting the 
lower net income and an approximate 1% increase in average 
diluted shares outstanding. 

Results for the second quarter of 2023 included 

divestiture-related impacts of $(73) million in earnings before 
taxes ($(92) million after-tax). See “Legacy Franchises” and 
“Corporate/Other” below for details about the divestiture-
related impacts. 

These divestiture-related impacts, collectively, had a 

$(0.04) negative impact on EPS in the current quarter. 
Excluding these divestiture-related impacts, EPS was $1.37. 
(As used throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi’s results of 
operations and financial condition excluding the impact of 
divestiture-related impacts are non-GAAP financial measures.)

Results for the second quarter of 2022 included 

divestiture-related impacts of $48 million in earnings before 
taxes ($35 million after-tax). See “Legacy Franchises” below 
for details about the divestiture-related impacts. 

These divestiture-related impacts, collectively, had a 
$0.02 beneficial impact on EPS in the prior-year period. 
Excluding these divestiture-related impacts, EPS was $2.17.

Citigroup revenues of $19.4 billion in the second quarter 

of 2023 decreased 1% from the prior-year period, both on a 
reported basis and excluding divestiture-related impacts. The 
lower revenues reflected a decline in revenues across Markets 
and Investment banking in ICG and Global Wealth 
Management (Global Wealth) in Personal Banking and 
Wealth Management (PBWM), as well as a revenue reduction 
from the exited markets and continued wind-downs in Legacy 
Franchises. The decline in revenues was largely offset by 
strength across Services in ICG, U.S. Personal Banking 
revenues in PBWM and higher revenues from the investment 
portfolio in Corporate/Other.

     3                                                                                                                                                                                                            

Citigroup’s end-of-period loans were $661 billion, up 1% 

versus the prior-year period, driven by growth in PBWM, 
primarily driven by U.S. Personal Banking, largely offset by 
declines in ICG and Legacy Franchises. 

Citigroup’s end-of-period deposits were approximately 
$1.3 trillion, largely unchanged versus the prior-year period, 
as a decrease in ICG, primarily driven by Securities services, 
was offset by an increase in institutional certificates of deposit 
in Corporate/Other. For additional information about Citi’s 
deposits by business, including drivers and deposit trends, see 
each respective business’s results of operations and “Liquidity 
Risk—Deposits” below.

Expenses
Citigroup’s operating expenses of $13.6 billion increased 9% 
from the prior-year period, both on a reported basis and 
excluding divestiture-related impacts. The higher expenses 
largely reflected continued investments in risk and controls, 
business-led and enterprise-led investments, volume growth 
and macroeconomic factors, including inflation, as well as 
severance costs. The higher expenses were partially offset by 
productivity savings and expense reductions from the exited 
markets and wind-downs in Legacy Franchises.

As previously disclosed, Citi expects a sequential increase 

in expenses for the third quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting 
continued investments in Citi’s transformation and other risk 
and controls. 

Cost of Credit
Citi’s total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and 
claims was a cost of $1.8 billion, compared to $1.3 billion in 
the prior-year period. This increase was driven by higher net 
credit losses (see below), partially offset by a lower net build 
of $320 million in the ACL for loans and unfunded 
commitments and other provisions. The net ACL build and 
other provisions in the current quarter were primarily driven 
by growth in card balances in Branded cards and Retail 
services. This compared to a net ACL build and other 
provisions of $424 million in the prior-year period. For 
additional information on Citi’s ACL, see “Significant 
Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—Citi’s 
Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)” below. 

Net credit losses of $1.5 billion increased 77% from the 
prior year. Consumer net credit losses of $1.4 billion increased 
73%, reflecting ongoing normalization, particularly in 
Branded cards and Retail services. Corporate net credit losses 
increased to $75 million from $23 million.

Citi also expects to incur higher year-over-year net credit 

losses for the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by 
continued normalization, particularly in the cards business in 
PBWM.

For additional information on Citi’s consumer and 

corporate credit costs, see each respective business’s results of 
operations and “Credit Risk” below.

Capital
Citigroup’s CET1 Capital ratio was 13.4% as of June 30, 
2023, compared to 12.0% as of June 30, 2022, based on the 
Basel III Standardized Approach for determining risk-
weighted assets (RWA). The increase was primarily driven by 

net income, the impacts from the closing of the Asia consumer 
banking business sales and business actions, including a 
reduction in RWA, partially offset by the payment of common 
dividends and share repurchases. 

As previously announced, during the second quarter of 

2023, Citi resumed common share repurchases, and 
repurchased $1.0 billion of common shares (see “Unregistered 
Sales of Equity Securities, Repurchases of Equity Securities 
and Dividends” below). Citi will continue to assess common 
share repurchases on a quarter-by-quarter basis given 
uncertainty regarding regulatory capital requirements. For 
additional information, see “Capital Resources—Regulatory 
Capital Standards and Developments” below.

Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio as of June 30, 
2023 was 6.0%, compared to 5.7% as of June 30, 2022. The 
increase was driven by higher Tier 1 Capital, partially offset 
by an increase in Total Leverage Exposure. For additional 
information on Citi’s capital ratios and related components, 
see “Capital Resources” below.

Institutional Clients Group
ICG net income of $2.2 billion decreased 45%, primarily 
driven by lower revenues, higher expenses and higher cost of 
credit. ICG operating expenses of $7.3 billion increased 13%, 
primarily driven by continued investments in Treasury and 
trade solutions (TTS), continued risk and controls investments 
and severance costs in Markets and Investment banking, 
partially offset by productivity savings.

ICG revenues of $10.4 billion decreased 9% (including 
gain (loss) on loan hedges), primarily driven by a decline in 
Markets and Banking, partially offset by growth in Services. 
Results included a loss on loan hedges of $66 million in the 
second quarter of 2023, compared with a gain on loan hedges 
of $494 million in the prior-year period.

Services revenues of $4.7 billion increased 15%. TTS 
revenues of $3.5 billion increased 15%, driven by 18% growth 
in net interest income and 8% growth in non-interest revenue. 
Strong performance in TTS was primarily driven by higher 
interest rates and non-interest revenue benefits from continued 
growth of underlying drivers, primarily an 11% increase in 
cross-border transaction value and a 15% increase in 
commercial card spend volume. Securities services revenues 
of $1.1 billion increased 15%, as net interest income increased 
62%, largely driven by higher interest rates across currencies.
Markets revenues of $4.6 billion decreased 13%, driven 
by lower revenues in both Fixed income markets and Equity 
markets relative to strong performance in the prior-year 
period, as well as low volatility in the second quarter of 2023. 
Fixed income markets revenues of $3.5 billion decreased 13%, 
driven by declines in currencies and commodities, partially 
offset by modest growth in rates. Equity markets revenues of 
$1.1 billion decreased 10%, primarily reflecting a decline in 
equity derivatives revenues.

Banking revenues of $1.2 billion decreased 44%, 

including the gain (loss) on loan hedges in the current quarter 
and the prior-year period. Excluding the gain (loss) on loan 
hedges, Banking revenues of $1.2 billion decreased 22%, 
driven by lower revenues in Investment banking and 
Corporate lending. Investment banking revenues of $612 
million decreased 24%, reflecting a decline in the overall 

     4                                                                                                                                                                                                            

market wallet, as continued macroeconomic and geopolitical 
uncertainty continued to adversely impact client activity. 
Corporate lending revenues decreased 56%, including the 
impact of the gain (loss) on loan hedges. Excluding the impact 
of the gain (loss) on loan hedges, Corporate lending revenues 
decreased 20% versus the prior-year period, primarily driven 
by the impacts of foreign currency translation and lower 
lending volumes. (As used throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi’s 
results of operations and financial condition excluding the 
impact of the gain (loss) on loan hedges are non-GAAP 
financial measures.) 

For additional information on the results of operations of 
ICG for the second quarter of 2023, see “Institutional Clients 
Group” below.

Personal Banking and Wealth Management
PBWM net income of $494 million decreased 11%, driven by 
higher cost of credit and higher expenses, partially offset by 
higher revenues. PBWM operating expenses of $4.2 billion 
increased 5%, primarily driven by continued risk and controls 
investments.

PBWM revenues of $6.4 billion increased 6%, as net 
interest income growth, driven by strong loan growth across 
U.S. Personal Banking, was partially offset by a decline in 
non-interest revenue, driven by lower investment product 
revenues in Global Wealth.

U.S. Personal Banking revenues of $4.6 billion increased 

11%, primarily driven by higher revenues in cards, partially 
offset by lower Retail banking revenues. Branded cards 
revenues of $2.4 billion increased 8%, primarily driven by the 
higher net interest income, as average loans increased 14%. 
Retail services revenues of $1.6 billion increased 27%, 
primarily driven by the higher net interest income, as well as 
lower partner payments. Retail banking revenues of $594 
million decreased 9%, primarily reflecting the transfer of 
certain relationships and the associated deposit balances to 
Global Wealth.

Global Wealth revenues of $1.8 billion decreased 5%, 

largely driven by continued investment product revenue 
headwinds and higher interest rates paid on deposits, partially 
offset by the benefits from the continued transfer of Retail 
banking relationships.

For additional information on the results of operations of 
PBWM for the second quarter of 2023, see “Personal Banking 
and Wealth Management” below.

Legacy Franchises
Legacy Franchises recorded a net loss of $125 million, 
compared to a net loss of $17 million in the prior-year period, 
primarily driven by higher cost of credit, partially offset by 
lower expenses. Legacy Franchises expenses of $1.8 billion 
decreased 2%, primarily driven by the impact of exited 
markets and continued wind-downs.

Legacy Franchises revenues of $1.9 billion decreased 1%, 

driven by the reductions from exited markets and continued 
wind-downs, partially offset by the benefit of higher rates and 
lending volumes in Mexico Consumer/SBMM, as well as 
higher revenues in Legacy Holdings Assets. 

For additional information on the results of operations of 

Legacy Franchises for the second quarter of 2023, see 
“Legacy Franchises” below.

Corporate/Other 
Corporate/Other net income was $356 million, compared to 
$50 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by higher 
net interest income from Deposits with banks and the 
investment portfolio, a reserve release related to the repayment 
of the previously disclosed First Republic Bank deposit and 
the prior-year release of a CTA loss (net of hedges) from 
AOCI (for additional information, see Note 2). The increase in 
net income was partially offset by lower income tax benefits 
and higher expenses. Corporate/Other operating expenses of 
$302 million increased from $160 million in the prior-year 
period, primarily driven by the impact of inflation and 
severance costs and the absence of certain settlements that 
occurred in the prior-year period, partially offset by lower 
consulting expenses.

Corporate/Other revenues of $677 million increased from 

$255 million in the prior-year period, primarily driven by 
higher net interest income from Deposits with banks and the 
investment portfolio, largely due to higher interest rates. 

For additional information on the results of operations of 

Corporate/Other for the second quarter of 2023, see 
“Corporate/Other” below.

Macroeconomic and Other Risks and Uncertainties
Various geopolitical, macroeconomic and regulatory 
challenges and uncertainties continue to adversely impact 
economic conditions in the U.S. and globally, including 
central banks continuing to increase interest rates, continued 
elevated levels of inflation and economic and geopolitical 
challenges related to both China and the Russia–Ukraine war. 
These and other factors have adversely affected financial 
markets, negatively impacted global economic growth rates 
and raised fears of recession in the U.S., Europe and other 
regions and countries. In addition, these and other factors 
could adversely affect Citi’s customers, clients, businesses, 
funding costs, expenses and overall results of operations and 
financial condition during the remainder of 2023.

In May 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 

(FDIC) issued a proposal that would implement a special 
assessment to recover its uninsured deposit losses from recent 
bank failures. The FDIC estimated that the preliminary cost of 
the failures is approximately $15.8 billion, an estimate that 
would be periodically adjusted. If finalized as proposed, the 
FDIC is proposing to collect the special assessment at an 
annual rate of approximately 12.5 basis points of uninsured 
deposits, over eight quarterly assessment periods beginning in 
2024. Citi is likely to incur a significant increase in its 
operating expenses if the final rule for the FDIC special 
assessment is enacted as proposed, which is expected before 
the end of 2023. For additional information on the expected 
impact, see Note 26. 

In July 2023, the U.S. banking agencies issued a notice of 
proposed rulemaking, known as the Basel III Endgame, related 
to regulatory capital requirements. The rule as proposed would 
have a material impact on Citi’s current capital position; 
however, its finalization and implementation will be a 

     5                                                                                                                                                                                                            

multiyear process, including phase-in periods to meet the new 
capital requirements. Citi plans to comment on the proposal 
and adapt business activities to address associated impacts, if 
necessary, and will be in compliance with the final rule, once 
it is in effect and implemented. For additional information, see 
“Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital Standards and 
Developments” below.

For a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and risks 

that will or could impact Citi’s businesses, results of 
operations, capital and other financial condition during the 
remainder of 2023, see “Second Quarter of 2023 Results 
Summary” above and each respective business’s results of 
operations, “Managing Global Risk,” including “Managing

(1)  Certain series of preferred stock have semiannual payment dates. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K. 
(2)  The return on average common stockholders’ equity is calculated using net income less preferred stock dividends divided by average common stockholders’ 

equity. The return on average total Citigroup stockholders’ equity is calculated using net income divided by average Citigroup stockholders’ equity.

(3)  RoTCE and TBVPS are non-GAAP financial measures. For information on RoTCE and TBVPS, see “Capital Resources—Tangible Common Equity, Book Value 

Per Share, Tangible Book Value Per Share and Return on Equity” below.

(4)  Citi’s binding CET1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach, whereas Citi’s binding Total Capital ratio was 

derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework for both periods presented.

(5)  Certain of the above prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with enhancements made in the current period.
(6)  Dividends declared per common share as a percentage of net income per diluted share.
(7)  Total common dividends declared plus common share repurchases as a percentage of net income available to common shareholders (Net income less preferred 

dividends). See “Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity,” Note 9 and “Equity Security Repurchases” below for the component details.

respective segment information depicts the assets and liabilities managed by each segment.

(2) Consolidating eliminations for total Citigroup and Citigroup parent company assets and liabilities are recorded within Corporate/Other.
(3) The total equity and the majority of long-term debt of Citigroup are reflected on the Citigroup parent company balance sheet (see Notes 17 and 27). Citigroup 

allocates stockholders’ equity and long-term debt to its businesses through intersegment allocations as shown above.

(4) Represents the attribution of Citigroup’s liquid assets (primarily consisting of cash, marketable equity securities and AFS debt securities) to the various businesses 

based on Liquidity Coverage ratio (LCR) assumptions.
(5) Corporate/Other equity represents noncontrolling interests.

INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS GROUP

Institutional Clients Group (ICG) includes Services, Markets and Banking (for additional information on these businesses, see 
“Citigroup Operating Segments” above). ICG provides corporate, institutional and public sector clients around the world with a full 
range of wholesale banking products and services, including fixed income and equity sales and trading, foreign exchange, prime 
brokerage, derivative services, equity and fixed income research, corporate lending, investment banking and advisory services, cash 
management, trade finance and securities services. ICG transacts with clients in both cash instruments and derivatives, including fixed 
income, foreign currency, equity and commodity products. For more information on ICG’s business activities, see “Institutional 
Clients Group” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K. 

ICG’s international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 95 

countries and jurisdictions. As previously disclosed, as of March 31, 2023, Citi ended nearly all of the institutional banking services it 
offered in Russia, with the remaining services only those necessary to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations. For 
additional information about Citi’s continued efforts to reduce its operations and exposure in Russia, see “Legacy Franchises” and 
“Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—Russia” below.

At June 30, 2023, ICG had $1.8 trillion in assets and $818 billion in deposits. Securities services managed $23.7 trillion in assets 
under custody and administration at June 30, 2023, of which Citi provided both custody and administrative services to certain clients 
related to $2.2 trillion of such assets. Managed assets under trust were $4.1 trillion at June 30, 2023. For additional information on 
these operations, see “Administration and Other Fiduciary Fees” in Note 5.

(1)  Citi assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items. For example, securities that generate Net 

interest income may be risk managed with derivatives that are recorded in Principal transactions revenue within Non-interest revenue. For a description of the 
composition of these revenue line items, see Notes 4, 5 and 6.

(2)  Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. Gain (loss) on 

loan hedges include the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. The fixed premium

costs of these hedges are netted against the corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. Citigroup’s results of operations excluding the 
impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.

NM Not meaningful

The discussion of the results of operations for ICG below excludes (where noted) the impact of any gain (loss) on hedges of accrual 
loans, which are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.

2Q23 vs. 2Q22
Net income of $2.2 billion decreased 45%, primarily driven by 
lower revenues, higher expenses and higher cost of credit.
Revenues decreased 9% (including gain (loss) on loan 

hedges), driven by lower Banking and Markets revenues, 
partially offset by higher Services revenues. Banking revenues 
were down 44% (including the impact of the gain (loss) on 
loan hedges), reflecting lower revenues in both Investment 
banking and Corporate lending. Markets revenues were down 
13%, driven by lower revenues in both Fixed income markets 
and Equity markets, due to lower client activity, driven by 
decreased volatility and a strong prior-year comparison. 
Services revenues were up 15%, driven by higher revenues in 
both TTS and Securities services.

Citi expects that revenues in its Markets and Investment 
banking businesses will continue to reflect the overall market 
environment during the remainder of 2023.

Within Services:

•

•

TTS revenues increased 15%, driven by 18% growth in 
net interest income and 8% growth in non-interest 
revenue, reflecting strong growth across all client 
segments. The increase in net interest income was 
primarily driven by higher interest rates as well as growth 
in deposits, partially offset by higher interest rates paid on 
deposits. Average deposits increased 2%, largely driven 
by growth in EMEA and Latin America. Average loans 
decreased 6%, reflecting business actions taken to reduce 
RWA. The increase in non-interest revenue was primarily 
driven by strong fee growth in the cash business, 
reflecting solid client engagement and continued growth 
of underlying drivers, reflecting higher cross-border flows 
(up 11%) and commercial card spend (up 15%).
Securities services revenues increased 15%, as net interest 
income grew 63%, driven by higher interest rates across 
currencies and cost of funds management, partially offset 
by the impact of an 8% decline in average deposits. Non-
interest revenues decreased 5%, primarily driven by 
custody fee spread compression, partially offset by higher 
assets under custody and administration and continued 
elevated levels of corporate activity in Issuer services.

Within Markets:

•

Fixed income markets revenues decreased 13%, driven by 
North America, EMEA and Asia, largely due to decreased 
institutional and corporate client activity.

Rates and currencies decreased 12%, largely due to a 

decline in the currencies business, driven by EMEA, 
primarily reflecting lower volatility and a strong prior-
year comparison, partially offset by a modest increase in 
the rates business. Spread products and other fixed 
income revenues decreased 17%, due to a decline across 

•

regions in commodities, driven by lower corporate and 
institutional client activity, as well as a decline in the 
financing and securitization business, as the business 
further reduced its subscription credit facilities portfolio. 
Equity markets revenues decreased 10%, driven by North 
America and Asia. The decline primarily reflected lower 
equity derivatives revenues, driven by a more challenging 
macroeconomic environment, lower volatility and a 
strong prior-year comparison. The decline in equity 
derivatives revenues was partially offset by an increase in 
equity cash, reflecting a modest increase in institutional 
client activity. Prime finance revenues were largely 
unchanged, while prime finance balances continued to 
grow in the quarter. 

Within Banking:

•

•

Investment banking revenues declined 24%, reflecting a 
decline in the overall market wallet, as ongoing 
macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty continued to 
adversely impact client activity. Advisory revenues 
decreased 55%, reflecting a decline in North America and 
Asia, partially offset by growth in EMEA. The decrease in 
advisory revenues was driven by the lower market wallet 
as well as lower wallet share. Equity underwriting 
revenues decreased 8%, reflecting a decline in North 
America, Asia and EMEA, driven by lower wallet share, 
partially offset by growth in the market wallet. Debt 
underwriting revenues increased 6%, reflecting growth in 
North America and EMEA, driven by wallet share gains, 
largely in the investment-grade portfolio, partially offset 
by the decline in the market wallet.
Corporate lending revenues decreased 56%, including the 
impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges. Excluding the 
impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, revenues 
decreased 20%, primarily driven by the impacts of foreign 
currency translation and lower lending volumes. 

Expenses increased 13%, primarily driven by continued 

investment in TTS, risk and controls investments and 
severance costs in Markets and Investment banking, partially 
offset by productivity savings. 

Provisions reflected a cost of $58 million, compared to a 
benefit of $202 million in the prior-year period, largely driven 
by an ACL build for other assets and higher net credit losses. 
Net credit losses were $73 million, compared to $18 million in 
the prior-year period.

The ACL release was $15 million, compared to a release 
of $220 million in the prior-year period. The $15 million ACL 
release was driven by a net ACL release for loans and 
unfunded lending commitments of $238 million, primarily due 
to an improved macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a 
$223 million build for other assets, primarily related to an 
increase in transfer risk associated with exposures outside the 

     14                                                                                                                                                                                                            

Within Banking:

•

•

Investment banking revenues decreased 24%. Advisory 
revenues decreased 36% and equity underwriting 
revenues decreased 25%, driven by the same factors 
described above. Debt underwriting revenues decreased 
13%, largely driven by the lower market wallet.
Corporate lending revenues decreased 56%, including the 
impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges. Excluding the 
impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, revenues 
decreased 17%, driven by the same factors described 
above.

Expenses increased 8%, primarily driven by continued 
investment in Citi’s transformation, investments in TTS, other 
risk and controls investments, volume-related expenses and 
other structural expenses, including severance costs, partially 
offset by productivity savings and foreign exchange 
translation.

Provisions reflected a benefit of $14 million, compared to 

a cost of $769 million in the prior-year period, largely driven 
by a net ACL release for loans and unfunded lending 
commitments, compared to an ACL build in the prior-year 
period. Net credit losses were $95 million, compared to $48 
million in the prior-year period. 

The ACL release was $109 million, compared to a build 
of $721 million in the prior-year period, driven by a net ACL 
release for loans and unfunded lending commitments of $483 
million, due to an improved macroeconomic outlook and 
Russia loan reductions, partially offset by a $374 million build 
for other assets, primarily related to an increase in transfer risk 
associated with exposures outside the U.S. driven by safety 
and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law.

2Q23 YTD vs. 2Q22 YTD
Net income of $5.4 billion decreased 17%, primarily driven by 
lower revenues and higher expenses, partially offset by lower 
cost of credit.

Revenues decreased 4% (including gain (loss) on loan 

hedges), driven by lower Banking and Markets revenues, 
partially offset by higher Services revenues. Banking revenues 
were down 41% (including the impact of the gain (loss) on 
loan hedges), reflecting lower revenues in both Investment 
banking and Corporate lending. Markets revenues were down 
8%, driven by lower revenues in both Equity markets and 
Fixed income markets, also reflecting lower client activity, 
driven by decreased volatility and a strong prior-year 
comparison. Services revenues were up 21%, driven by higher 
revenues in both TTS and Securities services.

Within Services:

•

•

TTS revenues increased 22%, with growth in net interest 
income of 28% and non-interest revenue of 11%, driven 
by the same factors described above.
Securities services revenues increased 19%, reflecting 
higher net interest income, driven by the same factors 
described above. Non-interest revenue declined 6%, as a 
decrease in revenues in the custody business was partially 
offset by an increase in Issuer services.

Within Markets:

•

•

Fixed income markets revenues decreased 5%, primarily 
due to EMEA, reflecting a decline in spread products and 
other fixed income, driven by the same factors described 
above, as rates and currencies revenues were largely 
unchanged.
Equity markets revenues decreased 18%, primarily due to 
a decline in equity derivatives, driven by the same factors 
as described above, as well as a modest decline in equity 
cash. Prime finance balances continued to grow year to

2Q23 YTD vs. 2Q22 YTD
Year-to-date, PBWM experienced similar trends to those 
described above. Net income was $983 million, compared to 
$2.4 billion in the prior-year period, largely driven by higher 
cost of credit and higher expenses, partially offset by higher 
revenues. 

Revenues increased 8%, largely due to higher revenues in 

U.S. Personal Banking. U.S. Personal Banking revenues 
increased 15%, reflecting higher revenues in cards, largely 
driven by the same factors described above. Global Wealth 
revenues decreased 7%, largely driven by the same factors 
described above. 

Expenses increased 7%, primarily driven by continued 
investments in Citi’s transformation, other risk and controls 
investments and severance costs, partially offset by 
productivity savings. 

Provisions were $3.2 billion, compared to $1.0 billion in 

the prior-year period, due to a net ACL build for loans, as well 
as higher net credit losses, primarily driven by ongoing 
normalization in U.S. cards. 

The net ACL build was $0.8 billion, primarily driven by 
U.S. cards loan growth, compared to a release of $0.4 billion 
in the prior-year period.

2Q23 vs. 2Q22 
Net income was $494 million, compared to $553 million in the 
prior-year period, driven by higher cost of credit and higher 
expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.

Revenues increased 6%, primarily due to higher net 

interest income, driven by strong loan growth across U.S. 
Personal Banking. The increase was partially offset by lower 
non-interest revenue, primarily reflecting lower investment 
product revenues in Global Wealth. 

U.S. Personal Banking revenues increased 11%, reflecting 
higher revenues in cards, partially offset by lower revenues in 
Retail banking.

Cards revenues increased 15%. Branded cards revenues 
increased 8%, primarily driven by higher net interest income, 
reflecting strength in underlying drivers. Branded cards new 
account acquisitions increased 6% and card spend volumes 
increased 4%. Average loans increased 14%, reflecting the 
higher card spend volumes and lower payment rates.

Retail services revenues increased 27%, primarily driven 

by higher net interest income on higher loan balances and 
lower partner payments. Retail services card spend volumes 
decreased 5%, primarily driven by lower discretionary retail 
spend. Average loans increased 9%, reflecting lower payment 
rates, partially offset by the lower card spend volumes. 

Retail banking revenues decreased 9%, primarily driven 
by the impact of the transfer of certain relationships and the 
associated deposit balances to Global Wealth. Average loans 
increased 17%, primarily driven by higher mortgage 
originations. Average deposits decreased 3%, largely 
reflecting the transfer of certain relationships and the 
associated deposit balances to Global Wealth.

Global Wealth revenues decreased 5%, largely reflecting 
investment product revenue headwinds and lower net interest 
income, partially offset by the benefits of the transfer of 
certain relationships and the associated deposit balances from 
Retail banking. Average deposits and average loans were 
largely unchanged. Client assets increased 5%, primarily 
driven by increases in market valuations. Client advisors 
decreased 1%, reflecting the re-pacing of strategic hiring. 
Private bank revenues decreased 19%, driven by the 
investment product revenue headwinds and higher interest 
rates paid on deposits. Wealth at Work revenues increased 
32%, driven by strong lending results, primarily in mortgages, 
and Citigold revenues decreased 2%, driven by the lower net 
interest income and the lower investment product revenue. 
Expenses increased 5%, largely driven by risk and 
controls investments, partially offset by productivity savings.
Provisions were $1.6 billion, compared to $1.4 billion in 

the prior-year period, largely driven by higher net credit 
losses, partially offset by a lower net ACL build for loans. Net 
credit losses increased 78%, reflecting ongoing normalization 
in U.S. cards from near historically low levels, with Branded 
cards net credit losses up 87% to $614 million and Retail 
services net credit losses up 88% to $545 million. Both 
Branded cards and Retail services net credit losses are 
expected to normalize by the end of 2023.

LEGACY FRANCHISES

As of June 30, 2023, Legacy Franchises included (i) Asia Consumer Banking (Asia Consumer), representing the consumer banking 
operations of the remaining six Asia and EMEA exit countries, (ii) Mexico Consumer Banking (Mexico Consumer) and Mexico Small 
Business and Middle-Market Banking (Mexico SBMM), collectively Mexico Consumer/SBMM, and (iii) Legacy Holdings Assets 
(certain North America consumer mortgage loans and other legacy assets). Asia Consumer provides traditional retail banking and 
branded card products to retail and small business customers. Mexico Consumer/SBMM provides traditional retail banking and 
branded card products to consumers and small business customers and traditional middle-market banking products and services to 
commercial customers through Citibanamex. 

Legacy Franchises also included the following seven consumer banking businesses prior to their sale: Australia, until its closing 
on June 1, 2022; the Philippines, until its closing on August 1, 2022; Thailand and Malaysia, until their closings on November 1, 2022; 
Bahrain, until its closing on December 1, 2022; and India and Vietnam, until their closings on March 1, 2023. 

In addition, Citi has entered into agreements to sell its consumer banking businesses in Indonesia and Taiwan, and has continued 
to make progress on its wind-downs of consumer banking operations in Korea and China and consumer banking and local commercial 
banking operations in Russia (see below). See Note 2 for additional information on Legacy Franchises’ consumer banking business 
sales and wind-downs. 

In May 2023, Citi announced it intends to pursue an IPO of consumer, small business and middle-market banking operations in 
Mexico. Citi will retain its ICG and Private bank businesses in Mexico. Citi currently expects that the separation of the businesses will 
be completed in the second half of 2024 and that the IPO will take place in 2025. 

In connection with Citi’s wind-down of its consumer and local commercial banking businesses in Russia, Citi expects to incur 
approximately $140 million in total estimated charges (excluding the impact from any portfolio sales) related to Legacy Franchises. 
Citi’s previously disclosed referral agreement with a Russian bank to settle a portfolio of ruble-denominated credit card loans, subject 
to customer consents, was signed in May 2023. The outstanding card loan balances with Citi ($131 million as of June 30, 2023) are to 
be settled upon referral and refinancing, and the portfolio has not been designated as held-for-sale (HFS). For additional information 
about Citi’s continued efforts to reduce its operations and exposures in Russia, see “Institutional Clients Group” above and “Managing 
Global Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—Russia” below, as well as “Risk Factors” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

At June 30, 2023, on a combined basis, Legacy Franchises had 1,413 retail branches, $21 billion in retail banking loans and $53 
billion in deposits. In addition, the businesses had $9 billion in outstanding card loan balances, and Mexico SBMM had $8 billion in 
outstanding corporate loan balances. These loan and deposit amounts exclude approximately $8 billion of loans ($7 billion of retail 
banking loans and $1 billion of credit card loan balances) and approximately $11 billion of deposits, all of which were reclassified to 
HFS (e.g., as Other assets and Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet) as a result of Citi’s entry into agreements to sell 
certain remaining consumer banking businesses. See Note 2 for additional information.

cards revenues increased 38%, SBMM revenues increased 
25% and retail banking revenues increased 16%, primarily due 
to higher interest rates and higher lending volumes.

Expenses decreased 2%, mainly driven by the impact of 

the exited markets and continued wind-downs. 

Provisions were $300 million, compared to $121 million

revenues increased 19%, mainly due to the benefit of FX 
translation as well as higher interest rates and higher lending 
volumes. Legacy Holdings Assets revenues of $41 million

Expenses decreased 14%, mainly driven by the absence of 

the goodwill impairment in the prior-year period and the 
benefit of the closed exit markets and wind-downs.

Provisions were $645 million, compared to $281 million 
in the prior-year period, driven by higher lending volumes and 
net credit losses in Mexico Consumer, and a build for transfer 
risk associated with exposures outside the U.S., driven by 
safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law.

2Q23 YTD vs. 2Q22 YTD
Year-to-date, Corporate/Other experienced similar trends to 
those described above. Net income was $611 million, 
compared to net income of $239 million in the prior-year 
period, largely driven by the same factors described above.

Revenues were $1.6 billion, compared to $445 million in 

the prior-year period, driven by the same factors described 
above. 

Expenses were $612 million, compared to $420 million in 

the prior-year period, driven by the same factors described 
above.

Provisions were a $2 million benefit, as the reserve build 
for the First Republic Bank deposit in the first quarter of 2023 
was released in the second quarter of 2023.

2Q23 vs. 2Q22
Net income was $356 million, compared to $50 million in the 
prior-year period. The increase in net income was primarily 
driven by higher revenues, benefits from cost of credit and the 
prior-year release of a CTA loss (net of hedges) from AOCI 
(for additional information, see Note 2). These increases were 
partially offset by higher expenses and lower income tax 
benefits. Results for the quarter also included a $40 million 
withholding tax related to an exit market, which is a 
divestiture-related impact.

Revenues were $677 million, compared to $255 million in 

the prior-year period, primarily driven by higher net interest 
income from Deposits with banks and the investment 
portfolio, largely due to higher interest rates. 

Expenses were $302 million, compared to $160 million in 

the prior-year period, primarily reflecting the impact of 
inflation, higher severance costs and the absence of certain 
settlements that occurred in the prior-year period, partially 
offset by lower consulting expenses. 

Provisions were a $113 million benefit, primarily driven 

by a reserve release related to the repayment of the First 
Republic Bank deposit.

risks related to Corporate/Other’s future results, see 
“Executive Summary” above, “Forward-Looking Statements” 
below and “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” in Citi’s 2022
