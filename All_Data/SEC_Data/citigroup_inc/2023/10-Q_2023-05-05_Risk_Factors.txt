MANAGING GLOBAL RISK

For Citi, effective risk management is of primary importance 
to its overall operations. Accordingly, Citi’s risk management 
process has been designed to monitor, evaluate and manage 
the principal risks it assumes in conducting its activities. 
Specifically, the activities that Citi engages in, and the risks 
those activities generate, must be consistent with Citi’s 
Mission and Value Proposition and the key Leadership 
Principles that support it, as well as Citi’s risk appetite. For 
more information on managing global risk at Citi, see 
“Managing Global Risk” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

CREDIT RISK

For more information on credit risk, including Citi’s credit risk 
management, measurement and stress testing, and Citi’s consumer 
and corporate credit portfolios, see “Credit Risk” and “Risk 
Factors” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings 
across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison 
of credit exposure across all lines of business, geographic 
regions and products. Counterparty risk ratings reflect an 
estimated probability of default for a counterparty, and 
internal risk ratings are derived by leveraging validated 
statistical models and scorecards in combination with 
consideration of factors specific to the obligor or market, such 
as management experience, competitive position, regulatory 
environment and commodity prices. Facility risk ratings are 
assigned that reflect the probability of default of the obligor 
and factors that affect the loss given default of the facility, 
such as support or collateral. Internal obligor ratings that 
generally correspond to BBB and above are considered 
investment grade, while those below are considered non-
investment grade.

Note: Total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending 
commitments. 

In addition to the obligor and facility risk ratings assigned 

to all exposures, Citi may classify exposures in the corporate 
credit portfolio. These classifications are consistent with Citi’s 
interpretation of the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of 
criticized exposures, which may categorize exposures as 
special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss.

Risk ratings and classifications are reviewed regularly and 
adjusted as appropriate. The credit review process incorporates 
quantitative and qualitative factors, including financial and 
non-financial disclosures or metrics, idiosyncratic events or 
changes to the competitive, regulatory or macroeconomic 
environment. 

Citi believes the corporate credit portfolio to be 

appropriately rated and classified as of March 31, 2023. Citi 
has taken action to adjust internal ratings and classifications of 
exposures as both the macroeconomic environment and 
obligor-specific factors have changed, particularly where 
additional stress has been seen. 

As obligor risk ratings are downgraded, the probability of 

default increases. Downgrades of obligor risk ratings tend to 
result in a higher provision for credit losses. In addition, 
appetite per obligor is reduced consistent with the ratings, and 
downgrades may result in the purchase of additional credit 
derivatives or other risk/structural mitigants to hedge the 
incremental credit risk, or may result in Citi’s seeking to 
reduce exposure to an obligor or an industry sector. Citi will 
continue to review exposures to ensure that the appropriate 
probability of default is incorporated into all risk assessments.
See Note 13 for additional information on Citi’s corporate 

credit portfolio.

(1)  Excludes $0.7 billion and $0.1 billion of funded and unfunded exposure at March 31, 2023, respectively, primarily related to the delinquency-managed loans and 

unearned income. Funded balances also exclude loans carried at fair value of $4.9 billion at March 31, 2023. 
Includes non-accrual loan exposures and criticized unfunded exposures.

(2) 
(3)  Represents the amount of purchased credit protection in the form of derivatives to economically hedge funded and unfunded exposures. Of the $39.8 billion of 

purchased credit protection, $36.9 billion represents the total notional amount of purchased credit derivatives on individual reference entities. The remaining $2.9 
billion represents the first loss tranche of portfolios of purchased credit derivatives with a total notional of $24.5 billion, where the protection seller absorbs the 
first loss on the referenced loan portfolios.

(4)  Autos total credit exposure includes securitization financing facilities secured by auto loans and leases, extended mainly to the finance company subsidiaries of 
global auto manufacturers, bank subsidiaries and independent auto finance companies, of approximately $16.9 billion ($10.6 billion in funded, with 100% rated 
investment grade) as of March 31, 2023.
In addition to this exposure, Citi has energy-related exposure within the public sector (e.g., energy-related state-owned entities) and the transportation and 
industrials sector (e.g., off-shore drilling entities) included in the table above. As of March 31, 2023, Citi’s total exposure to these energy-related entities was 
approximately $4.6 billion, of which approximately $2.6 billion consisted of direct outstanding funded loans.

(5) 

Exposure to Commercial Real Estate
As of March 31, 2023, Citi’s total credit exposure to 
commercial real estate (CRE) was $66 billion, inclusive of $8 
billion of exposure related to office buildings. This total CRE 
exposure consisted of (i) $55 billion related to corporate 
clients, mainly included in the real estate category in the table 
above, and (ii) $11 billion related to Private bank clients 
within PBWM that is not in the table above as they are not 
considered corporate exposures. 

In addition, as of March 31, 2023, approximately 86% of 

Citi’s total CRE exposure was rated investment grade and 
more than 70% was to borrowers in the U.S.

As of March 31, 2023, the ACLL attributed to the total 

funded CRE exposure (including the Private bank) was 
approximately 1.2%, and there were $38 million of non-
accrual CRE loans.

(1)  Excludes $0.6 billion and $0.1 billion of funded and unfunded exposure at December 31, 2022, respectively, primarily related to the delinquency-managed loans 

and unearned income. Funded balances also exclude loans carried at fair value of $5.1 billion at December 31, 2022. 
Includes non-accrual loan exposures and criticized unfunded exposures.

(2) 
(3)  Represents the amount of purchased credit protection in the form of derivatives to economically hedge funded and unfunded exposures. Of the $39.8 billion of 

purchased credit protection, $36.6 billion represents the total notional amount of purchased credit derivatives on individual reference entities. The remaining $3.2 
billion represents the first loss tranche of portfolios of purchased credit derivatives with a total notional of $27.6 billion, where the protection seller absorbs the 
first loss on the referenced loan portfolios.

(4)  Autos total credit exposure includes securitization financing facilities secured by auto loans and leases, extended mainly to the finance company subsidiaries of 
global auto manufacturers, bank subsidiaries and independent auto finance companies, of approximately $17.4 billion ($10.3 billion in funded, with more than 
99% rated investment grade) as of December 31, 2022.
In addition to this exposure, Citi has energy-related exposure within the public sector (e.g., energy-related state-owned entities) and the transportation and 
industrials sector (e.g., off-shore drilling entities) included in the table above. As of December 31, 2022, Citi’s total exposure to these energy-related entities was 
approximately $4.7 billion, of which approximately $2.4 billion consisted of direct outstanding funded loans.

Credit Risk Mitigation
As part of its overall risk management activities, Citigroup 
uses credit derivatives and other risk mitigants to hedge 
portions of the credit risk in its corporate credit portfolio, in 
addition to outright asset sales. Citi may enter into partial-term 
hedges as well as full-term hedges. In advance of the 
expiration of partial-term hedges, Citi will determine, among 
other factors, the economic feasibility of hedging the 
remaining life of the instrument. The results of the mark-to-
market and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives 
are reflected primarily in Principal transactions in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income.

At March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and March 31, 

2022, ICG had economic hedges on the corporate credit 
portfolio of $39.8 billion, $39.8 billion and $37.9 billion, 
respectively. Citi’s expected credit loss model used in the 
calculation of its ACL does not include the favorable impact 
of credit derivatives and other mitigants that are marked-to-
market. In addition, the reported amounts of direct 
outstandings and unfunded lending commitments in the tables 
above do not reflect the impact of these hedging transactions. 
The credit protection was economically hedging underlying 
ICG corporate credit portfolio exposures with the following 
risk rating distribution:

(1) End-of-period loans include interest and fees on credit cards.
(2) Asia Consumer loan balances, reported within Legacy Franchises, exclude any loans reclassified to held-for-sale (HFS) as of the date Citi enters into a sale 

agreement for the respective Asia Consumer banking business. These reclassified HFS loans are instead reported in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet until sale closing. The remaining Asia Consumer loan portfolios—China, Korea, Russia and Poland—are held-for-investment and included in end-of-period 
consumer loans for all periods presented. All HFS portfolios were reclassified prior to the end of 1Q22 except for a $1.8 billion portfolio, which was moved to 
HFS in 1Q23.

(3) Consists of $98.9 billion, $98.2 billion, $99.3 billion, $94.6 billion and $94.1 billion of loans in North America as of March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, 

September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively. For additional information on the credit quality of the Global Wealth portfolio, see Note 13.

(4) Consists of $51.0 billion, $51.0 billion, $51.8 billion, $54.2 billion and $56.1 billion of loans outside North America as of March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022,

marketable investment securities, commercial real estate and limited partner capital commitments in private equity) and have experienced very low historical 
NCLs. As discussed below, approximately 93% of the classifiably managed portion of these loans are investment grade. See “Consumer Loan Delinquencies 
Amounts and Ratios” below for details on the delinquency-managed portfolio.

(7) Asia Consumer also includes loans and leases in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.

Consumer Credit Trends

Personal Banking and Wealth Management (PBWM)

Personal Banking and Wealth Management

U.S. Personal Banking’s Branded cards portfolio includes 

proprietary and co-branded cards. 

As shown in the chart above, the first quarter of 2023 net 

credit loss rate in Branded cards increased quarter-over-
quarter and year-over-year, driven by a continued increase in 
net flow rates, primarily reflecting ongoing normalization 
toward pre-pandemic levels from historically low levels 
(4Q’19 and 1Q’20 NCL ratios were 3.10% and 3.40%, 
respectively).

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-

over-quarter and year-over year, also driven by a continued 
increase in net flow rates, primarily reflecting the ongoing 
normalization toward pre-pandemic levels (4Q’19 and 1Q’20 
90+ DPD ratios were 0.95% and 1.01%, respectively). 

Retail Services

As indicated above, PBWM consists of U.S. Personal Banking 
and Global Wealth Management (Global Wealth). U.S. 
Personal Banking provides card products through Branded 
cards and Retail services, and also includes mortgages and 
home equity, small business and personal consumer loans 
through Citi’s Retail banking network. The Retail bank is 
concentrated in six major U.S. metropolitan areas. Global 
Wealth provides investment services, cards, mortgages and 
personal, small business and other consumer loans through the 
Private bank, Wealth at Work and Citigold. 

As of March 31, 2023, 43% of PBWM consumer loans 
consisted of Branded cards and Retail services card loans, 
which generally drives the overall credit performance of 
PBWM, as U.S. Cards net credit losses represented 
approximately 93% of total PBWM losses. 

As shown in the chart above, the first quarter of 2023 net 

credit loss rate in PBWM increased quarter-over-quarter and 
year-over-year, driven by a continued increase in net flow 
rates, primarily reflecting ongoing normalization from 
historically low levels in U.S. Cards.

PBWM’s 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased 

quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, also driven by a 
continued increase in net flow rates, primarily reflecting the 
ongoing normalization in U.S. Cards.

Branded Cards

U.S. Personal Banking’s Retail services partners directly 

with more than 20 retailers and dealers to offer private label 
and co-branded cards. Retail services’ target market focuses 
on select industry segments such as home improvement, 
specialty retail, consumer electronics and fuel. Retail services 
continually evaluates opportunities to add partners within 
target industries that have strong loyalty, lending or payment 
programs and growth potential.

As shown in the chart above, the first quarter of 2023 net 

credit loss rate in Retail services increased quarter-over-
quarter and year-over-year, driven by a continued increase in 
net flow rates, primarily reflecting the ongoing normalization 
toward pre-pandemic levels from historically low levels (for 
4Q’19 and 1Q’20, the NCL ratios were 5.05% and 5.35%, 
respectively, and the 90+ DPD ratios were 1.91% and 1.96%, 
respectively).

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-

over-quarter and year-over-year, also driven by a continued 
increase in net flow rates, primarily reflecting the ongoing 
normalization.

For additional information on cost of credit, loan 

delinquency and other information for Citi’s cards portfolios, 
see each respective business’s results of operations above and 
Note 13.

41

Retail Banking

U.S. Personal Banking’s Retail banking portfolio consists 
primarily of consumer mortgages (including home equity) and 
unsecured lending products, such as small business loans and 
personal loans. The portfolio is generally delinquency 
managed, where Citi evaluates credit risk based on FICO 
scores, delinquencies and the value of underlying collateral. 
The consumer mortgages in this portfolio have historically 
been extended to high credit quality customers, generally with 
loan-to-value ratios that are less than or equal to 80% on first 
and second mortgages. For additional information, see “Loan-
to-Value (LTV) Ratios” in Note 13.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 

Retail banking for the first quarter of 2023 increased quarter-
over-quarter, primarily due to a decrease in recoveries and 
normalization of losses in the personal loan portfolio, and 
decreased year-over-year, primarily driven by the impact of 
industry-wide episodic overdraft losses in the prior-year 
period.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily driven by 
U.S. mortgages, which reflected the lasting effects of 
government stimulus, unemployment benefits and consumer 
relief programs.

Global Wealth

As discussed above, the Global Wealth credit portfolio 
primarily consists of consumer mortgages, cards and other 
lending products extended to customer segments that range 
from the affluent to ultra-high-net-worth through the Private 
bank, Wealth at Work and Citigold. These customer segments 
represent a target market that is characterized by historically 
low default rates and delinquencies. 

As of March 31, 2023, approximately $49 billion, or 33%, 

of the portfolio was classifiably managed and primarily 
consisted of margin lending, commercial real estate, 

42

subscription credit finance and other lending programs. These 
classifiably managed loans are primarily evaluated for credit 
risk based on their internal risk rating, of which 93% is rated 
investment grade. While the delinquency rate in the chart 
above is calculated only for the delinquency-managed 
portfolio, the net credit loss rate is calculated using net credit 
losses for both the delinquency and classifiably managed 
portfolios.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 
Global Wealth for the first quarter of 2023 decreased slightly 
quarter-over-quarter, due to a classifiably managed loan 
charge-off in the prior quarter, while the net credit loss rate 
year-over-year was broadly stable. The 90+ days past due 
delinquency rate was broadly stable quarter-over-quarter and 
year-over-year, reflecting the strong credit profiles of the 
portfolios. The low levels of net credit losses and the 90+ days 
past due delinquency rate continued to reflect the strong credit 
profiles of the portfolios. 

Legacy Franchises
Legacy Franchises provides traditional retail banking and 
branded card products to retail and small business customers 
in Asia Consumer and Mexico Consumer.

Asia(1) Consumer

(1) Asia Consumer includes Legacy Franchises activities in certain EMEA 

countries for all periods presented.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 

Asia Consumer (for the remaining consumer banking 
portfolios held-for-investment (China, Korea, Russia and 
Poland)) for the first quarter of 2023 increased quarter-over-
quarter and year-over-year. The increases were primarily 
driven by lower average loans due to the ongoing wind-downs 
of the remaining businesses, particularly Korea, and the 
reclassification of a portfolio to HFS in the first quarter of 
2023.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-
over-quarter and year-over-year, mainly driven by lower loans 
due to the ongoing wind-downs of the remaining businesses 
and the reclassification of a portfolio to HFS in the first 
quarter of 2023. The overall performance of remaining Asia 
Consumer portfolios continues to reflect the strong credit 
profiles in the region’s target customer segments.

 
Mexico Consumer

Mexico Consumer operates in Mexico through 

Citibanamex and provides credit cards, consumer mortgages 
and small business and personal loans. Mexico Consumer 
serves a more mass-market segment in Mexico and focuses on 
developing multiproduct relationships with customers.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 

Mexico Consumer for the first quarter of 2023 increased 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily driven by 
the gradual normalization of loss rates after peak losses 
experienced during the pandemic.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate was largely 

unchanged quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.

For additional information on cost of credit, loan 
delinquency and other information for Citi’s consumer loan 
portfolios, see each respective business’s results of operations 
above and Note 13.

U.S. Cards FICO Distribution
The following tables show the current FICO score

normalization in the portfolio. However, the FICO distribution 
continues to reflect strong underlying credit quality and a

(1) End-of-period (EOP) loans include interest and fees on credit cards.
(2) The ratios of 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due are calculated based on EOP loans, net of unearned income.
(3) The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios for Retail banking exclude loans guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies since the 

potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) 
were $80 million ($0.6 billion), $89 million ($0.6 billion) and $161 million ($0.9 billion) at March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, 
respectively. The amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP 
loans) were $57 million, $70 million and $62 million at March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively. The EOP loans in the table include 
the guaranteed loans.

(4) The 90+ days past due balances for Branded cards and Retail services are generally still accruing interest. Citi’s policy is generally to accrue interest on credit card 

loans until 180 days past due, unless notification of bankruptcy filing has been received earlier.

(5) Excludes EOP classifiably managed Private bank loans. These loans are not included in the delinquency numerator, denominator and ratios. 
(6) These loans are evaluated for non-accrual status and write-off primarily based on their internal risk classification and not solely on their delinquency status, and 

therefore delinquency metrics are excluded from this table. As of March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, 93%, 96% and 92% of Global Wealth 
classifiably managed loans were rated investment grade. For additional information on the credit quality of the Global Wealth portfolio, including classifiably 
managed portfolios, see “Consumer Credit Trends” above.

(7) Asia Consumer includes delinquencies and loans in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.

(8) Citi has entered into agreements to sell certain Asia consumer banking businesses. Accordingly, the loans of these businesses have been reclassified as HFS in 

Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and hence the loans and related delinquencies and ratios are not included in this table. The reclassifications 
commenced as follows: Bahrain, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam in 1Q22 (Bahrain, Malaysia and Thailand closed in 4Q22; India and 
Vietnam closed in 1Q23). In addition, a portfolio was reclassified to HFS in the first quarter of 2023. See Note 2 for additional information.

(9) The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are primarily related to U.S. mortgages guaranteed by U.S. 
government-sponsored agencies since the potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the U.S. agencies. The amounts excluded for 90+ days past due and 
(EOP loans) were $81 million ($0.3 billion), $90 million ($0.3 billion) and $124 million ($0.4 billion) at March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and March 31, 
2022, respectively. The amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due 
EOP loans) were $30 million, $37 million and $35 million at March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively. The EOP loans in the table 
include the guaranteed loans.

(1) Average loans include interest and fees on credit cards.
(2) The ratios of net credit losses are calculated based on average loans, net of unearned income.
(3) Asia Consumer includes NCLs and average loans in certain EMEA countries (Russia and Poland) for all periods presented.
(4) As of the end of the first quarter of 2022, Citi had entered into agreements to sell certain Asia consumer banking businesses, which have been reclassified as HFS 

in Other assets and Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As a result, approximately $11 million, $18 million and $53 million in related net credit 
losses (NCLs) were recorded as a reduction in revenue (Other revenue) in 1Q23, 4Q22 and 1Q22, respectively. Accordingly, these NCLs are not included in this 
table. The reclassifications commenced as follows: Bahrain, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam in 1Q22 (Bahrain, Malaysia and Thailand 
closed in 4Q22; India and Vietnam closed in 1Q23). See Note 2 for additional information.

(1) North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Mexico is included in offices outside North America. The classification of corporate loans between 

offices in North America and outside North America is based on the domicile of the booking unit. The difference between the domicile of the booking unit and the 
domicile of the managing unit is not material.

(2) Loans secured primarily by real estate.
(3) Consumer loans are net of unearned income of $748 million, $712 million, $671 million, $631 million and $591 million at March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, 

September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively. Unearned income on consumer loans primarily represents unamortized origination fees and 
costs, premiums and discounts. 

(4) Corporate loans include Mexico SBMM loans and are net of unearned income of $(801) million, $(797) million, $(750) million, $(759) million and $(766) million 
at March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively. Unearned income on corporate loans primarily 
represents interest received in advance, but not yet earned, on loans originated on a discounted basis.

(5) Because loans carried at fair value do not have an ACLL, they are excluded from the ACLL ratio calculation.

(1) On January 1, 2023, Citi adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-02, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): TDRs and Vintage 

Disclosures. The ASU eliminates the accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure the ACLL for TDRs using a 
discounted cash flow (DCF) approach. On January 1, 2023, Citi recorded a $352 million decrease in the Allowance for loan losses, along with a $290 million 
after-tax increase to Retained earnings.
Includes all adjustments to the allowance for credit losses, such as changes in the allowance from acquisitions, dispositions, securitizations, FX translation, 
purchase accounting adjustments, etc.

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets 
For additional information on Citi’s non-accrual loans and 
assets, see “Non-Accrual Loans and Assets” in Citi’s 2022 
Form 10-K.

Non-Accrual Loans
The table below summarizes Citigroup’s non-accrual loans as 
of the periods indicated. Non-accrual loans may still be current 
on interest payments. In situations where Citi reasonably 
expects that only a portion of the principal owed will 
ultimately be collected, all payments received are reflected as 
a reduction of principal and not as interest income. For all 
other non-accrual loans, cash interest receipts are generally 
recorded as revenue.

(1) Corporate loans are placed on non-accrual status based upon a review by Citigroup’s risk officers. Corporate non-accrual loans may still be current on interest 

payments. With limited exceptions, the following practices are applied for consumer loans: consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are placed on 
non-accrual status at 90 days past due and are charged off at 120 days past due; residential mortgage loans are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and 
written down to net realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent with industry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest on credit card loans until such 
loans are charged off, which typically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency. As such, the non-accrual loan disclosures do not include credit card loans. The 
balances above represent non-accrual loans within Corporate loans and Consumer loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

(2) Approximately 61%, 50%, 68%, 52% and 66% of Citi’s corporate non-accrual loans were performing at March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, September 30, 

2022, June 30, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively.

(3) The March 31, 2023 total corporate non-accrual loans represented 0.42% of total corporate loans.
(4)  Asia Consumer includes balances in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.

Modified Loans
On January 1, 2023, Citi adopted ASU 2022-02, which 
eliminated the accounting and disclosure requirements for 
TDRs (see Note 1 for additional information). See Note 13 for 
information on loan modifications during the three months 
ended March 31, 2023.

Note: The amounts shown in the table above are presented on an average basis. For securities, the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be 
realized and, therefore, exclude any securities that are encumbered and incorporate any haircuts applicable under the U.S. LCR rule. The table above incorporates 
various restrictions that could limit the transferability of liquidity between legal entities, including Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.
(1)  Foreign government debt includes securities issued or guaranteed by foreign sovereigns, agencies and multilateral development banks. Foreign government debt 

securities are held largely to support local liquidity requirements and Citi’s local franchises and principally include government bonds from Japan, Mexico, Korea, 
Singapore and India. 

The table above includes average amounts of HQLA held 
at Citigroup’s operating entities that are eligible for inclusion 
in the calculation of Citigroup’s consolidated Liquidity 
Coverage ratio (LCR), pursuant to the U.S. LCR rules. These 
amounts include the HQLA needed to meet the minimum 
requirements at these entities as well as any amounts in excess 
of these minimums that are available to be transferred to other 
entities within Citigroup. Citigroup’s average HQLA 
increased quarter-over-quarter as of the first quarter of 2023, 
primarily driven by an increase in customer-related debt at the 
non-bank entities. 

As of March 31, 2023, Citigroup had approximately 
$1,033 billion of available liquidity resources to support client 
and business needs, including end-of-period HQLA ($588 
billion); additional unencumbered HQLA, including excess 
liquidity held at bank entities that is non-transferable to other 
entities within Citigroup ($252 billion); and unused borrowing 
capacity from available assets not already accounted for within 
Citi’s HQLA to support the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) 
and the Federal Reserve Bank discount window ($193 billion).

Short-Term Liquidity Measurement: Liquidity Coverage 
Ratio (LCR)
In addition to internal 30-day liquidity stress testing performed 
for Citi’s major entities, operating subsidiaries and countries, 
Citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the LCR. The 
table below details the components of Citi’s LCR calculation 
and HQLA in excess of net outflows for the periods indicated:

Note: The amounts are presented on an average basis.

As of March 31, 2023, Citigroup’s average LCR 
increased, from the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The 
increase was primarily driven by the increase in average 
HQLA, primarily driven by the increase in customer-related 
debt at the non-bank entities. 

In addition, considering Citi’s total available liquidity 
resources at quarter end of $1,033 billion, Citi maintained 
approximately $545 billion of excess liquidity above the 
stressed average net outflow of $488 billion, as noted in the 
table above for LCR.

Long-Term Liquidity Measurement: Net Stable Funding 
Ratio (NSFR)
As previously disclosed, the U.S. banking agencies adopted a 
rule to assess the availability of a bank’s stable funding against 
a required level. 

The rule became effective beginning July 1, 2021, while 

public disclosure of the ratio is required to occur on a 
semiannual basis beginning June 30, 2023. Citi was in 
compliance with the rule as of March 31, 2023.

(1) See footnote 2 to the table in “Credit Risk—Consumer Credit—

Consumer Credit Portfolio” above.

Citi’s loan portfolio is well diversified across consumer 
and corporate loans, with an aggregate duration of 1.3 years, 
as a majority of loans are at variable rates.

On an average basis, loans increased 1% year-over-year 
and were largely unchanged sequentially. The year-over-year 
increase was primarily due to growth in PBWM, partially 
offset by a decline in ICG and lower balances in Legacy 
Franchises. PBWM average loans increased 7% year-over-
year, primarily driven by loan growth in cards, mortgages and 
installment lending. ICG average loans decreased 2% year-
over-year, driven by continued strategic actions to manage the 
balance sheet, including trade loan sales. The decline in 
Legacy Franchises primarily reflected the impact of the 
ongoing wind-downs of the remaining businesses, particularly 
Korea, and the reclassification of a portfolio to Other assets to 
reflect held-for-sale accounting in the current quarter. 

End-of-period loans decreased 1% year-over-year, as 

growth in PBWM was more than offset by a decline in ICG 
and Legacy Franchises. End-of-period loans declined 1% 
sequentially.

Citi’s deposit base is spread across a diversified set of 

countries, industries, clients and currencies. 

On an average basis, deposits increased 2% year-over-
year and were up slightly sequentially. The year-over-year 
increase primarily reflected an increase in Corporate/Other 
and ICG, partially offset by a decline in PBWM and Legacy 
Franchises. Corporate/Other average deposits increased $20 
billion year-over-year, primarily driven by the issuance of 
institutional certificates of deposit. ICG average deposits 
increased 3% year-over-year, driven by TTS. PBWM average 
deposits decreased 3% year-over-year, largely reflecting the 
Global Wealth reallocation of deposits to higher-yielding 
investments. The decline in Legacy Franchises was primarily

due to the impact of the ongoing Korea and Russia wind-
downs.

End-of-period deposits were largely unchanged year-over-
year, as a decrease in PBWM, largely reflecting Global Wealth 
clients reallocating deposits to higher-yielding investments on 
the business’s platform, was offset by an increase in 
institutional certificates of deposit in Corporate/Other. End-
of-period deposits decreased 3% sequentially, reflecting 
seasonal activity in TTS and the reallocation of Global Wealth 
clients’ deposits to higher-yielding investments. On a 
sequential basis, end-of-period deposits were down $36 
billion, primarily driven by ICG, largely reflecting seasonal 
client activity.

The majority of Citi’s $1.3 trillion of end-of-period 
deposits are institutional (approximately $819 billion), and 
span 90 countries. A large majority of these institutional 
deposits are within TTS, and of these, approximately 80% are 
from clients that use all three TTS integrated services: 
payments and collections, liquidity management and working 
capital solutions. In addition, nearly 80% of TTS deposits are 
from clients that have a greater than 15-year relationship with 
Citi. Over the past year, TTS deposits grew at a faster rate than 
total Citi deposits on both an average and end-of-period basis. 
Citi also has a strong consumer and wealth deposit base, with 
$437 billion of U.S. Retail banking and Global Wealth 
deposits as of end-of-period, which are diversified across the 
Private bank, Citigold, Retail banking and Wealth at Work. As 
of year-end 2022, approximately 75% of U.S. Citigold clients 
have been with Citi for more than 10 years and approximately 
50% of Private bank ultra-high-net-worth clients have been 
with Citi for more than 10 years. U.S. Personal Banking 
deposits are spread across six core urban centers.

Long-Term Debt 
The weighted-average maturity of unsecured long-term debt 
issued by Citigroup and its affiliates (including Citibank) with 
a remaining life greater than one year was approximately 
7.5 years as of March 31, 2023, compared to 8.5 years as of 
the prior year and 7.6 years as of the prior quarter. The 
weighted-average maturity is calculated based on the 
contractual maturity of each security. For securities that are 
redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the holder, the 
weighted-average maturity is calculated based on the earliest 
date an option becomes exercisable.

Citi’s long-term debt outstanding at the Citigroup parent 

company includes benchmark senior and subordinated debt 
and what Citi refers to as customer-related debt, consisting of 
structured notes, such as equity- and credit-linked notes, as 
well as non-structured notes. Citi’s issuance of customer-
related debt is generally driven by customer demand and 
complements benchmark debt issuance as a source of funding 
for Citi’s non-bank entities. Citi’s long-term debt at the bank 
includes bank notes, FHLB advances and securitizations.

Note: Amounts represent the current value of long-term debt on Citi’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet that, for certain debt instruments, includes 
consideration of fair value, hedging impacts and unamortized discounts and 
premiums.
(1) Non-bank includes long-term debt issued to third parties by the parent 

holding company (Citigroup) and Citi’s non-bank subsidiaries (including 
broker-dealer subsidiaries) that are consolidated into Citigroup. As of 
March 31, 2023, non-bank included $92.9 billion of long-term debt 
issued by Citi’s broker-dealer and other subsidiaries that are 
consolidated into Citigroup. Certain Citigroup consolidated hedging 
activities are also included in this line.

(2) Local country and other includes debt issued by Citi’s affiliates in 
support of their local operations. Within non-bank, certain secured 
financing is also included.

(3) Predominantly credit card securitizations, primarily backed by Branded 

cards receivables.

Citi’s total long-term debt outstanding increased 10% 
year-over-year, largely driven by the issuance of customer-
related debt at the non-bank entities and increased FHLB 
borrowings at the bank. The increase was partially offset by a 
decline in senior benchmark debt at both the bank and non-
bank entities, as well as lower securitizations at the bank. 
Sequentially, long-term debt outstanding increased 3%, largely 
driven by the issuance of customer-related debt at the non-
bank entities. 

As part of its liability management, Citi has considered, 

and may continue to consider, opportunities to redeem or 
repurchase its long-term debt pursuant to open market 
purchases, tender offers or other means. Such redemptions and 
repurchases help reduce Citi’s overall funding costs. During 
the first quarter of 2023, Citi redeemed or repurchased an 
aggregate of approximately $4.8 billion of its outstanding 
long-term debt.

Secured Funding Transactions and Short-Term 
Borrowings
Citi supplements its primary sources of funding with short-
term financings that generally include (i) secured funding 
transactions consisting of securities loaned or sold under 
agreements to repurchase, i.e., repos, and (ii) to a lesser extent, 
short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper and 
borrowings from the FHLB and other market participants. 

Short-Term Borrowings
Citi’s short-term borrowings of $40 billion as of the first 
quarter of 2023 increased 33% year-over-year, reflecting an 
increase in FHLB advances and commercial paper issuance. 
Short-term borrowings decreased 15% sequentially, reflecting 
a decline in outstanding FHLB advances (see Note 17 for 
further information on Citigroup’s and its affiliates’ 
outstanding short-term borrowings).

Secured Funding Transactions
Secured funding is primarily accessed through Citi’s broker-
dealer subsidiaries, with a smaller portion executed through 
Citi’s bank entities to efficiently fund both (i) secured lending 
activity and (ii) a portion of the securities inventory held in the 
context of market making and customer activities. Secured 
funding transactions are predominantly collateralized by 
government debt securities. Generally, changes in the level of 
Citi’s secured funding are primarily due to fluctuations in 
secured lending activity in the matched book (as described 
below) and changes in securities inventory. In order to 
maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market 
conditions, Citi manages risks related to its secured funding by 
establishing secured funding limits and conducting daily stress 
tests that account for risks related to capacity, tenor, haircut, 
collateral type, counterparty and client actions. 

Secured funding of $258 billion as of March 31, 2023 

increased 26% year-over-year and 27% sequentially, largely 
driven by additional financing to support increases in trading-
related assets within Citi’s broker-dealer subsidiaries. As of 
the quarter ended March 31, 2023, on an average basis, 
secured funding was $224 billion. The portion of secured 
funding in the broker-dealer subsidiaries that funds secured 
lending is commonly referred to as “matched book” activity 
and is primarily secured by high-quality liquid securities such 
as U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities and foreign 
government debt securities. Other “matched book” activity is 
secured by less liquid securities, including equity securities, 
corporate bonds and asset-backed securities, the tenor of 
which is generally equal to or longer than the tenor of the 
corresponding assets. As indicated above, the remaining 
portion of secured funding is used to fund securities inventory 
held in the context of market making and customer activities.

Credit Ratings
The table below shows the ratings for Citigroup and Citibank 
as of March 31, 2023. While not included in the table below, 
the long-term and short-term ratings of Citigroup Global 
Markets Holdings Inc. (CGMHI) were A+/F1 at Fitch, A2/P-1 
at Moody’s Investors Service and A/A-1 at S&P Global 
Ratings as of March 31, 2023.

Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades
Ratings downgrades by Fitch, Moody’s or S&P could 
negatively impact Citigroup’s and/or Citibank’s funding and 
liquidity due to reduced funding capacity, including derivative 
triggers, which could take the form of cash obligations and 
collateral requirements.

For additional information on the impact of credit rating 

changes on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see “Risk 
Factors—Liquidity Risks” and “Credit Ratings” in Citi’s 2022 
Form 10-K.

Citigroup Inc. and Citibank—Potential Derivative Triggers
As of March 31, 2023, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-
notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of 
Citigroup Inc. across all three major rating agencies could 
impact Citigroup’s funding and liquidity due to derivative 
triggers by approximately $0.3 billion, compared to $0.5 
billion as of December 31, 2022. Other funding sources, such 
as secured financing transactions and other margin 
requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could 
also be adversely affected.

As of March 31, 2023, Citi estimates that a hypothetical 
one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of 
Citibank across all three major rating agencies could impact 
Citibank’s funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by 
approximately $0.3 billion, compared to $0.4 billion as of 
December 31, 2022. Other funding sources, such as secured 
funding transactions and other margin requirements, for which 
there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely 
impacted.

In total, as of March 31, 2023, Citi estimates that a one-

notch downgrade of Citigroup Inc. and Citibank across all 
three major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate 
cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately 
$0.6 billion, compared to $0.9 billion as of December 31, 
2022 (see also Note 20). As detailed under “High-Quality 
Liquid Assets (HQLA)” above, Citigroup has various liquidity 
resources available to its bank and non-bank entities in part as 
a contingency for the potential events described above.

Citibank—Additional Potential Impacts
In addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a 
potential downgrade of Citibank’s senior debt/long-term rating 
across any of the three major rating agencies could also have 
an adverse impact on the commercial paper/short-term rating 
of Citibank. Citibank has provided liquidity commitments to 
consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits, 
primarily in the form of asset purchase agreements. As of 
March 31, 2023, Citibank had liquidity commitments of 
approximately $10.9 billion to consolidated asset-backed 
commercial paper conduits, compared to $11.0 billion as of 
December 31, 2022 (see Note 19 for additional information).
In addition to the above-referenced liquidity resources of 

certain Citibank entities, Citibank could reduce the funding 
and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades 
described above through mitigating actions, including 
repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial 
paper conduits. In the event of the potential downgrades 
described above, Citi believes that certain corporate customers 
could reevaluate their deposit relationships with Citibank. This 
reevaluation could result in clients adjusting their 
discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository 
institution, which could potentially reduce certain deposit 
levels at Citibank. However, Citi could choose to adjust 
pricing, offer alternative deposit products to its existing 
customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers, in 
addition to the mitigating actions referenced above.

58

 
In addition, Citi uses multiple metrics to measure its 
Banking Book interest rate risk. Interest Rate Exposure (IRE) 
is a key metric that analyzes the impact of a range of scenarios 
on Citi’s Banking Book net interest income and certain other 
interest rate-sensitive income versus a base case. IRE does not 
represent a forecast of Citi’s net interest income.

The scenarios, methodologies and assumptions used in 

this analysis are periodically evaluated and enhanced in 
response to changes in the market environment, changes in 
Citi’s balance sheet composition, enhancements in Citi’s 
modeling and other factors.

Since the third quarter of 2022, Citi has employed 

enhanced IRE methodologies and changes to certain 
assumptions. The changes included, among other things, 
assumptions around the projected balance sheet and revisions 
to the treatment of certain business contributions (notably 
accrual positions in ICG’s Markets businesses). These changes 
resulted in a higher impact to Citi’s net interest income over a 
12-month period.

Under the enhanced methodology, Citi utilizes the most 
recent quarter-end balance sheet, assuming no changes to its 
composition and size over the forecasted horizon (holding the 
balance sheet static). The forecasts incorporate expectations 
and assumptions of deposit pricing, loan spreads and mortgage 
prepayment behavior implied by the interest rate curves in 
each scenario. The base case scenario reflects the market 
implied forward interest rates, and sensitivity scenarios 
assume instantaneous shocks to the base case. The forecasts do 
not assume Citi takes any risk-mitigating actions in response 
to changes in the interest rate environment. Certain interest 
rates are subject to flooring assumptions in downward rate 
scenarios. Deposit pricing sensitivities (i.e., deposit betas), are 
informed by historical and expected behavior. Actual deposit 
pricing could differ from the assumptions used in these 
forecasts.

Citi’s IRE analysis primarily reflects the impacts from the 

following Banking Book assets and liabilities: loans, client 
deposits, Citi’s deposits with other banks, investment 
securities, long-term debt, any related interest rate hedges and 
the funds transfer pricing of positions in total trading and 
credit portfolio value at risk (VAR). It excludes impacts from 
any positions that are included in total trading and credit 
portfolio VAR.

MARKET RISK

Market risk arises from both Citi’s trading and non-trading 
portfolios. For additional information on market risk and 
market risk management at Citi, see “Market Risk—
Overview” and “Risk Factors” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

Market Risk of Non-Trading Portfolios
Market risk from non-trading portfolios stems predominantly 
from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and 
foreign exchange rates on Citi’s net interest income and on 
Citi’s Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) 
from its investment securities portfolios. Market risk from 
non-trading portfolios also includes the potential impact of 
changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital invested in 
foreign currencies.

Banking Book Interest Rate Risk 
For interest rate risk purposes, Citi’s non-trading portfolios are 
referred to as the Banking Book. Management of interest rate 
risk in the Banking Book is governed by Citi’s Non-Trading 
Market Risk Policy. Management’s Asset & Liability 
Committee (ALCO) establishes Citi’s risk appetite and related 
limits for interest rate risk in the Banking Book, which are 
subject to approval by Citigroup’s Board of Directors. 
Corporate Treasury is responsible for the day-to-day 
management of Citi’s Banking Book interest rate risk as well 
as periodically reviewing it with the ALCO. Citi’s Banking 
Book interest rate risk management is also subject to 
independent oversight from the second line of defense team 
reporting to the Chief Risk Officer.

Changes in interest rates impact Citi’s net income, AOCI 

and CET1. These changes primarily affect Citi’s Banking 
Book through net interest income, due to a variety of risk 
factors, including:

•

•
•

•

Differences in timing and amounts of the maturity or 
repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet 
instruments;
Changes in the level and/or shape of interest rate curves;
Client behavior in response to changes in interest rates 
(e.g., mortgage prepayments, deposit betas); and
Changes in the maturity of instruments resulting from 
changes in the interest rate environment.

As part of their ongoing activities, Citi’s businesses generate 
interest rate-sensitive positions from their client-facing 
products, such as loans and deposits. The component of this 
interest rate risk that can be hedged is transferred via Citi’s 
funds transfer pricing process to Corporate Treasury. 
Corporate Treasury uses various tools to manage the total 
interest rate risk position within the established risk appetite 
and target Citi’s desired risk profile, including its investment 
securities portfolio, company-issued debt and interest rate 
derivatives. 

59

 Interest Rate Risk of Investment Portfolios—Impact on 
AOCI
Citi also measures the potential impacts of changes in interest 
rates on the value of its AOCI, which can in turn impact Citi’s 
common equity and tangible common equity. This will impact 
Citi’s CET1 and other regulatory capital ratios. Citi seeks to 
manage its exposure to changes in the market level of interest 
rates, while limiting the potential impact on its AOCI and 
regulatory capital position.

Citi uses 100 basis point (bps) shocks in each scenario to 

reflect its net interest income sensitivity to unanticipated 
changes in market interest rates, as potential monetary policy 
decisions and changes in economic conditions may be 
reflected in current market implied forward rates. The

Citi’s balance sheet is asset sensitive (assets reprice faster 

than liabilities), resulting in higher net interest income in 
increasing interest rate scenarios. The estimated impact to 
Citi’s net interest income in a 100 bps upward rate shock 
scenario as of the first quarter of 2023 decreased modestly 
quarter-over-quarter and decreased year-over-year. At 
progressively higher interest rate levels, the marginal net 
interest income benefit is lower, as Citi assumes it will pass on 
a larger share of rate changes to depositors (i.e., higher betas), 
further reducing Citi’s IRE sensitivity. Currency-specific 
interest rate changes and balance sheet factors may drive 
quarter-to-quarter volatility in Citi’s estimated IRE.

In a 100 bps upward rate shock scenario, Citi expects that 

the approximate $1.6 billion initial negative impact to AOCI 
could potentially be offset in shareholders’ equity through the 
expected recovery of the impact on AOCI through accretion of 
Citi’s investment portfolio and expected net interest income 
benefit over a period of approximately six months.

Scenario Analysis
The following table presents the estimated impact to Citi’s net 
interest income, AOCI and CET1 Capital ratio (on a fully 
implemented basis) under five different scenarios of changes 
in interest rate for the U.S. dollar and all other currencies in 
which Citi has invested capital as of March 31, 2023. The rate 
scenarios are also impacted by convexity related to mortgage 
products.

Note: Each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur instantaneously. Changes in interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and the 10-year rate are 
interpolated. 
(1)

Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.

As shown in the table above, the estimated impact to 
Citi’s net interest income is larger under Scenario 2 than 
Scenario 3, as Citi’s Banking Book has relatively higher 
interest rate exposure to the short end of the yield curve. For 
U.S. dollars, exposure to downward parallel rate shocks is 
larger in magnitude than to upward rate shocks. This is 
because of the lower benefit to net interest income from Citi’s 
deposit base at higher rate levels, as well as the prepayment 
effects on mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. For 
other currencies, exposure to downward rate shocks is smaller 
in magnitude as a result of Citi’s flooring assumption, given 
low rate levels for certain non-U.S. dollar currencies.

The magnitude of the impact to AOCI is greater under 

Scenario 2 compared to Scenario 3. This is because the 
combination of changes to Citi’s investment portfolio, 
partially offset by changes related to Citi’s pension liabilities, 
results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at 
shorter- and intermediate-term maturities.

Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates—Impacts on AOCI 
and Capital
As of March 31, 2023, Citi estimates that an unanticipated 
parallel instantaneous 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar 
against all of the other currencies in which Citi has invested 
capital could reduce Citi’s tangible common equity (TCE) by 
approximately $1.6 billion, or 0.91%, as a result of changes to 
Citi’s CTA in AOCI, net of hedges. This impact would be 
primarily due to changes in the value of the Mexican peso, 
Euro and Indian rupee.

This impact is also before any mitigating actions Citi may 

take, including ongoing management of its foreign currency 
translation exposure. Specifically, as currency movements 
change the value of Citi’s net investments in foreign currency-
denominated capital, these movements also change the value 
of Citi’s risk-weighted assets denominated in those currencies.

Change in FX spot rate(1)
Change in TCE due to FX translation, net of hedges

As a percentage of TCE

Estimated impact to CET1 Capital ratio (on a fully implemented basis) 
due to changes in FX translation, net of hedges (bps)

This, coupled with Citi’s foreign currency hedging strategies, 
such as foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency 
forwards and other currency hedging instruments, lessens the 
impact of foreign currency movements on Citi’s CET1 Capital 
ratio. Changes in these hedging strategies, as well as hedging 
costs, divestitures and tax impacts, can further affect the actual 
impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital 
compared to an unanticipated parallel shock, as described 
above.

The effect of Citi’s ongoing management strategies with 

respect to quarterly changes in foreign exchange rates, and the 
quarterly impact of these changes on Citi’s TCE and CET1 
Capital ratio, are shown in the table below. See Note 18 for 
additional information on the changes in AOCI.

Interest revenue and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments primarily related to the tax-exempt bond portfolio and certain tax-advantaged 
loan programs (based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%) of $44 million, $33 million and $42 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, 
December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively. 
Interest expense associated with certain hybrid financial instruments, which are classified as Long-term debt and accounted for at fair value, is reported together 
with any changes in fair value as part of Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income and is therefore not reflected in Interest expense in the 
table above.

(3) The average rate on interest revenue and net interest margin reflects the taxable equivalent gross-up adjustment. See footnote 1 above.
(4) Citi’s NIM is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets.

Interest revenue and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments discussed in the table above.

Citi’s net interest income in the first quarter of 2023 
increased 23% to $13.4 billion versus the prior-year period. As 
presented in the table above, Citi’s net interest income on a 
taxable equivalent basis also increased 23% year-over-year, or 
$2.5 billion. The increase was driven by higher net interest 
income in non-ICG Markets, which increased 21%, and ICG 
Markets, which increased 34%. The increase in net interest 
income in non-ICG Markets primarily reflected higher interest 
rates, growth in U.S. Cards interest-earning balances and 
higher income from Citi’s investment portfolio, partially offset 
by the impact of the closed exit markets and wind-downs in 
Legacy Franchises. The increase in ICG Markets net interest 
income largely reflected a change in the mix of trading 
positions in support of client activity.

Citi’s net interest margin was 2.41% on a taxable 
equivalent basis in the first quarter of 2023, an increase of 2 
basis points from the prior quarter, primarily driven by the 
impact of higher interest rates and growth in U.S. Cards 
interest-earning balances, partially offset by lower deposit 
spreads in Services.

Market Risk of Trading Portfolios

Value at Risk (VAR)
Citi believes its VAR model is conservatively calibrated to incorporate fat-tail scaling and the greater of short-term (approximately the 
most recent month) and long-term (18 months for commodities and three years for others) market volatility. As of March 31, 2023, 
Citi estimates that the conservative features of the VAR calibration contribute an approximate 65% add-on to what would be a VAR 
estimated under the assumption of stable and perfectly, normally distributed markets. As of December 31, 2022, the add-on was 46%.
As presented in the table below, Citi’s average trading VAR for the first quarter of 2023 decreased modestly quarter-over-quarter, 

mainly due to lower market volatility earlier in the current quarter. As of March 31, 2023, VAR included updates to the market 
historical data series to reflect increased March volatility in the rates markets.

(1)  Covariance adjustment (also known as diversification benefit) equals the difference between the total VAR and the sum of the VARs tied to each risk type. The 
benefit reflects the fact that the risks within individual and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VAR on a given day will be 
lower than the sum of the VARs relating to each risk type. The determination of the primary drivers of changes to the covariance adjustment is made by an 
examination of the impact of both model parameter and position changes.

(2)  The total trading VAR includes mark-to-market and certain fair value option trading positions in ICG, with the exception of hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value 

option loans and all CVA exposures. Available-for-sale and accrual exposures are not included.

(3)  The specific risk-only component represents the level of equity and fixed income issuer-specific risk embedded in VAR. 
(4)  The credit portfolio is composed of mark-to-market positions associated with non-trading business units, with the CVA relating to derivative counterparties and all 

associated CVA hedges. FVA and DVA are not included. The credit portfolio also includes hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value option loans and hedges to the 
leveraged finance pipeline within capital markets origination in ICG.

Regulatory VAR Back-testing
In accordance with Basel III, Citi is required to perform back-
testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR 
model. Regulatory VAR back-testing is the process in which 
the daily one-day VAR, at a 99% confidence interval, is 
compared to the buy-and-hold profit and loss (i.e., the profit 
and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of 
the day and re-priced the following day). Buy-and-hold profit 
and loss represents the daily mark-to-market profit and loss 
attributable to price movements in covered positions from the 
close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and 
loss excludes realized trading revenue, net interest, fees and 
commissions, intra-day trading profit and loss and changes in 
reserves.

Based on a 99% confidence level, Citi would expect two 

to three days in any one year where buy-and-hold losses 
exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the conservative 
calibration of Citi’s VAR model (as a result of taking the 
greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-tail scaling 
of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer exceptions under 
normal and stable market conditions. Periods of unstable 
market conditions could increase the number of back-testing 
exceptions.

As of March 31, 2023, there were two back-testing 
exceptions observed for Citi’s Regulatory VAR in the last 12 
months.

 OTHER RISKS
For additional information regarding other risks, including 
Citi’s management of other risks, see “Managing Global Risk
—Other Risks” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

LIBOR Transition Risk 
On April 3, 2023, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority 
announced its decision to require the LIBOR administrator, 
ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (IBA), to continue 
the publication of one-, three- and six-month USD LIBOR 
after June 30, 2023 using an unrepresentative synthetic 
methodology. The synthetic USD LIBOR rates are expected to 
cease on September 30, 2024. The publication of synthetic 
USD LIBOR would provide additional time for certain USD 
LIBOR contracts to be remediated or mature.

During April 2023, certain central counterparties (CCPs) 

completed conversions of certain USD LIBOR-cleared 
derivatives to alternative reference rate positions, with the 
remaining cleared derivative conversions expected to be 
completed in May 2023. In addition, on February 27, 2023, 
Citi provided notice that, after the June 30, 2023 cessation 
date, the relevant USD LIBOR rate for certain debt securities, 
certificates of deposit, preferred stock, asset-backed securities 
and trust preferred securities issued by Citigroup Inc. and 
certain of its consolidated subsidiaries is planned to be 
replaced with the CME Term SOFR Reference Rate published 
for the one-, three- or six-month tenor corresponding to the 
relevant USD LIBOR rate as administered by CME Group 
Benchmark Administration, Ltd., plus a tenor spread 
adjustment. 

For additional information about Citi’s actions to address 

a transition away from and discontinuance of LIBOR, see 
“Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—LIBOR Transition 
Risk” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K. For information about Citi’s 
LIBOR transition risks, see “Risk Factors—Other Risks” in 
the 2022 Form 10-K.

Country Risk

Top 25 Country Exposures
The following table presents Citi’s top 25 exposures by 
country (excluding the U.S.) as of March 31, 2023. (Including 
the U.S., the total exposure as of March 31, 2023 to the top 25 
countries would represent approximately 98% of Citi’s 
exposure to all countries.)

For purposes of the table, loan amounts are reflected in 
the country where the loan is booked, which is generally based 
on the domicile of the borrower. For example, a loan to a 
Chinese subsidiary of a Switzerland-based corporation will 
generally be categorized as a loan in China. In addition, Citi 
has developed regional booking centers in certain countries, 

most significantly in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland, 
in order to more efficiently serve its corporate customers. As 
an example, with respect to the U.K., only 39% of corporate 
loans presented in the table below are to U.K. domiciled 
entities (40% for unfunded commitments), with the balance of 
the loans predominately to European domiciled counterparties. 
Approximately 89% of the total U.K. funded loans and 89% of 
the total U.K. unfunded commitments were investment grade 
as of March 31, 2023. 

Trading account assets and investment securities are 
generally categorized based on the domicile of the issuer of 
the security of the underlying reference entity. For additional 
information on the assets included in the table, see the 
footnotes to the table below.

Russia 

Introduction
In Russia, Citi’s remaining operations are conducted through 
both its ICG and Legacy Franchises segments. 

As part of previously disclosed plans, Citi has ended 
nearly all of the institutional banking services it offered in 
Russia as of March 31, 2023, with the remaining services only 
those necessary to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory 
obligations. In addition, Citi continues to wind down its 
consumer and local commercial banking businesses. Citi has 
ceased soliciting any new business or new clients in Russia. 
Citi will continue to manage its existing legal and regulatory 
commitments and obligations, as well as support its 
employees, during this period. For additional information, see 
“Citi’s Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations” below.

Citi continues to monitor the war in Ukraine, related 
sanctions and economic conditions and continues to mitigate 
its Russia exposures and risks as appropriate. 

For additional information about Citi’s risks related to its 
Russia exposures, see “Forward-Looking Statements” below 
and “Risk Factors—Market-Related Risk,” “—Operational 
Risks” and “—Other Risks” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

Impact of Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine on Citi’s Businesses

Russia-related Balance Sheet Exposures 
Citi’s remaining domestic operations in Russia are conducted 
through a subsidiary of Citibank, AO Citibank, which uses the 
Russian ruble as its functional currency.

Investment securities include debt securities AFS, recorded at fair market value, primarily local government debt securities. 

(1) 
(2)  Net MTM on OTC derivatives and securities lending/borrowing transactions (repos). Effective from 2Q22, reverse repurchase agreements have been shown gross 
of collateral and reclassified to net MTM on derivatives/repos in the table above, as netting of collateral for Russia-related reverse repurchase agreements was 
removed. This removal was due to the inability to conclude, with a well-founded basis, the enforceability of contractual rights in the Russian legal system in the 
event of a counterparty default, given the geopolitical uncertainty caused by the war in Ukraine. As this exposure was already included in Total third-party 
exposure, the Total Russia exposure was not impacted by this reclassification.

(3)  Unfunded exposure consists of unfunded corporate lending commitments, letters of credit and other contingencies. 
(4)  Cash on deposit and placements are primarily with the Central Bank of Russia.
(5)  Represents dividends received by Citi in its role as custodian for investor clients in Russia, which Citi is required by local regulation to hold at the Depository. Citi 

is unable to remit these funds to clients due to restrictions imposed by the Russian government.

(6)  The majority of AO Citibank’s third-party exposures was funded with the dividends under footnote 5 and domestic deposit liabilities from both corporate and 

personal banking clients.

(7)  Citigroup’s CTA loss included in its AOCI related to its indirect subsidiary, AO Citibank, is excluded from the above table, because the CTA loss is not held in 

AO Citibank and would be recognized in Citigroup’s earnings only upon either the substantial liquidation or a loss of control of AO Citibank. Citi has separately 
described these risks in “Deconsolidation Risk” below.

73

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During the first quarter of 2023, Citi continued to reduce 

its operations in Russia and Russia-related exposures, resulting 
in a net decrease in total Russia exposure of $1.4 billion, as 
shown in the table above, as well as a change in the 
composition of its exposure as mitigation efforts have reduced 
Citi’s third-party credit risk (see discussion below). The 
sequential decline in exposure was driven by (i) a $0.5 billion 
decrease due to depreciation of the ruble against the U.S. 
dollar, (ii) decreases in local currency terms of a $1.3 billion 
reduction in deposits held within the Central Bank of Russia 
driven by client deposit withdrawals, (iii) a $0.2 billion 
decrease due to loan repayments and sales, (iv) a $0.3 billion 
reduction in reverse repo balances and (v) a $0.1 billion 
reduction of third-party cross-border exposures. The decline in 
exposure was partially offset by an increase of $1.0 billion in 
exposure in local currency terms, driven by $1.3 billion of 
dividends received by Citi as custodian for investor clients in 
Russia that Citi was unable to remit due to regulatory 
restrictions, partially offset by payments to clients and tax 
authorities. The decline in overall exposure was also driven by 
a modest reduction in exposures to Russian counterparties not 
held by AO Citibank.

Citi’s continued risk mitigation efforts have included ICG 

borrower paydowns and limiting extensions of new credit. 
ICG’s credit exposure also reflected a shift to a higher 
proportion of stronger credit names, including a higher 
proportion of subsidiaries of multinational companies that are 
headquartered outside of Russia, primarily in the U.S. and 
Europe. 

Citi’s net investment in Russia was approximately $1.2 
billion as of March 31, 2023 (unchanged from December 31, 
2022). Citi hedges its ruble/USD spot FX exposure in AOCI 
through the purchase of FX derivatives. The ongoing mark-to-
market of the hedging derivatives is also reported in AOCI. 
When the ruble depreciates against the USD, the USD 
equivalent value of Citigroup’s investment in AO Citibank 
also declines. This change in value is offset by the change in 
value of the hedging instrument (FX derivative). Going 
forward, Citi may record devaluations on its net ruble-
denominated assets in earnings, without the benefit from a 
change in the fair value of derivative positions used to 
economically hedge the exposures. 

Earnings and Other Impacts on Citi’s Businesses
Citi’s ICG, PBWM and Legacy Franchises segments and 
Corporate/Other have been impacted by various 
macroeconomic factors and volatilities, including Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine and its direct and indirect impact on the 
European and global economies. For a broader discussion of 
these factors and volatilities on Citi’s businesses, see 
“Executive Summary” and each business’s results of 
operations above. 

As of March 31, 2023, Citigroup’s ACL included a $0.2 
billion remaining credit reserve for Citi’s direct and indirect 
Russian counterparties (compared to $0.3 billion at December 
31, 2022).

Citi’s Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations
In August 2022, Citi disclosed its decision to wind down its 
Russia consumer, local commercial and institutional banking 
businesses, including actively pursuing portfolio sales. In 
connection with this wind-down, Citi expects to incur 
approximately $210 million in total estimated charges ($60 
million in ICG and $150 million in Legacy Franchises, 
excluding the impact from any portfolio sales), largely driven 
by restructuring, vendor termination fees and other related 
charges. Citi’s referral agreement with a Russian bank for a 
portfolio of ruble-denominated credit card loans, subject to 
customer consents, can be terminated under certain 
circumstances and is being reevaluated as Citi reviews other 
alternatives. As a result, the credit card loans will remain held-
for-investment and are not transferred to held-for-sale. For 
additional information about Citi’s continued efforts to reduce 
its operations and exposure in Russia, see Note 2 and “Risk 
Factors” and “Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—Country 
Risk—Russia” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

Deconsolidation Risk
Citi’s remaining operations in Russia subject it to various 
risks, including, among others, foreign currency volatility, 
including appreciation or devaluation; restrictions arising from 
retaliatory Russian laws and regulations on the conduct of its 
business; sanctions or asset freezes; or other deconsolidation 
events (for additional information, see “Risk Factors—Other 
Risks” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K). Examples of triggers that 
may result in deconsolidation of AO Citibank include 
voluntary or forced sale of ownership or loss of control due to 
actions of relevant governmental authorities, including 
expropriation (i.e., the entity becomes subject to the complete 
control of a government, court, administrator, trustee or 
regulator); revocation of banking license; and loss of ability to 
elect a board of directors or appoint members of senior 
management. As of March 31, 2023, Citi continued to 
consolidate AO Citibank because none of the deconsolidation 
factors were triggered.

In the event Citi deems there is a loss of control, for 
example, through expropriation of AO Citibank Russia, Citi’s 
foreign entity in Russia, Citi would be required to (i) write off 
the net investment of approximately $1.2 billion (unchanged 
from December 31, 2022), (ii) recognize a CTA loss of 
approximately $1.4 billion (compared to $1.3 billion as of 
December 31, 2022) through earnings and (iii) recognize a 
loss of $0.4 billion (compared to $0.5 billion as of December 
31, 2022) on intercompany liabilities owed by AO Citibank to 
other Citi entities outside Russia. In the sole event of a 
substantial liquidation, as opposed to a loss of control, Citi 
would be required to recognize the CTA loss of approximately 
$1.4 billion through earnings and would evaluate its remaining 
net investment as circumstances evolve.

Citi as Paying Agent for Russian-related Clients
Citi serves or served as paying agent on bonds issued by 
various entities in Russia, including Russian corporate clients. 
Citi’s role as paying agent is administrative. In this role, Citi 
acts as an agent of its client, the bond issuer, receiving interest 
and principal payments from the bond issuer and then making 
payments to international central securities depositories (e.g., 

74

Depository Trust Company, Euroclear, Clearstream). The 
international central securities depositories (ICSDs) make 
payments to those participants or account holders (e.g., broker/
dealers) that have clients who are investors in the applicable 
bonds (i.e., bondholders). As a paying agent, Citi generally 
does not have information about the identity of the 
bondholders. Citi may be exposed to risks due to its 
responsibilities for receiving and processing payments on 
behalf of its clients as a result of sanctions or other 
governmental requirements and prohibitions. To mitigate 
operational and sanctions risks, Citi has established policies, 
procedures and controls for client relationships and payment 
processing to help ensure compliance with U.S., U.K., EU and 
other jurisdictions’ sanctions laws.

These processes may require Citi to delay or withhold the 

processing of payments as a result of sanctions on the bond 
issuer. Citi is also prevented from making payments to 
accounts on behalf of bondholders should the ICSDs disclose 
to Citi the presence of sanctioned bondholders. In both 
instances, Citi is generally required to segregate, restrict or 
block the funds until applicable sanctions are lifted or the 
payment is otherwise authorized under applicable law.

Reputational Risks
Citi has continued its efforts to enhance and protect its 
reputation with its colleagues, clients, customers, investors, 
regulators and the public. Citi’s response to the war in 
Ukraine, including any action or inaction, may have a negative 
impact on Citi’s reputation with some or all of these parties.
For example, Citi is exposed to reputational risk as a 
result of its current presence in Russia and association with 
Russian individuals or entities, whether subject to sanctions or 
not, including Citi’s inability to support its global clients in 
Russia, which could adversely affect its broader client 
relationships and businesses; current involvement in 
transactions or supporting activities involving Russian assets 
or interests; failure to correctly interpret and apply laws and 
regulations, including those related to sanctions; perceived 
misalignment of Citi’s actions to its stated strategy in Russia; 
and the reputational impact from Citi’s activity and 
engagement with Ukraine or with non-Russian clients exiting 
their Russia businesses. Citi has considered the potential for 
reputation risk and taken actions to mitigate such risks. Citi 
established a Russia Special Review Process with 
management’s Reputation Risk Committee with oversight for 
significant Russia-related reputation risks and completed a 
number of reputation risk reviews of matters with a Russian 
nexus.

While Citi announced its intention to wind down its 
businesses in Russia, Citi will continue to manage those 
operations during the wind-down process and will be required 
to maintain certain limited operations to fulfill its remaining 
legal and regulatory obligations. Also, sanctions and sanctions 
compliance are highly complex and may change over time and 
result in increased operational risk. Failure to fully comply 
with relevant sanctions or the application of sanctions where 
they should not be applied may negatively impact Citi’s 
reputation. In addition, Citi currently performs services for, 
conducts business with or deals in non-sanctioned Russian-
owned businesses and Russian assets. This has attracted, and 

75

will likely continue to attract, negative attention, despite the 
previously disclosed plan to wind down nearly all its activities 
in the country, cessation of new business and client 
originations, and reduction of other exposures.

Citi’s continued presence or divestiture of businesses in 

Russia could also increase its susceptibility to cyberattacks 
that could negatively impact its relationships with clients and 
customers, harm its reputation, increase its compliance costs 
and adversely affect its business operations and results of 
operations. For additional information on operational and 
cyber risks, see “Risk Factors—Operational Risk” in Citi’s 
2022 Form 10-K.

Board’s Role in Overseeing Related Risks
The Citi Board of Directors (Board) and the Board’s Risk 
Management Committee (RMC) and its other Committees 
have received and continue to receive regular reports from 
senior management regarding the war in Ukraine and its 
impact on Citi’s operations in Russia, Ukraine and elsewhere, 
as well as the war’s broader geopolitical, macroeconomic and 
reputational impacts. In addition to receiving regular briefings 
from management, the full Board has routinely been invited to 
attend portions of the RMC meetings for discussions related to 
the war in Ukraine, including with respect to Citi’s risk 
exposures and stress testing. The reports to the Board and its 
Committees from senior management who represent the 
impacted businesses and the EMEA region, Independent Risk 
Management, Finance, Independent Compliance Risk 
Management, including those individuals responsible for 
sanctions compliance, and Human Resources, have included 
detailed information regarding financial impacts, impacts on 
capital, cybersecurity, strategic considerations, sanctions 
compliance, employee assistance and reputational risks, 
enabling the Board and its Committees to properly exercise 
their oversight responsibilities. In addition, senior 
management has also provided updates to Citi’s Executive 
Management Team and the Board, outside of formal meetings, 
regarding Citi’s Russia-related risks, including with respect to 
cybersecurity matters.

Ukraine
Citi has continued to operate in Ukraine throughout the war 
through its ICG businesses, serving the local subsidiaries of 
multinationals, along with local financial institutions and the 
public sector. Citi employs approximately 230 people in 
Ukraine and their safety is Citi’s top priority. All of Citi’s 
domestic operations in Ukraine are conducted through a 
subsidiary of Citibank, which uses the Ukrainian hryvnia as its 
functional currency. Citi’s exposures in Ukraine are not 
significant enough to be included in the “Top 25 Country 
Exposures” table above. As of March 31, 2023, Citi had $1.2 
billion of direct exposures related to Ukraine, compared to 
$1.0 billion as of December 31, 2022. The increase in 
exposures reflected a $0.3 billion increase in deposits, partially 
offset by a $0.1 billion decrease in loans.
