Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Executive Summary 

Overview of Financial Results 

Consolidated Results&#8212;Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 

&#8226; The Firm reported net revenues of $15.1 billion and net income of $3.4 billion with strong contributions across each of our businesses. 

&#8226; The Firm delivered ROE of 14.5% and ROTCE of 19.7% (see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein). 

&#8226; The Firm&#8217;s expense efficiency ratio was 71% demonstrating operating leverage in an improving market environment. 

&#8226; At March 31, 2024, the Firm&#8217;s Standardized Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 15.0%. 

&#8226; Institutional Securities net revenues of $7.0 billion reflect strong performance across the broad franchise, with particular strength in Equity as well as underwriting revenues, partially offset by lower results in Advisory. 

&#8226; Wealth Management delivered a pre-tax margin of 26.3%. Net revenues were $6.9 billion on higher asset management revenues driven by the positive market environment. Net new assets for the quarter were $95 billion. 

&#8226; Investment Management results reflect net revenues of $1.4 billion on higher average AUM of $1.5 trillion. The quarter included positive long-term net flows of $7.6 billion.

Earnings per Diluted Common Share 

We reported net revenues of $15.1 billion in the quarter ended March 31, 2024 (&#8220;current quarter,&#8221; or &#8220;1Q 2024&#8221;), which increased by 4% compared with $14.5 billion in the quarter ended March 31, 2023 (&#8220;prior year quarter,&#8221; or &#8220;1Q 2023&#8221;). For the current quarter, net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $3.4 billion, or $2.02 per diluted common share, which increased by 14%, or 19% compared with $3.0 billion, or $1.70 per diluted common share in the prior year quarter. 

Non-interest Expenses 

($ in millions) 

March 2024 Form 10-Q 5 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses of $6,696 million in the current quarter increased 4% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to an increase in the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives driven by higher compensable revenues and higher discretionary incentive compensation, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense in the prior year quarter. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses of $4,051 million in the current quarter decreased 2% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by lower legal and professional services expenses and lower marketing and business development costs, partially offset by an increased technology spend, an incremental FDIC special assessment cost of $42 million and higher execution-related expenses. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments was a net release of $6 million, primarily as a result of improvements in the macroeconomic outlook. This was partially offset by provisions for certain specific commercial real estate and corporate loans and modest growth in certain other loan portfolios. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments in the prior year quarter was $234 million, primarily related to a deterioration in both the macroeconomic outlook and the commercial real estate portfolio. 

For further information on the Provision for credit losses, see &#8220;Credit Risk&#8221; herein.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis

&#8226; Asia net revenues in the current quarter decreased 12% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by lower results from Fixed income and Equity within the Institutional Securities business segment.

Economic and Market Conditions 

The market environment continued to improve in the first quarter of 2024, despite heightened geopolitical risks, continued inflationary concerns and uncertainty regarding the future path of interest rates, which have remained persistently high relative to recent years. The timing and pace of interest rate changes remain unknown and could impact capital markets in 2024. The market environment impacted our businesses, as discussed further in &#8220;Business Segments&#8221; herein, and, to the extent that it continues to remain uncertain, could adversely impact client confidence and related activity. 

For more information on economic and market conditions, and the potential effects of geopolitical events and acts of war or aggression on our future results, refer to &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; in the 2023 Form 10-K. 

Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information 

We prepare our financial statements using U.S. GAAP. From time to time, we may disclose certain &#8220;non-GAAP financial measures&#8221; in this document or in the course of our earnings releases, earnings and other conference calls, financial presentations, definitive proxy statements and other public disclosures. A &#8220;non-GAAP financial measure&#8221; excludes, or includes, amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We consider the non-GAAP financial measures we disclose to be useful to us, investors, analysts and other stakeholders by providing further transparency about, or an alternate means of assessing or comparing our financial condition, operating results and capital adequacy. 

These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally define it or present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the U.S. GAAP financial measure and the non-GAAP financial measure. 

We present certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on DCP investments from net revenues and compensation expenses. The impact of DCP is primarily reflected in our Wealth Management business segment results. These measures allow for better comparability of period-to-period underlying operating performance and revenue trends, 

March 2024 Form 10-Q 7 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

especially in our Wealth Management business segment. By excluding the impact of these items, we are better able to describe the business drivers and resulting impact to net revenues and corresponding change to the associated compensation expenses. For more information, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Executive Summary&#8221; in the 2023 Form 10-K. 

Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe analysts, investors and other stakeholders consider useful to allow for comparability to peers and of the period-to-period use of our equity. The calculation of tangible common equity represents common shareholders&#8217; equity less goodwill and intangible assets net of allowable mortgage servicing rights deduction. In addition, we believe that certain ratios that utilize tangible common equity, such as return on average tangible common equity (&#8220;ROTCE&#8221;) and tangible book value per common share, also non-GAAP financial measures, are useful for evaluating the operating performance and capital adequacy of the business period-to-period, respectively. The calculation of ROTCE represents annualized earnings applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders as a percentage of average tangible common equity. The calculation of tangible book value per common share represents tangible common equity divided by common shares outstanding. 

The principal non-GAAP financial measures presented in this document are set forth in the following tables.

Average common equity and average tangible common equity for each business segment is determined using our Required Capital framework (see &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Requirements&#8212;Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework&#8221; herein). The sums of the segments&#8217; Average common equity and Average tangible common equity do not equal the Consolidated measures due to Parent Company equity. 

3. The calculation of ROE and ROTCE by segment uses net income applicable to Morgan Stanley by segment less preferred dividends allocated to each segment, annualized as a percentage of average common equity and average tangible common equity, respectively, allocated to each segment. 

Return on Tangible Common Equity Goal 

We have an ROTCE goal of 20%. Our ROTCE goal is a forward-looking statement that is based on a normal market environment and may be materially affected by many factors.

Investment Banking Revenues 

Revenues of $1,447 million in the current quarter increased 16% from the prior year quarter, reflecting an increase in underwriting revenues, partially offset by lower Advisory revenues. 

&#8226; Advisory revenues decreased primarily due to fewer completed M&#38;A transactions. 

&#8226; Equity underwriting revenues increased on higher volumes, primarily in initial public and follow-on offerings. 

&#8226; Fixed income underwriting revenues increased primarily due to higher bond issuances, securitized products revenues and investment-grade loan issuances. 

While Investment Banking results improved from recent quarters on higher underwriting revenues, we continue to operate in a market environment with lower completed M&#38;A activity.

Equity 

Net revenues of $2,842 million in the current quarter increased 4% compared with the prior year quarter, reflecting an increase in Execution services, partially offset by a decrease in Financing. 

&#8226; Financing revenues decreased primarily driven by lower gains on inventory held to facilitate client activity in Asia compared to elevated results in the prior year quarter, partially offset by the impact of higher average client balances. 

&#8226; Execution services revenues increased primarily due to higher gains on inventory held to facilitate client activity in derivatives and cash equities and mark-to-market gains on business-related investments compared with losses in the prior year quarter. 

March 2024 Form 10-Q 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Fixed Income 

Net revenues of $2,485 million in the current quarter decreased 4% from the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting a decrease in client activity, partially offset by an increase in certain commodities products. 

&#8226; Global macro products revenues decreased primarily due to decreased client activity in foreign exchange and rates products. 

&#8226; Credit products revenues decreased primarily due to lower client activity, partially offset by higher gains on inventory held to facilitate client activity. 

&#8226; Commodities products and other fixed income revenues increased primarily due to higher gains on inventory held to facilitate client activity. 

Other Net Revenues 

Other net revenues of $242 million in the current quarter were relatively unchanged from the prior year quarter. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $2 million in the current quarter was primarily related to modest growth in certain loan portfolios and provisions for certain specific commercial real estate and corporate loans, partially offset by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments was $189 million in the prior year quarter, primarily related to a deterioration in both the macroeconomic outlook and the commercial real estate portfolio. 

For further information on the Provision for credit losses, see &#8220;Credit Risk&#8221; herein. 

Non-interest Expenses 

Non-interest expenses of $4,663 million in the current quarter decreased 1% compared with the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower Non-compensation expenses. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses were relatively unchanged from the prior year quarter, reflecting lower stock-based compensation expense in the prior year quarter and the impact of lower headcount, offset by higher discretionary incentive compensation. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses decreased primarily due to lower legal and professional services expenses, partially offset by higher execution-related expenses and an increased technology spend.

Net New Assets 

NNA represent client asset inflows, inclusive of interest, dividends and asset acquisitions, less client asset outflows, and exclude the impact of business combinations/divestitures and the impact of fees and commissions. The level of NNA in a given period is influenced by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic factors that impact client investment and spending behaviors, our ability to attract and retain financial 

advisors and clients, and timing of large idiosyncratic flows. Of the $95 billion of NNA during the current quarter, a little more than half related to our family office offering. Macroeconomic factors have had an impact on our NNA in recent periods. Should these factors continue, the growth rate of our NNA may be impacted.

Net Revenues 

Asset Management 

Asset management revenues of $3,829 million in the current quarter increased 13% compared with the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting higher fee-based asset levels in the 

March 2024 Form 10-Q 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

current quarter due to higher market levels and the cumulative impact of positive fee-based flows. 

See &#8220;Fee-Based Client Assets Rollforwards&#8221; herein. 

Transactional Revenues 

Transactional revenues of $1,033 million in the current quarter increased 12% compared with the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher revenues from the distribution of structured products commensurate with equity markets and higher gains on DCP investments . 

For further information on the impact of DCP, see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein. 

Net Interest 

Net interest revenues of $1,856 million in the current quarter decreased 14% when compared with the prior year quarter, primarily due to changes in deposit mix, partially offset by the net effect of higher interest rates. 

The level and pace of interest rate changes and other macroeconomic factors continued to impact client preferences for cash allocation to higher-yielding products and the pace of reallocation of client balances, resulting in changes in the deposit mix and associated interest expense, as well as client demand for loans. If these trends persist, net interest income may be further impacted in future periods. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments was a net release of $8 million in the current quarter as a result of improvements in the macroeconomic outlook. This was partially offset by provisions for certain specific commercial real estate loans. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments was $45 million in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook. 

Non-interest Expenses 

Non-interest expenses of $5,082 million in the current quarter increased 6% compared with the prior year quarter, as a result of higher compensation and benefits expenses. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses increased in the current quarter primarily due to an increase in the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives driven by higher compensable revenues and higher expenses related to amortization of deferred compensation. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses were relatively unchanged from the prior year quarter, reflecting lower professional services and legal expenses, and lower marketing and business development costs offset by the incremental FDIC special assessment cost.

1. Includes Investments, Trading, Commissions and fees, Net interest, and Other revenues. 

Net Revenues 

Asset Management and Related Fees 

Asset management and related fees of $1,346 million in the current quarter increased 8% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by higher average AUM on higher market levels. Additionally, there were positive long-term net flows during the current quarter. 

Asset management revenues are influenced by the level, relative mix of AUM and related fee rates. While the market environment improved in the current quarter, client preferences in previous quarters have resulted in net outflows in the Equity asset class. To the extent these conditions continue, we would expect our Asset management revenue to continue to be impacted. 

See &#8220;Assets under Management or Supervision&#8221; herein. 

Performance-based Income and Other 

Performance-based income and other revenues of $31 million in the current quarter decreased from the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower accrued carried interest in certain private funds. 

Non-interest Expenses 

Non-interest expenses of $1,136 million in the current quarter increased 1% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher Non-compensation expenses. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses were relatively unchanged from the prior year quarter. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses increased in the current quarter primarily due to higher distribution expenses on higher AUM.

Accounting Development Updates 

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued certain accounting updates that apply to us. Accounting updates not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or to not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption. 

We are currently evaluating the following accounting updates; however, we do not expect a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption: 

&#8226; Income Tax Disclosures. This accounting update requires disclosure of additional information in relation to income taxes, including additional disaggregation of the income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. For the income tax rate reconciliation, this update requires (1) disclosure of specific categories of reconciling items; and (2) additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income (or loss) by the applicable statutory income tax rate). For income taxes paid, this update requires disclosure of information, including (1) the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes; and (2) the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received), disaggregated by individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid (net of refunds received) is equal to or greater than 5 percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). Additionally, the update requires disclosure of (1) income (or loss) before income taxes, disaggregated between domestic and foreign; and (2) income taxes disaggregated by federal, state and foreign. The accounting update is effective for annual periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. 

&#8226; Segment Reporting. This accounting update requires additional reportable segment disclosures on an annual and interim basis, primarily about significant segment expenses and other segment items that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within the reported measure of segment profit or loss. This update does not change how operating segments are identified or aggregated, or how quantitative thresholds are applied to determine the reportable segments. The accounting update is effective for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2024, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 to the financial statements). We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the financial statements in the 2023 Form 10-K and Note 2 to the financial statements), the fair value of financial instruments, goodwill and intangible assets, legal and regulatory contingencies (see Note 14 to the financial statements in the 2023 Form 10-K and Note 13 to the financial statements) and income taxes policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. For a further discussion about our critical accounting policies, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; in the 2023 Form 10-K.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our liquidity and capital policies are established and maintained by senior management, with oversight by the Asset/Liability Management Committee and the Board. Through various risk and control committees, senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity, interest rate and currency sensitivity of our asset and liability position. Our Corporate Treasury department (&#8220;Treasury&#8221;), Firm Risk Committee, Asset/Liability Management Committee, and other committees and control groups assist in evaluating, monitoring and managing the impact that our business activities have on our balance sheet, liquidity and capital structure. Liquidity and capital matters are reported regularly to the Board and the Risk Committee of the Board.
