Executive Summary 

Overview of Financial Results 

Consolidated Results&#8212;Full Year Ended December 31, 2023 

&#8226; The Firm reported net revenues of $54.1 billion and net income of $9.1 billion against a mixed market backdrop and a number of headwinds. 

&#8226; The Firm delivered ROE of 9.4% and ROTCE of 12.8% (see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein). 

&#8226; The Firm expense efficiency ratio was 77%. The ratio was negatively impacted by severance costs of $353 million, an FDIC special assessment of $286 million, higher legal expenses relating to a specific matter of $249 million and integration-related expenses of $293 million. 

&#8226; At December 31, 2023, the Firm&#8217;s Standardized Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 15.2%. 

&#8226; Institutional Securities reported net revenues of $23.1 billion reflecting lower completed activity in Investment Banking and lower results in Equity and Fixed Income on reduced client activity and a less favorable market environment compared to a year ago. 

&#8226; Wealth Management delivered net revenues of $26.3 billion, reflecting mark-to-market gains on investments associated with certain employee deferred cash-based compensation plans (&#8220;DCP investments&#8221;) compared with losses in the prior year and higher Net interest revenues. The pre-tax margin was 24.9%. The business added net new assets of $282.3 billion, representing a 6.7% annualized growth rate from beginning period assets. 

&#8226; Investment Management reported net revenues of $5.4 billion and AUM increased to $1.5 trillion.

Non-Interest Expenses 

($ in millions) 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses of $24,558 million in 2023 increased 7% from the prior year, primarily due to higher expenses related to certain employee deferred cash-based compensation plans linked to investment performance (&#8220;DCP&#8221;) and higher salary expenses, partially offset by lower expenses related to outstanding deferred equity compensation. 

2023 Compensation and benefits expenses included $353 million of severance costs, primarily associated with the employee action recorded in the second quarter of 2023. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses of $17,240 million in 2023 increased 6% from the prior year, primarily driven by an FDIC special assessment of $286 million, increased spend on technology, higher costs related to exits of real estate and higher legal expenses, including $249 million related to a specific matter. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $532 million in 2023 was primarily related to deteriorating conditions in the commercial real estate sector, including provisions for certain specific loans, mainly in the office portfolio, and modest growth in certain other loan portfolios. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $280 million in 2022 was due to portfolio growth and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook. 

For further information on the Provision for credit losses, see &#8220;Credit Risk&#8221; herein.

&#8226; Investment Management net revenues of $5,370 million in 2023 were relatively unchanged from the prior year, reflecting a decrease in Asset management and related fees revenues offset by an increase in Performance based income and other revenues.

Economic and Market Conditions 

The market environment in 2023 remained mixed, characterized by inflationary pressures and uncertainty regarding the future path of interest rates, which remained persistently high. Towards the end of the year, the market environment improved from prior quarters with the expectation of lower interest rates going into 2024. However, there is continued uncertainty regarding the timing and pace of these rate reductions along with concerns regarding heightened geopolitical risks that could impact the capital markets in 2024. The market environment impacted our businesses in 2023, as discussed further in &#8220;Business Segments&#8221; herein, and, to the extent that it continues to remain uncertain, could adversely impact client confidence and related activity. 

For more information on economic and market conditions, and the potential effects of geopolitical events and acts of war or aggression on our future results, refer to &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements.&#8221;

Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information 

We prepare our financial statements using U.S. GAAP. From time to time, we may disclose certain &#8220;non-GAAP financial measures&#8221; in this document or in the course of our earnings releases, earnings and other conference calls, financial presentations, definitive proxy statements and other public disclosures. A &#8220;non-GAAP financial measure&#8221; excludes, or includes, amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We consider the non-GAAP financial measures we disclose to be useful to us, investors, analysts and other stakeholders by providing further transparency about, or an alternate means of assessing or comparing our financial condition, operating results and capital adequacy. 

These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally define it or present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the U.S. GAAP financial measure and the non-GAAP financial measure. 

We present certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on DCP investments from net revenues and compensation expenses. The impact of DCP is primarily reflected in our Wealth Management business segment results. These measures allow for better comparability of period-to-period underlying operating performance and revenue trends, especially in our Wealth Management business segment. By excluding the impact of these items, we are better able to describe the business drivers and resulting impact to net revenues and corresponding change to the associated compensation expenses. 

Compensation expense for DCP awards is calculated based on the notional value of the award granted, adjusted for changes in the fair value of the referenced investments that employees select. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period relevant to each separately vesting portion of deferred awards. 

We invest directly, as principal, in financial instruments and other investments to economically hedge certain of our obligations under these DCP awards. Changes in the fair value of such investments, net of financing costs, are recorded in net revenues, and included in Transactional revenues in the Wealth Management business segment. Although changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value of the referenced investments will generally be offset by changes in the fair value of investments recognized in net revenues, there is typically a timing difference between the immediate recognition of gains and losses on our investments and the deferred recognition of the related compensation expense over the vesting period. While this timing difference 

may not be material to our Income before provision for income taxes in any individual period, it may impact the Wealth Management business segment reported ratios and operating metrics in certain periods due to potentially significant impacts to net revenues and compensation expenses. For additional information on DCP, refer to &#8220;Other Matters&#8221; herein. 

The principal non-GAAP financial measures presented in this document are set forth in the following tables.

1. Net revenues and compensation expense are adjusted for DCP for both Firm and Wealth Management business segment. See &#8220;Other Matters&#8221; herein for more information. 

2. Average common equity and average tangible common equity for each business segment is determined using our Required Capital framework (see &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Requirements&#8212;Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework&#8221; herein). The sums of the segments&#8217; Average common equity and Average tangible common equity do not equal the Consolidated measures due to Parent Company equity. 

3. The calculation of ROE and ROTCE by segment uses net income applicable to Morgan Stanley by segment less preferred dividends allocated to each segment as a percentage of average common equity and average tangible common equity, respectively, allocated to each segment. 

Return on Tangible Common Equity Goal 

We have an ROTCE goal of 20%. Our ROTCE goal is a forward-looking statement that is based on a normal market environment and may be materially affected by many factors. 

See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; herein for further information on market and economic conditions and their potential effects on our future operating results. 

ROTCE represents a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on non-GAAP measures, see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein. 

Business Segments 

Substantially all of our operating revenues and operating expenses are directly attributable to our business segments. Certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures. See Note 22 to the financial statements for segment net revenues by income statement line item and information on intersegment transactions. 

Net Revenues 

Investment Banking 

Investment banking revenues are derived from client engagements in which we act as an advisor, underwriter or distributor of capital. 

Within the Institutional Securities business segment, these revenues are primarily composed of fees earned from underwriting equity and fixed income securities, syndicating loans and advisory services in relation to mergers and acquisitions, divestitures and corporate restructurings. 

Within the Wealth Management business segment, these revenues are derived from the distribution of newly issued securities. 

Trading 

Trading revenues include the realized gains and losses from transactions in financial instruments, unrealized gains and losses from ongoing changes in the fair value of our positions, and gains and losses from financial instruments used to economically hedge compensation expense related to DCP. 

Within the Institutional Securities business segment, Trading revenues arise from transactions in cash instruments and derivatives in which we act as a market maker for our clients. In this role, we stand ready to buy, sell or otherwise transact with customers under a variety of market conditions and to provide firm or indicative prices in response to customer requests. Our liquidity obligations can be explicit in some cases, and in others, customers expect us to be willing to transact with them. In order to most effectively fulfill our market-making function, we engage in activities across all of our trading businesses that include, but are not limited to: 

&#8226; taking positions in anticipation of, and in response to, customer demand to buy or sell and&#8212;depending on the liquidity of the relevant market and the size of the position&#8212;to hold those positions for a period of time; 

&#8226; building, maintaining and rebalancing inventory held to facilitate client activity through trades with other market participants; 

&#8226; managing and assuming basis risk (risk associated with imperfect hedging) between risks incurred from the facilitation of client transactions and the standardized products available in the market to hedge those risks; 

&#8226; trading in the market to remain current on pricing and trends; and 

&#8226; engaging in other activities to provide efficiency and liquidity for markets. 

In many markets, the realized and unrealized gains and losses from purchase and sale transactions will include any spreads between bids and offers. Certain fees received on loans carried at fair value and dividends from equity securities are also recorded in Trading revenues since they relate to positions carried at fair value. 

Within the Wealth Management business segment, Trading revenues primarily include revenues from customers&#8217; purchases and sales of fixed income instruments in which we act as principal, as well as gains and losses related to DCP investments.

&#160; 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

##TABLE_END

Investments 

Investments revenues are composed of realized and unrealized gains and losses derived from investments, including those associated with employee deferred compensation and co-investment plans. Estimates of the fair value of the investments that produce these revenues may involve significant judgment and may fluctuate significantly over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions, generally or in relation to specific transactions. 

Within the Institutional Securities segment, gains and losses are primarily from business-related investments. Certain investments are subject to sale restrictions. 

Within the Investment Management business segment, Investments revenues are primarily from performance-based fees in the form of carried interest, a portion of which is subject to reversal, and gains and losses from investments. The business is entitled to receive carried interest when the return in certain funds exceeds specified performance targets. Additionally, we consolidate certain sponsored Investment Management funds where revenues are primarily attributable to holders of noncontrolling interests. 

Commissions and Fees 

Commissions and fees result from arrangements in which the client is charged a fee for executing transactions related to securities, services related to sales and trading activities, and sales of other products. 

Within the Institutional Securities business segment, commissions and fees include fees earned from market-making activities, such as executing and clearing client transactions on major stock and derivative exchanges, as well as from OTC derivatives. 

Within the Wealth Management business segment, commissions and fees arise from client transactions primarily in equity securities, insurance products, mutual funds, alternative investments, futures and options. Wealth Management also earns revenues from order flow payments for directing customer orders to broker-dealers, exchanges and market centers for execution . 

Asset Management 

Asset management revenues include fees associated with the management and supervision of assets and the distribution of funds and similar products. 

Within the Wealth Management business segment, Asset management revenues are related to advisory services associated with fee-based assets, account service and administration, as well as distribution of products. These revenues are generally based on the net asset value of the account in which a client is invested. 

Within the Investment Management business segment, Asset management revenues are primarily composed of fees received from investment vehicles on the basis of assets under management. Performance-based fees, not in the form of carried interest, are earned on certain products and separately managed accounts as a percentage of appreciation in value and, in certain cases, are based upon the achievement of performance criteria. These performance fees are generally recognized on a quarterly or annual basis. 

Net Interest 

Interest income and Interest expense are functions of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities, including Trading assets and Trading liabilities, Investment securities, Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, Securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, Loans, Deposits and Borrowings. 

Within the Institutional Securities business segment, Net interest is a function of market-making strategies, client activity, and the prevailing level, term structure and volatility of interest rates. Net interest is impacted by market-making, lending and financing activities as we generally earn interest on securities held by the Firm, Securities borrowed, Securities purchased under agreements to resell, Loans and margin loans, while Borrowings, Securities loaned and Securities sold under agreements to repurchase generally incur interest expense. 

Within the Wealth Management business segment, Interest income is driven by assets held including Investment securities, Loans and margin loans. Interest expense is driven by Deposits and other funding. 

Other 

Other revenues for Institutional Securities include revenues and losses from equity method investments, fees earned in association with lending activities, mark-to-market gains and losses on loans and lending commitments held for sale, as well as gains and losses on economic derivative hedges associated with certain held-for-sale and held-for-investment loans and lending commitments. 

Other revenues for Wealth Management include realized gains and losses on AFS securities, account handling fees, referral fees and other miscellaneous revenues. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Provision for credit losses includes the provision for credit losses for loans and lending commitments held for investment. 

Institutional Securities&#8212;Fixed Income and Equities 

Fixed income and Equities net revenues are composed of Trading revenues, Commissions and fees, Asset management revenues, Net interest, and certain Investments and Other

revenues directly attributable to those businesses. These revenues, which can be affected by a variety of interrelated factors, including market volumes, bid-offer spreads and the impact of market conditions on inventory held to facilitate client activity, as well as the effect of hedging activity, are viewed in the aggregate when assessing the performance and profitability of our businesses. 

Following is a description of the revenue-generating activities within our equity and fixed income businesses, as well as how their results impact the income statement line items. 

Equity&#8212;Financing. We provide financing, prime brokerage and fund administration services to our clients active in the equity markets through a variety of products, including margin lending, securities lending and swaps. Results from this business are largely driven by the difference between financing income earned and financing and liquidity costs incurred, which are reflected in Net interest for securities lending products, and in Trading revenues for derivative products. Fees for providing fund administration services are reflected in Asset management revenues. 

Equity&#8212;Execution services. A significant portion of the results for this business is generated by commissions and fees from executing and clearing client transactions on major stock and derivative exchanges, as well as from OTC transactions. We make markets for our clients principally in equity-related securities and derivative products, including those that provide liquidity and are utilized for hedging. Market-making also generates gains and losses on inventory held to facilitate client activity, which are reflected in Trading revenues. Execution services also includes certain Investments and Other revenues. 

Fixed income &#8212;Within fixed income, we make markets in various flow and structured products in order to facilitate client activity as part of the following products and services: 

&#8226; Global macro products. We make markets for our clients in interest rate, foreign exchange and emerging market products, including exchange-traded and OTC securities and derivative instruments. The results of this market-making activity are primarily driven by gains and losses from buying and selling positions to stand ready for and satisfy client demand and are recorded in Trading revenues. 

&#8226; Credit products. We make markets in credit-sensitive products, such as corporate bonds and mortgage securities and other securitized products, and related derivative instruments. The values of positions in this business are sensitive to changes in credit spreads and interest rates, which result in gains and losses reflected in Trading revenues. We undertake lending activities, which include commercial mortgage lending, secured lending facilities and financing extended to sales and trading customers. Due to the amount and type of the interest-bearing securities and loans making up this business, a significant portion of the results is also reflected in Net interest revenues. 

&#8226; Commodities products and Other. We make markets in various commodity products related primarily to electricity, natural gas, oil and metals. Other activities primarily include results from the centralized management of our fixed income derivative counterparty exposures and the management of derivative counterparty risk. These activities are primarily recorded in Trading revenues. 

Fixed income also includes certain Investments and Other revenues. 

Institutional Securities&#8212;Other Net Revenues 

Other net revenues include impacts from certain treasury functions, such as liquidity and funding costs and gains and losses on economic hedges related to certain borrowings. Other net revenues also include mark-to-market gains and losses on held-for-sale corporate loans and lending commitments, as well as net interest and gain and losses on economic hedges associated with held-for-sale and held-for-investment corporate loans and lending commitments. Also included are gains and losses from financial instruments used to economically hedge compensation expense related to certain DCP, income and losses from the equity method investment related to our Japanese securities joint venture with MUFG, as well as Investments and Other revenues that are not directly attributable to Fixed income and Equities businesses. 

Compensation Expense 

Compensation and benefits expenses include base salaries and fixed allowances, formulaic programs, discretionary incentive compensation, amortization of deferred cash and equity awards, changes in the fair value of DCP investments, including the Firm&#8217;s share price for certain awards, carried interest allocated to employees, severance costs, and other items such as health and welfare benefits. 

The factors that drive compensation for our employees vary from period to period, from segment to segment and within a segment. For certain revenue-producing employees in the Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments, compensation is largely paid on the basis of formulaic payouts that link employee compensation to revenues. Compensation for other employees, including revenue-producing employees in the Institutional Securities business segment, include base salary and benefits and may also include incentive compensation that is determined following the assessment of the performance of the Firm, business unit and individual. 

Compensation expense for DCP is recognized over the relevant vesting period and is adjusted based on the fair value of the referenced investments until distribution. Although changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value of the referenced investments will generally be offset by changes in the fair value of investments made by the Firm, there is typically a timing difference between the

immediate recognition of gains and losses on the Firm's investments and the compensation expense recognized over the vesting period. 

Income Taxes 

The Income tax provision for our business segments is generally determined based on the revenues, expenses and activities directly attributable to each business segment. Certain items have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues or other relevant measures.

Investment Banking Revenues 

Net revenues of $4,578 million in 2023 decreased 13% compared with the prior year, primarily reflecting lower Advisory revenues. 

&#8226; Advisory revenues decreased primarily due to fewer completed M&#38;A transactions on lower market volumes. 

&#8226; Equity underwriting revenues increased on higher volumes, primarily in secondary offerings and convertible issuances, partially offset by lower revenues from initial public offerings. 

&#8226; Fixed income underwriting revenues were relatively unchanged from the prior year, primarily reflecting higher investment-grade loan and bond issuances, offset by lower non-investment grade loan issuances. 

Investment Banking continues to operate in a market environment characterized by lower completed M&#38;A and underwriting activity amid market uncertainty, including the future path of interest rates .

Equity 

Net revenues of $9,986 million in 2023 decreased 7% compared with the prior year, reflecting decreases in Financing and Execution services. 

&#8226; Financing revenues decreased primarily due to higher funding and liquidity costs compared with the prior year. 

&#8226; Execution services revenues decreased primarily due to lower gains on inventory held to facilitate client activity in derivatives and cash equities and lower client activity in cash equities, partially offset by mark-to-market gains on business-related investments compared with losses in the prior year. 

Fixed Income 

Net revenues of $7,673 million in 2023 decreased 15% compared with the prior year, primarily reflecting a decrease in foreign exchange and commodities products. 

&#8226; Global macro products revenues decreased primarily due to a decline in foreign exchange products. 

&#8226; Credit products revenues decreased primarily due to lower client activity across products.

##TABLE_END

&#8226; Commodities products and other fixed income revenues decreased compared to elevated results in the prior year, primarily due to lower gains on inventory held to facilitate client activity and lower client activity. 

Other Net Revenues 

Other net revenues were $823 million in 2023 compared with losses of $633 million in the prior year, primarily due to lower mark-to-market losses on corporate loans held for sale, inclusive of hedges, and higher net interest income and fees on corporate loans, mark-to-market gains compared with losses in the prior year on DCP investments and impacts from liquidity and funding costs. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

In 2023, the Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $401 million was primarily related to deteriorating conditions in the commercial real estate sector, including provisions for certain specific loans, mainly in the office portfolio, and modest growth in certain other loan portfolios. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $211 million in 2022 was primarily driven by portfolio growth and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook. 

For further information on the Provision for credit losses, see &#8220;Credit Risk&#8221; herein. 

Non-Interest Expenses 

Non-interest expenses of $18,183 million in 2023 increased 4% compared with the prior year due to higher Non-compensation expenses and Compensation and benefits expenses. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses increased primarily due to higher expenses related to DCP and higher stock-based compensation expenses driven by the Firm&#8217;s share price movement in the prior year, partially offset by lower expenses related to outstanding deferred equity compensation. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses increased primarily due to increased spend on technology, an FDIC special assessment of $121 million, higher legal expenses, including $249 million related to a specific matter, higher execution-related and marketing and business development expenses.

Net Revenues 

Asset Management 

Asset management revenues of $14,019 million in 2023 increased 1% compared with the prior year, reflecting the cumulative impact of positive fee-based flows, partially offset by a reduction driven by changes in client and product mix and lower average fee-based client asset levels due to declines in the markets.

Transactional Revenues 

Transactional revenues of $3,556 million in 2023 increased 44% compared with the prior year, primarily due to $282 million of gains on DCP investments compared with $858 million of losses in the prior year, partially offset by lower client activity. 

For further information on the impact of DCP, see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein. 

Net Interest 

Net interest revenues of $8,118 million in 2023 increased 9% compared with the prior year, primarily due to the net effect of higher interest rates, partially offset by changes in deposit mix. 

The level and pace of interest rate changes and other macroeconomic factors continued to impact client preferences for cash allocation to higher-yielding products and the pace of reallocation of client balances, resulting in changes in the deposit mix and associated interest expense, as well as client demand for loans. If these trends persist, net interest income could be impacted in future periods. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $131 million in 2023 was primarily related to deteriorating conditions in the commercial real estate sector, including provisions for certain specific loans, mainly in the office portfolio. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments was $69 million in 2022, primarily driven by portfolio growth in Residential real estate loans and deteriorating conditions in the commercial real estate sector. 

For further information on the Provision for credit losses, see &#8220;Credit Risk&#8221; herein. 

Non-Interest Expenses 

Non-interest expenses of $19,607 million in 2023 increased 10% compared with the prior year, as a result of higher Compensation and benefits expense and higher Non-compensation expense. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses increased, primarily due to higher expenses related to DCP and higher salaries driven by hiring mix. 

For further information on the impact of expenses related to DCP, see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses increased, primarily driven by an FDIC special assessment of $165 million, increased spend on technology and costs related to exits of real estate.

Net Revenues 

Asset Management and Related Fees 

Asset management and related fees of $5,231 million in 2023 decreased 2% compared with the prior year, primarily due to a shift in the mix of average AUM, driven by the cumulative effect of net flows. 

Asset management revenues are influenced by the level, relative mix of AUM and related fee rates. The market environment and client preferences in recent quarters have impacted the mix of our average Long-Term AUM level across certain asset classes. To the extent these conditions continue, we would expect our Asset management revenue to continue to be negatively impacted. 

See &#8220;Assets Under Management or Supervision&#8221; herein. 

Performance-based Income and Other 

Performance-based income and other revenues increased to $139 million in 2023, from $43 million in the prior year, primarily due to mark-to-market gains in 2023 compared with losses in the prior year on DCP investments and investments in public funds, partially offset by lower accrued carried interest in certain private funds. 

Non-Interest Expenses 

Non-interest expenses of $4,528 million in 2023 decreased 1% from the prior year, primarily due to lower Compensation and benefits expenses. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses decreased primarily due to lower expenses related to compensation associated with carried interest, partially offset by higher expenses related to DCP. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses were relatively unchanged for the current year.

Other Matters 

Deferred Cash-Based Compensation 

The Firm sponsors a number of deferred cash-based compensation programs for current and former employees, which generally contain vesting, clawback and cancellation provisions. 

Employees are permitted to allocate the value of their deferred awards among a menu of notional investments, whereby the value of their awards will track the performance of the referenced notional investments. The menu of investments, which is selected by the Firm, includes fixed income, equity, commodity and money market funds. 

Compensation expense for DCP awards is calculated based on the notional value of the award granted, adjusted for changes in the fair value of the referenced investments that employees select. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period relevant to each separately vesting portion of deferred awards. 

We invest directly, as principal, in financial instruments and other investments to economically hedge certain of our obligations under these DCP awards. Changes in the fair value of such investments, net of financing costs, are recorded in net revenues, and included in Transactional revenues in the Wealth Management business segment. Although changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value of the referenced investments will generally be offset by changes in the fair value of investments recognized in net revenues, there is typically a timing difference between the immediate recognition of gains and losses on our investments and the deferred recognition of the related compensation expense over the vesting period. While this timing difference may not be material to our Income before provision for income taxes in any individual period, it may impact the Wealth Management business segment reported ratios and operating metrics in certain periods due to potentially significant impacts to net revenues and compensation expenses. At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, substantially all employee referenced investments that subjected the Firm to price risk were economically hedged.

Accounting Development Updates 

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued certain accounting updates that apply to us. Accounting updates not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or to not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption. 

We adopted the following accounting update on January 1, 2024, with no material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption: 

&#8226; Investments&#8212;Tax Credit Structures . This accounting update permits an election to account for tax equity investments using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. Under the proportional amortization method, the initial cost of the investment is amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received and recognized net in the income statement as a component of provision for income taxes. The update requires a separate accounting policy election to be made for each tax credit program. Additional disclosures are required regarding (i) the nature of our tax equity investments and (ii) the effect of our tax equity investments and related income tax credits on the financial condition and results of operations. 

We are currently evaluating the following accounting updates; however, we do not expect a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption: 

&#8226; Income Tax Disclosures. This accounting update requires disclosure of additional information in relation to income taxes, including additional disaggregation of the income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. For the income tax rate reconciliation, this update requires (1) disclosure of specific categories of reconciling items; and (2) providing additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income (or loss) by the applicable statutory income tax rate). For income taxes paid, this update requires disclosure of information, including (1) the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes; and (2) the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received), disaggregated by individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid (net of refunds received) is equal to or greater than 5 percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). Additionally, the update requires disclosure of (1) income (or loss) before income taxes, disaggregated between domestic and foreign; and (2) income taxes disaggregated by federal, state and foreign. The accounting update is effective for annual periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. 

&#8226; Segment Reporting. This accounting update requires additional reportable segment disclosures on an annual and interim basis, primarily about significant segment expenses and other segment items that are regularly provided to the

chief operating decision maker and included within the reported measure of segment profit or loss. This update does not change how operating segments are identified or aggregated, or how quantitative thresholds are applied to determine the reportable segments. The accounting update is effective for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2024, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 to the financial statements). We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the financial statements), the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. 

Fair Value 

Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value 

A significant number of our financial instruments are carried at fair value. The use of fair value to measure financial instruments is fundamental to our risk management practices and is our most critical accounting estimate. We make estimates regarding the valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the financial statements. These assets and liabilities include, but are not limited to: 

&#8226; Trading assets and Trading liabilities; 

&#8226; Investment Securities&#8212;AFS; 

&#8226; Certain Securities purchased under agreements to resell; 

&#8226; Loans held-for-sale (measured at the lower of amortized cost or fair value); 

&#8226; Certain Deposits, primarily certificates of deposit; 

&#8226; Certain Securities sold under agreements to repurchase; 

&#8226; Certain Other secured financings; and 

&#8226; Certain Borrowings. 

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 

In determining fair value, we use various valuation approaches. A hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable prices and inputs, and minimizes the use of unobservable prices and inputs by requiring that the relevant observable inputs be used when available. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels: wherein Level 1 represents quoted prices in active markets, Level 2 represents valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, and Level 3 consists of valuation techniques that incorporate significant unobservable inputs and, therefore, require the greatest use of judgment. The fair values for the substantial majority of our financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are based on observable prices and inputs and are classified in level 1 or 2, of the fair value 

hierarchy. Level 3 financial assets represented 1.2% and 1.4% of our total assets, as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

In periods of market disruption, the observability of prices and inputs, as well as market liquidity, may be reduced for many instruments, which could cause an instrument to be recategorized from Level 1 to Level 2 or from Level 2 to Level 3. In addition, a downturn in market conditions could lead to declines in the valuation of many instruments carried at fair value. Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. For further information on the definition of fair value, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 and related valuation techniques, and quantitative information about and sensitivity of significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements, see Notes 2 and 4 to the financial statements. 

Where appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to account for various factors, such as liquidity risk (bid-ask adjustments), credit quality, model uncertainty, concentration risk and funding, in order to arrive at fair value. For a further discussion of valuation adjustments that we apply, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 

Goodwill and Intangible Assets 

Goodwill 

We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of July 1 and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. Evaluating goodwill for impairment requires management to make significant judgments, including, in part, the use of unobservable inputs that are subject to uncertainty. Goodwill impairment tests are performed at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the level of or one level below our business segments. Goodwill no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition once it has been assigned to a reporting unit. As such, all the activities of a reporting unit, whether acquired or organically developed, are available to support the value of the goodwill. 

For both the annual and interim tests, we have the option to either (i) perform a quantitative impairment test or (ii) first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, in which case, the quantitative test would be performed. 

When performing a quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the goodwill impairment loss is equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, 

##TABLE_START December 2023 Form 10-K 46 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START 

&#160; 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

##TABLE_END

limited by the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. 

The carrying value of each reporting unit is determined based on the capital allocated to the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of the reporting units is derived based on valuation techniques we believe market participants would use for each of the reporting units. The estimated fair value is generally determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology. In certain instances, we may also utilize methodologies that incorporate price-to-book and price-to-earnings multiples of comparable companies. 

The discounted cash flow methodology uses projected future cash flows based on the reporting units&#8217; earnings forecast. The discount rate used represents an estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting unit based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model. 

At each annual goodwill impairment testing date, each of our reporting units with goodwill had a fair value that was substantially in excess of its carrying value. 

Intangible Assets 

Intangible assets are initially recorded at cost, or in the situation where acquired as part of a business combination, at the fair value determined as part of the acquisition method of accounting. Subsequently, amortizable intangible assets are carried in the balance sheet at amortized cost, where amortization is recognized over their estimated useful lives. Indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment on an annual basis as of July 1 and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. 

On a quarterly basis: 

&#8226; All intangible assets are assessed for the presence of impairment indicators. Where such indicators are present, an evaluation for impairment is conducted. 

&#8226; For amortizable intangible assets, an impairment loss exists if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows. 

&#8226; For indefinite-lived intangible assets, an impairment exists if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. 

&#8226; Amortizable intangible assets are assessed for any indication that the remaining useful life or the finite life classification should be revised. In such cases, the remaining carrying amount is amortized prospectively over the revised useful life, unless it is determined that the life of the intangible asset is indefinite, in which case the intangible asset is not amortized. 

&#8226; Indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for any indication that the life of the intangible asset is no longer indefinite; in such cases, the carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over its remaining useful life. 

The initial valuation of an intangible asset as part of the acquisition method of accounting and the subsequent valuation of intangible assets as part of an impairment assessment are subjective and based, in part, on inputs that are unobservable and can be subject to uncertainty. These inputs include, but are not limited to, forecasted cash flows, revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates and discount rates. 

For both goodwill and intangible assets, to the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted. For amortizable intangible assets, the new cost basis is amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset. Unanticipated declines in our revenue generating capability, adverse market or economic events, and regulatory actions, could result in material impairment charges in future periods. 

See Notes 2 and 10 to the financial statements for additional information about goodwill and intangible assets. 

Legal and Regulatory Contingencies 

In the normal course of business, we have been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with our activities as a global diversified financial services institution. 

Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the third-party entities that are, or would otherwise be, the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt, in financial distress, or may not honor applicable indemnification obligations. These actions have included, but are not limited to, antitrust claims, claims under various false claims act statutes, and matters arising from our sales and trading businesses and our activities in the capital markets. 

We are also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding our business, and involving, among other matters, sales, trading, financing, prime brokerage, market-making activities, investment banking advisory services, capital markets activities, financial products or offerings sponsored, underwritten or sold by us, wealth and investment management services, and accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, disgorgement, restitution, forfeiture, injunctions, limitations on our ability to conduct certain business, or other relief. 

We contest liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. Where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and we can

reasonably estimate the amount of that loss or the range of loss, we accrue an estimated loss by a charge to income. 

In many legal proceedings and investigations, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or reasonably possible, or to estimate the amount of any loss. In addition, even where we have determined that a loss is probable or reasonably possible or an exposure to loss or range of loss exists in excess of the liability already accrued with respect to a previously recognized loss contingency, we are often unable to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss or range of loss. It is particularly difficult to determine if a loss is probable or reasonably possible, or to estimate the amount of loss, where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, forfeiture, disgorgement or penalties. Numerous issues may need to be resolved in an investigation or proceeding before a determination can be made that a loss or additional loss (or range of loss or range of additional loss) is probable or reasonably possible, or to estimate the amount of loss, including through potentially lengthy discovery or determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification, the calculation of damages or other relief, and consideration of novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question. 

Significant judgment is required in deciding when and if to make these accruals, and the actual cost of a legal claim or regulatory fine/penalty may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals. 

See Note 14 to the financial statements for additional information on legal contingencies. 

Income Taxes 

We are subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have business operations. These tax laws are complex and subject to interpretation by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws and make estimates about certain items affecting taxable income when determining the provision for income taxes in the various tax jurisdictions. 

Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. We periodically evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each taxing jurisdiction resulting from current and subsequent years&#8217; examinations, and unrecognized tax benefits related to potential losses that may arise from tax audits are established in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. Once established, unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring a change. 

Our provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. Current income taxes approximate taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the applicable enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. 

Our deferred tax balances may also include deferred assets related to tax attribute carryforwards, such as net operating losses and tax credits that will be realized through reduction of future tax liabilities and, in some cases, are subject to expiration if not utilized within certain periods. We perform regular reviews to ascertain whether deferred tax assets are realizable. These reviews include management&#8217;s estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income and incorporate various tax planning strategies, including strategies that may be available to tax attribute carryforwards before they expire. 

Once the deferred tax asset balances have been determined, we may record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset balances to reflect the amount we estimate is more likely than not to be realized at a future date. Both current and deferred income taxes may reflect adjustments related to our unrecognized tax benefits. 

Significant judgment is required in estimating the consolidated provision for (benefit from) income taxes, current and deferred tax balances (including valuation allowance, if any), accrued interest or penalties and uncertain tax positions. Revisions in estimates and/or the actual costs of a tax assessment may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, if any. 

See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information on our significant assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with the accounting for income taxes and Note 21 to the financial statements for additional information on our tax examinations. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our liquidity and capital policies are established and maintained by senior management, with oversight by the Asset/Liability Management Committee and the Board. Through various risk and control committees, senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity, interest rate and currency sensitivity of our asset and liability position. Our Corporate Treasury department (&#8220;Treasury&#8221;), Firm Risk Committee, Asset/Liability Management Committee, and other committees and control groups assist in evaluating, monitoring and managing the impact that our business activities have on our balance sheet, liquidity and capital structure. Liquidity and capital matters are reported regularly to the Board and the BRC.

Balance Sheet 

We monitor and evaluate the composition and size of our balance sheet on a regular basis. Our balance sheet management process includes quarterly planning, business-specific thresholds, monitoring of business-specific usage versus key performance metrics and new business impact assessments. 

We establish balance sheet thresholds at the consolidated and business segment levels. We monitor balance sheet utilization and review variances resulting from business activity and market fluctuations. On a regular basis, we review current performance versus established thresholds and assess the need to re-allocate our balance sheet based on business segment needs. We also monitor key metrics, including asset and liability size and capital usage.

Liquidity Risk Management Framework 

The primary goal of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework is to ensure that we have access to adequate funding across a wide range of market conditions and time horizons. The framework is designed to enable us to fulfill our financial obligations and support the execution of our business strategies. 

The following principles guide our Liquidity Risk Management Framework: 

&#8226; Sufficient liquidity resources, which consist of HQLA and cash deposits with banks (&#8220;Liquidity Resources&#8221;) should be maintained to cover maturing liabilities and other planned and contingent outflows; 

&#8226; Maturity profile of assets and liabilities should be aligned, with limited reliance on short-term funding; 

&#8226; Source, counterparty, currency, region and term of funding should be diversified; and 

&#8226; Liquidity Stress Tests should anticipate, and account for, periods of limited access to funding. 

The core components of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework are the Required Liquidity Framework, Liquidity Stress Tests and Liquidity Resources, which support our target liquidity profile. 

Required Liquidity Framework 

Our Required Liquidity Framework establishes the amount of liquidity we must hold in both normal and stressed environments to ensure that our financial condition and overall soundness are not adversely affected by an inability (or perceived inability) to meet our financial obligations in a timely manner. The Required Liquidity Framework considers the most constraining liquidity requirement to satisfy all regulatory and internal limits at a consolidated and legal entity level. 

Liquidity Stress Tests 

We use Liquidity Stress Tests to model external and intercompany liquidity flows across multiple scenarios and a range of time horizons. These scenarios contain various combinations of idiosyncratic and systemic stress events of different severity and duration. The methodology, implementation, production and analysis of our Liquidity Stress Tests are important components of the Required Liquidity Framework. 

The assumptions used in our various Liquidity Stress Test scenarios include, but are not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; No government support; 

&#8226; No access to equity and limited access to unsecured debt markets; 

##TABLE_START 49 

December 2023 Form 10-K ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START 

&#160; 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

##TABLE_END

&#8226; Repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within the stress horizon; 

&#8226; Higher haircuts for and significantly lower availability of secured funding; 

&#8226; Additional collateral that would be required by trading counterparties, certain exchanges and clearing organizations related to credit rating downgrades; 

&#8226; Additional collateral that would be required due to collateral substitutions, collateral disputes and uncalled collateral; 

&#8226; Discretionary unsecured debt buybacks; 

&#8226; Drawdowns on lending commitments provided to third parties; and 

&#8226; Client cash withdrawals and reduction in customer short positions that fund long positions. 

Liquidity Stress Tests are produced and results are reported at different levels, including major operating subsidiaries and major currencies, to capture specific cash requirements and cash availability across the Firm, including a limited number of asset sales in a stressed environment. The Liquidity Stress Tests assume that subsidiaries will use their own liquidity first to fund their obligations before drawing liquidity from the Parent Company and that the Parent Company will support its subsidiaries and will not have access to subsidiaries&#8217; liquidity reserves. In addition to the assumptions underpinning the Liquidity Stress Tests, we take into consideration settlement risk related to intraday settlement and clearing of securities and financing activities. 

At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we maintained sufficient Liquidity Resources to meet current and contingent funding obligations as modeled in our Liquidity Stress Tests. 

Liquidity Resources 

We maintain sufficient Liquidity Resources to cover daily funding needs and to meet strategic liquidity targets sized by the Required Liquidity Framework and Liquidity Stress Tests. We actively manage the amount of our Liquidity Resources considering the following components: unsecured debt maturity profile; balance sheet size and composition; funding needs in a stressed environment, inclusive of contingent cash outflows; legal entity, regional and segment liquidity requirements; regulatory requirements; and collateral requirements. 

The amount of Liquidity Resources we hold is based on our risk appetite and is calibrated to meet various internal and regulatory requirements and to fund prospective business activities. The Liquidity Resources are primarily held within the Parent Company and its major operating subsidiaries. The Total HQLA values in the tables immediately following are different from Eligible HQLA, which, in accordance with the LCR rule, also takes into account certain regulatory weightings and other operational considerations.

Liquidity Resources may fluctuate from period to period based on the overall size and composition of our balance sheet, the maturity profile of our unsecured debt, and estimates of funding needs in a stressed environment, among other factors. 

Regulatory Liquidity Framework 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio 

We and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum LCR and NSFR of 100%. 

The LCR rule requires large banking organizations to have sufficient Eligible HQLA to cover net cash outflows arising from significant stress over 30 calendar days, thus promoting the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banking organizations. In determining Eligible HQLA for LCR purposes, weightings (or asset haircuts) are applied to HQLA, and certain HQLA held in subsidiaries is excluded. 

The NSFR rule requires large banking organizations to maintain an amount of available stable funding, which is their regulatory capital and liabilities subject to standardized weightings, equal to or greater than their required stable

Funding Management 

We manage our funding in a manner that reduces the risk of disruption to our operations. We pursue a strategy of diversification of secured and unsecured funding sources (by product, investor and region) and attempt to ensure that the tenor of our liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed. Our goal is to achieve an optimal mix of durable secured and unsecured financing. 

We fund our balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources. These sources include our equity capital, borrowings, bank notes, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities lending, deposits, letters of credit and lines of credit. We have active financing programs for both standard and structured products targeting global investors and currencies. 

Treasury allocates interest expense to our businesses based on the tenor and interest rate profile of the assets being funded. Treasury similarly allocates interest income to businesses carrying deposit products and other liabilities across the businesses based on the characteristics of those deposits and other liabilities. 

Secured Financing 

The liquid nature of the marketable securities and short-term receivables arising principally from sales and trading activities in the Institutional Securities business segment 

provides us with flexibility in managing the composition of our balance sheet. Secured financing investors principally focus on the quality of the eligible collateral posted. Accordingly, we actively manage our secured financings based on the quality of the assets being funded. 

We have established longer-tenor secured funding requirements for less liquid asset classes, for which funding may be at risk in the event of a market disruption. We define highly liquid assets as government-issued or government-guaranteed securities with a high degree of fundability and less liquid assets as those that do not meet these criteria. 

To further minimize the refinancing risk of secured financing for less liquid assets, we have established concentration limits to diversify our investor base and reduce the amount of monthly maturities for secured financing of less liquid assets. As a component of the Liquidity Risk Management Framework, we hold a portion of our Liquidity Resources against the potential disruption to our secured financing capabilities. 

In general, we maintain a pool of liquid and easily fundable securities, which takes into account HQLA classifications consistent with LCR definitions, and other regulatory requirements, and provides a valuable future source of liquidity.

In addition to the collateralized financing transactions shown in the previous table, we engage in financing transactions collateralized by customer-owned securities, which are segregated in accordance with regulatory requirements. Receivables under these financing transactions, primarily margin loans, are included in Customer and other receivables in the balance sheet, and payables under these financing transactions, primarily to prime brokerage customers, are included in Customer and other payables in the balance sheet.

collateral maintenance policies and the elements of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework. 

Unsecured Financing 

We view deposits and borrowings as stable sources of funding for unencumbered securities and non-security assets. Our unsecured financings include borrowings and certificates of deposit carried at fair value, which are primarily composed of: instruments whose payments and redemption values are linked to the performance of a specific index, a basket of stocks, a specific equity security, a commodity, a credit exposure or basket of credit exposures; and instruments with various interest rate-related features, including step-ups, step-downs and zero coupons. Also included are unsecured contracts that are not classified as OTC derivatives because they fail initial net investment criteria. As part of our asset/liability management strategy, when appropriate, we use derivatives to make adjustments to the interest rate risk profile of our borrowings (see Notes 6 and 13 to the financial statements). 

Deposits 

##TABLE_START $ in millions At December 31, 2023 At December 31, 2022 Savings and demand deposits: Brokerage sweep deposits 1

1. Amounts represent balances swept from client brokerage accounts. 

2. As of December 31, 2023, there were no off-balance sheet amounts excluded from deposits. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $6 billion of off-balance sheet amounts were excluded from deposits at unaffiliated financial institutions. 

Deposits are primarily sourced from our Wealth Management clients and are considered to have stable, low-cost funding characteristics relative to other sources of funding. Each category of deposits presented above has a different cost profile and clients may respond differently to changes in interest rates and other macroeconomic conditions. The decrease in total deposits in 2023 was primarily driven by a continued reduction in Brokerage sweep deposits, largely due to net outflows to alternative cash equivalent and other products, partially offset by an increase in Time deposits and Savings.

1. Original maturity in the table is generally based on contractual final maturity. For borrowings with put options, remaining maturity represents the earliest put date. 

Borrowings of $264 billion at December 31, 2023 increased from $238 billion at December 31, 2022, primarily due to issuances net of maturities and redemptions and mark-to-market adjustments on equity-linked borrowings driven by market factors. 

We believe that accessing debt investors through multiple distribution channels helps provide consistent access to the unsecured markets. In addition, the issuance of borrowings with original maturities greater than one year allows us to reduce reliance on short-term credit-sensitive instruments. Borrowings with original maturities greater than one year are generally managed to achieve staggered maturities, thereby mitigating refinancing risk, and to maximize investor diversification through sales to global institutional and retail clients across regions, currencies and product types. 

The availability and cost of financing to us can vary depending on market conditions, the volume of certain trading and lending activities, our credit ratings and the overall availability of credit. We also engage in, and may continue to engage in, repurchases of our borrowings as part of our market-making activities. 

For further information on Borrowings, see Note 13 to the financial statements. 

Credit Ratings 

We rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our daily operations. Our credit ratings are one of the factors in the cost and availability of financing and can have an impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer-term counterparty performance is a key consideration, such as certain OTC derivative transactions. When determining credit ratings, rating agencies consider both company-specific and industry-wide factors. See also &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Liquidity Risk.&#8221;

Incremental Collateral or Terminating Payments 

In connection with certain OTC derivatives and certain other agreements where we are a liquidity provider to certain financing vehicles associated with the Institutional Securities business segment, we may be required to provide additional collateral, immediately settle any outstanding liability balances with certain counterparties or pledge additional collateral to certain clearing organizations in the event of a future credit rating downgrade irrespective of whether we are in a net asset or net liability position. See Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information on OTC derivatives that contain such contingent features. 

While certain aspects of a credit rating downgrade are quantifiable pursuant to contractual provisions, the impact it would have on our business and results of operations in future periods is inherently uncertain and would depend on a number of interrelated factors, including, among other things, the magnitude of the downgrade, the rating relative to peers, the rating assigned by the relevant agency before the downgrade, individual client behavior and future mitigating actions we might take. The liquidity impact of additional collateral requirements is included in our Liquidity Stress Tests. 

Capital Management 

We view capital as an important source of financial strength and actively manage our consolidated capital position based upon, among other things, business opportunities, risks, capital availability and rates of return together with internal capital policies, regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines. In the future, we may expand or contract our capital base to address the changing needs of our businesses.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We enter into various off-balance sheet arrangements, including through unconsolidated SPEs and lending-related financial instruments ( e.g. , guarantees and commitments), primarily in connection with the Institutional Securities and Investment Management business segments. 

We utilize SPEs primarily in connection with securitization activities. For information on our securitization activities, see Note 15 to the financial statements.

Regulatory Requirements 

Regulatory Capital Framework 

We are an FHC under the BHC Act and are subject to the regulation and oversight of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements for us, including &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; standards, and evaluates our compliance with such capital requirements. The OCC establishes similar capital requirements and standards for our U.S. Bank

Subsidiaries. The regulatory capital requirements are largely based on the Basel III capital standards established by the Basel Committee and also implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. For us to remain an FHC, we must remain well-capitalized in accordance with standards established by the Federal Reserve, and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must remain well-capitalized in accordance with standards established by the OCC. In addition, many of our regulated subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements, including regulated subsidiaries registered as swap dealers with the CFTC or conditionally registered as security-based swap dealers with the SEC or registered as broker-dealers or futures commission merchants. For additional information on regulatory capital requirements for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, as well as our subsidiaries that are swap entities, see Note 16 to the financial statements. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 

We are required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage-based capital and TLAC ratios. For additional information on TLAC, see &#8220;Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements&#8221; herein. 

Risk-Based Regulatory Capital . Risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital (which includes Tier 2 capital), each as a percentage of RWA, and consist of regulatory minimum required ratios plus our capital buffer requirement. Capital requirements require certain adjustments to, and deductions from, capital for purposes of determining these ratios.

2. For a further discussion of the G-SIB capital surcharge, see &#8220;G-SIB Capital Surcharge&#8221; herein. 

3. The CCyB can be set up to 2.5% but is currently set by the Federal Reserve at zero. 

The capital buffer requirement represents the amount of Common Equity Tier 1 capital we must maintain above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. Our capital buffer requirement computed under the standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market RWAs (&#8220;Standardized Approach&#8221;) is equal to the sum of our SCB, G-SIB capital surcharge and CCyB, and our capital 

buffer requirement computed under the applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk RWAs (&#8220;Advanced Approach&#8221;) is equal to our 2.5% capital conservation buffer, G-SIB capital surcharge and CCyB.

1. Required ratios represent the regulatory minimum plus the capital buffer requirement. 

Risk-Weighted Assets. RWA reflects both our on- and off-balance sheet risk, as well as capital charges attributable to the risk of loss arising from the following: 

&#8226; Credit risk: The failure of a borrower, counterparty or issuer to meet its financial obligations to us; 

&#8226; Market risk: Adverse changes in the level of one or more market prices, rates, spreads, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity; and 

&#8226; Operational risk: Inadequate or failed processes or systems, from human factors or from external events ( e.g. , fraud, theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage to physical assets). 

Our risk-based capital ratios are computed under each of (i) the Standardized Approach and (ii) the Advanced Approach. The credit risk RWA calculations between the two approaches differ in that the Standardized Approach requires calculation of RWA using prescribed risk weights and exposure methodologies, whereas the Advanced Approach utilizes models to calculate exposure amounts and risk weights. At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the differences between the actual and required ratios were lower under the Standardized Approach. 

Leverage-Based Regulatory Capital. Leverage-based capital requirements include a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%, a minimum SLR of 3% and an enhanced SLR capital buffer of at least 2%. 

CECL Deferral. Beginning on January 1, 2020, we elected to defer the effect of the adoption of CECL on our risk-based and leverage-based capital amounts and ratios, as well as our RWA, adjusted average assets and supplementary leverage exposure calculations, over a five-year transition period. The deferral impacts began to phase in at 25% per year from January 1, 2022 and are phased-in at 50% from January 1, 2023. The deferral impacts will become fully phased-in beginning on January 1, 2025.

Regulatory VaR&#8212;VaR for regulatory capital requirements 

In 2023, Credit risk RWA increased under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. Under the Standardized Approach, the increase was primarily driven by higher derivatives, higher securities financing transactions, higher equity investments, as well as an increase in Other credit risk driven by higher deferred tax assets and securitizations. These increases were partially offset by decreases in lending activity. Under the Advanced Approach, the increase was primarily driven by growth in Corporate lending, higher equity investments, higher derivatives, as well as increase in Other credit risk driven by higher deferred tax assets and securitizations. 

Market risk RWA decreased in 2023 under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches, primarily due to lower Regulatory VaR and stressed VaR driven by reductions in macro and commodities businesses, partially offset by higher Specific risk charges on securitization and non-securitization standardized charges. 

Operational risk RWA in 2023 remained relatively unchanged. 

G-SIB Capital Surcharge 

We and other U.S. G-SIBs are subject to an additional risk-based capital surcharge, the G-SIB capital surcharge, which must be satisfied using Common Equity Tier 1 capital and which functions as an extension of the capital conservation buffer. The surcharge is calculated based on the G-SIB&#8217;s size, 

interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, and complexity and substitutability (&#8220;Method 1&#8221;) or use of short-term wholesale funding (&#8220;Method 2&#8221;), whichever is higher. 

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements 

The Federal Reserve has established external TLAC, long-term debt (&#8220;LTD&#8221;) and clean holding company requirements for top-tier BHCs of U.S. G-SIBs (&#8220;covered BHCs&#8221;), including the Parent Company. These requirements are designed to ensure that covered BHCs will have enough loss-absorbing resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized through the conversion of eligible LTD to equity or otherwise by imposing losses on eligible LTD or other forms of TLAC where an SPOE resolution strategy is used (see &#8220;Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation&#8212;Financial Holding Company&#8212;Resolution and Recovery Planning&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk&#8221;). 

These TLAC and eligible LTD requirements include various restrictions, such as requiring eligible LTD to: be issued by the covered BHC; be unsecured; have a maturity of one year or more from the date of issuance; and not contain certain embedded features, such as a principal or redemption amount subject to reduction based on the performance of an asset, entity or index, or a similar feature. In addition, the requirements provide permanent grandfathering for debt instruments issued prior to December 31, 2016 that would be eligible LTD but for having impermissible acceleration clauses or being governed by foreign law. 

A covered BHC is also required to maintain minimum external TLAC equal to the greater of (i) 18% of total RWA or (ii) 7.5% of its total leverage exposure (the denominator of its SLR). Covered BHCs must also meet a minimum external LTD requirement equal to the greater of (i) total RWA multiplied by the sum of 6% plus the higher of the Method 1 or Method 2 G-SIB capital surcharge applicable to the Parent Company or (ii) 4.5% of its total leverage exposure. 

TLAC buffer requirements are imposed on top of both the risk-based and leverage exposure-based external TLAC minimum requirements. The risk-based TLAC buffer is equal to the sum of 2.5%, our Method 1 G-SIB surcharge and the CCyB, if any, as a percentage of total RWA. The leverage exposure-based TLAC buffer is equal to 2% of our total leverage exposure. Failure to maintain the buffers would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers.

3. Consists of TLAC-eligible LTD reduced by 50% for amounts of unpaid principal due to be paid in more than one year but less than two years from each respective balance sheet date. 

Furthermore, under the clean holding company requirements, a covered BHC is prohibited from incurring any external debt with an original maturity of less than one year or certain other liabilities, regardless of whether the liabilities are fully secured or otherwise senior to eligible LTD, or entering into certain other prohibited transactions. Certain other external liabilities, including those with certain embedded features noted above, are subject to a cap equal to 5% of the covered BHC&#8217;s outstanding external TLAC amount. Additionally, as of April 1, 2021, we and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are required to make certain deductions from regulatory capital for investments in certain unsecured debt instruments (including eligible LTD in the TLAC framework) issued by the Parent Company or other G-SIBs. 

We are in compliance with all TLAC requirements as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

Capital Plans, Stress Tests and the Stress Capital Buffer 

The Federal Reserve has capital planning and stress test requirements for large BHCs, which form part of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s annual CCAR framework. 

We must submit, on at least an annual basis, a capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate annual stress tests designed by us and the Federal Reserve, so that the Federal Reserve may assess our systems and processes that incorporate forward-looking projections of revenues and losses to monitor and maintain our internal capital adequacy. As banks with less than $250 billion of total assets, our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are not subject to company-run stress test regulatory requirements. 

The capital plan must include a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance or redemption of a debt or equity capital instrument, any capital distribution ( i.e. , payments of dividends or stock repurchases) and any similar action that the Federal Reserve determines could impact our consolidated 

capital. The capital plan must include a discussion of how we will maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios and how we will serve as a source of strength to our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries under supervisory stress scenarios. In addition, the Federal Reserve has issued guidance setting out its heightened expectations for capital planning practices at certain large financial institutions, including us. 

As part of its annual capital supervisory stress testing process, the Federal Reserve determines an SCB for each large BHC, including us. The SCB applies only with respect to Standardized Approach risk-based capital requirements and replaced the Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5%. The SCB is the greater of (i) the maximum decline in our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario over the supervisory stress test measurement period plus the sum of the four quarters of planned common stock dividends divided by the projected RWAs from the quarter in which the Firm&#8217;s projected Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio reaches its minimum in the supervisory stress test and (ii) 2.5%. 

The supervisory stress test assumes that BHCs generally maintain a constant level of assets and RWAs throughout the projection period. 

A firm&#8217;s SCB is subject to revision each year, taking effect from October 1 to reflect the results of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s annual supervisory stress test. The Federal Reserve has discretion to recalculate a firm&#8217;s SCB outside of the October 1 annual cycle and to require approval for certain actions, in some circumstances. The Federal Reserve also has the authority to impose restrictions on capital actions as a supervisory matter. 

For the 2023 capital planning and stress test cycle, we submitted our capital plan and company-run stress test results to the Federal Reserve on April 5, 2023. On June 28, 2023, the Federal Reserve published summary results of its supervisory stress tests of each large BHC, in which the projected decline in our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio in the severely adverse scenario improved from the prior annual supervisory stress test by 50 basis points, from 4.6% to 4.1%. Following the publication of the supervisory stress test results, and as a result of the increase in our common stock dividend and the resulting dividend add-on, we announced that our SCB will be 5.4% from October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024. Together with other features of the regulatory capital framework, this SCB results in an aggregate Standardized Approach Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 12.9%. 

We also disclosed a summary of the results of our company-run stress tests on our Investor Relations website and increased our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.85 per share from $0.775, beginning with the common stock dividend announced on July 18, 2023. Additionally, our Board of Directors reauthorized a multi-year common stock repurchase program of up to $20 billion, without a set

Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework 

Our required capital (&#8220;Required Capital&#8221;) estimation is based on the Required Capital framework, an internal capital adequacy measure. Common equity attribution to the business segments is based on capital usage calculated under the Required Capital framework, as well as each business segment&#8217;s relative contribution to our total Required Capital. 

The Required Capital framework is a risk-based and leverage-based capital measure, which is compared with our regulatory capital to ensure that we maintain an amount of going concern capital after absorbing potential losses from stress events, where applicable, at a point in time. The amount of capital allocated to the business segments is generally set at the beginning of each year and remains fixed throughout the year until the next annual reset unless a significant business change occurs (e.g . , acquisition or disposition). We define the difference between our total average common equity and the sum of the average common equity amounts allocated to our business segments as Parent Company common equity. We generally hold Parent Company common equity for prospective regulatory requirements, organic growth, potential future acquisitions and other capital needs.

2. The total average common equity and the allocation to the Investment Management business segment in 2021 reflect the Eaton Vance acquisition on March 1, 2021. 

We continue to evaluate our Required Capital framework with respect to the impact of evolving regulatory requirements, as appropriate. 

Resolution and Recovery Planning 

We are required to submit once every two years to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC (&#8220;Agencies&#8221;) a resolution plan that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of our material financial distress or failure. We submitted our 2021 targeted resolution plan on June 30, 2021. In November 2022, we received joint feedback on our 2021 resolution plan from the Agencies. The feedback indicated that there are no shortcomings or deficiencies in our 2021 resolution plan and that we had successfully addressed a prior shortcoming identified by the Agencies in the review of our 2019 full resolution plan. We submitted our 2023 full resolution plan 

on June 30, 2023. For more information about resolution planning requirements, see &#8220;Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation&#8212;Financial Holding Company&#8212;Resolution and Recovery Planning.&#8221; 

As described in our most recent resolution plan, our preferred resolution strategy is an SPOE strategy. In line with our SPOE strategy, the Parent Company has transferred, and has agreed to transfer on an ongoing basis, certain assets to its wholly owned, direct subsidiary Morgan Stanley Holdings LLC (the &#8220;Funding IHC&#8221;). In addition, the Parent Company has entered into an amended and restated support agreement with its material entities (including the Funding IHC) and certain other subsidiaries. In the event of a resolution scenario, the Parent Company would be obligated to contribute all of its contributable assets to our supported entities and/or the Funding IHC. The Funding IHC would be obligated to provide capital and liquidity, as applicable, to our supported entities. The combined implication of the SPOE resolution strategy and the requirement to maintain certain levels of TLAC is that losses in resolution would be imposed on the holders of eligible LTD and other forms of eligible TLAC issued by the Parent Company before any losses are imposed on creditors of our supported entities and without requiring taxpayer or government financial support. 

The obligations of the Parent Company and the Funding IHC under the amended and restated support agreement are in most cases secured on a senior basis by the assets of the Parent Company (other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company and certain other assets) and the assets of the Funding IHC. As a result, claims of our supported entities, including the Funding IHC, with respect to the secured assets, are effectively senior to unsecured obligations of the Parent Company.

Regulatory Developments and Other Matters 

Replacement of London Interbank Offered Rate and Replacement or Reform of Other Interest Rate Benchmarks 

Central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, have sponsored initiatives in recent years to replace LIBOR and replace or reform certain other interest rate benchmarks (collectively, the &#8220;IBORs&#8221;). 

With the cessation of publication of U.S. dollar LIBOR rates on a representative basis as of June 30, 2023, all LIBOR publications have ceased on a representative basis. However, the one-, three- and six-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and three-month sterling LIBOR rates are being published for a limited period for use in legacy transactions on the basis of a

synthetic methodology (known as &#8220;synthetic LIBOR&#8221;). Publication of the three-month synthetic sterling LIBOR will cease at the end of March 2024 and publication of the one-, three- and six-month synthetic U.S. dollar LIBOR will cease at the end of September 2024. 

As of December 31, 2023, a significant majority of our U.S. dollar LIBOR-referenced contracts contained fallback provisions or otherwise had a path that allowed for the transition to an alternative reference rate following the cessation of the applicable U.S. dollar LIBOR rate. We continue to execute against our Firmwide IBOR transition plan to complete the transition in all relevant markets to alternative reference rates. 

See also &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risk Management&#8221; for a further discussion of risks related to the planned replacement of the IBORs and/or reform of other interest rate benchmarks and related risks. 

FDIC Final Rulemaking on Special Assessment 

Following the failures of certain banks and resulting losses to the FDIC&#8217;s Deposit Insurance Fund in the first half of 2023, the FDIC adopted a final rule on November 16, 2023 to implement a special assessment to recover the cost associated with protecting uninsured depositors. Under the final rule, the assessment base for the special assessment is equal to an IDI&#8217;s estimated uninsured deposits reported as of December 31, 2022, adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion of uninsured deposits. The $5 billion exclusion is applied once to the aggregate uninsured deposits of our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. The final rule provides that, starting in 2024, the FDIC will collect the special assessment at a quarterly rate of 3.36 basis points over eight quarterly assessment periods, subject to change depending on any adjustments to the loss estimate, mergers, failures, or amendments to reported estimates of uninsured deposits. We recorded the cost of the entire special assessment of $286 million in Non-interest expenses when the final rule was published in the Federal Register, in the fourth quarter of 2023. 

Basel III Endgame Proposal 

On July 27, 2023, U.S. banking agencies proposed revisions to risk-based capital and related standards applicable to us and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries (&#8220;Basel III Endgame Proposal&#8221;). The proposal would introduce a new measure of RWAs known as &#8220;Expanded Total RWAs&#8221; (the &#8220;Expanded Approach&#8221;), reflecting new RWA methodologies that generally align with changes to the global Basel Accord adopted by the Basel Committee. The proposal would eliminate the current capital rule&#8217;s Advanced Approach and effectively replace it with the Expanded Approach, which more heavily relies on standardized methodologies. As compared with the Standardized Approach, the Expanded Approach includes more granular risk weights for credit risk and introduces a new market risk framework. In addition, unlike the Standardized Approach, the Expanded Approach 

includes operational risk and credit valuation adjustment RWA components. 

The Basel III Endgame Proposal, if adopted as a final rule, would maintain the current capital rule&#8217;s dual-requirement structure, whereby we and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries would be required to calculate our risk-based capital ratios under both the Expanded Approach and the Standardized Approach. In addition, the proposal would modify the Standardized Approach by requiring that the new market risk standards from the proposal also be applied in the Standardized Approach. 

The Basel III Endgame Proposal would apply the SCB and G-SIB surcharge to risk-based capital requirements calculated under both the Expanded Approach and the Standardized Approach. The proposal includes a proposed effective date of 

July 1, 2025, with three-year transition arrangements until revised standards are fully phased in on July 1, 2028. 

Based on our current understanding of the Basel III Endgame Proposal, we estimate that, if the Expanded Approach had applied on a fully phased-in basis as of December 31, 2023, and in the absence of taking any actions to mitigate its impact, our Expanded Approach RWAs as of that date would have been approximately 40% higher than our actual Standardized Approach RWAs as of that date. 

The increase in RWAs resulting from the Expanded Approach would result, assuming all other surcharge elements remained unchanged, in a lower SCB and lower G-SIB Method 2 surcharge as compared with current surcharges, as RWAs are included in the denominators of the relevant calculations for each buffer. Lower surcharges would, therefore, partially decrease the otherwise higher regulatory capital requirements under the Expanded Approach. The proposal would phase in the higher Expanded Approach RWAs on July 1 of each year during the transition, thereby increasing our regulatory capital requirements, with delayed incorporation of the potentially lower SCB and G-SIB Method 2 capital surcharge calculations. 

Any estimate of how the Expanded Approach may impact us is a forward-looking statement and subject to uncertainty, as actual results may differ from the anticipated results and may be materially affected by and dependent on a range of factors, including business performance, future capital actions, the results of future supervisory stress tests, and potential modifications to the proposal by the U.S. banking agencies in a final rulemaking. The Firm does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. 

G-SIB Surcharge Proposal 

On July 27, 2023, the Federal Reserve proposed revisions to the G-SIB capital surcharge framework applicable to us (&#8220;G-SIB Surcharge Proposal&#8221;). The G-SIB Surcharge Proposal includes various technical revisions to the G-SIB capital surcharge methodology and would revise the resulting

Method 2 G-SIB capital surcharge from 0.5-percentage point increments to 0.1-percentage point increments. The G-SIB Surcharge Proposal includes a proposed effective date two calendar quarters after the date of adoption of a final rule by the Federal Reserve. We continue to evaluate the G-SIB Surcharge Proposal and the potential impacts, if adopted, on our capital requirements and our Required Capital framework.
