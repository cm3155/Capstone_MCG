Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Executive Summary 

Overview of Financial Results 

Consolidated Results&#8212;Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 

&#8226; The Firm reported net revenues of $14.5 billion and net income of $3.0 billion as our businesses navigated a volatile market environment. 

&#8226; The Firm delivered ROTCE of 16.9% (see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein). 

&#8226; The Firm&#8217;s expense efficiency ratio was 72%. Expenses for the quarter include integration-related expenses of $77 million. 

&#8226; At March 31, 2023, the Firm&#8217;s Standardized Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 15.1%. 

&#8226; Institutional Securities net revenues of $6.8 billion reflect strong performance in Equity and Fixed Income despite a less favorable market environment compared to a year ago and lower results in Investment Banking. 

&#8226; Wealth Management net revenues were $6.6 billion, positively impacted by mark-to-market gains on investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans compared to losses a year ago. The business delivered a pre-tax margin of 26.1%. Results reflect higher net interest income versus prior year, primarily driven by higher interest rates, even as clients continue to redeploy sweep deposits. These results were partially offset by an increase in expenses as well as higher provisions for credit losses. 

&#8226; Wealth Management attracted significant net new assets of $110 billion during the quarter. 

&#8226; Investment Management results reflect net revenues of $1.3 billion on AUM of $1.4 trillion amid declines in asset values from a year ago.

Earnings per Diluted Common Share 

We reported net revenues of $14.5 billion in the quarter ended March 31, 2023 (&#8220;current quarter,&#8221; or &#8220;1Q 2023&#8221;) compared with $14.8 billion in the quarter ended March 31, 2022 (&#8220;prior year quarter,&#8221; or &#8220;1Q 2022&#8221;). For the current quarter, net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $3.0 billion, or $1.70 per diluted common share, compared with $3.7 billion, or $2.02 per diluted common share in the prior year quarter.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Non-interest Expenses 1 

($ in millions) 

1. The percentages on the bars in the chart represent the contribution of compensation and benefits expenses and non-compensation expenses to the total. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses of $6,410 million in the current quarter increased 2% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher expenses related to certain deferred cash-based compensation plans linked to investment performance, higher stock-based compensation expense driven by the Firm&#8217;s share price, and higher salary expenses driven in part by the impact of higher headcount, partially offset by lower discretionary incentive compensation on lower revenues and a decrease in the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives driven by lower compensable revenues. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses of $4,113 million in the current quarter increased 6% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher spend on technology, higher marketing and business development costs and higher legal expenses. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $234 million in the current quarter was primarily related to a deterioration in both the macroeconomic outlook and our expectations of commercial real estate borrowers. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments in the prior year quarter was $57 million, primarily driven by portfolio growth. 

For further information on the Provision for credit losses, see &#8220;Credit Risk&#8221; herein. 

Income Taxes 

The effective tax rate of 19.3% for the current quarter was substantially similar to the prior year quarter, both periods reflecting a benefit associated with employee share-based awards, which primarily settled in the first quarter of each year.

1. The percentages on the bars in the charts represent the contribution of each business segment to the total of the applicable financial category and may not sum to 100% due to intersegment eliminations. See Note 19 to the financial statements for details of intersegment eliminations. 

&#8226; Institutional Securities net revenues of $6,797 million in the current quarter decreased 11% from the elevated levels in the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting lower results from Equity, Investment Banking and Fixed income, partially offset by higher other net revenues. 

&#8226; Wealth Management net revenues of $6,559 million in the current quarter increased 11% from the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting gains on investments associated with certain employee deferred cash-based compensation plans compared with losses in the prior year quarter and higher Net interest revenues, partially offset by lower Asset management revenues driven by lower fee-based asset levels in the current quarter resulting from lower market levels, partially offset by the impact of positive fee-based flows. 

&#8226; Investment Management net revenues of $1,289 million in the current quarter decreased 3% from the prior year quarter, reflecting lower AUM due to the decline in asset values and cumulative outflows over the prior year, partially offset by higher Performance-based income and other revenues.

2. For a discussion of how the geographic breakdown of net revenues is determined, see Note 23 to the financial statements in the 2022 Form 10-K. 

Americas net revenues in the current quarter increased 3% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by results within the Wealth Management business segment, partially offset by Equity results within the Institutional Securities business segment. EMEA net revenues decreased 25% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by Fixed income, Investment banking and Equity results within the Institutional Securities business segment. Asia net revenues in the current quarter continued to reflect the strong levels in the prior year quarter.

March 2023 Form 10-Q 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Economic and Market Conditions 

The global economic and geopolitical environment continues to be characterized by elevated inflation, rising interest rates and volatility in global financial markets and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook. This environment has impacted our businesses, as discussed further in &#8220;Business Segments&#8221; herein, and, to the extent that it continues to deteriorate, could adversely impact client confidence and related activity. In addition to the aforementioned conditions, certain financial institutions have recently come under significant stress. While the full impact of these events in the U.S. or global banking sector remains uncertain, they have not significantly impacted our results or financial condition. For more information on economic and market conditions and their potential effects on our future results, refer to &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; in the 2022 Form 10-K. 

Following the recent failure of several financial institutions and resulting losses to the FDIC&#8217;s Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) it is likely that the FDIC will assess certain financial institutions, including the Firm, for additional amounts to be provided to the DIF. While such special assessments have not been determined, they may impact our future operating results. 

Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information 

We prepare our financial statements using U.S. GAAP. From time to time, we may disclose certain &#8220;non-GAAP financial measures&#8221; in this document or in the course of our earnings releases, earnings and other conference calls, financial presentations, definitive proxy statements and other public disclosures. A &#8220;non-GAAP financial measure&#8221; excludes, or includes, amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We consider the non-GAAP financial measures we disclose to be useful to us, investors, analysts and other stakeholders by providing further transparency about, or an alternate means of assessing or comparing our financial condition, operating results and capital adequacy. 

These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally define it or present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the U.S. GAAP financial measure and the non-GAAP financial measure. 

In the fourth quarter of 2022, we introduced new non-GAAP financial measures and have presented comparable prior year quarter amounts for the first time in the following table. These measures exclude the impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on investments associated with certain employee deferred cash-based compensation plans from net revenues and compensation expenses. These employee deferred cash- 

based compensation plans are primarily reflected in our Wealth Management business segment. For more information, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Executive Summary&#8221; in the 2022 Form 10-K. 

The principal non-GAAP financial measures presented in this document are set forth in the following tables.

2. Average common equity and average tangible common equity for each business segment is determined using our Required Capital framework (see &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Requirements&#8212;Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework&#8221; herein). The sums of the segments&#8217; Average common equity and Average tangible common equity do not equal the Consolidated measures due to Parent equity. 

3. The calculation of ROE and ROTCE by segment uses net income applicable to Morgan Stanley by segment less preferred dividends allocated to each segment as a percentage of average common equity and average tangible common equity, respectively, allocated to each segment. 

Return on Tangible Common Equity Goal 

We have an ROTCE goal of over 20%. Our ROTCE goal is a forward-looking statement that is based on a normal market environment and may be materially affected by many factors. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; in the 2022 Form 10-K for further information on market and economic conditions and their potential effects on our future operating results. ROTCE represents a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on non-GAAP measures, see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein. 

Business Segments 

Substantially all of our operating revenues and operating expenses are directly attributable to our business segments. Certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures. See Note 19 to the financial statements for segment net revenues by income statement line item and information on intersegment transactions. 

For an overview of the components of our business segments, net revenues, compensation expense and income taxes, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Business Segments&#8221; in the 2022 Form 10-K.

Investment Banking Revenues 

Revenues of $1,247 million in the current quarter decreased 24% compared with the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting lower advisory revenues. 

&#8226; Advisory revenues decreased primarily due to fewer completed M&#38;A transactions. 

&#8226; Equity underwriting revenues decreased primarily due to lower initial public offerings. 

&#8226; Fixed income underwriting revenues decreased primarily due to lower non-investment grade loan issuances. 

Investment Banking continues to operate in a global economic and geopolitical environment characterized by significantly reduced M&#38;A and underwriting activity amid elevated inflation, rising interest rates and volatility in global financial markets and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook and client confidence . T o the extent that the environment continues to deteriorate, it could adversely impact global announced M&#38;A transactions and underwriting volumes, and as a result, continue to adversely impact our Investment Banking revenues.

3. Includes Investments and Other revenues. 

Equity 

Net revenues of $2,729 million in the current quarter decreased 14% compared with the prior year quarter, reflecting a decrease in execution services and financing. 

&#8226; Financing revenues decreased primarily due to lower average client balances reflective of market declines. 

&#8226; Execution services revenues decreased primarily due to lower gains from the impact of market conditions on inventory held to facilitate client activity and lower client activity across products compared to the prior year quarter. 

Fixed Income 

Net revenues of $2,576 million in the current quarter decreased 12% compared with the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting a decrease in foreign exchange products and commodities, partially offset by increases in rates and credit products. 

&#8226; Global macro products revenues decreased primarily due to a decline in foreign exchange products, partially offset by an increase from market conditions on inventory held to

facilitate client activity in rates products reflective of interest rate volatility across regions. 

&#8226; Credit products revenues increased, supported by client engagement, reflecting the impact of market conditions on inventory held to facilitate client activity in corporate credit products and municipal securities. 

&#8226; Commodities products and other fixed income revenues decreased compared to elevated results in the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower gains from the impact of market conditions on inventory held to facilitate client activity and lower client activity in Commodities. 

Other Net Revenues 

Other net revenues reflected a gain of $245 million in the current quarter compared with a loss of $74 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to gains compared with losses in the prior year quarter on investments associated with certain employee deferred cash-based compensation plans, higher net interest income on corporate loans, and lower mark-to-market losses on corporate loans inclusive of hedges. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $189 million in the current quarter was primarily related to a deterioration in both the macroeconomic outlook and our expectations of commercial real estate borrowers. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments was $44 million in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by portfolio growth.

Non-interest expenses of $4,716 million in the current quarter decreased 2% compared with the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower Compensation and benefits expenses, partially offset by higher Non-compensation expenses. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses decreased in the current quarter, primarily due to lower discretionary incentive compensation on lower revenues, partially offset by higher stock-based compensation expense driven by the Firm&#8217;s share price and higher expenses related to certain deferred cash-based compensation plans linked to investment performance. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses increased in the current quarter, primarily due to an increase in legal expenses and higher marketing and business development costs.

Net Revenues 

Asset Management 

Asset management revenues of $3,382 million in the current quarter decreased 7% compared with the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower fee-based asset levels in the current quarter resulting from lower market levels, partially offset by the cumulative impact of positive fee-based flows. 

See &#8220;Fee-Based Client Assets&#8212;Rollforwards&#8221; herein. 

Transactional Revenues 

Transactional revenues of $921 million in the current quarter increased 45% compared with the prior year quarter, 

March 2023 Form 10-Q 9 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

primarily due to gains on investments associated with certain employee deferred cash-based compensation plans compared with losses in the prior year quarter, partially offset by fewer new issuances and reduced client activity. 

For further information on the impact of investments associated with certain employee deferred cash-based compensation plans, see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein. 

Net Interest 

Net interest revenues of $2,158 million in the current quarter increased 40% compared with the prior year quarter, primarily due to the net effect of higher interest rates, partially offset by the impact of a reduction in brokerage sweep deposits in excess of our expectations. 

The level and pace of interest rate changes and other macroeconomic factors continue to impact client demand for loans, client preferences for cash allocation to other products and the pace of reallocation of client balances, resulting in changes in the deposit mix and associated interest expense. If these trends persist, net interest income may continue to be impacted in future periods. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $45 million in the current quarter was primarily driven by deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments was $13 million in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by portfolio growth. 

Non-interest Expenses 

Non-interest expenses of $4,802 million in the current quarter increased 10% compared with the prior year quarter, as a result of higher Compensation and benefits expenses and higher Non-compensation expenses. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses increased in the current quarter primarily due to higher expenses related to certain deferred cash-based compensation plans linked to investment performance and the impact of higher headcount, partially offset by a decrease in the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives driven by lower compensable revenues. 

For further information on the impact of expenses related to certain employee deferred cash-based compensation plans linked to investment performance, see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses increased in the current quarter primarily driven by higher spend on technology and higher marketing and business development costs.

Net Revenues 

Asset Management and Related Fees 

Asset management and related fees of $1,248 million in the current quarter decreased 10% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower average AUM driven by the decline in asset values and the cumulative effect of net outflows in Long-Term AUM. 

Asset management revenues are influenced by the level and relative mix of AUM and related fee rates. The market environment in recent quarters has led to a decline in asset prices, which in turn, negatively impacted our AUM level across asset classes. To the extent the market condition deteriorates further, or we continue to see net outflows of Long-Term AUM, we would expect our Asset management revenue to continue to be negatively impacted. 

See &#8220;Assets under Management or Supervision&#8221; herein. 

Performance-based Income and Other 

Performance-based income and other revenues were a gain of $41 million in the current quarter, representing an increase from the prior year quarter, primarily due to gains on investments associated with certain employee deferred cash-based compensation plans and mark-to-market gains on public investments compared with losses in the prior year quarter, partially offset by lower accrued carried interest. 

Non-interest Expenses 

Non-interest expenses of $1,123 million in the current quarter increased 1% from the prior year quarter primarily due to higher Compensation and benefits. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses increased in the current quarter primarily due to higher expenses related to certain deferred cash-based compensation plans linked to investment performance, partially offset by lower compensation associated with carried interest. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses were relatively unchanged.

Accounting Development Updates 

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued certain accounting updates that apply to us. Accounting updates not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or to not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption. 

We are currently evaluating the following accounting update; However, we do not expect a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption: 

&#8226; Investments&#8212;Tax Credit Structures . This accounting update permits an election to account for tax equity investments using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. Under the proportional amortization method, the initial cost of the investment is amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received. The net amortization and income tax credits and other income tax benefits are recognized in the income statement as a component of provision for income taxes. The update also requires disclosures of certain information that enable investors and other users of our financial statements to understand the nature of (i) the tax equity investments in projects that generate income tax credits and other income tax benefits from a program for which the proportional amortization method has been elected and (ii) the impact of the tax equity investments and related income tax credits on the financial condition and results of operations. The ASU will be effective January 1, 2024, with early adoption permitted. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 to the financial statements). We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the financial statements in the 2022 Form 10-K and Note 2 to the financial statements), the fair value of financial instruments, goodwill and intangible assets, legal and regulatory contingencies (see Note 15 to the financial statements in the 2022 Form 10-K and Note 13 to the financial statements) and income taxes policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. For a further discussion about our critical accounting policies, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; in the 2022 Form 10-K. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our liquidity and capital policies are established and maintained by senior management, with oversight by the Asset/Liability Management Committee and the Board of Directors (&#8220;Board&#8221;). Through various risk and control committees, senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity, interest rate and currency sensitivity of our asset and liability position. Our Treasury department, Firm Risk Committee, Asset/Liability Management Committee, and other committees and control groups assist in evaluating, monitoring and managing the impact that our business activities have on our balance sheet, liquidity and capital structure. Liquidity and capital matters are reported regularly to the Board and the Risk Committee of the Board.
