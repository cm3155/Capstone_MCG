Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Executive Summary 

Overview of Financial Results 

Consolidated Results&#8212;Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 

&#8226; The Firm reported net revenues of $13.5 billion and net income of $2.2 billion as our businesses navigated an environment that remains challenging. 

&#8226; The Firm delivered ROTCE of 12.1% (see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein). 

&#8226; The Firm&#8217;s expense efficiency ratio for the first half of the year was 75%. Expenses for the quarter include severance costs associated with the May employee action of $308 million and integration-related expenses of $99 million. 

&#8226; At June 30, 2023, the Firm&#8217;s Standardized Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 15.5%. 

&#8226; Institutional Securities net revenues of $5.7 billion reflect continued muted activity in Investment Banking and declines in Equity and Fixed Income driven by lower client activity in a less favorable market environment compared to a year ago. 

&#8226; Wealth Management added net new client assets of $90 billion and net revenues of $6.7 billion, which reflect higher net interest income and the positive impact of investments associated with certain employee deferred cash-based compensation plans (&#8220;DCP investments&#8221;). Pre-tax margin was 25.2%, reflecting higher compensation expenses driven by severance costs associated with the May employee action, integration-related expenses and higher provisions for credit losses. 

&#8226; Investment Management results reflect net revenues of $1.3 billion on AUM of $1.4 trillion and positive net flows in long-term and liquidity asset classes.

Non-interest Expenses 1 

($ in millions) 

1. The percentages on the bars in the chart represent the contribution of compensation and benefits expenses and non-compensation expenses to the total. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses of $6,262 million in the current quarter increased 13% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher expenses related to certain deferred cash-based compensation plans linked to investment performance (&#8220;DCP&#8221;) and severance costs associated with the May employee action, partially offset by lower discretionary incentive compensation on lower revenues. 

Compensation and benefits expenses of $12,672 million in the current year period increased 7% from the prior year period, primarily due to higher expenses related to DCP and higher salary expenses, partially offset by lower discretionary incentive compensation on lower revenues. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses of $4,222 million in the current quarter increased 1% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher execution-related expenses, increased spend on technology, higher occupancy expenses and higher professional services expenses, partially offset by lower legal expenses. 

Non-compensation expenses of $8,335 million in the current year period increased 4% from the prior year period, primarily due to increased spend on technology, higher marketing and business development cost, higher 

occupancy expenses and higher professional services expenses, partially offset by lower legal expenses. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $161 million in the current quarter was primarily related to credit deterioration in commercial real estate lending, mainly in the office sector, and modest growth in certain loan portfolios. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments in the prior year quarter was $101 million, primarily due to portfolio growth and deterioration in macroeconomic outlook. 

The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $395 million in the current year period was primarily related to credit deterioration in commercial real estate lending, mainly in the office sector, modest growth in certain loan portfolios and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments in the prior year period was $158 million, primarily due to portfolio growth and deterioration in macroeconomic outlook. 

For further information on the Provision for credit losses, see &#8220;Credit Risk&#8221; herein. 

Income Taxes 

The effective tax rate of 21.0% for the current quarter was lower compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by the level and geographic mix of earnings.

Economic and Market Conditions 

The global economic and geopolitical environment continues to be characterized by inflationary pressures, high interest rates, and uncertainty regarding the possibility of a recession, driving muted activity. This environment has impacted our businesses, as discussed further in &#8220;Business Segments&#8221; herein, and, to the extent that it continues to remain uncertain, could adversely impact client confidence and related activity.

Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information 

We prepare our financial statements using U.S. GAAP. From time to time, we may disclose certain &#8220;non-GAAP financial measures&#8221; in this document or in the course of our earnings releases, earnings and other conference calls, financial presentations, definitive proxy statements and other public disclosures. A &#8220;non-GAAP financial measure&#8221; excludes, or includes, amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We consider the non-GAAP financial measures we disclose to be useful to us, investors, analysts and other stakeholders by providing further transparency about, or an alternate means of assessing or comparing our financial condition, operating results and capital adequacy. 

These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally define it or present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the U.S. GAAP financial measure and the non-GAAP financial measure. 

The principal non-GAAP financial measures presented in this document are set forth in the following tables.

2. Average common equity and average tangible common equity for each business segment is determined using our Required Capital framework (see &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Requirements&#8212;Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework&#8221; herein). The sums of the segments&#8217; Average common equity and Average tangible common equity do not equal the Consolidated measures due to Parent equity. 

3. The calculation of ROE and ROTCE by segment uses net income applicable to Morgan Stanley by segment less preferred dividends allocated to each segment as a percentage of average common equity and average tangible common equity, respectively, allocated to each segment. 

Return on Tangible Common Equity Goal 

We have an ROTCE goal of over 20%. Our ROTCE goal is a forward-looking statement that is based on a normal market environment and may be materially affected by many factors. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; in the 2022 Form 10-K for further information on market and economic conditions and their potential effects on our future operating results. ROTCE represents a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on non-GAAP measures, see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein. 

Business Segments 

Substantially all of our operating revenues and operating expenses are directly attributable to our business segments. Certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures. See Note 19 to the financial statements for segment net revenues by income statement line item and information on intersegment transactions. 

For an overview of the components of our business segments, net revenues, compensation expense and income taxes, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Business Segments&#8221; in the 2022 Form 10-K.

Net Revenues 

Asset Management 

Asset management revenues of $3,452 million in the current quarter and $6,834 million in the current year period decreased 2% and 4%, respectively, when compared with the prior year periods, primarily reflecting lower fee-based asset levels due to declines in the markets, partially offset by the cumulative impact of positive fee-based flows. 

See &#8220;Fee-Based Client Assets&#8212;Rollforwards&#8221; herein. 

Transactional Revenues 

Transactional revenues of $869 million in the current quarter increased by $578 million from the prior year quarter, primarily due to an increase of $597 million due to mark-to-market gains on DCP investments compared with losses in the prior year quarte r, partially offset by lower client activity. 

In the current year period, transactional revenues of $1,790 million increased by $864 million from the prior year period, primarily due to an increase of $991 million due to mark-to-market gains on DCP investments compared with losses in the prior year period, partially offset by lower client activity.

Net Interest 

Net interest revenues of $2,156 million in the current quarter and $4,314 million in the current year period increased 23% and 31%, respectively, when compared with the prior year periods, primarily due to the net effect of higher interest rates, partially offset by the impact of lower brokerage sweep deposits as client preferences continue to evolve. 

The level and pace of interest rate changes and other macroeconomic factors continue to impact client demand for loans, client preferences for cash allocation to other products and the pace of reallocation of client balances, resulting in changes in the deposit mix and associated interest expense. If these trends persist, net interest income may continue to be impacted in future periods. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $64 million in the current quarter was primarily related to credit deterioration in commercial real estate lending, mainly in the office sectors. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments was $19 million in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by portfolio growth in Residential real estate loans and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook.

Net Revenues 

Asset Management and Related Fees 

Asset management and related fees of $1,268 million in the current quarter and $2,516 million in the current year period decreased 3% and 7%, respectively, from the prior year periods, primarily driven by lower average AUM due to the decline in asset values from the prior year quarter commensurate with the market environment, and the cumulative effect of net outflows in Long-Term AUM. 

Asset management revenues are influenced by the level and relative mix of AUM and related fee rates. The market environment in recent quarters has led to a decline in asset prices, which in turn, negatively impacted our average AUM 

level across asset classes. To the extent the market condition deteriorates further, or we continue to see net outflows of Long-Term AUM, we would expect our Asset management revenue to continue to be negatively impacted. 

See &#8220;Assets under Management or Supervision&#8221; herein. 

Performance-based Income and Other 

Performance-based income and other revenues were $13 million in the current quarter, representing an 88% decrease from the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower accrued carried interest across private funds, partially offset by mark-to-market gains in the current year quarter compared with losses in the prior year quarter on DCP investments and public investments. 

Performance-based income and other revenues of $54 million in the current year period remained unchanged from the prior year period, as lower accrued carried interest across private funds was offset by mark-to-market gains in the current year period compared with losses in the prior year period on DCP investments and public investments. 

Non-interest Expenses 

Non-interest expenses of $1,111 million in the current quarter and $2,234 million in the current year period decreased 4% and 2%, respectively, from the prior year periods, primarily due to lower Compensation and benefits. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses decreased in both the current quarter and current year period primarily due to lower expenses related to compensation associated with carried interest, partially offset by higher expenses related to DCP. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses were relatively unchanged for the current year quarter and current year period.

Accounting Development Updates 

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued certain accounting updates that apply to us. Accounting updates not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or to not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption. 

We are currently evaluating the following accounting update; However, we do not expect a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption: 

&#8226; Investments&#8212;Tax Credit Structures . This accounting update permits an election to account for tax equity investments using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. The update requires a separate accounting policy election to be made for each tax credit program. Under the proportional amortization method, the initial cost of the investment is amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received. The amortization of the investment and the income tax credits and other income tax benefits are recognized net in the income statement as a component of provision for income taxes. The update also requires disclosures of certain information that enable investors and other users of our financial statements to understand the nature of (i) the tax equity investments in projects that generate income tax credits and other income tax benefits from a program for which the proportional amortization method has been elected and (ii) the impact of the tax equity investments and related income tax credits on the financial condition and results of operations. The ASU will be effective January 1, 2024, with early adoption permitted. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 to the financial statements). We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the financial statements in the 2022 Form 10-K and Note 2 to the financial statements), the fair value of financial instruments, goodwill and intangible assets, legal and regulatory contingencies (see Note 15 to the financial statements in the 2022 Form 10-K and Note 13 to the financial statements) and income taxes policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. For a further discussion about our critical accounting policies, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; in the 2022 Form 10-K. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our liquidity and capital policies are established and maintained by senior management, with oversight by the Asset/Liability Management Committee and the Board of Directors (&#8220;Board&#8221;). Through various risk and control committees, senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity, interest rate and currency sensitivity of our asset and liability position. Our Treasury department, Firm Risk Committee, Asset/Liability Management Committee, and other committees and control groups assist in evaluating, monitoring and managing the impact that our business activities have on our balance sheet, liquidity and capital structure. Liquidity and capital matters are reported regularly to the Board and the Risk Committee of the Board.
