Non-interest Expenses 1 

($ in millions) 

1. The percentages on the bars in the chart represent the contribution of compensation and benefits expenses and non-compensation expenses to the total. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses of $23,053 million in 2022 decreased 6% from the prior year, primarily due to lower expenses related to certain deferred cash-based compensation plans linked to investment performance, lower discretionary incentive compensation on lower revenues, and lower stock-based compensation expense driven by the Firm&#8217;s share price, partially offset by higher salary expenses driven in part by the impact of higher headcount. 

2022 Compensation and benefits expenses included $133 million associated with a December employee action recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses of $16,246 million in 2022 increased 5% from the prior year, primarily due to an increased spend on technology and higher legal expenses, including $200 million related to a regulatory matter in the second quarter of 2022. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $280 million in 2022 was due to portfolio growth and deterioration in macroeconomic outlook. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $4 million in 2021 was primarily as a result of portfolio growth offset by the impact of changes in loan quality mix. 

Income Taxes 

The Firm's effective tax rate of 20.7% for 2022 was lower compared with the prior year, primarily driven by the realization of certain tax benefits.

Net Income Applicable to Morgan Stanley by Segment 1 

($ in millions) 

1. The percentages on the bars in the charts represent the contribution of each business segment to the total of the applicable financial category and may not sum to 100% due to intersegment eliminations. See Note 23 to the financial statements for details of intersegment eliminations. 

&#8226; Institutional Securities net revenues of $24,393 million in 2022 decreased 18% from the prior year, primarily reflecting lower results from Investment banking, particularly equity underwriting, and losses in Other net revenues primarily from higher mark-to-market losses on corporate loans held for sale inclusive of hedges, partially offset by higher Fixed income results, particularly in global macro products. 

&#8226; Wealth Management net revenues of $24,417 million in 2022 increased 1% from the prior year, as higher Net interest revenues were offset by lower Transactional revenues, primarily driven by losses on investments associated with certain employee deferred cash-based compensation plans.

Asia net revenues decreased 10%, primarily driven by results within the Institutional Securities business segment, with lower results in Investment banking and Equity, partially offset by higher results from Fixed income.

Russia and Ukraine War 

We continue to monitor the war in Ukraine and its impact on both the Ukrainian and Russian economies, as well as related impacts on other world economies and the financial markets. Our direct exposure to both Russia and Ukraine remains limited. We are not entering any new business onshore in Russia and our activities in Russia are limited to helping global clients address and close out pre-existing obligations. 

Refer to &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; for more information on the potential effects of geopolitical events and acts of war or aggression. 

Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information 

We prepare our financial statements using U.S. GAAP. From time to time, we may disclose certain &#8220;non-GAAP financial measures&#8221; in this document or in the course of our earnings releases, earnings and other conference calls, financial presentations, definitive proxy statement and otherwise. A &#8220;non-GAAP financial measure&#8221; excludes, or includes, amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We consider the non-GAAP financial measures we disclose to be useful to us, investors, analysts and other stakeholders by providing further transparency about, or an alternate means of assessing or comparing our financial condition, operating results and capital adequacy. 

These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally define it or present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the U.S. GAAP financial measure and the non-GAAP financial measure. 

In the fourth quarter of 2022, we introduced new non-GAAP financial measures. These measures exclude the impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on investments associated with certain employee deferred cash-based compensation plans from net revenues and compensation expenses. These employee deferred cash-based compensation plans are primarily reflected in our Wealth Management business segment. We consider these new measures useful for analysts, investors, and other stakeholders to allow better comparability of period-to-period underlying operating performance and revenue trends, especially in our Wealth Management business segment. By excluding the impact of these items we are better able to describe the business drivers and resulting impact to net revenues and corresponding change to the associated compensation expenses. 

Compensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation awards is calculated based on the notional value of the award granted, adjusted for changes in the fair value of the 

referenced investments that employees select. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period relevant to each separately vesting portion of deferred awards. 

We invest directly, as a principal, in financial instruments and other investments to economically hedge certain of our obligations under these deferred cash-based compensation plans. Changes in the fair value of such investments, net of financing costs, are recorded in Net revenues, and included in Transactional revenues in the Wealth Management business segment. Although changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value of the referenced investments will generally be offset by changes in the fair value of investments recognized in net revenues, there is typically a timing difference between the immediate recognition of gains and losses on our investments and the deferred recognition of the related compensation expense over the vesting period. While this timing difference may not be material to our Income before provision for income taxes in any individual period, it may impact the Wealth Management business segment reported ratios and operating metrics in certain periods due to potentially significant impacts to net revenues and compensation expenses. For additional information on deferred cash-based compensation, refer to &#8220;Other Matters&#8221; herein. 

The principal non-GAAP financial measures presented in this document are set forth in the following tables.

4. Average common equity and average tangible common equity for each business segment is determined using our Required Capital framework (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Requirements&#8212;Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework&#8221; herein). The sums of the segments&#8217; Average common equity and Average tangible common equity do not equal the Consolidated measures due to Parent equity. 

5. The calculation of ROE and ROTCE by segment uses net income applicable to Morgan Stanley by segment less preferred dividends allocated to each segment as a percentage of average common equity and average tangible common equity, respectively, allocated to each segment.

Return on Tangible Common Equity Goal 

We have an ROTCE goal of over 20%. Our ROTCE goal is a forward-looking statement that was based on a normal market environment and may be materially affected by many factors. 

See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; herein for further information on market and economic conditions and their potential effects on our future operating results. 

For further information on non-GAAP measures (ROTCE excluding integration-related expenses), see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein. 

Business Segments 

Substantially all of our operating revenues and operating expenses are directly attributable to our business segments. Certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures. See Note 23 to the financial statements for segment net revenues by income statement line item and information on intersegment transactions. 

The global economic and geopolitical environment in 2022 was characterized by elevated inflation, rising interest rates and volatility in global financial markets and these factors have continued into 2023. This environment has impacted our businesses, as discussed further herein. 

Net Revenues 

Investment Banking 

Investment banking revenues are derived from client engagements in which we act as an advisor, underwriter or distributor of capital. 

Within the Institutional Securities business segment, these revenues are primarily composed of fees earned from underwriting equity and fixed income securities, syndicating loans and advisory services in relation to mergers and acquisitions, divestitures and corporate restructurings. 

Within the Wealth Management business segment, these revenues are derived from the distribution of newly issued securities. 

Trading 

Trading revenues include the realized gains and losses from transactions in financial instruments, unrealized gains and losses from ongoing changes in the fair value of our positions, and gains and losses from financial instruments used to economically hedge compensation expense related to certain employee deferred compensation plans. 

Within the Institutional Securities business segment, Trading revenues arise from transactions in cash instruments and 

derivatives in which we act as a market maker for our clients. In this role, we stand ready to buy, sell or otherwise transact with customers under a variety of market conditions and to provide firm or indicative prices in response to customer requests. Our liquidity obligations can be explicit in some cases, and in others, customers expect us to be willing to transact with them. In order to most effectively fulfill our market-making function, we engage in activities across all of our trading businesses that include, but are not limited to: 

&#8226; taking positions in anticipation of, and in response to, customer demand to buy or sell and&#8212;depending on the liquidity of the relevant market and the size of the position&#8212;to hold those positions for a period of time; 

&#8226; building, maintaining and rebalancing inventory held to facilitate client activity through trades with other market participants; 

&#8226; managing and assuming basis risk (risk associated with imperfect hedging) between risks incurred from the facilitation of client transactions and the standardized products available in the market to hedge those risks; 

&#8226; trading in the market to remain current on pricing and trends; and 

&#8226; engaging in other activities to provide efficiency and liquidity for markets. 

In many markets, the realized and unrealized gains and losses from purchase and sale transactions will include any spreads between bids and offers. Certain fees received on loans carried at fair value and dividends from equity securities are also recorded in Trading revenues since they relate to positions carried at fair value. 

Within the Wealth Management business segment, Trading revenues primarily include revenues from customers&#8217; purchases and sales of fixed income instruments in which we act as principal, as well as gains and losses related to investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans. 

Investments 

Investments revenues are composed of realized and unrealized gains and losses derived from investments, including those associated with employee deferred compensation and co-investment plans. Estimates of the fair value of the investments that produce these revenues may involve significant judgment and may fluctuate significantly over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions, generally or in relation to specific transactions. 

Within the Institutional Securities segment, gains and losses are primarily from business-related investments. Certain investments are subject to sale restrictions. 

Within the Investment Management business segment, Investments revenues are primarily from performance-based fees in the form of carried interest, a portion of which is subject to reversal, and gains and losses from investments.

##TABLE_END

The business is entitled to receive carried interest when the return in certain funds exceeds specified performance targets. Additionally, there are certain sponsored Investment Management funds consolidated by us where revenues are primarily attributable to holders of noncontrolling interests. 

Commissions and Fees 

Commissions and fees result from arrangements in which the client is charged a fee for executing transactions related to securities, services related to sales and trading activities, and sales of other products. 

Within the Institutional Securities business segment, commissions and fees include fees earned from market-making activities, such as executing and clearing client transactions on major stock and derivative exchanges, as well as from OTC derivatives. 

Within the Wealth Management business segment, commissions and fees arise from client transactions primarily in equity securities, insurance products, mutual funds, futures and options. Wealth Management also earns revenues from order flow payments for directing customer orders to broker-dealers, exchanges and market centers for execution . 

Asset Management 

Asset management revenues include fees associated with the management and supervision of assets and the distribution of funds and similar products. 

Within the Wealth Management business segment, Asset management revenues are related to advisory services associated with fee-based assets, account service and administration, as well as distribution of products. These revenues are generally based on the net asset value of the account in which a client is invested. 

Within the Investment Management business segment, Asset management revenues are primarily composed of fees received from investment vehicles on the basis of assets under management. Performance-based fees, not in the form of carried interest, are earned on certain products and separately managed accounts as a percentage of appreciation in value and, in certain cases, are based upon the achievement of performance criteria. These performance fees are generally recognized annually. 

Net Interest 

Interest income and Interest expense are functions of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities, including Trading assets and Trading liabilities, Investment securities, Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, Securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, Loans, Deposits and Borrowings. 

Within the Institutional Securities business segment, Net interest is a function of market-making strategies, client 

activity, and the prevailing level, term structure and volatility of interest rates. Net interest is impacted by market-making activities as securities held by the Firm generally earn interest, as do securities borrowed and securities purchased under agreements to resell, while securities loaned and securities sold under agreements to repurchase generally incur interest expense. 

Within the Wealth Management business segment, Interest income is driven by assets held including Investment securities, Loans and margin loans. Interest expense is driven by Deposits and other funding. Upon acquisition, E*TRADE&#8217;s Investment securities were recorded at fair value, and the resulting premium is being amortized over the life of the portfolio against interest income. 

Other 

Other revenues for Institutional Securities include revenues and losses from equity method investments, fees earned in association with lending activities, mark-to-market gains and losses on loans and lending commitments held for sale, as well as gains and losses on economic derivative hedges associated with certain held-for-sale and held-for-investment loans and lending commitments. 

Other revenues for Wealth Management include realized gains and losses on AFS securities, account handling fees, referral fees and other miscellaneous revenues. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Provision for credit losses includes the provision for credit losses for loans and lending commitments held for investment. 

Institutional Securities&#8212;Fixed Income and Equities 

Fixed income and Equities net revenues are composed of Trading revenues, Commissions and fees, Asset management revenues, Net interest, and certain Investments and Other revenues directly attributable to those businesses. These revenues, which can be affected by a variety of interrelated factors, including market volumes, bid-offer spreads and the impact of market conditions on inventory held to facilitate client activity, as well as the effect of hedging activity, are viewed in the aggregate when assessing the performance and profitability of our businesses. 

Following is a description of the revenue-generating activities within our equity and fixed income businesses, as well as how their results impact the income statement line items. 

Equity&#8212;Financing. We provide financing, prime brokerage and fund administration services to our clients active in the equity markets through a variety of products, including margin lending, securities lending and swaps. Results from this business are largely driven by the difference between financing income earned and financing costs incurred, which are reflected in Net interest for securities lending products, 

##TABLE_START December 2022 Form 10-K 28 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START 

&#160; 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

##TABLE_END

and in Trading revenues for derivative products. Fees for providing fund administration services are reflected in Asset management revenues. 

Equity&#8212;Execution services. A significant portion of the results for this business is generated by commissions and fees from executing and clearing client transactions on major stock and derivative exchanges, as well as from OTC transactions. We make markets for our clients principally in equity-related securities and derivative products, including those that provide liquidity and are utilized for hedging. Market-making also generates gains and losses on inventory held to facilitate client activity, which are reflected in Trading revenues. Execution services also includes certain Investments and Other revenues. 

Fixed income &#8212;Within fixed income, we make markets in various flow and structured products in order to facilitate client activity as part of the following products and services: 

&#8226; Global macro products. We make markets for our clients in interest rate, foreign exchange and emerging market products, including exchange-traded and OTC securities and derivative instruments. The results of this market-making activity are primarily driven by gains and losses from buying and selling positions to stand ready for and satisfy client demand and are recorded in Trading revenues. 

&#8226; Credit products. We make markets in credit-sensitive products, such as corporate bonds and mortgage securities and other securitized products, and related derivative instruments. The values of positions in this business are sensitive to changes in credit spreads and interest rates, which result in gains and losses reflected in Trading revenues. We undertake lending activities, which include commercial mortgage lending, secured lending facilities and financing extended to sales and trading customers. Due to the amount and type of the interest-bearing securities and loans making up this business, a significant portion of the results is also reflected in Net interest revenues. 

&#8226; Commodities products and Other. We make markets in various commodity products related primarily to electricity, natural gas, oil and metals. Other activities primarily include results from the centralized management of our fixed income derivative counterparty exposures and the management of derivative counterparty risk. These activities are primarily recorded in Trading revenues. 

Fixed income also includes certain Investments and Other revenues. 

Institutional Securities&#8212;Other Net Revenues 

Other net revenues include impacts from certain treasury functions, such as liquidity costs and gains and losses on economic hedges related to certain borrowings. Other net revenues also include mark-to-market gains and losses on held-for-sale corporate loans and lending commitments, as well as net interest and gain and losses on economic hedges associated with held-for-sale and held-for-investment corporate loans and lending commitments. Also included are gains and losses from financial instruments used to economically hedge compensation expense related to certain employee deferred compensation plans, as well as Investments and Other revenues that are not directly attributable to Fixed income and Equities businesses. 

Compensation Expense 

Compensation and benefits expenses include base salaries and fixed allowances, formulaic programs, discretionary incentive compensation, amortization of deferred cash and equity awards, changes in the fair value of investments to which certain deferred compensation plans are referenced, including the Firm&#8217;s share price for certain awards, carried interest allocated to employees, severance costs, and other items such as health and welfare benefits. 

The factors that drive compensation for our employees vary from period to period, from segment to segment and within a segment. For certain revenue-producing employees in the Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments, compensation is largely paid on the basis of formulaic payouts that link employee compensation to revenues. Compensation for other employees, including revenue-producing employees in the Institutional Securities business segment, include base salary and benefits and may also include incentive compensation that is determined following the assessment of the Firm&#8217;s, business unit&#8217;s and individual&#8217;s performance. 

Compensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation plans is recognized over the relevant vesting period and is adjusted based on the notional earnings of the referenced investments until distribution. Although changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value of the referenced investments will generally be offset by changes in the fair value of investments made by the Firm, there is typically a timing difference between the immediate recognition of gains and losses on the Firm's investments and the compensation expense recognized over the vesting period. 

Income Taxes 

The income tax provision for our business segments is generally determined based on the revenues, expenses and activities directly attributable to each business segment. Certain items have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues or other relevant measures.

Investment Banking Revenues 

Investment banking revenues of $5,235 million in 2022 decreased 49% compared with the prior year, primarily reflecting a decrease in underwriting revenues in line with market levels, reflecting a significant decline in global volumes. 

&#8226; Advisory revenues decreased primarily due to fewer completed M&#38;A transactions. 

&#8226; Equity underwriting revenues decreased on lower volumes, with lower revenues across all products, notably in initial public offerings, secondary block share trades and follow-on offerings. 

&#8226; Fixed income underwriting revenues decreased primarily due to lower bond and loan issuances. 

In 2022, Investment Banking operated in a global economic environment characterized, particularly in the second half of 2022, by significantly reduced M&#38;A and underwriting activity in comparison to 2021 levels, amid elevated inflation, rising interest rates and market volatility. To the extent global announced M&#38;A transactions and underwriting volumes remain at levels similar to those in the second half of 2022, we would expect these market conditions to continue to have an adverse im pact on Investment Banking revenues compared to our performance in 2021.

Equity 

Net revenues of $10,769 million in 2022 decreased 6% compared with the prior year, reflecting a decrease in execution services driven by markdowns on certain business-related investments and lower levels of client activity amid challenging market conditions, partially offset by an increase in financing. 

&#8226; Financing revenues increased primarily due to the absence of a loss from a credit event for a single client in the prior year period, partially offset by the impact of lower average client balances. 

&#8226; Execution services revenues decreased primarily due to mark-to-market losses on certain business-related investments compared to gains in the fourth quarter of 2021, lower client activity, as well as the impact of market conditions on inventory held to facilitate client activity in

cash equities, partially offset by the absence of trading losses related to the aforementioned credit event. 

Fixed Income 

Net revenues of $9,022 million in 2022 increased 20% compared with the prior year, primarily reflecting an increase in global macro products, which benefited from strong client engagement and increased client flow activity in an environment characterized by inflationary pressures, central bank actions and fiscal activity driving higher volatility. 

&#8226; Global macro products revenues increased in rates and foreign exchange products, primarily due to the positive impact of market conditions on inventory held to facilitate client activity and increased client activity. 

&#8226; Credit products revenues decreased, reflecting the impact of widening credit spreads and market volatility, primarily due to the impact of market conditions on inventory held to facilitate client activity in securitized products. 

&#8226; Commodities products and other fixed income revenues increased primarily due to higher client activity in Commodities. 

Other Net Revenues 

Other net revenues reflected a loss of $633 million in 2022 compared to a gain in the prior year, primarily due to mark-to-market losses on corporate loans held for sale inclusive of hedges of $876 million in 2022 compared to $195 million in 2021, partially offset by higher net interest income and fees of $701 million in 2022 compared with $509 million in 2021. Also contributing to the decline were losses in 2022 compared with gains in 2021 on investments associated with certain employee deferred cash-based compensation plans and lower results from our Japanese joint venture, MUMSS. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

In 2022, the Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $211 million was driven by portfolio growth and deterioration in macroeconomic outlook. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments was a net release of $7 million in 2021, primarily as the impact of changes in loan quality mix were offset by portfolio growth. 

For further information on the Provision for credit losses, see &#8220;Credit Risk&#8221; herein. 

Non-interest Expenses 

Non-interest expenses of $17,467 million in 2022 decreased 3% compared with the prior year due to lower Compensation and benefits expenses, partially offset by higher Non-compensation expenses. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses decreased in the current year primarily due to lower discretionary incentive compensation on lower revenues, lower stock-based compensation expense driven by the Firm&#8217;s share price, and 

lower expenses related to certain deferred cash-based compensation plans linked to investment performance, partially offset by higher salary expenses. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses increased in the current year primarily due to an increase in legal expenses, including $200 million related to a regulatory matter in the second quarter of 2022 and an increased spend on technology. 

Income Tax Items 

The effective tax rate of 19.5% for 2022 was lower compared with the prior year, primarily driven by the realization of certain tax benefits.

investments associated with certain employee deferred cash-based compensation plans and lower client activity in equities. 

For further information on the impact of investments associated with certain employee deferred cash-based compensation plans, see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein. 

Net Interest 

Net interest revenues of $7,429 million in 2022 increased 38% compared with the prior year, primarily due to net effect of higher interest rates and growth in bank lending. 

The level and pace of interest rate changes and other macroeconomic factors may impact client demand for loans as well as preferences for cash allocation to other products, potentially resulting in changes in the deposit mix and associated interest expense. As such net interest income may be impacted in future periods. 

Non-interest Expenses 

Non-interest expenses of $17,765 million in 2022 decreased 2% compared with the prior year, as a result of lower Compensation and benefits expenses, partially offset by higher Non-compensation expenses. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses decreased, primarily due to lower expenses related to certain deferred cash-based compensation plans linked to investment performance and a decrease in the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives driven by lower compensable revenues, partially offset by the impact of higher headcount. 

For further information on the impact of expenses related to certain employee deferred cash-based compensation plans linked to investment performance, see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses increased, primarily driven by spend on technology and higher marketing and business development costs.

Acquisition of Eaton Vance 

The comparisons of current year results to prior periods are impacted by the acquisition of Eaton Vance on March 1, 2021. For additional information on the acquisition of Eaton Vance, see Note 3 to the financial statements. 

Net Revenues 

Asset Management and Related Fees 

Asset management and related fees of $5,332 million in 2022 decreased 4% compared with the prior year, reflecting the impact of the decline in the equity markets, partially offset by incremental revenues as a result of the Eaton Vance acquisition and the impact of lower fee waivers in certain money market funds. 

Asset management revenues are influenced by the level and relative mix of AUM and related fee rates. The current market environment may impact AUM and net flows within asset classes and therefore our asset management revenues. 

See &#8220;Assets under Management or Supervision&#8221; herein. 

Performance-based Income and Other 

Performance-based income and other revenues were $43 million in 2022, representing a 93% decrease from the prior year, primarily due to lower accrued carried interest in certain private equity and real estate funds, losses on investments associated with certain employee deferred cash-based compensation plans, and mark-to-market losses on public investments. 

Non-interest Expenses 

Non-interest expenses of $4,568 million in 2022 were relatively unchanged from the prior year period, reflecting higher Non-compensation expenses offset by lower Compensation and benefits. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses decreased primarily due to lower discretionary incentive compensation driven by lower asset management revenues and lower compensation associated with carried interest, partially offset by the impact of incremental compensation as a result of the Eaton Vance acquisition. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses increased primarily due to higher marketing and business development costs and incremental expenses as a result of the Eaton Vance acquisition.

Other Matters 

Deferred Cash-Based Compensation 

The Firm sponsors a number of deferred cash-based compensation programs for current and former employees, which generally contain vesting, clawback and cancellation provisions. 

Employees are permitted to allocate the value of their deferred awards among a menu of notional investments, whereby the value of their awards will track the performance of the referenced notional investments. The menu of investments, which is selected by the Firm, includes fixed income, equity, commodity and money market funds. 

Compensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation awards is calculated based on the notional value of the award granted, adjusted for changes in the fair value of the referenced investments that employees select. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period relevant to each separately vesting portion of deferred awards. 

We invest directly, as a principal, in financial instruments and other investments to economically hedge certain of our obligations under these deferred cash-based compensation plans. Changes in the fair value of such investments, net of financing costs, are recorded in Net revenues, and included in Transactional revenues in the Wealth Management business segment. Although changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value of the referenced investments will generally be offset by changes in the fair value of investments recognized in net revenues, there is typically a timing difference between the immediate recognition of gains and losses on our investments and the deferred recognition of the related compensation expense over the vesting period. While this timing difference may not be material to our Income before provision for income taxes in any individual period, it may impact the Wealth Management business segment reported ratios and operating metrics in certain periods due to potentially significant impacts to net revenues and compensation expenses. At December 31, 2022, substantially all employee notional investments that subjected the Firm to price risk were economically hedged.

Accounting Development Updates 

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued certain accounting updates that apply to us. Accounting updates not listed below were assessed and either determined to be not applicable or to not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption. 

We adopted the following accounting updates on January 1, 2023: 

&#8226; Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses. This accounting update eliminates the accounting guidance for Troubled Debt Restructurings (&#8220;TDRs&#8221;) and requires new disclosures regarding certain modifications of financing receivables ( i.e. , principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-than-insignificant payment delays and term extensions) to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The update also requires disclosure of current period gross charge-offs by year of origination for financing receivables measured at amortized cost. We adopted this update on a prospective basis and noted no impact on our financial condition or results of operation upon adoption. 

We are currently evaluating the following accounting update, however, we do not expect a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption: 

&#8226; Fair Value Measurement . This accounting update clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The update also requires additional disclosures including the fair value of equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions, the nature and remaining duration of the restriction and circumstances that could cause the restriction to lapse. The ASU is effective January 1, 2024 with early adoption permitted. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 to the financial statements). We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the financial statements), the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. 

Fair Value 

Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value 

A significant number of our financial instruments are carried at fair value. The use of fair value to measure financial instruments is fundamental to our risk management practices and is our most critical accounting estimate. We make estimates regarding the valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the financial statements. These assets and liabilities include, but are not limited to: 

##TABLE_START December 2022 Form 10-K 38 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START 

&#160; 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

##TABLE_END

&#8226; Trading assets and Trading liabilities; 

&#8226; Investment Securities&#8212;AFS; 

&#8226; Certain Securities purchased under agreements to resell; 

&#8226; Loans held-for-sale (measured at the lower of amortized cost or fair value); 

&#8226; Certain Deposits, primarily certificates of deposit; 

&#8226; Certain Securities sold under agreements to repurchase; 

&#8226; Certain Other secured financings; and 

&#8226; Certain Borrowings. 

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ( i.e. , the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 

In determining fair value, we use various valuation approaches. A hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable prices and inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable prices and inputs by requiring that the relevant observable inputs be used when available. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels, wherein Level 1 represents quoted prices in active markets, Level 2 represents valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, and Level 3 consists of valuation techniques that incorporate significant unobservable inputs and, therefore, require the greatest use of judgment. The fair values for the substantial majority of our financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are based on observable prices and inputs and are classified in level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Level 3 financial assets represented 1.4% and 1.1% of our total assets, as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

In periods of market disruption, the observability of prices and inputs, as well as market liquidity may be reduced for many instruments, which could cause an instrument to be recategorized from Level 1 to Level 2 or from Level 2 to Level 3. In addition, a downturn in market conditions could lead to declines in the valuation of many instruments carried at fair value. Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. For further information on the definition of fair value, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 and related valuation techniques, and quantitative information about and sensitivity of significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements, see Notes 2 and 5 to the financial statements. 

Where appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to account for various factors such as liquidity risk (bid-ask adjustments), credit quality, model uncertainty, concentration risk and funding in order to arrive at fair value. For a further discussion of valuation adjustments that we apply, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 

Goodwill and Intangible Assets 

Goodwill 

We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of July 1 and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. Evaluating goodwill for impairment requires management to make significant judgments, including, in part, the use of unobservable inputs that are subject to uncertainty. Goodwill impairment tests are performed at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the level of or one level below our business segments. Goodwill no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition once it has been assigned to a reporting unit. As such, all the activities of a reporting unit, whether acquired or organically developed, are available to support the value of the goodwill. 

For both the annual and interim tests, we have the option to either (i) perform a quantitative impairment test or (ii) first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, in which case the quantitative test would be performed. 

When performing a quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the goodwill impairment loss is equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, limited by the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. 

The carrying value of each reporting unit is determined based on the capital allocated to the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of the reporting units is derived based on valuation techniques we believe market participants would use for each of the reporting units. The estimated fair value is generally determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology. In certain instances, we may also utilize methodologies that incorporate price-to-book and price-to-earnings multiples of certain comparable companies. 

The discounted cash flow methodology uses projected future cash flows based on the reporting units&#8217; earnings forecast. The discount rate used represents an estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting unit based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model. 

At each annual goodwill impairment testing date, each of our reporting units with goodwill had a fair value that was substantially in excess of its carrying value. 

Intangible Assets 

Intangible assets are initially recorded at cost, or in the situation where acquired as part of a business combination, at the fair value determined as part of the acquisition method of accounting. Subsequently, amortizable intangible assets are carried in the balance sheet at amortized cost, where amortization is recognized over their estimated useful lives.

##TABLE_END

Indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment on an annual basis as of July 1 and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. 

On a quarterly basis: 

&#8226; All intangible assets are assessed for the presence of impairment indicators. Where such indicators are present, an evaluation for impairment is conducted. 

&#8226; For amortizable intangible assets, an impairment loss exists if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows. 

&#8226; For indefinite-lived intangible assets, an impairment exists if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. 

&#8226; Amortizable intangible assets are assessed for any indication that the remaining useful life or the finite life classification should be revised. In such cases, the remaining carrying amount is amortized prospectively over the revised useful life, unless it is determined that the life of the intangible asset is indefinite, in which case the intangible asset is not amortized. 

&#8226; Indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for any indication that the life of the intangible asset is no longer indefinite; in such cases, the carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over its remaining useful life. 

The initial valuation of an intangible asset as part of the acquisition method of accounting and the subsequent valuation of intangible assets as part of an impairment assessment are subjective and based, in part, on inputs that are unobservable and can be subject to uncertainty. These inputs include, but are not limited to, forecasted cash flows, revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates and discount rates. 

For both goodwill and intangible assets, to the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted. For amortizable intangible assets, the new cost basis is amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset. Unanticipated declines in our revenue generating capability, adverse market or economic events, and regulatory actions, could result in material impairment charges in future periods. 

See Notes 2, 3 and 11 to the financial statements for additional information about goodwill and intangible assets. 

Legal and Regulatory Contingencies 

In the normal course of business, we have been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with our activities as a global diversified financial services institution. 

Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or are in financial distress. 

We are also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding our business and involving, among other matters, investment banking advisory services, capital markets activities, sales, trading, financing, prime-brokerage, market-making activities, wealth and investment management services, financial products or offerings sponsored, underwritten or sold by us, and accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, limitations on our ability to conduct certain business, or other relief. 

Accruals for litigation and regulatory proceedings are generally determined on a case-by-case basis. Where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and we can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, we accrue the estimated loss by a charge to income. 

In many proceedings and investigations, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss. In addition, even where a loss is possible or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the liability already accrued with respect to a previously recognized loss contingency, it is not always possible to reasonably estimate the size of the possible loss or range of loss, particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties. Numerous issues may need to be resolved before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional range of loss can be reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages or other relief, and consideration of novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question. 

Significant judgment is required in deciding when and if to make these accruals, and the actual cost of a legal claim or regulatory fine/penalty may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals. 

See Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information on legal contingencies. 

Income Taxes 

We are subject to the income and indirect tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign 

##TABLE_START December 2022 Form 10-K 40 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START 

&#160; 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

##TABLE_END

jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. These tax laws are complex and subject to interpretation by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and the expense for indirect taxes and must also make estimates about when certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. 

Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. We periodically evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each taxing jurisdiction resulting from current and subsequent years&#8217; examinations, and unrecognized tax benefits related to potential losses that may arise from tax audits are established in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. Once established, unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring a change. 

Our provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. Current income taxes approximate taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the applicable enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. 

Our deferred tax balances may also include deferred assets related to tax attribute carryforwards, such as net operating losses and tax credits that will be realized through reduction of future tax liabilities and, in some cases, are subject to expiration if not utilized within certain periods. We perform regular reviews to ascertain whether deferred tax assets are realizable. These reviews include management&#8217;s estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income and incorporate various tax planning strategies, including strategies that may be available to tax attribute carryforwards before they expire. 

Once the deferred tax asset balances have been determined, we may record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset balances to reflect the amount we estimate is more likely than not to be realized at a future date. Both current and deferred income taxes may reflect adjustments related to our unrecognized tax benefits. 

Significant judgment is required in estimating the consolidated provision for (benefit from) income taxes, current and deferred tax balances (including valuation allowance, if any), accrued interest or penalties and uncertain tax positions. Revisions in estimates and/or the actual costs of a tax assessment may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, if any. 

See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information on our significant assumptions, judgments and 

interpretations associated with the accounting for income taxes and Note 22 to the financial statements for additional information on our tax examinations. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our liquidity and capital policies are established and maintained by senior management, with oversight by the Asset/Liability Management Committee and the Board of Directors (&#8220;Board&#8221;). Through various risk and control committees, senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity, interest rate and currency sensitivity of our asset and liability position. Our Treasury department, Firm Risk Committee, Asset/Liability Management Committee, and other committees and control groups assist in evaluating, monitoring and managing the impact that our business activities have on our balance sheet, liquidity and capital structure. Liquidity and capital matters are reported regularly to the Board and the Risk Committee of the Board. 

Balance Sheet 

We monitor and evaluate the composition and size of our balance sheet on a regular basis. Our balance sheet management process includes quarterly planning, business-specific thresholds, monitoring of business-specific usage versus key performance metrics and new business impact assessments. 

We establish balance sheet thresholds at the consolidated and business segment levels. We monitor balance sheet utilization and review variances resulting from business activity and market fluctuations. On a regular basis, we review current performance versus established thresholds and assess the need to re-allocate our balance sheet based on business segment needs. We also monitor key metrics, including asset and liability size and capital usage.

Liquidity Risk Management Framework 

The primary goal of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework is to ensure that we have access to adequate funding across a wide range of market conditions and time horizons. The framework is designed to enable us to fulfill our financial obligations and support the execution of our business strategies. 

The following principles guide our Liquidity Risk Management Framework: 

&#8226; Sufficient Liquidity Resources should be maintained to cover maturing liabilities and other planned and contingent outflows; 

&#8226; Maturity profile of assets and liabilities should be aligned, with limited reliance on short-term funding; 

&#8226; Source, counterparty, currency, region and term of funding should be diversified; and 

&#8226; Liquidity Stress Tests should anticipate, and account for, periods of limited access to funding. 

The core components of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework are the Required Liquidity Framework, Liquidity Stress Tests and Liquidity Resources, which support our target liquidity profile. 

Required Liquidity Framework 

Our Required Liquidity Framework establishes the amount of liquidity we must hold in both normal and stressed environments to ensure that our financial condition and overall soundness are not adversely affected by an inability 

(or perceived inability) to meet our financial obligations in a timely manner. The Required Liquidity Framework considers the most constraining liquidity requirement to satisfy all regulatory and internal limits at a consolidated and legal entity level. 

Liquidity Stress Tests 

We use Liquidity Stress Tests to model external and intercompany liquidity flows across multiple scenarios and a range of time horizons. These scenarios contain various combinations of idiosyncratic and systemic stress events of different severity and duration. The methodology, implementation, production and analysis of our Liquidity Stress Tests are important components of the Required Liquidity Framework. 

The assumptions used in our various Liquidity Stress Test scenarios include, but are not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; No government support; 

&#8226; No access to equity and limited access to unsecured debt markets; 

&#8226; Repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within the stress horizon; 

&#8226; Higher haircuts for and significantly lower availability of secured funding; 

&#8226; Additional collateral that would be required by trading counterparties, certain exchanges and clearing organizations related to credit rating downgrades; 

&#8226; Additional collateral that would be required due to collateral substitutions, collateral disputes and uncalled collateral; 

&#8226; Discretionary unsecured debt buybacks; 

&#8226; Drawdowns on lending commitments provided to third parties; and 

&#8226; Client cash withdrawals and reduction in customer short positions that fund long positions. 

Liquidity Stress Tests are produced and results are reported at different levels, including major operating subsidiaries and major currencies, to capture specific cash requirements and cash availability across the Firm, including a limited number of asset sales in a stressed environment. The Liquidity Stress Tests assume that subsidiaries will use their own liquidity first to fund their obligations before drawing liquidity from the Parent Company and that the Parent Company will support its subsidiaries and will not have access to subsidiaries&#8217; liquidity reserves. In addition to the assumptions underpinning the Liquidity Stress Tests, we take into consideration settlement risk related to intraday settlement and clearing of securities and financing activities. 

At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we maintained sufficient Liquidity Resources to meet current and contingent funding obligations as modeled in our Liquidity Stress Tests.

Liquidity Resources 

We maintain sufficient liquidity resources, which consist of HQLA and cash deposits with banks (&#8220;Liquidity Resources&#8221;) to cover daily funding needs and to meet strategic liquidity targets sized by the Required Liquidity Framework and Liquidity Stress Tests. We actively manage the amount of our Liquidity Resources considering the following components: unsecured debt maturity profile; balance sheet size and composition; funding needs in a stressed environment, inclusive of contingent cash outflows; legal entity, regional and segment liquidity requirements; regulatory requirements; and collateral requirements. 

The amount of Liquidity Resources we hold is based on our risk appetite and is calibrated to meet various internal and regulatory requirements and to fund prospective business activities. The Liquidity Resources are primarily held within the Parent Company and its major operating subsidiaries. The Total HQLA values in the tables immediately following are different from Eligible HQLA, which, in accordance with the LCR rule, also takes into account certain regulatory weightings and other operational considerations.

Liquidity Resources may fluctuate from period to period based on the overall size and composition of our balance sheet, the maturity profile of our unsecured debt and estimates of funding needs in a stressed environment, among other factors. 

Regulatory Liquidity Framework 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio 

We and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum LCR and NSFR of 100%. The LCR requires that large banking organizations have sufficient Eligible HQLA to cover net cash outflows arising from significant stress over 30 calendar days, thus promoting the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banking organizations. In determining Eligible HQLA for LCR purposes, weightings (or asset haircuts) are applied to HQLA, and certain HQLA held in subsidiaries is excluded. The NSFR requires large banking organizations to maintain sufficiently stable sources of funding over a one-year time horizon. 

As of December 31, 2022, we and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are compliant with the minimum LCR and NSFR requirements of 100%.

2. Primarily includes U.S. Treasuries, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, sovereign bonds and investment grade corporate bonds. 

Funding Management 

We manage our funding in a manner that reduces the risk of disruption to our operations. We pursue a strategy of diversification of secured and unsecured funding sources (by product, investor and region) and attempt to ensure that the tenor of our liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed. Our goal is to achieve an optimal mix of durable secured and unsecured financing. 

We fund our balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources. These sources include our equity capital, borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities lending, deposits, letters of credit and lines of credit. We have active financing programs for both standard and structured products targeting global investors and currencies. 

Secured Financing 

The liquid nature of the marketable securities and short-term receivables arising principally from sales and trading

&#160; 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

##TABLE_END

activities in the Institutional Securities business segment provides us with flexibility in managing the composition of our balance sheet. Secured financing investors principally focus on the quality of the eligible collateral posted. Accordingly, we actively manage our secured financings based on the quality of the assets being funded. 

We have established longer tenor secured funding requirements for less liquid asset classes, for which funding may be at risk in the event of a market disruption. We define highly liquid assets as government-issued or government-guaranteed securities with a high degree of fundability and less liquid assets as those that do not meet these criteria. 

To further minimize the refinancing risk of secured financing for less liquid assets, we have established concentration limits to diversify our investor base and reduce the amount of monthly maturities for secured financing of less liquid assets. As a component of the Liquidity Risk Management Framework, we hold a portion of our Liquidity Resources against the potential disruption to our secured financing capabilities. 

We generally maintain a pool of liquid and easily fundable securities, which takes into account HQLA classifications consistent with LCR definitions, and other regulatory requirements, and provides a valuable future source of liquidity.

In addition to the collateralized financing transactions shown in the previous table, we engage in financing transactions collateralized by customer-owned securities, which are segregated in accordance with regulatory requirements. Receivables under these financing transactions, primarily margin loans, are included in Customer and other receivables in the balance sheet, and payables under these financing transactions, primarily to prime brokerage customers, are included in Customer and other payables in the balance sheet. 

Our risk exposure on these transactions is mitigated by collateral maintenance policies and the elements of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework. 

Unsecured Financing 

We view deposits and borrowings as stable sources of funding for unencumbered securities and non-security assets. Our unsecured financings include borrowings and certificates of deposit carried at fair value, which are primarily composed of: instruments whose payments and redemption values are linked to the performance of a specific index, a basket of stocks, a specific equity security, a commodity, a credit exposure or basket of credit exposures; and instruments with various interest rate-related features, including step-ups, step-downs and zero coupons. Also included are unsecured contracts which are not classified as OTC derivatives because they fail net investment criteria. As part of our asset/liability management strategy, when appropriate, we use derivatives to make adjustments to the interest rate risk profile of our borrowings (see Notes 7 and 14 to the financial statements).

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

##TABLE_END

Borrowings of $238 billion as of December 31, 2022 were relatively unchanged when compared with $233 billion at December 31, 2021. 

We believe that accessing debt investors through multiple distribution channels helps provide consistent access to the unsecured markets. In addition, the issuance of borrowings with original maturities greater than one year allows us to reduce reliance on short-term credit sensitive instruments. Borrowings with original maturities greater than one year are generally managed to achieve staggered maturities, thereby mitigating refinancing risk, and to maximize investor diversification through sales to global institutional and retail clients across regions, currencies and product types. 

The availability and cost of financing to us can vary depending on market conditions, the volume of certain trading and lending activities, our credit ratings and the overall availability of credit. We also engage in, and may continue to engage in, repurcha ses of our borrowings as part of our market-making activities. 

For further information on Borrowings, see Note 14 to the financial statements. 

Credit Ratings 

We rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our daily operations. Our credit ratings are one of the factors in the cost and availability of financing and can have an impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer-term counterparty performance is a key consideration, such as certain OTC derivative transactions. When determining credit ratings, rating agencies consider both company-specific and industry-wide factors. See also &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Liquidity Risk.&#8221;

Incremental Collateral or Terminating Payments 

In connection with certain OTC derivatives and certain other agreements where we are a liquidity provider to certain financing vehicles associated with the Institutional Securities business segment, we may be required to provide additional collateral, immediately settle any outstanding liability balances with certain counterparties or pledge additional collateral to certain clearing organizations in the event of a future credit rating downgrade irrespective of whether we are in a net asset or net liability position. See Note 7 to the financial statements for additional information on OTC derivatives that contain such contingent features. 

While certain aspects of a credit rating downgrade are quantifiable pursuant to contractual provisions, the impact it would have on our business and results of operations in future periods is inherently uncertain and would depend on a number of interrelated factors, including, among other things, the magnitude of the downgrade, the rating relative to peers, the rating assigned by the relevant agency before the downgrade, individual client behavior and future mitigating actions we might take. The liquidity impact of additional collateral requirements is included in our Liquidity Stress Tests. 

Capital Management 

We view capital as an important source of financial strength and actively manage our consolidated capital position based upon, among other things, business opportunities, risks, capital availability and rates of return together with internal capital policies, regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines. In the future, we may expand or contract our capital base to address the changing needs of our businesses.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We enter into various off-balance sheet arrangements, including through unconsolidated SPEs and lending-related financial instruments ( e.g. , guarantees and commitments), primarily in connection with the Institutional Securities and Investment Management business segments. 

We utilize SPEs primarily in connection with securitization activities. For information on our securitization activities, see Note 16 to the financial statements.

Regulatory Requirements 

Regulatory Capital Framework 

We are an FHC under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (&#8220;BHC Act&#8221;) and are subject to the regulation and oversight of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements for us, including &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; standards, and evaluates our compliance with such capital requirements. The OCC establishes similar capital requirements and standards for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. The regulatory capital requirements are largely based on the Basel III capital standards established by the Basel Committee and also implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. For us to remain an FHC, we must remain well-capitalized in accordance with standards established by the Federal Reserve, and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must remain well-capitalized in accordance with standards established by the OCC. In addition, many of our regulated 

subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements, including regulated subsidiaries provisionally registered as swap dealers with the CFTC or conditionally registered as security-based swap dealers with the SEC or registered as broker-dealers or futures commission merchants. For additional information on regulatory capital requirements for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, as well as our subsidiaries that are Swap Entities, see Note 17 to the financial statements. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 

We are required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage-based capital and TLAC ratios. For additional information on TLAC, see &#8220;Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements&#8221; herein. 

Risk-Based Regulatory Capital . Risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital (which includes Tier 2 capital), each as a percentage of RWA, and consist of regulatory minimum required ratios plus our capital buffer requirement. Capital requirements require certain adjustments to, and deductions from, capital for purposes of determining these ratios.

2. For a further discussion of the G-SIB capital surcharge, see &#8220;G-SIB Capital Surcharge&#8221; herein. 

3. The CCyB can be set up to 2.5% but is currently set by the Federal Reserve at zero. 

The capital buffer requirement represents the amount of Common Equity Tier 1 capital we must maintain above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. Our capital buffer requirement computed under the standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market RWAs ( &#8220; Standardized Approach &#8221; ) is equal to the sum of our SCB, G-SIB capital surcharge and CCyB, and our capital buffer requirement computed under the applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk RWAs ( &#8220; Advanced Approach &#8221; ) is equal to our 2.5% capital conservation buffer, G-SIB capital surcharge and CCyB.

1. Required ratios represent the regulatory minimum plus the capital buffer requirement. 

Risk-Weighted Assets. RWA reflects both our on- and off-balance sheet risk, as well as capital charges attributable to the risk of loss arising from the following: 

&#8226; Credit risk: The failure of a borrower, counterparty or issuer to meet its financial obligations to us; 

&#8226; Market risk: Adverse changes in the level of one or more market prices, rates, spreads, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity; and 

&#8226; Operational risk: Inadequate or failed processes or systems, from human factors or from external events ( e.g. , fraud, theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage to physical assets). 

Our risk-based capital ratios are computed under each of (i) the Standardized Approach and (ii) the Advanced Approach. The credit risk RWA calculations between the two approaches differ in that the Standardized Approach requires calculation of RWA using prescribed risk weights and exposure methodologies, whereas the Advanced Approach utilizes models to calculate exposure amounts and risk weights. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the differences between the actual and required ratios were lower under the Standardized Approach. 

Leverage-Based Regulatory Capital. Leverage-based capital requirements include a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%, a minimum SLR of 3% and an enhanced SLR capital buffer of at least 2%. 

CECL Deferral. As of December 31, 2021, our risk-based and leverage-based capital amounts and ratios, as well as RWA, adjusted average assets and supplementary leverage exposure were calculated excluding the effect of the adoption of CECL based on the Firm&#8217;s election to defer this effect over a five-year transition period that began on January 1, 2020. In 2022 t he deferral impacts began to phase in at 25% per year and will become fully phased-in beginning in 2025.

Regulatory VaR&#8212;VaR for regulatory capital requirements 

In 2022, Credit risk RWA decreased under the Standardized Approach but was relatively unchanged under the Advanced Approach. Under the Standardized Approach, the decrease was primarily driven by lower equity, commodities, and credit Derivatives as well as lower Securities financing transactions from margin lending, partially offset by lending growth. Under the Advanced Approach, lending growth, higher foreign exchange Derivatives exposures and higher other assets exposures were offset by lower Investment securities and Equity Investments. 

Market risk RWA decreased in 2022 under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches primarily driven by lower Incremental Risk Charge driven by exposure reduction in the Fixed Income business and lower Specific risk securitization and non-securitization standardized charges, partially offset by higher Regulatory VaR. 

The increase in Operational risk RWA in 2022 reflects higher legal expenses and execution-related losses. 

G-SIB Capital Surcharge 

We and other U.S. G-SIBs are subject to an additional risk-based capital surcharge, the G-SIB capital surcharge, which must be satisfied using Common Equity Tier 1 capital and which functions as an extension of the capital conservation buffer. The surcharge is calculated based on the G-SIB&#8217;s size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, and

complexity and substitutability (&#8220;Method 1&#8221;) or use of short-term wholesale funding (&#8220;Method 2&#8221;), whichever is higher. 

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements 

The Federal Reserve has established external TLAC, long-term debt (&#8220;LTD&#8221;) and clean holding company requirements for top-tier BHCs of U.S. G-SIBs (&#8220;covered BHCs&#8221;), including the Parent Company. These requirements are designed to ensure that covered BHCs will have enough loss-absorbing resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized through the conversion of eligible LTD to equity or otherwise by imposing losses on eligible LTD or other forms of TLAC where an SPOE resolution strategy is used (see &#8220;Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation&#8212;Financial Holding Company&#8212;Resolution and Recovery Planning&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk&#8221;). 

These TLAC and eligible LTD requirements include various restrictions, such as requiring eligible LTD to: be issued by the covered BHC; be unsecured; have a maturity of one year or more from the date of issuance; and not contain certain embedded features, such as a principal or redemption amount subject to reduction based on the performance of an asset, entity or index, or a similar feature. In addition, the requirements provide permanent grandfathering for debt instruments issued prior to December 31, 2016 that would be eligible LTD but for having impermissible acceleration clauses or being governed by foreign law. 

A covered BHC is also required to maintain minimum external TLAC equal to the greater of (i) 18% of total RWA or (ii) 7.5% of its total leverage exposure (the denominator of its SLR). Covered BHCs must also meet a minimum external LTD requirement equal to the greater of (i) total RWA multiplied by the sum of 6% plus the higher of the Method 1 or Method 2 G-SIB capital surcharge applicable to the Parent Company or (ii) 4.5% of its total leverage exposure. 

The final rule imposes TLAC buffer requirements on top of both the risk-based and leverage exposure-based external TLAC minimum requirements. The risk-based TLAC buffer is equal to the sum of 2.5%, our Method 1 G-SIB surcharge and the CCyB, if any, as a percentage of total RWA. The leverage exposure-based TLAC buffer is equal to 2% of our total leverage exposure. Failure to maintain the buffers would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers.

2. External TLAC consists of Common Equity Tier 1 capital and Additional Tier 1 capital (each excluding any noncontrolling minority interests), as well as eligible LTD. 

3. Consists of TLAC-eligible LTD reduced by 50% for amounts of unpaid principal due to be paid in more than one year but less than two years from each respective balance sheet date. 

Furthermore, under the clean holding company requirements, a covered BHC is prohibited from incurring any external debt with an original maturity of less than one year or certain other liabilities, regardless of whether the liabilities are fully secured or otherwise senior to eligible LTD, or entering into certain other prohibited transactions. Certain other external liabilities, including those with certain embedded features noted above, are subject to a cap equal to 5% of the covered BHC&#8217;s outstanding external TLAC amount. Additionally, as of April 1, 2021, we and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are required to make certain deductions from regulatory capital for investments in certain unsecured debt instruments (including eligible LTD in the TLAC framework) issued by the Parent Company or other G-SIBs. 

We are in compliance with all TLAC requirements as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

Capital Plans, Stress Tests and the Stress Capital Buffer 

The Federal Reserve has capital planning and stress test requirements for large BHCs, which form part of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s annual CCAR framework. 

We must submit, on at least an annual basis, a capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate annual stress tests designed by us and the Federal Reserve, so that the Federal Reserve may assess our systems and processes that incorporate forward-looking projections of revenues and losses to monitor and maintain our internal capital adequacy. As banks with less than $250 billion of total assets, our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are not subject to company-run stress test regulatory requirements. 

The capital plan must include a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance or redemption of a debt or equity capital instrument, any capital distribution ( i.e. , payments of dividends or stock repurchases) and any similar action that the Federal Reserve determines could impact our consolidated

##TABLE_END

capital. The capital plan must include a discussion of how we will maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios and how we will serve as a source of strength to our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries under supervisory stress scenarios. In addition, the Federal Reserve has issued guidance setting out its heightened expectations for capital planning practices at certain large financial institutions, including us. 

As part of its annual capital supervisory stress testing process, the Federal Reserve determines an SCB for each large BHC, including us. The SCB applies only with respect to Standardized Approach risk-based capital requirements and replaced the Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5%. The SCB is the greater of (i) the maximum decline in our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario over the supervisory stress test measurement period plus the sum of the four quarters of planned common stock dividends divided by the projected RWAs from the quarter in which the Firm&#8217;s projected Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio reaches its minimum in the supervisory stress test and (ii) 2.5%. 

The supervisory stress test assumes that BHCs generally maintain a constant level of assets and RWAs throughout the projection period. 

A firm&#8217;s SCB is subject to revision each year, taking effect from October 1 to reflect the results of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s annual supervisory stress test. The Federal Reserve has discretion to recalculate a firm&#8217;s SCB outside of the October 1 annual cycle and to require approval for certain actions, in some circumstances. The Federal Reserve also has the authority to impose restrictions on capital actions as a supervisory matter. 

For the 2022 capital planning and stress test cycle, we submitted our capital plan and company-run stress test results to the Federal Reserve on April 5, 2022. On June 23, 2022, the Federal Reserve published summary results of its supervisory stress tests of each large BHC, in which the projected decline in our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio in the severely adverse scenario improved from the prior annual supervisory stress test, from 4.7% to 4.6%. Following the publication of the supervisory stress test results, and as a result of the increase in our common stock dividend and the resulting dividend add-on, we announced that our SCB will be 5.8% from October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023. Together with other features of the regulatory capital framework, this SCB results in an aggregate Standardized Approach Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 13.3%. 

We also disclosed a summary of the results of our company-run stress tests on our Investor Relations website and increased our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.775 per share from $0.70, beginning with the common stock dividend announced on July 14, 2022. Additionally, our Board of Directors approved a new multi-year repurchase authorization of up to $20 billion of outstanding common stock, without a set expiration date, beginning in the third quarter of 2022, 

which will be exercised from time to time as conditions warrant. 

Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework 

Our required capital (&#8220;Required Capital&#8221;) estimation is based on the Required Capital framework, an internal capital adequacy measure. Common equity attribution to the business segments is based on capital usage calculated under the Required Capital framework, as well as each business segment&#8217;s relative contribution to our total Required Capital. 

The Required Capital framework is a risk-based and leverage-based capital measure, which is compared with our regulatory capital to ensure that we maintain an amount of going concern capital after absorbing potential losses from stress events, where applicable, at a point in time. The amount of capital allocated to the business segments is generally set at the beginning of each year and remains fixed throughout the year until the next annual reset unless a significant business change occurs ( e.g. , acquisition or disposition). We define the difference between our total average common equity and the sum of the average common equity amounts allocated to our business segments as Parent common equity. We generally hold Parent common equity for prospective regulatory requirements, organic growth, potential future acquisitions and other capital needs.

3. The total average common equity and the allocation to the Investment Management business segment in 2021 reflect the Eaton Vance acquisition on March 1, 2021. 

We continue to evaluate our Required Capital framework with respect to the impact of evolving regulatory requirements, as appropriate. 

Resolution and Recovery Planning 

We are required to submit once every two years to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a resolution plan that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of our material financial distress or failure. We submitted our 2021 targeted resolution plan on June 30, 2021. In November 2022, we received joint feedback on our 2021 resolution plan from the Federal Reserve and the FDIC (&#8220;Agencies&#8221;). The feedback indicated that there are no shortcomings or deficiencies in our 2021 resolution plan and that we had successfully addressed a prior

shortcoming identified by the Agencies in the review of our 2019 resolution plan. For more information about resolution planning requirements, see &#8220;Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation&#8212;Financial Holding Company&#8212;Resolution and Recovery Planning.&#8221; 

As described in our most recent resolution plan, our preferred resolution strategy is an SPOE strategy. In line with our SPOE strategy, the Parent Company has transferred, and has agreed to transfer on an ongoing basis, certain assets to its wholly owned, direct subsidiary Morgan Stanley Holdings LLC (the &#8220;Funding IHC&#8221;). In addition, the Parent Company has entered into an amended and restated support agreement with its material entities (including the Funding IHC) and certain other subsidiaries. In the event of a resolution scenario, the Parent Company would be obligated to contribute all of its contributable assets to our supported entities and/or the Funding IHC. The Funding IHC would be obligated to provide capital and liquidity, as applicable, to our supported entities. The combined implication of the SPOE resolution strategy and the requirement to maintain certain levels of TLAC is that losses in resolution would be imposed on the holders of eligible long-term debt and other forms of eligible TLAC issued by the Parent Company before any losses are imposed on creditors of our supported entities and without requiring taxpayer or government financial support. 

The obligations of the Parent Company and the Funding IHC under the amended and restated support agreement are in most cases secured on a senior basis by the assets of the Parent Company (other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company and certain other assets) and the assets of the Funding IHC. As a result, claims of our supported entities, including the Funding IHC, with respect to the secured assets, are effectively senior to unsecured obligations of the Parent Company. 

For more information about resolution and recovery planning requirements and our activities in these areas, including the implications of such activities in a resolution scenario, see &#8220;Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation&#8212;Financial Holding Company&#8212;Resolution and Recovery Planning&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk.&#8221; 

Regulatory Developments and Other Matters 

Covered Fund Restrictions under the Volcker Rule 

The Volcker Rule prohibits certain investments and relationships by banking entities with covered funds, as defined in the Volcker Rule. During the current quarter, we have continued our assessment of conformance options permitted under the Volcker Rule with respect to certain legacy illiquid funds for which we previously received a conformance extension until July 21, 2023. These conformance options include, but are not limited to, restructuring our investments, selling a portion or all of our interests in certain legacy illiquid funds and relying on other applicable exemptions and exclusions under the Volcker Rule. 

As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investments in those legacy illiquid funds approximated $230 million. 

Replacement of London Interbank Offered Rate and Replacement or Reform of Other Interest Rate Benchmarks 

Central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, have sponsored initiatives in recent years to replace LIBOR and replace or reform certain other interest rate benchmarks (collectively, the &#8220;IBORs&#8221;). A transition away from use of the IBORs to alternative rates and other potential interest rate benchmark reforms is underway and is a multi-year initiative. 

The publication of most non-U.S. dollar LIBOR rates ceased as of the end of December 2021, although certain Sterling and Yen LIBOR rates have been published for a limited period following this date on the basis of a &#8220;synthetic&#8221; methodology (known as &#8220;synthetic LIBOR&#8221;). The synthetic Yen LIBOR rates ceased as of the end of December 2022 and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;UK FCA&#8221;), which regulates the publisher of LIBOR (ICE Benchmark Administration), has announced that publication of the one- and six-month tenors of synthetic Sterling LIBOR will cease at the end of March 2023 and the three-month synthetic Sterling LIBOR at the end of March 2024. 

U.S. dollar LIBOR rates are expected to cease being published as of the end of June 2023. On March 15, 2022 the U.S. enacted federal legislation that is intended to minimize legal and economic uncertainty following U.S. dollar LIBOR&#8217;s cessation by replacing LIBOR references in certain U.S. law-governed contracts under certain circumstances with a SOFR-based rate identified in a Federal Reserve rule plus a statutory spread adjustment. While some states have already adopted LIBOR legislation, the federal legislation expressly preempts any provision of any state or local law, statute, rule, regulation or standard. In addition, the UK FCA is considering the continued publication of the one-, three- and six-month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR on a synthetic basis until the end of September 2024. This may result in certain non-U.S. law-governed contracts and U.S. law-governed contracts not covered by the federal legislation to remain on synthetic U.S. dollar LIBOR until the end of this period. 

As of December 31, 2022, our LIBOR-referenced contracts were primarily concentrated in derivative contracts and, to a lesser extent, loans, floating rate notes, preferred shares, securitizations and mortgages. A significant majority of our derivative contracts, and a majority of our non-derivative contracts, contain fallback provisions or otherwise have an expected path that will allow for the transition to an alternative reference rate upon the cessation of the applicable LIBOR rate. 

While we have made substantial progress in the transition away from the IBORs, we nonetheless currently remain party to a significant number of U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked

contracts. For the limited number of U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked contracts without a current market standard fallback, or to which the federal legislation does not apply, we are actively developing appropriate transition plans in light of the planned June 30, 2023 cessation date for the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors. 

Our IBOR transition plan is overseen by a global steering committee, with senior management oversight, and we continue to execute against our Firm-wide IBOR transition plan to complete the transition to alternative reference rates. 

See also &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risk Management&#8221; for a further discussion of risks related to the planned replacement of the IBORs and/or reform of interest rate benchmarks.
