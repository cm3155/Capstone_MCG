Executive Summary 

Overview of Financial Results 

Consolidated Results&#8212;Three Months Ended June 30, 2022 

&#8226; The Firm reported net revenues of $13.1 billion demonstrating the benefits of our diversified franchise as the businesses navigated a challenging market environment. 

&#8226; The Firm delivered ROTCE of 13.8%, or 14.3% excluding the impact of integration-related expenses (see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein). 

&#8226; The Firm&#8217;s expense efficiency ratio was 74%, impacted by $200 million related to a regulatory matter concerning the use of unapproved personal devices and the Firm&#8217;s record-keeping requirements. In the first half of the year, the expense efficiency ratio was 71%, or 70% excluding the impact of integration-related expenses (see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein). 

&#8226; At June 30, 2022, our Standardized Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 15.2%. 

&#8226; Institutional Securities net revenues of $6.1 billion reflect increases in Fixed Income and Equity as clients remained engaged in volatile markets, while limited activity in Investment Banking was impacted by the uncertain macroeconomic environment. 

&#8226; Wealth Management delivered a pre-tax margin of 26.5% or 28.2% excluding integration-related expenses (see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein). Net revenues were $5.7 billion, negatively impacted by mark-to-market losses on investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans. The business added net new assets of $53 billion in the quarter and $195 billion in the first half of 2022. The quarter also saw continued growth in bank lending and $29 billion of fee-based flows. 

&#8226; Investment Management net revenues were $1.4 billion. The diversified business helped results despite lower equity markets.

Earnings per Diluted Common Share 1 

1. Adjusted Diluted EPS was $1.44 for the current quarter and $1.89 for the prior year quarter. Adjusted Diluted EPS was $3.51 for the current year period and $4.11 for the prior year period (see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein for further information). 

We reported net revenues of $13.1 billion in the quarter ended June 30, 2022 (&#8220;current quarter,&#8221; or &#8220;2Q 2022&#8221;) compared with $14.8 billion in the quarter ended June 30, 2021 (&#8220;prior year quarter,&#8221; or &#8220;2Q 2021&#8221;). For the current quarter, net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $2.5 billion, or $1.39 per diluted common share, compared with $3.5 billion or $1.85 per diluted common share in the prior year quarter.

Non-interest Expenses 1 

($ in millions) 

1. The percentages on the bars in the chart represent the contribution of compensation and benefits expenses and non-compensation expenses to the total. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses of $5,550 million in the current quarter decreased 14% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower expenses related to certain deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance and lower stock-based compensation expense driven by the Firm&#8217;s share price, partially offset by the impact of higher headcount. Compensati on and benefits expenses of $11,824 million in the current year period decreased 11% from the prior year period, primarily due to lower expenses related to certain deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance and lower stock-based compensation expense driven by the Firm&#8217;s share price, and lower discretionary incentive compensation, partially offset by the impact of higher headcount, and an increase due to the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives driven by higher compensable revenues. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses of $4,162 million in the current quarter increased 13% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher legal expenses, including $200 million related to the aforementioned regulato ry matter in the current quarter, increased volume-related expenses and increased investments in technology. Non-compensation expenses of $8,044 million in the current year period 

increased 9% from the prior year period, primarily due to higher legal expenses, including $200 million related to the aforementioned regulatory matter in the current quarter, and increased investments in technology. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $101 million in the current quarter was primarily due to portfolio growth and deterioration in macroeconomic outlook. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments in the prior year quarter was $73 million, primarily driven by one secured lending facility. 

The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $158 million in the current year period was primarily due to portfolio growth and deterioration in macroeconomic outlook. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments in the prior year period was a net release of $25 million, primarily as a result of improvements in the outlook of macroeconomic conditions, as the forecasted effects of the COVID-19 pandemic became less severe, and the impact of paydowns on corporate loans, including by lower-rated borrowers, partially offset by the provision for one secured lending facility in the prior year period. 

For further information on the Provision for credit losses, see &#8220;Credit Risk&#8221; herein.

1. Adjusted amounts exclude the effect of costs related to the integrations of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance, net of tax as appropriate. 

2. ROE and ROTCE represent earnings applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders as a percentage of average common equity and average tangible common equity, respectively. When excluding integration-related costs, both the numerator and average denominator are adjusted. 

3. Average common equity and average tangible common equity for each business segment is determined using our Required Capital framework (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Requirements&#8212;Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework&#8221; herein). The sums of the segments&#8217; Average common equity and Average tangible common equity do not equal the Consolidated measures due to Parent equity. 

4. The calculation of ROE and ROTCE by segment uses net income applicable to Morgan Stanley by segment less preferred dividends allocated to each segment as a percentage of average common equity and average tangible common equity, respectively, allocated to each segment. 

Return on Tangible Common Equity Goal 

In January 2022, we established an ROTCE goal of over 20%, excluding integration-related expenses. Our ROTCE goal is a forward-looking statement that was based on a normal market environment and may be materially affected by many factors. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; in the 2021 Form 10-K for further information on market and economic conditions and their potential effects on our future operating results.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Business Segments 

Substantially all of our operating revenues and operating expenses are directly attributable to our business segments. Certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures. See Note 19 to the financial statements for segment net revenues by income statement line item and information on intersegment transactions. 

The global economic and geopolitical environment in the current quarter has been characterized by continued inflation, rising interest rates and volatility in global financial markets. This environment has had a mixed impact on our businesses, which is discussed further herein. 

For an overview of the components of our business segments, net revenues, compensation expense and income taxes, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Business Segments&#8221; in the 2021 Form 10-K.

Acquisition of Eaton Vance 

The comparison of the current year period results to the prior year period is impacted by the acquisition of Eaton Vance on March 1, 2021. For additional information on the acquisition of Eaton Vance, see Note 3 to the financial statements in the 2021 Form 10-K. 

Net Revenues 

Asset Management and Related Fees 

Asset management and related fees of $1,304 million in the current quarter decreased 8% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower average AUM driven by the decline in the equity markets, partially offset by the impact of lower fee waivers in certain money market funds. 

Asset management and related fees of $2,692 million in the current year period increased 7% from the prior year period, primarily due to incremental revenues and higher average AUM as a result of the Eaton Vance acquisition, and the impact of lower fee waivers in certain money market funds, partially offset by the decline in the equity markets. 

See &#8220;Assets under Management or Supervision&#8221; herein. 

Performance-based Income and Other 

Performance-based income and other revenues of $107 million in the current quarter decreased 62% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to losses on investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans compared with gains in the prior year quarter and mark-to-market losses on public investments reflecting the decline in equity markets. 

Performance-based income and other revenues of $54 million in the current year period decreased 89% from the prior year period, primarily due to losses on investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans compared with gains in the prior year period, lower accrued carried interest and mark-to-market losses on public investments reflecting the decline in equity markets. 

Non-interest Expenses 

Non-interest expenses of $1,162 million in the current quarter decreased 9% from the prior year quarter as a result of lower Compensation and benefits. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses decreased in the current quarter primarily due to lower expenses related to certain deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance and lower compensation associated with carried interest. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses were relatively unchanged. 

June 2022 Form 10-Q 15 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Non-interest expenses of $2,269 million in the current year period increased 2% from the prior year period as a result of higher Non-compensation expenses, partially offset with lower Compensation and benefits. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses decreased in the current year period primarily due to lower expenses related to certain deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance and lower compensation associated with carried interest, partially offset by incremental compensation as a result of the Eaton Vance acquisition. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses increased in the current year period primarily due to incremental expenses as a result of the Eaton Vance acquisition.

For certain non-U.S. funds, it includes the portion of advisory fees that the advisor collects on behalf of third-party distributors. The payment of those fees to the distributor is included in Non-compensation expenses in the income statement. 

Certain Eaton Vance products may have higher or lower average fee rates than similar products prior to the acquisition, with the overall impact yielding a lower average fee rate; however, Asset management and related fees arising from the acquisition are incremental to our revenues.

Accounting Development Updates 

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued certain accounting updates that apply to us. Accounting updates not listed below were assessed and either determined to be not applicable or to not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption. 

The following accounting updates are currently being evaluated, however, we do not expect a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption: 

&#8226; Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses. This accounting update eliminates the accounting guidance for Troubled Debt Restructurings (&#8220;TDRs&#8221;) and requires new disclosures regarding certain modifications of financing receivables ( i.e. , principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-than-insignificant payment delays and term extensions) to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The update also requires disclosure of current period gross charge-offs by year of origination for financing receivables measured at amortized cost. The ASU is effective January 1, 2023 with early adoption permitted. 

&#8226; Derivatives and Hedging. The accounting update allows entities to designate fair value hedging relationships to multiple layers in a closed portfolio of prepayable and non-prepayable financial assets. It also provides additional guidance on the accounting for and disclosure of hedge basis adjustments under the portfolio layer method. As of the adoption date, entities are permitted to reclassify HTM debt securities to AFS if the securities will be included in a closed portfolio that are designated in a portfolio layer method hedge. The ASU is effective January 1, 2023 with early adoption permitted. 

&#8226; Fair Value Measurement . This accounting update clarifies, consistent with our current accounting policy, that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The update also requires additional disclosures including the fair value of equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions, the nature and remaining duration of the restriction and circumstances that could cause the restriction to lapse. The ASU is effective January 1, 2024 with early adoption permitted. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 to the financial statements). We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the financial statements in the 2021 Form 10-K and Note 2 to the financial statements), the fair value, goodwill and intangible assets, legal and regulatory contingencies and income taxes policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. For a further discussion about our critical accounting policies, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; in the 2021 Form 10-K.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our liquidity and capital policies are established and maintained by senior management, with oversight by the Asset/Liability Management Committee and the Board of Directors (&#8220;Board&#8221;). Through various risk and control committees, senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity, interest rate and currency sensitivity of our asset and liability position. Our Treasury department, Firm Risk Committee, Asset/Liability Management Committee, and other committees and control groups assist in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our balance sheet, liquidity and capital structure. Liquidity and capital matters are reported regularly to the Board and the Risk Committee of the Board. 

Balance Sheet 

We monitor and evaluate the composition and size of our balance sheet on a regular basis. Our balance sheet management process includes quarterly planning, business-specific thresholds, monitoring of business-specific usage versus key performance metrics and new business impact assessments. 

We establish balance sheet thresholds at the consolidated and business segment levels. We monitor balance sheet utilization and review variances resulting from business activity and market fluctuations. On a regular basis, we review current performance versus established thresholds and assess the need to re-allocate our balance sheet based on business segment needs. We also monitor key metrics, including asset and liability size and capital usage.

2. Other assets primarily includes Goodwill and Intangible assets, premises, equipment and software, ROU assets related to leases, other investments, and deferred tax assets. 

A substantial portion of total assets consists of liquid marketable securities and short-term receivables. In the Institutional Securities business segment, these arise from market-making, financing and prime brokerage activities, and in the Wealth Management business segment, these arise from banking activities, including management of the investment portfolio, comprising Investment securities, Cash and cash equivalents and Securities purchased under agreements to resell. Total assets of $1,174 billion at June 30, 2022 were relatively unchanged from $1,188 billion at December 31, 2021. 

Liquidity Risk Management Framework 

The core components of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework are the Required Liquidity Framework, Liquidity Stress Tests and Liquidity Resources, which support our target liquidity profile. For a further discussion about the Firm&#8217;s Required Liquidity Framework and Liquidity Stress Tests, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Liquidity Risk Management Framework&#8221; in the 2021 Form 10-K. 

At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we maintained sufficient liquidity to meet current and contingent funding obligations as modeled in our Liquidity Stress Tests. 

Liquidity Resources 

We maintain sufficient liquidity resources, which consist of HQLA and cash deposits with banks (&#8220;Liquidity Resources&#8221;) to cover daily funding needs and to meet strategic liquidity targets sized by the Required Liquidity Framework and Liquidity Stress Tests. We actively manage the amount of our Liquidity Resources considering the following components: unsecured debt maturity profile; balance sheet size and composition; funding needs in a stressed environment, inclusive of contingent cash outflows; legal entity, regional and segment liquidity requirements; regulatory requirements; and collateral requirements. 

June 2022 Form 10-Q 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

The amount of Liquidity Resources we hold is based on our risk appetite and is calibrated to meet various internal and regulatory requirements as well as fund prospective business activities. The Liquidity Resources are primarily held within the Parent Company and its major operating subsidiaries. The Total HQLA values in the tables immediately following are different from Eligible HQLA, which, in accordance with the LCR rule, also takes into account certain regulatory weightings and other operational considerations.

Liquidity Resources may fluctuate from period to period based on the overall size and composition of our balance sheet, the maturity profile of our unsecured debt and estimates of funding needs in a stressed environment, among other factors. 

Regulatory Liquidity Framework 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio 

We and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum LCR and NSFR of 100%. The LCR requires that large banking organizations have sufficient Eligible HQLA to cover net cash outflows arising from significant stress over 30 calendar days, thus promoting the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banking organizations. In determining 

Eligible HQLA for LCR purposes, weightings (or asset haircuts) are applied to HQLA, and certain HQLA held in subsidiaries is excluded. The NSFR requires large banking organizations to maintain sufficiently stable sources of funding over a one-year time horizon. 

As of June 30, 2022, we and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are compliant with the minimum LCR and NSFR requirements of 100%.

1. Under the LCR rule, Eligible HQLA is calculated using weightings and excluding certain HQLA held in subsidiaries. 

2. Primarily includes U.S. Treasuries, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, sovereign bonds and investment grade corporate bonds. 

Funding Management 

We manage our funding in a manner that reduces the risk of disruption to our operations. We pursue a strategy of diversification of secured and unsecured funding sources (by product, investor and region) and attempt to ensure that the tenor of our liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed. Our goal is to achieve an optimal mix of durable secured and unsecured financing. 

We fund our balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources. These sources include our equity capital, borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities lending, deposits, letters of credit and lines of credit. We have active financing programs for both standard and structured products targeting global investors and currencies. 

Secured Financing

1. Original maturity in the table is generally based on contractual final maturity. For borrowings with put options, remaining maturity represents the earliest put date. 

2. Includes only borrowings with original maturities greater than one year. 

Borrowings of $226 billion as of June 30, 2022 were relatively unchanged when compared with $233 billion at December 31, 2021. 

We believe that accessing debt investors through multiple distribution channels helps provide consistent access to the unsecured markets. In addition, the issuance of borrowings with original maturities greater than one year allows us to reduce reliance on short-term credit sensitive instruments. Borrowings with original maturities greater than one year are generally managed to achieve staggered maturities, thereby mitigating refinancing risk, and to maximize investor diversification through sales to global institutional and retail clients across regions, currencies and product types. 

The availability and cost of financing to us can vary depending on market conditions, the volume of certain trading and lending activities, our credit ratings and the overall availability of credit. We also engage in, and may continue to engage in, repurcha ses of our borrowings as part of our market-making activities. 

For further information on Borrowings, see Note 12 to the financial statements. 

Credit Ratings 

We rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our daily operations. Our credit ratings are one of the factors in the cost and availability of financing and can have an impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer-term counterparty performance is a key consideration, such as certain OTC derivative transactions. When determining credit ratings, rating agencies consider both company-specific and industry-wide factors. See also &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Liquidity Risk&#8221; in the 2021 Form 10-K.

Incremental Collateral or Terminating Payments 

In connection with certain OTC derivatives and certain other agreements where we are a liquidity provider to certain financing vehicles associated with the Institutional Securities business segment, we may be required to provide additional collateral, immediately settle any outstanding liability balances with certain counterparties or pledge additional collateral to certain clearing organizations in the event of a future credit rating downgrade irrespective of whether we are in a net asset or net liability position. See Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information on OTC derivatives that contain such contingent features. 

While certain aspects of a credit rating downgrade are quantifiable pursuant to contractual provisions, the impact it would have on our business and results of operations in future periods is inherently uncertain and would depend on a number of interrelated factors, including, among other things, the magnitude of the downgrade, the rating relative to peers, the rating assigned by the relevant agency before the downgrade, individual client behavior and future mitigating actions we might take. The liquidity impact of additional collateral requirements is included in our Liquidity Stress Tests. 

Capital Management 

We view capital as an important source of financial strength and actively manage our consolidated capital position based upon, among other things, business opportunities, risks, capital availability and rates of return together with internal capital policies, regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines. In the future, we may expand or contract our capital base to address the changing needs of our businesses.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We enter into various off-balance sheet arrangements, including through unconsolidated SPEs and lending-related financial instruments ( e.g. , guarantees and commitments), primarily in connection with the Institutional Securities and Investment Management business segments. 

We utilize SPEs primarily in connection with securitization activities. For information on our securitization activities, see Note 16 to the financial statements in the 2021 Form 10-K.

Regulatory Requirements 

Regulatory Capital Framework 

We are an FHC under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (&#8220;BHC Act&#8221;) and are subject to the regulation and oversight of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements for us, including &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; standards, and evaluates our compliance 

June 2022 Form 10-Q 21 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

with such capital requirements. The OCC establishes similar capital requirements and standards for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. The regulatory capital requirements are largely based on the Basel III capital standards established by the Basel Committee and also implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. For us to remain an FHC, we must remain well-capitalized in accordance with standards established by the Federal Reserve, and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must remain well-capitalized in accordance with standards established by the OCC. In addition, many of our regulated subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements, including regulated subsidiaries provisionally registered as swap dealers with the CFTC or conditionally registered as security-based swap dealers with the SEC or registered as broker-dealers or futures commission merchants. For additional information on regulatory capital requirements for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, as well as our subsidiaries that are Swap Entities, see Note 15 to the financial statements. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 

We are required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage-based capital and TLAC ratios. For more information, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Capital Requirements&#8221; in the 2021 Form 10-K. For additional information on TLAC, see &#8220;Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements&#8221; herein. 

Risk-Based Regulatory Capital. Risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital (which includes Tier 2 capital), each as a percentage of RWA, and consist of regulatory minimum required ratios plus our capital buffer requirement. Capital requirements require certain adjustments to, and deductions from, capital for purposes of determining these ratios. 

Risk-Based Regulatory Capital Ratio Requirements At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 

Standardized Advanced Capital buffers Capital conservation buffer &#8212; 2.5% SCB 1 

5.7% N/A G-SIB capital surcharge 2 

3.0% 3.0% CCyB 3

1. For additional information on the SCB, see &#8220;Capital Plans, Stress Tests and the Stress Capital Buffer&#8221; herein and in the 2021 Form 10-K. 

2. For a further discussion of the G-SIB capital surcharge, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Requirements&#8212;G-SIB Capital Surcharge&#8221; in the 2021 Form 10-K. 

3. The CCyB can be set up to 2.5%, but is currently set by the Federal Reserve at zero. 

The capital buffer requirement represents the amount of Common Equity Tier 1 capital we must maintain above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of 

stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. Our Standardized Approach capital buffer requirement is equal to the sum of our SCB, G-SIB capital surcharge and CCyB, and our Advanced Approach capital buffer requirement is equal to our 2.5% capital conservation buffer, G-SIB capital surcharge and CCyB.

1. Required ratios represent the regulatory minimum plus the capital buffer requirement. 

Our risk-based capital ratios are computed under each of (i) the standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market risk RWA (&#8220;Standardized Approach&#8221;) and (ii) the applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk RWA (&#8220;Advanced Approach&#8221;). The credit risk RWA calculations between the two approaches differ in that the Standardized Approach requires calculation of RWA using prescribed risk weights, whereas the Advanced Approach utilizes models to calculate exposure amounts and risk weights. At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the differences between the actual and required ratios were lower under the Standardized Approach. 

Leverage-Based Regulatory Capital. Leverage-based capital requirements include a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%, a minimum SLR of 3% and an enhanced SLR capital buffer of at least 2%. 

CECL Deferral. As of December 31, 2021, our risk-based and leverage-based capital amounts and ratios, as well as RWA, adjusted average assets and supplementary leverage exposure were calculated excluding the effect of the adoption of CECL based on our election to defer this effect over a five-year transition period that began on January 1, 2020. In 2022 the deferral impacts began to phase in at 25% per year and will become fully phased-in beginning in 2025.

Regulatory VaR&#8212;VaR for regulatory capital requirements 

Credit risk RWA in the current year period decreased under the Standardized Approach, but increased under the Advanced Approach. Under the Standardized Approach, the decrease was primarily due to reduced equity and credit Derivatives exposures and lower client activity in Securities financing transactions, partially offset by lending growth. Under the Advanced Approach, the increase was primarily due to higher commodity Derivatives exposure and lending growth, partially offset by a decrease in Investment securities. 

Market risk RWA was relatively unchanged in the current year period under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. 

The increase in Operational risk RWA in the current year period reflects higher legal expenses and execution-related losses. 

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements 

The Federal Reserve has established external TLAC, long-term debt (&#8220;LTD&#8221;) and clean holding company requirements for top-tier BHCs of U.S. G-SIBs (&#8220;covered BHCs&#8221;), including the Parent Company. These requirements are designed to ensure that covered BHCs will have enough loss-absorbing resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized through the conversion of eligible LTD to equity or otherwise by imposing losses on eligible LTD or other forms of TLAC where an SPOE resolution strategy is used.

Capital Plans, Stress Tests and the Stress Capital Buffer 

The Federal Reserve has capital planning and stress test requirements for large BHCs, which form part of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s annual CCAR framework. 

We must submit, on at least an annual basis, a capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate annual stress tests designed by us and the Federal Reserve, so that the Federal Reserve may assess our systems and processes that incorporate forward-looking projections of revenues and losses to monitor and maintain our internal capital adequacy. As banks with less than $250 billion of total assets, our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are not subject to company-run stress test regulatory requirements. 

For the 2022 capital planning and stress test cycle, we submitted our capital plan and company-run stress test results to the Federal Reserve on April 5, 2022. On June 23, 2022, the Federal Reserve published summary results of its supervisory stress tests of each large BHC, in which the projected decline in our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio in the severely adverse scenario improved from the prior annual supervisory stress test by 10 basis points, from 4.7% to 4.6% . Following the publication of the supervisory stress test results, and as a result of the increase in our common stock dividend and the resulting dividend add-on, we announced that our SCB will be 5.8% from October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023. Together with other features of the regulatory capital framework, this SCB results in an aggregate Standardized Approach Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 

June 2022 Form 10-Q 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

13.3%. Generally, our SCB is determined annually based on the results of the supervisory stress test. 

We also disclosed a summary of the results of our company-run stress tests on our Investor Relations website and increased our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.775 per share from $0.70, beginning with the common stock dividend announced on July 14, 2022. Additionally, our Board of Directors approved a new multi-year repurchase authorization of up to $20 billion of outstanding common stock, without a set expiration date, beginning in the third quarter of 2022, which will be exercised from time to time as conditions warrant. 

For additional information, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Requirements&#8212;Capital Plans, Stress Tests and the Stress Capital Buffer&#8221; in the 2021 Form 10-K. 

Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework 

Our required capital (&#8220;Required Capital&#8221;) estimation is based on the Required Capital framework, an internal capital adequacy measure. Common equity attribution to the business segments is based on capital usage calculated under the Required Capital framework, as well as each business segment&#8217;s relative contribution to our total Required Capital. 

The Required Capital framework is a risk-based and leverage-based capital measure, which is compared with our regulatory capital to ensure that we maintain an amount of going concern capital after absorbing potential losses from stress events, where applicable, at a point in time. The amount of capital allocated to the business segments is generally set at the beginning of each year and remains fixed throughout the year until the next annual reset unless a significant business change occurs ( e.g ., acquisition or disposition). We define the difference between our total average common equity and the sum of the average common equity amounts allocated to our business segments as Parent common equity. We generally hold Parent common equity for prospective regulatory requirements, organic growth, potential future acquisitions and other capital needs.

Resolution and Recovery Planning 

We are required to submit once every two years to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a resolution plan that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of our material financial distress or failure. We submitted our 2021 targeted resolution plan on June 30, 2021. On July 1, 2022, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC announced that they have extended the period for issuing feedback for the U.S. G-SIBs&#8217; 2021 resolution plans to allow the agencies additional time to analyze them. 

As described in our most recent resolution plan, our preferred resolution strategy is an SPOE strategy. In line with our SPOE strategy, the Parent Company has transferred, and has agreed to transfer on an ongoing basis, certain assets to its wholly owned, direct subsidiary Morgan Stanley Holdings LLC (the &#8220;Funding IHC&#8221;). In addition, the Parent Company has entered into an amended and restated support agreement with its material entities (including the Funding IHC) and certain other subsidiaries. In the event of a resolution scenario, the Parent Company would be obligated to contribute all of its Contributable Assets to our material entities and/or the Funding IHC. The Funding IHC would be obligated to provide capital and liquidity, as applicable, to our material entities. The combined implication of the SPOE resolution strategy and the requirement to maintain certain levels of TLAC is that losses in resolution would be imposed on the holders of eligible long-term debt and other forms of eligible TLAC issued by the Parent Company before any losses are imposed on creditors of our material entities and without requiring taxpayer or government financial support. 

For more information about resolution and recovery planning requirements and our activities in these areas, including the implications of such activities in a resolution scenario, see &#8220;Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation&#8212;Financial Holding Company&#8212;Resolution and Recovery Planning,&#8221; &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk&#8221; and &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Requirements&#8212;Resolution and Recovery Planning&#8221; in the 2021 Form 10-K.

Replacement of London Interbank Offered Rate and Replacement or Reform of Other Interest Rate Benchmarks 

Central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, have commissioned committees and working groups of market participants and official sector representatives to replace LIBOR and replace or reform other interest rate benchmarks (collectively, the &#8220;IBORs&#8221;). A transition away from use of the IBORs to alternative rates and other potential interest rate benchmark reforms is underway and will continue through the cessation dates. 

The publication of most non-U.S. dollar LIBOR rates ceased as of the end of December 2021. The publication of certain non-U.S. dollar LIBOR rates on the basis of a &#8220;synthetic&#8221; methodology (known as &#8220;synthetic LIBOR&#8221;) will continue at least until the end of 2022 and certain U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors are expected to continue to be published until June 30, 2023 . On March 15, 2022 the U.S. enacted federal legislation that is intended to minimize legal and economic uncertainty following U.S. dollar LIBOR&#8217;s cessation by replacing LIBOR references in certain contracts under certain circumstances with a SOFR-based rate to be established in a Federal Reserve rule that incorporates a spread adjustment specified in the statute. On July 19, 2022, the Federal Reserve issued a proposed rule to implement the federal legislation. While some states have already adopted LIBOR legislation, the federal legislation expressly preempts any provision of any state or local law, statute, rule, regulation or standard. 

As of June 30, 2022 , our LIBOR-referenced contracts were primarily concentrated in derivative contracts and to a lesser extent, loans, floating rate notes, preferred shares, securitizations and mortgages. A significant majority of our derivative contracts, and a majority of our non-derivative contracts contain fallback provisions or otherwise have an expected path that will allow for the transition to an alternative reference rate upon the cessation of the applicable LIBOR rate. 

While we have made substantial progress in the transition away from the IBORs, we nonetheless currently remain party to a significant number of U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked contracts. For the limited number of U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked contracts without a current market standard fallback, or for which the federal legislation does not apply, we are actively developing appropriate transition plans in light of the planned June 30, 2023 cessation date for the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors. 

Our IBOR transition plan is overseen by a global steering committee, with senior management oversight, and we 

continue to execute against our Firm-wide IBOR transition plan to complete the transition to alternative reference rates.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk 

Management believes effective risk management is vital to the success of our business activities. For a discussion of our Enterprise Risk Management framework and risk management functions, see &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Risk Management&#8221; in the 2021 Form 10-K. 

Market Risk 

Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, spreads, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity, will result in losses for a position or portfolio. Generally, we incur market risk as a result of trading, investing and client facilitation activities, principally within the Institutional Securities business segment where the substantial majority of our VaR for market risk exposures is generated. In addition, we incur non-trading market risk, principally within the Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments. The Wealth Management business segment primarily incurs non-trading market risk (including interest rate risk) from lending and deposit-taking activities. The Investment Management business segment primarily incurs non-trading market risk from capital investments in its funds. For a further discussion of market risk, see &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Market Risk&#8221; in the 2021 Form 10-K. 

Trading Risks 

We have exposures to a wide range of risks related to interest rates and credit spreads, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices as well as the associated implied volatilities and spreads of the global markets in which we conduct our trading activities. 

The statistical technique known as VaR is one of the tools we use to measure, monitor and review the market risk exposures of our trading portfolios. 

For information regarding our primary risk exposures and market risk management, VaR methodology, assumptions and limitations, see &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Market Risk&#8212;Trading Risks&#8221; in the 2021 Form 10-K.

1. The high and low VaR values for the Total Management VaR and each of the component VaRs might have occurred on different days during the quarter, and, therefore, the diversification benefit is not an applicable measure. 

2. Diversification benefit equals the difference between the total VaR and the sum of the component VaRs. This benefit arises because the simulated one-day losses for each of the components occur on different days; similar diversification benefits also are taken into account within each component. 

Average Total Management VaR and average Management VaR for the Primary Risk Categories increased from the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily from the commodity price and interest rate and credit spread risk categories, which were driven by increased market volatility and by increased exposure in the Fixed Income business. 

Distribution of VaR Statistics and Net Revenues 

We evaluate the reasonableness of our VaR model by comparing the potential declines in portfolio values generated by the model with corresponding actual trading results for the Firm, as well as individual business units. For days where losses exceed the VaR statistic, we examine the drivers of trading losses to evaluate the VaR model&#8217;s accuracy . There was one loss day in the current quarter, which did not exceed 95% Total Management VaR.

Daily Net Trading Revenues for the Current Quarter 

($ in millions) 

The previous histogram shows the distribution of daily net trading revenues for the current quarter. Daily net trading revenues include profits and losses from Interest rate and credit spread, Equity price, Foreign exchange rate, Commodity price, and Credit Portfolio positions and intraday trading activities for our trading businesses. Certain items such as fees, commissions, net interest income and counterparty default risk are excluded from daily net trading revenues and the VaR model. Revenues required for Regulatory VaR backtesting further exclude intraday trading. 

Non-Trading Risks 

We believe that sensitivity analysis is an appropriate representation of our non-trading risks. The following sensitivity analyses cover substantially all of the non-trading risk in our portfolio.

1. Amounts represent the potential gain for each 1 bps widening of our credit spread. 

Credit spread risk sensitivity for borrowings carried at fair value as of June 30, 2022 decreased from March 31, 2022 primarily due to widening credit spreads, partially offset by new debt issuances. 

The Wealth Management business segment reflects a substantial portion of our non-trading interest rate risk. Historically, net interest income sensitivity for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries was representative of such sensitivity for the Wealth Management business segment and, accordingly, we presented net interest income sensitivity for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. However, over time the Wealth Management business segment has grown its assets that generate net interest income outside of the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, such as margin and other lending on non-bank entities, and this growth has been further accelerated by the acquisition of E*TRADE. Net interest in the Wealth Management business segment primarily consists of interest income earned on non-trading assets, including loans and investment securities, as well as margin and other lending on non-bank entities and interest expense incurred on non-trading liabilities, primarily deposits.

The previous table presents an analysis of selected instantaneous upward and downward parallel interest rate shocks (subject to a floor of zero percent in the downward scenario) on net interest income over the next 12 months for our Wealth Management business segment. These shocks are applied to our 12-month forecast for our Wealth Management business segment, which incorporates market expectations of interest rates and our forecasted business activity. 

We do not manage to any single rate scenario but rather manage net interest income in our Wealth Management business segment to optimize across a range of possible outcomes, including non-parallel rate change scenarios. The sensitivity analysis assumes that we take no action in response to these scenarios, assumes there are no changes in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates and includes subjective assumptions regarding customer and market re-pricing behavior and other factors. The change in sensitivity to interest rates between June 30,

We have exposure to public and private companies through direct investments, as well as through funds that invest in these assets. These investments are predominantly equity positions with long investment horizons, a portion of which is for business facilitation purposes. The market risk related to these investments is measured by estimating the potential reduction in net revenues associated with a reasonably possible 10% decline in investment values and rel ated impact on performance-based income, as applicable. 

Asset Management Revenue Sensitivity 

Certain asset management revenues in the Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments are derived from management fees, which are based on fee-based client assets in Wealth Management or AUM in Investment Management (together, &#8220;client holdings&#8221;). The assets underlying client holdings are primarily composed of equity, fixed income and alternative investments and are sensitive to changes in related markets. The overall level of these revenues depends on multiple factors that include, but are not limited to, the level and duration of a market increase or decline, price volatility, the geographic and industry mix of client assets, and client behavior such as the rate and magnitude of client investments and redemptions. Therefore, overall revenues do not correlate completely with changes in the related markets. 

Credit Risk 

Credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising when a borrower, counterparty or issuer does not meet its financial obligations to us. We are primarily exposed to credit risk from institutions and individuals through our Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments. For a further discussion of our credit risks, see &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Credit Risk&#8221; in the 2021 Form 10-K.

1. Investment Management business segment loans are related to certain of our activities as an investment advisor and manager. Loans held at fair value are the result of the consolidation of investment vehicles (including CLOs) managed by Investment Management, composed primarily of senior secured loans to corporations. 

2. FVO also includes the fair value of certain unfunded lending commitments. 

3. Lending commitments represent the notional amount of legally binding obligations to provide funding to clients for lending transactions. Since commitments associated with these business activities may expire unused or may not be utilized to full capacity, they do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements. 

We provide loans and lending commitments to a variety of customers, including large corporate and institutional clients, as well as high to ultra-high net worth individuals. In addition, we purchase loans in the secondary market. Loans and lending commitments are either held for investment, held for sale or carried at fair value. For more information on these loan classifications, see Note 2 to the financial statements in the 2021 Form 10-K.

Credit exposure arising from our loans and lending commitments is measured in accordance with our internal risk management standards. Risk factors considered in determining the allowance for credit losses for loans and lending commitments include the borrower&#8217;s financial strength, industry, facility structure, LTV ratio, debt service ratio, collateral and covenants. Qualitative and environmental factors such as economic and business conditions, nature and volume of the portfolio and lending terms, and volume and severity of past due loans may also be considered. 

The aggregate allowance for credit losses for loans and lending commitments increased in the current year period, reflecting the Provision for credit losses primarily due to portfolio growth and deterioration in macroeconomic outlook. 

The base scenario used in our ACL models as of June 30, 2022 was generated using a combination of industry consensus economic forecasts, forward rates, and internally developed and validated models, and assumes continued economic growth over the forecast period. Given the nature of our lending portfolio, the most sensitive model input is U.S. gross domestic product.

Securities-based lending allows clients to borrow money against the value of qualifying securities, generally for any purpose other than purchasing, trading or carrying securities or refinancing margin debt.

Additionally, Wealth Management&#8217;s securities-based lending portfolio remains well-collateralized and subject to daily client margining, which includes requiring customers to deposit additional collateral or reduce debt positions, when necessary.

The Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments provide margin lending arrangements that allow customers to borrow against the value of qualifying securities, primarily for the purpose of purchasing additional securities, as well as to collateralize short positions. Institutional Securities primarily includes margin loans in the Equity Financing business. Wealth Management includes margin loans as well as non-purpose securities-based lending on non-bank entities. Amounts may fluctuate from period to period as overall client balances change as a result of market levels, client positioning and leverage. 

Credit exposures arising from margin lending activities are generally mitigated by their short-term nature, the value of collateral held and our right to call for additional margin when collateral values decline. However, we could incur losses in the event that the customer fails to meet margin calls and collateral values decline below the loan amount. This risk is elevated in loans backed by collateral pools with significant concentrations in individual issuers or securities with similar risk characteristics. For a further discussion, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Credit Risk&#8221; in the 2021 Form 10-K.

1. Net inventory represents exposure to both long and short single-name and index positions ( i.e ., bonds and equities at fair value and CDS based on a notional amount assuming zero recovery adjusted for the fair value of any receivable or payable). 

2. Net counterparty exposure ( e.g ., repurchase transactions, securities lending and OTC derivatives) is net of the benefit of collateral received and also is net by counterparty when legally enforceable master netting agreements are in place. For more information, see &#8220;Additional Information&#8212;Top 10 Non-U.S. Country Exposures&#8221; herein. 

3. Amounts represent net CDS hedges (purchased and sold) on net counterparty exposure and lending executed by trading desks responsible for hedging counterparty and lending credit risk exposures. Amounts are based on the CDS notional amount assuming zero recovery adjusted for the fair value of any receivable or payable. For further description of the contractual terms for purchased credit protection and whether they may limit the effectiveness of our hedges, see &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Credit Risk&#8212;Derivatives&#8221; in the 2021 Form 10-K.

Operational Risk 

Operational risk refers to the risk of loss, or of damage to our reputation, resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, from human factors or from external events ( e.g. , cyber attacks or third-party vulnerabilities) that may manifest as, for example, loss of information, business disruption, theft and fraud, legal and compliance risks, or damage to physical assets. We may incur operational risk across the full scope of our business activities, including revenue-generating activities and support and control groups ( e.g. , information technology and trade processing). For a further discussion about our operational risk, see &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Operational Risk&#8221; in the 2021 Form 10-K. 

Model Risk 

Model risk refers to the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs. Model risk can lead to financial loss, poor business and strategic decision making or damage to our reputation. The risk inherent in a model is a function of the materiality, complexity and uncertainty around inputs and assumptions. Model risk is generated from the use of models impacting financial statements, regulatory filings, capital adequacy assessments and the formulation of strategy. For a further discussion about our model risk, see &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Model Risk&#8221; in the 2021 Form 10-K. 

Liquidity Risk 

Liquidity risk refers to the risk that we will be unable to finance our operations due to a loss of access to the capital markets or difficulty in liquidating our assets. Liquidity risk also encompasses our ability (or perceived ability) to meet our financial obligations without experiencing significant business disruption or reputational damage that may threaten our viability as a going concern. For a further discussion about our liquidity risk, see &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Liquidity Risk&#8221; in the 2021 Form 10-K and &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; herein. 

Legal and Compliance Risk 

Legal and compliance risk includes the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, including fines, penalties, judgments, damages and/or settlements, limitations on our business, or loss to reputation that we may suffer as a result of failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, related self-regulatory organization standards and codes of conduct applicable to our business activities. This risk also includes contractual and commercial risk, such as the risk that a counterparty&#8217;s performance obligations will be unenforceable. It also includes compliance with AML, terrorist financing, and anti-corruption rules and regulations. For a further discussion about our legal and compliance risk, see &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Legal and Compliance Risk&#8221; in the 2021 Form 10-K.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Morgan Stanley: 

Results of Review of Interim Financial Information 

We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of Morgan Stanley and subsidiaries (the &#8220;Firm&#8221;) as of June 30, 2022, and the related condensed consolidated income statements, comprehensive income statements and statements of changes in total equity for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, and the cash flow statements for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;interim financial information&#8221;). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Firm as of December 31, 2021, and the related consolidated income statement, comprehensive income statement, cash flow statement and statement of changes in total equity for the year then ended (not presented herein) included in the Firm&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K; and in our report dated February 24, 2022, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 

Basis for Review Results 

This interim financial information is the responsibility of the Firm&#8217;s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms &#8220;Morgan Stanley&#8221; or the &#8220;Firm&#8221; mean Morgan Stanley (the &#8220;Parent Company&#8221;) together with its consolidated subsidiaries.

See the &#8220;Glossary of Common Terms and Acronyms&#8221; for the definition of certain terms and acronyms used throughout this Form 10-Q. 

A description of the clients and principal products and services of each of the Firm&#8217;s business segments is as follows: 

Institutional Securities provides a variety of products and services to corporations, governments, financial institutions and ultra-high net worth clients.

Basis of Financial Information 

The financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the Firm to make estimates and assumptions regarding the valuations of certain financial instruments, the valuations of goodwill and intangible assets, the outcome of legal and tax matters, deferred tax assets, ACL, and other matters that affect its financial statements and related disclosures. The Firm believes that the estimates utilized in the preparation of its financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. 

The notes are an integral part of the Firm&#8217;s financial statements. The Firm has evaluated subsequent events for adjustment to or disclosure in these financial statements through the date of this report and has not identified any recordable or disclosable events not otherwise reported in these financial statements or the notes thereto. 

The accompanying financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Firm&#8217;s financial statements and notes thereto included in the 2021 Form 10-K. Certain footnote disclosures included in the 2021 Form 10-K have been condensed or omitted from these financial statements as they are not required for interim reporting under U.S. GAAP. The financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for the fair presentation of the results for the interim period. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year. 

Consolidation 

The financial statements include the accounts of the Firm, its wholly owned subsidiaries and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest, including certain VIEs (see Note 14). Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. For consolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly owned, the third-party holdings of equity interests are referred to as Noncontrolling interests. The net income attributable to Noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented as Net income applicable to noncontrolling interests in the income statement. The portion of shareholders&#8217; equity that is attributable to noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented as Noncontrolling interests, a component of Total equity, in the balance sheet. 

For a discussion of the Firm&#8217;s significant regulated U.S. and international subsidiaries and its involvement with VIEs, see Note 1 to the financial statements in the 2021 Form 10-K.

1. Net transfers from Level 3 to Level 2 in the prior year quarter reflect $ 2.0 billion of Corporate and Other Debt, $ 1.0 billion of net Equity derivatives, and $ 2.2 billion of Borrowings as the unobservable inputs were not significant to the overall fair value measurements. 

2. Net transfers in the prior year period reflect the transfer in the first quarter of the prior year of $ 2.5 billion of AFS securities from Level 3 to Level 2 due to increased trading activity and observability of pricing inputs. 

Level 3 instruments may be hedged with instruments classified in Level 1 and Level 2. The realized and unrealized gains or losses for assets and liabilities within the Level 3 category presented in the previous tables do not reflect the related realized and unrealized gains or losses on hedging instruments that have been classified by the Firm within the Level 1 and/or Level 2 categories. 

The unrealized gains (losses) during the period for assets and liabilities within the Level 3 category may include changes in fair value during the period that were attributable to both observable and unobservable inputs. Total realized and unrealized gains (losses) are primarily included in Trading revenues in the income statement. 

Additionally, in the previous tables, consolidations of VIEs are included in Purchases, and deconsolidations of VIEs are included in Settlements.

The previous table provides information on the valuation techniques, significant unobservable inputs, and the ranges and averages for each major category of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis with a significant Level 3 balance. The level of aggregation and breadth of products cause the range of inputs to be wide and not evenly distributed across the inventory of financial instruments. Further, the range of unobservable inputs may differ across firms in the financial services industry because of diversity in the types of products included in each firm&#8217;s inventory. Generally, there are no predictable relationships between multiple significant unobservable inputs attributable to a given valuation technique. 

For a description of the Firm&#8217;s significant unobservable inputs and qualitative information about the effect of hypothetical changes in the values of those inputs, see Note 5 to the financial statements in the 2021 Form 10-K. During the current quarter, there were no significant revisions made to the descriptions of the Firm&#8217;s significant unobservable inputs.

1. Investments in hedge funds may be subject to initial period lock-up or gate provisions, which restrict an investor from withdrawing from the fund during a certain initial period or restrict the redemption amount on any redemption date, respectively. 

Amounts in the previous table represent the Firm&#8217;s carrying value of general and limited partnership interests in fund investments, as well as any related performance-based income in the form of carried interest. The carrying amounts are measured based on the NAV of the fund taking into account the distribution terms applicable to the interest held. This same measurement applies whether the fund investments are accounted for under the equity method or fair value. 

For a description of the Firm&#8217;s investments in private equity funds, real estate funds and hedge funds, which are measured based on NAV, see Note 5 to the financial statements in the 2021 Form 10-K. 

See Note 13 for information regarding general partner guarantees, which include potential obligations to return performance fee distributions previously received. See Note 19 for information regarding unrealized carried interest at risk of reversal.

1. Gains and losses for Loans and Other assets&#8212;Other investments are classified in Other revenues. For other items, gains and losses are recorded in Other revenues if the item is held for sale; otherwise, they are recorded in Other expenses. 

2. Nonrecurring changes in the fair value of loans and lending commitments, which exclude the impact of related economic hedges, are calculated as follows: for the held-for-investment category, based on the value of the underlying collateral; and for the held-for-sale category, based on recently executed transactions, market price quotations, valuation models that incorporate market observable inputs where possible, such as comparable loan or debt prices and CDS spread levels adjusted for any basis difference between cash and derivative instruments, or default recovery analysis where such transactions and quotations are unobservable. 

3. Losses related to Other assets&#8212;Other investments were determined using techniques that included discounted cash flow models, methodologies that incorporate multiples of certain comparable companies and recently executed transactions.

5. Fair Value Option 

The Firm has elected the fair value option for certain eligible instruments that are risk managed on a fair value basis to mitigate income statement volatility caused by measurement basis differences between the elected instruments and their associated risk management transactions or to eliminate complexities of applying certain accounting models.

The notional amounts of derivative contracts generally overstate the Firm&#8217;s exposure. In most circumstances, notional amounts are used only as a reference point from which to calculate amounts owed between the parties to the contract. Furthermore, notional amounts do not reflect the benefit of legally enforceable netting arrangements or risk mitigating transactions. 

For a discussion of the Firm&#8217;s derivative instruments and hedging activities, see Note 7 to the financial statements in the 2021 Form 10-K.

For AFS securities, the Firm believes there are no securities in an unrealized loss position that have credit losses after performing the analysis described in Note 2 in the 2021 Form 10-K and the Firm expects to recover the amortized cost basis of these securities. Additionally, the Firm does not intend to sell these securities and is not likely to be required to sell these securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis. 

As of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the securities in an unrealized loss position are predominantly investment grade. 

The HTM securities net carrying amounts at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 reflect an ACL of $ 32 million and $ 33 million, respectively, related to Non-agency CMBS. See Note 2 in the 2021 Form 10-K for a description of the ACL methodology used for HTM Securities. As of June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, Non-Agency CMBS HTM securities were predominantly on accrual status and investment grade. 

See Note 14 for additional information on securities issued by VIEs, including U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, non-agency CMBS, and FFELP student loan ABS.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

The base scenario used in our ACL models as of June 30, 2022 was generated using a combination of industry consensus economic forecasts, forward rates, and internally developed and validated models, and assumes continued economic growth over the forecast period. Given the nature of our lending portfolio, the most sensitive model input is U.S. gross domestic product. For a further discussion of the Firm&#8217;s loans as well as the Firm&#8217;s allowance methodology, refer to Notes 2 and 10 to the financial statements in the 2021 Form 10-K.

These liabilities are generally payable from the cash flows of the related assets accounted for as Trading assets. See Note 14 for further information on other secured financings related to VIEs and securitization activities. 

For transfers of assets that fail to meet accounting criteria for a sale, the Firm continues to record the assets and recognizes the associated liabilities in the balance sheet.

1. The carrying amounts of derivative contracts that meet the accounting definition of a guarantee are shown on a gross basis. For further information on derivatives contracts, see Note 6. 

2. These amounts include certain issued standby letters of credit participated to third parties, totaling $ 0.7 billion of notional and collateral/recourse, due to the nature of the Firm&#8217;s obligations under these arrangements. As of June 30, 2022, the carrying amount of standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees issued includes an allowance for credit losses of $ 82 million. 

3. Related to commercial and residential mortgage securitizations. 

The Firm has obligations under certain guarantee arrangements, including contracts and indemnification agreements, that contingently require the Firm to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying measure (such as an interest or foreign exchange rate, security or commodity price, an index, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of a specified event) related to an asset, liability or equity security of a guaranteed party. Also included as guarantees are contracts that contingently require the Firm to make payments to the guaranteed party based on another entity&#8217;s failure to perform under an agreement, as well as indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others. 

For more information on the nature of the obligations and related business activities for our guarantees, see Note 15 to the financial statements in the 2021 Form 10-K. 

Other Guarantees and Indemnities 

In the normal course of business, the Firm provides guarantees and indemnifications in a variety of transactions. These provisions generally are standard contractual terms. Certain of these guarantees and indemnifications related to indemnities, exchange and clearinghouse member guarantees and merger and acquisition guarantees are described in Note 15 to the financial statements in the 2021 Form 10-K. 

In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Firm guarantees the debt and/or certain trading obligations (including obligations associated with derivatives, foreign exchange contracts and the settlement of physical commodities) of certain subsidiaries. These guarantees generally are entity or product specific and are required by investors or trading counterparties. The activities of the Firm&#8217;s subsidiaries covered by these guarantees (including 

June 2022 Form 10-Q 58 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

any related debt or trading obligations) are included in the financial statements. 

Finance Subsidiary 

The Parent Company fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by Morgan Stanley Finance LLC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary. No other subsidiary of the Parent Company guarantees these securities. 

Contingencies 

Legal 

In addition to the matter described below, in the normal course of business, the Firm has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, as well as being subject to regulatory investigations arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services institution. Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions or regulatory investigations include claims for substantial penalties, compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of penalties or damages. In some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such legal actions are bankrupt or are in financial distress. These actions and investigations have included, but are not limited to, antitrust, false claims act, residential mortgage and credit crisis-related matters. 

While the Firm has identified below any individual proceedings where the Firm believes a material loss to be reasonably possible and reasonably estimable, there can be no assurance that material losses will not be incurred from claims that have not yet been asserted or those where potential losses have not yet been determined to be probable or possible and reasonably estimable.

The Firm&#8217;s legal expenses can, and may in the future, fluctuate from period to period, given the current environment regarding government investigations and private litigation affecting global financial services firms, including the Firm. 

In many proceedings and investigations, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss. In addition, even where a loss is possible or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the liability already accrued with respect to a previously recognized loss contingency, it is not always possible to reasonably estimate the size of the possible loss or range of loss, particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties. Numerous issues may need to be resolved before a loss or 

additional loss, or range of loss or additional range of loss, can be reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages or other relief, and consideration of novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question. 

For certain other legal proceedings and investigations, the Firm can estimate reasonably possible losses, additional losses, ranges of loss or ranges of additional loss in excess of amounts accrued but does not believe, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that such losses could have a material adverse effect on the Firm&#8217;s financial statements as a whole, other than the matter referred to in the following paragraph. 

Tax 

In matters styled Case number 15/3637 and Case number 15/4353 , the Dutch Tax Authority (&#8220;Dutch Authority&#8221;) is challenging in the Dutch courts the prior set-off by the Firm of approximately &#8364; 124 million (approximately $ 130 million) plus accrued interest of withholding tax credits against the Firm&#8217;s corporation tax liabilities for the tax years 2007 to 2012. The Dutch Authority alleges that the Firm was not entitled to receive the withholding tax credits on the basis, inter alia, that a Firm subsidiary did not hold legal title to certain securities subject to withholding tax on the relevant dates. The Dutch Authority has also alleged that the Firm failed to provide certain information to the Dutch Authority and to keep adequate books and records. On April 26, 2018, the District Court in Amsterdam issued a decision dismissing the Dutch Authority&#8217;s claims with respect to certain of the tax years in dispute. On May 12, 2020, the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam granted the Dutch Authority&#8217;s appeal in matters re-styled Case number 18/00318 and Case number 18/00319 . On June 22, 2020, the Firm filed an appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam before the Dutch High Court. On January 29, 2021, the Advocate General of the Dutch High Court issued an advisory opinion on the Firm&#8217;s appeal, which rejected the Firm&#8217;s principal grounds of appeal. On February 11, 2021, the Firm and the Dutch Authority each responded to this opinio n. On June 22, 2021, Dutch criminal authorities sought various documents in connection with an investigation of the Firm related to the civil claims asserted by the Dutch Authority concerning the accuracy of the Firm subsidiary&#8217;s tax returns and the maintenance of its books and records for 2007 to 2012.

The value of assets is determined based on the fair value of the liabilities and the interests owned by the Firm in such VIEs as the fair values for the liabilities and interests owned are more observable. 

2. Amounts include investment funds and CLOs.

Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities are presented in the previous tables after intercompany eliminations. Generally, most assets owned by consolidated VIEs cannot be removed unilaterally by the Firm and are not available to the Firm while the related liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are non-recourse to the Firm. However, in certain consolidated VIEs, the Firm either has the unilateral right to remove assets or provides additional recourse through derivatives such as total return swaps, guarantees or other forms of involvement. 

In general, the Firm&#8217;s exposure to loss in consolidated VIEs is limited to losses that would be absorbed on the VIE net assets recognized in its financial statements, net of amounts absorbed by third-party variable interest holders.

1. Amounts include transactions backed by residential mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans and other types of assets, including consumer or commercial assets, and may be in loan or security form. 

2. Other primarily includes exposures to commercial real estate property and investment funds. 

3. Where notional amounts are utilized in quantifying the maximum exposure related to derivatives, such amounts do not reflect changes in fair value recorded by the Firm. 

4. Additional VIE assets owned represents the carrying value of total exposure to non-consolidated VIEs for which the maximum exposure to loss is less than specific thresholds, primarily interests issued by securitization SPEs. The Firm&#8217;s maximum exposure to loss generally equals the fair value of the assets owned. These assets are primarily included in Trading assets and Investment securities and are measured at fair value (see Note 4). The Firm does not provide additional support in these transactions through contractual facilities, guarantees or similar derivatives. 

The majority of the VIEs included in the previous tables are sponsored by unrelated parties; examples of the Firm&#8217;s involvement with these VIEs include its secondary market-making activities and the securities held in its Investment securities portfolio (see Note 7). 

The Firm&#8217;s maximum exposure to loss is dependent on the nature of the Firm&#8217;s variable interest in the VIE and is limited to the notional amounts of certain liquidity facilities and other credit support, total return swaps and written put options, as well as the fair value of certain other derivatives and investments the Firm has made in the VIE. 

The Firm&#8217;s maximum exposure to loss in the previous tables does not include the offsetting benefit of hedges or any

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

reductions associated with the amount of collateral held as part of a transaction with the VIE or any party to the VIE directly against a specific exposure to loss. 

Liabilities issued by VIEs generally are non-recourse to the Firm.

The previous tables include transactions with SPEs in which the Firm, acting as principal, transferred financial assets with continuing involvement and received sales treatment. The transferred assets are carried at fair value prior to securitization, and any changes in fair value are recognized in the income statement. The Firm may act as underwriter of the beneficial interests issued by these securitization vehicles, for which Investment banking revenues are recognized. The Firm may retain interests in the securitized financial assets as one or more tranches of the securitization. These retained interests are generally carried at fair value in the balance sheet with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement. Fair value for these interests is measured using techniques that are consistent with the valuation techniques applied to the Firm&#8217;s major categories of assets and liabilities as described in Note 2 in the 2021 Form 10-K and Note 4 herein. Further, as permitted by applicable guidance, certain transfers of assets where the Firm&#8217;s only continuing involvement is a derivative are only reported in the following Assets Sold with Retained Exposure table.

15. Regulatory Requirements 

Regulatory Capital Framework and Requirements 

For a discussion of the Firm&#8217;s regulatory capital framework, see Note 17 to the financial statements in the 2021 Form 10-K. 

The Firm is required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage-based capital ratios under regulatory capital requirements. A summary of the calculations of regulatory capital and RWA follows. 

Risk-Based Regulatory Capital. Risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital (which includes Tier 2 capital), each as a percentage of RWA, and consist of regulatory minimum required ratios plus the Firm&#8217;s capital buffer requirement. Capital requirements require certain adjustments to, and deductions from, capital for purposes of determining these ratios. At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the differences between the actual and required ratios were lower under the Standardized Approach. 

CECL Deferral. As of December 31, 2021, the risk-based and leverage-based capital amounts and ratios, as well as RWA, adjusted average assets and supplementary leverage exposure were calculated excluding the effect of the adoption of CECL based on the Firm&#8217;s election to defer this effect over a five-year transition period that began on January 1, 2020. In 2022 t he deferral impacts began to phase in at 25% per year and will become fully phased-in beginning in 2025. 

Capital Buffer Requirements 

At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 

Standardized Advanced Capital buffers Capital conservation buffer &#8212; 2.5 % SCB 5.7 % N/A G-SIB capital surcharge 3.0 % 3.0 % CCyB 1 

0 % 0 % Capital buffer requirement 8.7 % 5.5 % 

1. The CCyB can be set up to 2.5 %, but is currently set by the Federal Reserve at zero . 

The capital buffer requirement represents the amount of Common Equity Tier 1 capital the Firm must maintain above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid restrictions on the Firm&#8217;s ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. The Firm&#8217;s Standardized Approach capital buffer requirement is equal to the sum of the SCB, G-SIB capital surcharge and CCyB, and the Advanced Approach capital buffer requirement is equal to the 2.5 % capital conservation buffer, G-SIB capital surcharge and CCyB.

1. Required ratios are inclusive of any buffers applicable as of the date presented. 

2. Adjusted average assets represents the denominator of the Tier 1 leverage ratio and is composed of the average daily balance of consolidated on-balance sheet assets for the quarters ending on the respective balance sheet dates, reduced by disallowed goodwill, intangible assets, investments in covered funds, defined benefit pension plan assets, after-tax gain on sale from assets sold into securitizations, investments in the Firm&#8217;s own capital instruments, certain defined tax assets and other capital deductions. 

3. Supplementary leverage exposure is the sum of Adjusted average assets used in the Tier 1 leverage ratio and other adjustments, primarily: (i) for derivatives, potential future exposure and the effective notional principal amount of sold credit protection, offset by qualifying purchased credit protection; (ii) the counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions; and (iii) the credit equivalent amount for off-balance sheet exposures. 

U.S. Bank Subsidiaries&#8217; Regulatory Capital and Capital Ratios 

The OCC establishes capital requirements for the Firm&#8217;s U.S. bank subsidiaries, which includes Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. (&#8220;MSBNA&#8221;) and Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association (&#8220;MSPBNA&#8221;) (collectively, &#8220;U.S. Bank Subsidiaries&#8221;), and evaluates their compliance with such capital requirements. Regulatory capital requirements for the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are calculated in a similar manner to the Firm&#8217;s regulatory capital requirements, although G-SIB capital surcharge and SCB requirements do not apply to the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. 

The OCC&#8217;s regulatory capital framework includes Prompt Corrective Action (&#8220;PCA&#8221;) standards, including &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; PCA standards that are based on specified regulatory capital ratio minimums. For the Firm to remain an FHC, its U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must remain well-capitalized in accordance with the OCC&#8217;s PCA standards. In addition, failure by the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements may result in certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries&#8217; and the Firm&#8217;s financial statements. 

At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, MSBNA and MSPBNA risk-based capital ratios are based on the Standardized Approach rules. As of December 31, 2021, the risk-based and leverage-based capital amounts and ratios were calculated excluding the effect of the adoption of CECL based 

on MSBNA&#8217;s and MSPBNA&#8217;s election to defer this effect over a five-year transition period that began on January 1, 2020. In 2022 t he deferral impacts began to phase in at 25% per year and will become fully phased-in beginning in 2025.

18. Income Taxes 

The Firm is routinely under examination by the IRS and other tax authorities in certain countries, such as Japan and the U.K., and in states and localities in which it has significant business operations, such as New York. 

The Firm believes that the resolution of these tax examinations will not have a material effect on the annual financial statements, although a resolution could have a material impact in the income statement and on the effective tax rate for any period in which such resolutions occur. 

It is reasonably possible that significant changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the next 12 months. At this time, however, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the expected change to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits and the impact on the Firm&#8217;s effective tax rate over the next 12 months.
