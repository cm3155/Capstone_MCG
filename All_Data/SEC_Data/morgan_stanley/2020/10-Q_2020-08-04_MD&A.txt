Executive Summary 

Overview of Financial Results 

Consolidated Results&#8212;Three Months Ended June 30, 2020 

&#8226; 

The Firm delivered an annualized ROE of 15.7% and an annualized ROTCE of 17.8% (see &#8220;Non-GAAP measures&#8221; herein). 

&#8226; 

Each of our businesses contributed meaningfully to this result, in particular the Institutional Securities business segment, which showed an increase in net revenues of 56% on strong client engagement. 

&#8226; 

Wealth Management delivered pre-tax income of $1.1 billion with a pre-tax margin of 24% despite a challenging market and rate environment. 

&#8226; 

Investment Management reported long-term net flows of $15.4 billion and AUM of $665 billion driving revenue growth of 6% . 

&#8226; 

Given economic conditions, we continued to increase our ACL on loans and lending commitments with a provision of $239 million . 

&#8226; 

Our capital and liquidity ratios remain strong. At June 30, 2020, our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 16.1% and our Liquidity Coverage ratio was 147% .

Non-interest Expenses 1 &#160; 

($ in millions) 

1. 

The percentages on the bars in the chart represent the contribution of compensation and benefits expenses and non-compensation expenses to the total. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Compensation and benefits expenses of $6,035 million in the current quarter increased 33% from $4,531 million in the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of increases in discretionary incentive compensation driven by higher revenues and higher expenses related to certain deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance. Compensation and benefits expenses of $10,318 million in the current year period increased 12% , from $9,182 million in the prior year period, primarily as a result of increases in discretionary incentive compensation driven by higher revenues, partially offset by lower expenses related to certain deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance. 

&#8226; 

Non-compensation expenses of $3,024 million in the current quarter and $6,082 million in the current year period increased 8% and 11% , respectively, from $2,810 million in the prior year quarter and $5,490 million in the prior year period, primarily reflecting higher volume-related expenses and increased information processing and communications expenses, partially offset by a decrease in marketing and business development expenses. In addition, the current year period reflects an increase in the provision for credit losses for lending commitments and off-balance sheet instruments. 

Income Taxes 

The current quarter and current year period included intermittent net discrete tax costs of $134 million and $103 million , respectively, principally associated with the remeasurement of reserves and interest related to a foreign tax matter. 

The prior year period included intermittent net discrete tax benefits of $101 million , primarily associated with remeasurement of reserves and related interest as a result of new information pertaining to the resolution of multi-jurisdiction tax examinations. For further information, see &#8220; Supplemental Financial Information&#8212;Income Tax Matters &#8221; herein.

&#160; 

1. 

The percentages on the bars in the charts represent the contribution of each business segment to the total of the applicable financial category and may not sum to 100% due to intersegment eliminations. See Note 19 to the financial statements for details of intersegment eliminations. 

&#8226; 

Institutional Securities net revenues of $7,977 million in the current quarter increased 56% from $5,113 million in the prior year quarter. Net revenues of $12,882 million in the current year period increased 25% from $10,309 million in the prior year period. Increases in the current quarter and current year period are primarily due to higher sales and trading and underwriting revenues, driven by increased client engagement, partially offset by increases in the provision for credit losses on loans held for investment. In the current year period, the increase in revenues was also partially offset by losses on loans and lending commitments held for sale. 

&#8226; 

Wealth Management net revenues of $4,680 million in the current quarter increased 6% from $4,408 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher gains from investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans, while Asset management revenues and net interest income were relatively unchanged. Net revenues of $8,717 million in the current year period were relatively unchanged from $8,797 million in the prior year period, as higher Asset management revenues were offset by the absence of gains 

&#160;

from investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans in the current year period and lower net interest income. 

&#8226; 

Investment Management net revenues of $886 million in the current quarter increased 6% from $839 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher Asset management revenues as a result of higher average AUM. Net revenues of $1,578 million in the current year period decreased 4% from $1,643 million in the prior year period primarily due to lower Investments revenues, driven by the reversal of accrued carried interest. 

Net Revenues by Region 1, 2 &#160;

The percentages on the bars in the charts represent the contribution of each region to the total. 

2. 

For a discussion of how the geographic breakdown of net revenues is determined, see Note 19 to the financial statements in the 2019 Form 10-K . 

Current quarter and current year period revenues in the Americas and Asia regions increased, primarily driven by the Institutional Securities business segment. With respect to the EMEA region, revenues increased primarily within Fixed Income sales and trading in the Institutional Securities business segment in the current quarter, while revenues were relatively unchanged in the current year period. 

June 2020 Form 10-Q 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Coronavirus Disease (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) Pandemic 

The COVID-19 pandemic and related government-imposed shelter-in-place restrictions have had, and will likely continue to have, a severe impact on global economic conditions and the environment in which we operate our businesses. We have begun implementing a return-to-workplace program, which is phased based on role, location and employee willingness and ability to return, and focused on the health and safety of all returning staff. Recognizing that our offices around the world face different local conditions, time lines for return may vary significantly, though we are currently planning for the return of additional employees to offices by the end of 2020. The Firm continues to be fully operational, with approximately 90% of global employees and 95% of employees in the Americas working from home as of June 30, 2020. 

Economic conditions have had mixed effects on our businesses. High levels of client trading activity, related to market volatility, have significantly increased revenues in the Sales and Trading businesses within the Institutional Securities business segment in both the current quarter and current year period. In addition, in the current quarter, certain of the negative impacts to our results in the first quarter have subsided given recoveries in public asset prices, tightening of credit spreads and an increase in underwriting activity. 

We have recognized provisions for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $239 million in the current quarter and $646 million in the current year period. In addition, the persistence of low interest rates will continue to negatively affect our net interest margin in the Wealth Management business segment. 

Though we are unable to estimate the extent of the impact, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related global economic crisis may have adverse impacts on our future operating results. In addition, levels of client trading activity may not remain elevated and investment banking advisory activity may be subdued. Refer to &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; herein and Forward Looking Statements in the 2019 Form 10-K. 

We continue to use the elements of our Enterprise Risk Management framework to manage the significant uncertainty in the present economic and market conditions. See &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8221; in the 2019 Form 10-K for further information. 

&#160;

Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information 

We prepare our financial statements using U.S. GAAP. From time to time, we may disclose certain &#8220;non-GAAP financial measures&#8221; in this document or in the course of our earnings releases, earnings and other conference calls, financial presentations, definitive proxy statement and otherwise. A &#8220;non-GAAP financial measure&#8221; excludes, or includes, amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We consider the non-GAAP financial measures we disclose to be useful to us, investors, analysts and other stakeholders by providing further transparency about, or an alternate means of assessing, our financial condition, operating results, prospective regulatory capital requirements or capital adequacy. 

These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally define it or present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the U.S. GAAP financial measure and the non-GAAP financial measure. 

The principal non-GAAP financial measures presented in this document are set forth in the following tables.

1. 

Adjusted amounts exclude net discrete tax provisions (benefits) that are intermittent and include those that are recurring. Provisions (benefits) related to conversion of employee share-based awards are expected to occur every year and, as such, are considered recurring discrete tax items. For further information on the net discrete tax provisions (benefits), see &#8220; Supplemental Financial Information&#8212;Income Tax Matters &#8221; herein. 

2. 

ROE and ROTCE represent annualized earnings applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders as a percentage of average common equity and average tangible common equity, respectively. When excluding intermittent net discrete tax provisions (benefits), both the numerator and average denominator are adjusted . 

3. 

The calculations used in determining our &#8220;ROE and ROTCE Targets&#8221; referred to in the following section are the Adjusted ROE and Adjusted ROTCE amounts shown in this table. 

4. 

Average common equity and average tangible common equity for each business segment is determined using our Required Capital framework (see " Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Requirements&#8212;Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework &#8221; herein). 

5. 

The sums of the segments' Average common equity and Average tangible common equity do not equal the Consolidated measures due to Parent equity. 

6. 

The calculation of ROE and ROTCE by segment uses annualized net income applicable to Morgan Stanley by segment less preferred dividends allocated to each segment as a percentage of average common equity and average tangible common equity, respectively, allocated to each segment.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Return on Tangible Common Equity Target 

In January 2020, we established an ROTCE Target of 13% to 15% to be achieved over the next two years. 

Our ROTCE Target is a forward-looking statement that was based on a normal market environment and may be materially affected by many factors, including, among other things: macroeconomic and market conditions; legislative and regulatory developments; industry trading and investment banking volumes; equity market levels; interest rate environment; outsized legal expenses or penalties; the ability to maintain a reduced level of expenses; and capital levels. 

With the COVID&#8211;19 pandemic, and the current global economic crisis that includes negative impacts from many of the aforementioned factors, it is uncertain that the ROTCE Target will be met within the originally stated time frame. See &#8220;Coronavirus Disease (COVID&#8211;19) Pandemic&#8221; herein and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for further information on market and economic conditions and their effects on our financial results. 

For further information on non-GAAP measures (ROTCE excluding intermittent net discrete tax items), see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein. For information on the impact of intermittent net discrete tax items, see &#8220;Supplemental Financial Information&#8212;Income Tax Matters&#8221; herein. 

Business Segments 

Substantially all of our operating revenues and operating expenses are directly attributable to our business segments. Certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures. 

For an overview of the components of our business segments, net revenues, compensation expense and income taxes, see &#8220; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Business Segments &#8221; in the 2019 Form 10-K .

Source: Refinitiv data as of July 1, 2020. Transaction volumes may not be indicative of net revenues in a given period. In addition, transaction volumes for prior periods may vary from amounts previously reported due to the subsequent withdrawal, change in value or change in timing of certain transactions. 

1. 

Includes transactions of $100 million or more. Based on full credit to each of the advisors in a transaction. 

2. 

Based on full credit for single book managers and equal credit for joint book managers. 

3. 

Includes Rule 144A issuances and registered public offerings of common stock, convertible securities and rights offerings. 

4. 

Includes Rule 144A and publicly registered issuances, non-convertible preferred stock, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and taxable municipal debt. Excludes leveraged loans and self-led issuances. 

Investment banking revenues of $2,051 million in the current quarter and $3,195 million in the current year period increased 39% and 22% from the comparable prior year periods, reflecting an increase in revenues in our underwriting businesses, partially offset by a decrease in revenues in our advisory business. 

&#8226; 

Advisory revenues decreased in the current year periods despite increases in completed volumes as there were fewer transactions contributing to revenues. 

&#8226; 

Equity underwriting revenues increased on higher overall volumes in the current quarter and current year period, with higher revenues primarily in secondary block share trades, convertible issuances, and follow-on offerings, partially offset by lower revenues in initial public offerings driven by lower volumes. 

&#8226; 

Fixed income underwriting revenues increased in the current quarter and in the current year period primarily due to higher revenues in both investment grade and non-investment grade bond issuances on higher volumes in both periods.

Sales and Trading Net Revenues in the Current Quarter 

Equity 

Equity sales and trading net revenues of $2,619 million in the current quarter increased 23% from the prior year quarter, reflecting increases in both our financing and execution services businesses. 

&#8226; 

Financing revenues increased from the prior year quarter, primarily due to the impact of higher realized spreads, partially offset by lower average client balances. Net interest revenues increased reflecting a reduction in funding costs. 

&#8226; 

Execution services revenues increased from the prior year quarter, reflecting improved inventory management results in derivatives products and cash equities as well as higher client 

&#160;

activity in cash equities, resulting in higher Commissions and fees. 

Fixed Income 

Fixed Income sales and trading net revenues of $3,033 million in the current quarter were 168% higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting increases across product lines. 

&#8226; 

Global macro products Trading revenues increased primarily due to higher client activity in both rates and foreign exchange products and wider bid-offer spreads from higher market volatility. 

&#8226; 

Credit products Trading revenues increased primarily due to higher client activity in corporate credit and securitized products and the effect of narrowing credit spreads. 

&#8226; 

Trading revenues from Commodities products and Other increased, primarily in power and gas, and oil products, as a result of increased client activity, driven by higher market volatility and structured transactions. 

Net interest revenues increased reflecting lower funding costs. 

Other 

&#8226; 

Other sales and trading losses of $99 million in the current quarter reflect losses on hedges associated with loans and lending commitments, lower yields on liquidity investments and losses on economic hedges related to certain Borrowings. Partially offsetting these decreases were gains from investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans. 

Sales and Trading Net Revenues in the Current Year Period 

Equity 

Equity sales and trading net revenues of $5,041 million in the current year period increased 22% from the prior year period, reflecting increases in both our financing and execution services businesses. 

&#8226; 

Financing revenues increased from the prior year period, primarily due to higher average client balances. Net interest revenues increased, reflecting a reduction in funding costs. 

&#8226; 

Execution services revenues increased from the prior year period, reflecting improved inventory management results in cash equities and higher client activity in cash equities and derivatives, partially offset by the impact of counterparty exposure losses.

&#160; 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Fixed Income 

Fixed Income sales and trading net revenues of $5,236 million in the current year period were 84% higher than the prior year period, primarily driven by global macro and credit products. 

&#8226; 

Global macro products Trading revenues increased primarily due to higher client activity in both rates and foreign exchange products and wider bid-offer spreads from continued high market volatility. 

&#8226; 

Credit products Trading revenues increased primarily due to higher client activity in corporate credit and securitized products from higher volumes and wider bid-offer spreads, partially offset by the effect of widening spreads on inventory in municipal, securitized and corporate credit products. 

&#8226; 

Trading revenues from Commodities products and Other increased as a result of improved inventory management and higher client activity in commodities due to higher market volatility, partially offset by lower client structuring activity within derivatives counterparty credit risk management. 

Net interest revenues increased reflecting lower funding costs. 

Other 

&#8226; 

Other sales and trading revenues of $141 million in the current year period increased from the prior year period reflecting gains on hedges associated with loans and lending commitments, partially offset by lower yields on liquidity investments and losses from investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans. 

Investments, Other Revenues, Non-interest Expenses, and Income Tax Items 

Investments 

&#8226; 

Net investments gains of $36 million in the current quarter and $11 million in the current year period decreased from the prior year periods. The prior year periods included gains associated with an investment's initial public offering and subsequent mark-to-market gains on remaining holdings. 

Other Revenues 

&#8226; 

Other revenues of $337 million in the current quarter increased compared to the prior year quarter primarily as a result of higher mark-to-market gains on loans and lending commitments held for sale, partially offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses on loans held for investment. Other net losses of $742 million in the current year period were primarily a result of mark-to-market losses on loans and lending commitments held for sale and an increase in the provision for credit losses on loans held for investment. 

&#160;

Non-interest Expenses 

Non-interest expenses of $4,984 million in the current quarter increased from the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting a 65% increase in Compensation and benefits expenses. Non-interest expenses of $8,939 million in the current year period increased from the prior year period, primarily reflecting a 32% increase in Compensation and benefits expenses and a 15% increase in Non-compensation expenses. 

&#8226; 

Compensation and benefits expenses increased in the current year periods primarily due to increases in discretionary incentive compensation, driven by higher revenues. Partially offsetting the increase in the current year period were lower expenses related to certain deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance. 

&#8226; 

Non-compensation expenses increased in the current year periods primarily due to higher volume-related expenses and information processing and communications expenses, and in the current year period, an increase in the provision for credit losses for lending commitments held for investment . P artially offsetting these increases were lower marketing and business development expenses in the current quarter and current year period. 

Income Tax Items 

The current quarter and current year period included intermittent net discrete tax costs of $125 million and $98 million , respectively. The prior year period included intermittent net discrete tax benefits of $101 million .

Net Revenues 

Transactional Revenues 

Transactional revenues of $1,075 million in the current quarter increased 48% from the prior year quarter primarily as a result of higher Trading revenues. Transactional revenues of $1,474 million in the current year period decreased 5% from the prior year period primarily as a result of lower Trading revenues, partially offset by higher Commissions and fees. 

&#8226; 

Investment banking revenues decreased in the current quarter primarily due to lower revenues from preferred equity and closed-end fund issuances. Investment banking revenues increased in the current year period primarily due to higher revenues from structured product issuances, partially offset by lower revenues from preferred equity issuances. 

&#8226; 

Trading revenues increased in the current quarter primarily due to higher gains from investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans, partially offset by lower fixed income revenue . Trading revenues decreased in the current year period primarily due to the absence of gains from investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans in the current year period, as well as lower fixed income revenue. 

&#8226; 

Commissions and fees increased in the current year periods primarily due to increased client activity in equities. 

Asset Management 

Asset management revenues of $2,507 million in the current quarter were relatively unchanged compared with the prior year quarter. Asset management revenues of $5,187 million in the 

&#160;

current year period increased 6% from the prior year period primarily due to higher fee-based asset levels in 2020 as a result of market appreciation and positive net flows, partially offset by lower average fee rates. 

See &#8220; Fee-Based Client Assets&#8212;Rollforwards &#8221; herein. 

&#160; 

Other 

Other revenues of $60 million in the current quarter and $122 million in the current year period decreased 50% and 39% , respectively, from the prior year periods primarily due to lower realized gains from the AFS securities portfolio and an increase in the provision for credit losses. 

Net Interest 

Net interest of $1,030 million in the current quarter was relatively unchanged compared with the prior year quarter as growth in Loans, favorable prepayment amortization related to mortgage-backed securities and increases in investment portfolio balances driven by higher brokerage sweep deposits, were offset by the net effect of lower interest rates. 

Net interest of $1,926 million in the current year period decreased 10% from the prior year period primarily due to the net effect of lower interest rates, partially offset by growth in Loans and increases in investment portfolio balances driven by higher brokerage sweep deposits. 

Non-interest Expenses 

Non-interest expenses of $3,538 million in the current quarter and $6,520 million in the current year period increased 12% and 2% , respectively, from the prior year periods, primarily as a result of higher Compensation and benefits expenses. 

&#8226; 

Compensation and benefits expenses increased in the current quarter, primarily due to higher expenses related to certain deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance. Compensation and benefits expenses increased in the current year period primarily due to an increase in the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives, driven by the mix of revenues and higher salaries, partially offset by lower expenses related to certain deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance. 

&#8226; 

Non-compensation expenses increased in the current year periods, reflecting E*TRADE acquisition-related expenses, and in the current year period incremental expenses related to Solium Capital, Inc. Partially offsetting these increases were lower marketing and business development expenses in the current quarter and current year period.

Net Revenues 

Investments 

Investments revenues of $231 million in the current quarter decreased 6% from the prior year quarter, primarily in real estate and infrastructure funds, driven by lower carried interest. 

Investments revenues of $294 million in the current year period decreased 33% from the prior year period primarily as a result of the reversal of accrued carried interest and investment losses in real estate, certain private equity and infrastructure funds, partially offset by investment gains in an Asia private equity fund, principally driven by gains from an underlying investment, which is subject to certain sales restrictions. 

Asset Management 

Asset management revenues of $684 million in the current quarter and $1,349 million in the current year period increased 12% and 10% from the prior year quarter and prior year period, respectively, primarily as a result of higher average AUM. 

See &#8220;Assets Under Management or Supervision&#8221; herein. 

Other 

Other losses of $47 million in the current quarter and $40 million in the current year period increased from the prior year quarter and prior year period, reflecting an impairment of an investment in a third-party asset manager. 

Non-interest Expenses 

Non-interest expenses of $670 million in the current quarter increased 5% from the prior year quarter primarily as a result of higher Non-compensation expenses. Non-interest expenses of $1,219 million in the current year period decreased 4% from the prior year period primarily as a result of lower Compensation and benefits expenses. 

&#8226; 

Compensation and benefits expenses decreased in the current quarter and current year period, primarily due to lower compensation associated with carried interest, partially offset in the current quarter by higher expenses related to certain deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance. 

&#8226; 

Non-compensation expenses in the current quarter increased from the prior year quarter and prior year period primarily as a result of higher fee sharing paid to intermediaries on higher average AUM.

1. 

The adjusted effective income tax rate is a non-GAAP measure that excludes net discrete tax provisions (benefits) that are intermittent and includes those that are recurring. For further information on non-GAAP measures, see &#8220; Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information &#8221; herein. 

2. 

Provisions (benefits) related to conversion of employee share-based awards are expected to occur every year and, as such, are considered recurring discrete tax items. 

3. 

Includes all tax provisions (benefits) that have been determined to be discrete, other than Recurring items as defined above. 

The current quarter and current year period included intermittent net discrete tax costs principally associated with the remeasurement of reserves and interest related to a foreign tax matter. The prior year period included intermittent net discrete tax benefits primarily associated with remeasurement of reserves and related interest as a result of new information pertaining to the resolution of multi-jurisdiction tax examinations. See Note 18 to the financial statements for further information.

Other Matters 

Planned Acquisition of E*TRADE 

On February 20, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we will acquire E*TRADE Financial Corporation (&#8220;E*TRADE&#8221;) in an all-stock transaction. In the first quarter of 2020, we filed our application with the Federal Reserve and in early April the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust waiting period expired. On July 17, 2020, E*TRADE shareholders approved the acquisition. While it remains subject to other customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, we continue to expect the acquisition to close in the fourth quarter of 2020. 

Accounting Development Updates 

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued certain accounting updates, which we have either determined are not applicable or are not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements. 

&#160; 

June 2020 Form 10-Q 

&#160; 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 to the financial statements). We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the financial statements in the 2019 Form 10-K and Note 2 to the financial statements), the fair value, goodwill and intangible assets, legal and regulatory contingencies and income taxes policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity . For a further discussion about our critical accounting policies, see &#8220; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Critical Accounting Policies &#8221; in the 2019 Form 10-K . 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Senior management, with oversight by the Asset/Liability Management Committee and the Board of Directors (&#8220;Board&#8221;), establishes and maintains our liquidity and capital policies. Through various risk and control committees, senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity, interest rate and currency sensitivity of our asset and liability position. Our Treasury department, Firm Risk Committee, Asset/Liability Management Committee, and other committees and control groups assist in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our balance sheet, liquidity and capital structure. Liquidity and capital matters are reported regularly to the Board and the Risk Committee of the Board. 

Balance Sheet 

We monitor and evaluate the composition and size of our balance sheet on a regular basis. Our balance sheet management process includes quarterly planning, business-specific thresholds, monitoring of business-specific usage versus key performance metrics and new business impact assessments. 

We establish balance sheet thresholds at the consolidated and business segment levels. We monitor balance sheet utilization and review variances resulting from business activity and market fluctuations. On a regular basis, we review current performance versus established thresholds and assess the need to re-allocate our balance sheet based on business unit needs. We also monitor key metrics, including asset and liability size and capital usage.

Amounts include loans held for investment, net of allowance, and loans held for sale but exclude loans at fair value, which are included in Trading assets in the balance sheets (see Note 9 to the financial statements). 

2. 

Other assets primarily includes Goodwill and Intangible assets, premises, equipment and software, ROU assets related to leases, other investments, and deferred tax assets. 

A substantial portion of total assets consists of liquid marketable securities and short-term receivables arising principally from sales and trading activities in the Institutional Securities business segment. Total assets increased to $975 billion at June 30, 2020 from $895 billion at December 31, 2019 . 

Wealth Management assets increased, primarily in the investment portfolio comprising Cash and cash equivalents, Investment securities and Securities purchased under agreements to resell, as a result of significantly higher deposits in this segment. Loans continued to grow. 

Institutional Securities&#8217; assets were also higher, reflecting increases within Cash and cash equivalents and Customer and other receivables, primarily due to higher margin related to derivatives and loan growth in support of client needs. 

Liquidity Risk Management Framework 

The core components of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework are the Required Liquidity Framework, Liquidity 

June 2020 Form 10-Q 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Stress Tests and Liquidity Resources, which support our target liquidity profile. For a further discussion about the Firm&#8217;s Required Liquidity Framework and Liquidity Stress Tests, see &#8220; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Liquidity Risk Management Framework &#8221; in the 2019 Form 10-K . 

At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , we maintained sufficient liquidity to meet current and contingent funding obligations as modeled in our Liquidity Stress Tests. 

Liquidity Resources 

We maintain sufficient liquidity resources, which consist of HQLA and cash deposits with banks (&#8220;Liquidity Resources&#8221;) to cover daily funding needs and to meet strategic liquidity targets sized by the Required Liquidity Framework and Liquidity Stress Tests. The total amount of Liquidity Resources is actively managed by us considering the following components: unsecured debt maturity profile; balance sheet size and composition; funding needs in a stressed environment, inclusive of contingent cash outflows; legal entity, regional and segment liquidity requirements; regulatory requirements; and collateral requirements. 

The amount of Liquidity Resources we hold is based on our risk tolerance and is subject to change depending on market and Firm-specific events. The Liquidity Resources are primarily held within the Parent Company and its major operating subsidiaries. The Total HQLA values in the tables immediately following are different from Eligible HQLA which, in accordance with the LCR rule, also takes into account certain regulatory weightings and other operational considerations.

In the first quarter of 2020, we changed our internal measure of liquidity from the Global Liquidity Reserve to Liquidity Resources, which is more closely aligned with the regulatory definition of HQLA. Prior periods have been recast to conform to the current presentation. 

Liquidity Resources may fluctuate from period to period based on the overall size and composition of our balance sheet, the maturity profile of our unsecured debt and estimates of funding needs in a stressed environment, among other factors. Liquidity Resources increased in the current year period primarily due to an increase in deposits. 

Regulatory Liquidity Framework 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio 

We and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are subject to LCR requirements, including a requirement to calculate each entity&#8217;s LCR on each business day. The requirements are designed to ensure that banking organizations have sufficient Eligible HQLA to cover net cash outflows arising from significant stress over 30 calendar days, thus promoting the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banking organizations. In determining Eligible HQLA for LCR purposes, weightings (or asset haircuts) are applied to HQLA and certain HQLA held in subsidiaries are excluded. 

As of June 30, 2020 , we and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are compliant with the minimum required LCR of 100%. For further information on regulatory developments that have impacted our LCR, see &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Requirements&#8212;Regulatory Developments&#8221; herein.

Under the LCR rule, Eligible HQLA is calculated using weightings and excluding certain HQLA held in subsidiaries. 

2. 

Primarily includes U.S. Treasuries, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, sovereign bonds and investment grade corporate bonds. 

The increase in the LCR in the current quarter is due to increased Eligible HQLA consistent with higher liquidity levels. 

Net Stable Funding Ratio 

The NSFR requires banking organizations to maintain sufficiently stable sources of funding over a one-year horizon. In 2016, the U.S. banking agencies issued a proposal to implement the NSFR in the U.S.; however, a final rule has not yet been issued. For an additional discussion of the NSFR, see &#8220; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Liquidity Framework&#8212;Net Stable Funding Ratio &#8221; in the 2019 Form 10-K . 

Funding Management 

We manage our funding in a manner that reduces the risk of disruption to our operations. We pursue a strategy of diversification of secured and unsecured funding sources (by product, investor and region) and attempt to ensure that the tenor of our liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed. 

We fund our balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources. These sources include our equity capital, borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities lending, deposits, letters of credit and lines of credit. We have active financing programs for both standard and structured products targeting global investors and currencies.

In addition to the collateralized financing transactions shown in the previous table, we engage in financing transactions collateralized by customer-owned securities, which are segregated in accordance with regulatory requirements. Receivables under these financing transactions, primarily margin loans, are included in Customer and other receivables in the balance sheets, and payables under these financing transactions, primarily to prime brokerage customers, are included in Customer and other payables in the balance sheets. Our risk exposure on these transactions is mitigated by collateral maintenance policies. We also hold related liquidity reserves.

Original maturity in the table is generally based on contractual final maturity. For borrowings with put options, remaining maturity represents the earliest put date. 

2. 

Includes only borrowings with original maturities greater than one year. 

Borrowings of $205 billion as of June 30, 2020 increased modestly when compared with $193 billion at December 31, 2019 . 

We believe that accessing debt investors through multiple distribution channels helps provide consistent access to the unsecured markets. In addition, the issuance of borrowings with original maturities greater than one year allows us to reduce reliance on short-term credit sensitive instruments. Borrowings with original maturities greater than one year are generally managed to achieve staggered maturities, thereby mitigating refinancing risk, and to maximize investor diversification through sales to global institutional and retail clients across regions, currencies and product types. 

The availability and cost of financing to us can vary depending on market conditions, the volume of certain trading and lending activities, our credit ratings and the overall availability of credit. 

&#160;

We also engage in, and may continue to engage in, repurchases of our borrowings in the ordinary course of business. 

For further information on Borrowings, see Note 12 to the financial statements. 

Credit Ratings 

We rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our daily operations. The cost and availability of financing generally are impacted by our credit ratings, among other things. In addition, our credit ratings can have an impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer-term counterparty performance is a key consideration, such as certain OTC derivative transactions. When determining credit ratings, rating agencies consider both company-specific and industry-wide factors. These include regulatory or legislative changes, the macroeconomic environment and perceived levels of support, among other things. See also &#8220; Risk Factors&#8212; Liquidity Risk &#8221; in the 2019 Form 10-K.

June 2020 Form 10-Q 

&#160; 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Incremental Collateral or Terminating Payments 

In connection with certain OTC derivatives and certain other agreements where we are a liquidity provider to certain financing vehicles associated with the Institutional Securities business segment, we may be required to provide additional collateral, immediately settle any outstanding liability balances with certain counterparties or pledge additional collateral to certain clearing organizations in the event of a future credit rating downgrade irrespective of whether we are in a net asset or net liability position. See Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information on OTC derivatives that contain such contingent features. 

While certain aspects of a credit rating downgrade are quantifiable pursuant to contractual provisions, the impact it would have on our business and results of operations in future periods is inherently uncertain and would depend on a number of interrelated factors, including, among other things, the magnitude of the downgrade, the rating relative to peers, the rating assigned by the relevant agency pre-downgrade, individual client behavior and future mitigating actions we might take. The liquidity impact of additional collateral requirements is included in our Liquidity Stress Tests. 

Capital Management 

We view capital as an important source of financial strength and actively manage our consolidated capital position based upon, among other things, business opportunities, risks, capital availability and rates of return together with internal capital policies, regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines. In the future, we may expand or contract our capital base to address the changing needs of our businesses.

We utilize SPEs primarily in connection with securitization activities. For information on our securitization activities, see Note 14 to the financial statements in the 2019 Form 10-K. 

For information on our commitments, obligations under certain guarantee arrangements and indemnities, see Note 13 to the financial statements.

Regulatory Requirements 

Regulatory Capital Framework 

We are an FHC under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (&#8220;BHC Act&#8221;), and are subject to the regulation and oversight of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements for us, including &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; standards, and evaluates our compliance with such capital requirements. Regulatory capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve are largely based on the Basel III capital standards established by the Basel Committee and also implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;). The OCC establishes similar capital requirements and standards for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. For us to remain an FHC, we must remain well-capitalized in accordance with standards established by the Federal Reserve and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must remain well-capitalized in accordance with standards established by the OCC. For additional information on regulatory capital requirements for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, see Note 15 to the financial statements. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 

We are required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage-based capital and TLAC ratios. For more information, see &#8220; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Capital Requirements &#8221; in the 2019 Form 10-K . For additional information on TLAC, see &#8220;Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements&#8221; herein. 

Risk-Based Regulatory Capital. Minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital (which includes Tier 2 capital). Capital standards require certain adjustments to, and deductions from, capital for purposes of determining these ratios. 

In addition to the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements, we are subject to the following Common Equity Tier 1 buffers: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

A greater than 2.5% capital conservation buffer; 

&#8226; 

The G-SIB capital surcharge, currently at 3%; and 

&#8226; 

Up to a 2.5% CCyB, currently set by U.S. banking agencies at zero. 

For a further discussion of the G-SIB capital surcharge, see &#8220; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Requirements&#8212;G-SIB Capital Surcharge &#8221; in the 2019 Form 10-K . 

&#160;

Our risk-based capital ratios for purposes of determining regulatory compliance are the lower of the capital ratios computed under (i) the standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market risk RWA (&#8220;Standardized Approach&#8221;) or (ii) the applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk RWA (&#8220;Advanced Approach&#8221;). The credit risk RWA calculations between the two approaches differ in that the Standardized Approach requires calculation of RWA using prescribed risk weights, whereas the Advanced Approach utilizes models to calculate exposure amounts and risk weights. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , our ratios for determining regulatory compliance are based on the Advanced Approach and the Standardized Approach rules, respectively. 

Leverage-Based Regulatory Capital . Minimum leverage-based capital requirements include a Tier 1 leverage ratio and an SLR. We are required to maintain an SLR of 5%, inclusive of an enhanced SLR capital buffer of at least 2%. 

As of June 30, 2020 , our risk-based and leverage-based capital amounts and ratios, as well as RWA, adjusted average assets and supplementary leverage exposure are calculated excluding the effect of the adoption of CECL based on our election to defer this effect over a five-year transition period. For further information, see &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Requirements&#8212;Regulatory Developments&#8221; herein.

1. 

Required ratios are inclusive of any buffers applicable as of the date presented. Failure to maintain the buffers would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. 

2. 

Adjusted average assets represents the denominator of the Tier 1 leverage ratio and is composed of the average daily balance of consolidated on-balance sheet assets for the quarters ending on the respective balance sheet dates, reduced by disallowed goodwill, intangible assets, investments in covered funds, defined benefit pension plan assets, after-tax gain on sale from assets sold into securitizations, investments in our own capital instruments, certain deferred tax assets and other capital deductions. 

3. 

Supplementary leverage exposure is the sum of Adjusted average assets used in the Tier 1 leverage ratio and other adjustments, primarily: (i) for derivatives, potential future exposure and the effective notional principal amount of sold credit protection offset by qualifying purchased credit protection; (ii) the counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions; and (iii) the credit equivalent amount for off-balance sheet exposures. 

4. 

Based on a Federal Reserve interim final rule in effect until March 31, 2021, our SLR and Supplementary leverage exposure as of June 30, 2020 reflect the exclusion of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. As of June 30, 2020, the impact of the interim final rule on our SLR was an improvement of 92 bps.

Regulatory VaR&#8212;VaR for regulatory capital requirements 

1. 

Amounts reflect assets not in a defined category, non-material portfolios of exposures and unsettled transactions, as applicable. 

Credit risk RWA increased in the current year period under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches primarily from an increase in Derivatives exposure driven by market volatility, and an increase in Investment Securities mainly due to increased exposures to U.S. government and agency securities. RWA under the Standardized Approach also increased due to Lending activities within the Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments, partially offset by a decrease in Securities financing transactions. Under the Advanced Approach, the increased exposure in Derivatives and widening credit spreads also led to an increase in RWA related to CVA. 

Market risk RWA increased in the current year period under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches primarily due to an increase in Regulatory VaR mainly as a result of higher market volatility, and an increase in Stressed VaR driven by increased equity and interest rate risk. 

&#160;

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements 

The Federal Reserve has established external TLAC, long-term debt (&#8220;LTD&#8221;) and clean holding company requirements for top-tier BHCs of U.S. G-SIBs (&#8220;covered BHCs&#8221;), including the Parent Company. These requirements are designed to ensure that covered BHCs will have enough loss-absorbing resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized through the conversion of eligible LTD to equity or otherwise by imposing losses on eligible LTD or other forms of TLAC where an SPOE resolution strategy is used .

Required ratios are inclusive of applicable buffers.The final rule imposes TLAC buffer requirements on top of both the risk-based and leverage exposure-based external TLAC minimum requirements. The risk-based TLAC buffer is equal to the sum of 2.5%, the covered BHC's Method 1 G-SIB surcharge and the CCyB, if any, as a percentage of total RWA. The leverage exposure-based TLAC buffer is equal to 2% of the covered BHC's total leverage exposure. Failure to maintain the buffers would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. 

2. 

External TLAC consists of Common Equity Tier 1 capital and Additional Tier 1 capital (each excluding any noncontrolling minority interests), as well as eligible LTD. 

3. 

Consists of TLAC-eligible LTD reduced by 50% for amounts of unpaid principal due to be paid in more than one year but less than two years from each respective balance sheet date. 

We are in compliance with all TLAC requirements as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . For a further discussion of TLAC and related requirements, see &#8220; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Requirements&#8212;Regulatory Capital Requirements &#8212;Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements&#8221; in the 2019 Form 10-K . 

Capital Plans and Stress Tests 

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve has adopted capital planning and stress test requirements for large BHCs, which form part of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s annual CCAR framework. 

We submitted our 2020 Capital Plan (&#8220;Capital Plan&#8221;) and company-run stress test results to the Federal Reserve on April 

&#160; 

June 2020 Form 10-Q 

&#160; 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

6, 2020 . On June 25, 2020, the Federal Reserve published summary results of its supervisory stress tests of each large BHC. On June 29, 2020, we disclosed a summary of the results of our company-run stress tests on our Investor Relations website. Also on June 29, 2020, we announced that we will be subject to a stress capital buffer (&#8220;SCB&#8221;) of 5.9% beginning October 1, 2020. Together with other features of the regulatory capital framework, this SCB results in an aggregate Standardized Approach Common Equity Tier 1 required ratio of 13.4%. Generally, our SCB will be updated annually based on the results of the supervisory stress test. See &#8220; Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Requirements&#8212;Regulatory Developments&#8212;Stress Capital Buffer Final Rule &#8221; herein for additional information on the SCB. 

On June 25, 2020, the Federal Reserve also announced that it will be providing updated scenarios, based on which each large BHC will be required to update and resubmit its capital plan within 45 days after the Federal Reserve makes the updated scenarios available. The Federal Reserve stated that it took this action based on its determination that changes in financial markets or the macro-economic outlook, since submission of each BHC&#8217;s original capital plan in April 2020, could have a material effect on each BHC&#8217;s risk profile and financial condition. 

Additionally, on June 25, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that, in the third quarter of 2020, all large BHCs would be subject to capital action restrictions. Except as noted below, these restrictions generally prohibit large BHCs from making any capital distribution (excluding any capital distribution arising from the issuance of a capital instrument eligible for inclusion in the numerator of a regulatory capital ratio), unless otherwise approved by the Federal Reserve. Large BHCs are, however, authorized to make share repurchases relating to issuances of common stock related to employee stock ownership plans; provided that a BHC does not increase the amount of its common stock dividends, to pay common stock dividends that do not exceed an amount equal to the average of the BHC&#8217;s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters, unless otherwise specified by the Federal Reserve; and to make scheduled payments on additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments. The Federal Reserve stated that it may extend these provisions on a quarter-by-quarter basis after September 30, 2020. For a further discussion of our capital plans, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Balance Sheet&#8212;Capital Management&#8221; herein and in the 2019 Form 10-K . 

Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework 

Our required capital (&#8220;Required Capital&#8221;) estimation is based on the Required Capital framework, an internal capital adequacy measure. Common equity attribution to the business segments is based on capital usage calculated under the Required Capital 

&#160;

framework, as well as each business segment&#8217;s relative contribution to our total Required Capital. 

The Required Capital framework is a risk-based and leverage use-of-capital measure, which is compared with our regulatory capital to ensure that we maintain an amount of going concern capital after absorbing potential losses from stress events, where applicable, at a point in time. The amount of capital allocated to the business segments is generally set at the beginning of each year and remains fixed throughout the year until the next annual reset unless a significant business change occurs ( e.g. , acquisition or disposition). We define the difference between our total average common equity and the sum of the average common equity amounts allocated to our business segments as Parent common equity. We generally hold Parent common equity for prospective regulatory requirements, organic growth, acquisitions and other capital needs. 

We are currently evaluating potential updates to our Required Capital framework to take into account changes to our risk-based capital requirements resulting from the SCB and we will continue to evaluate the framework with respect to the impact of other future regulatory requirements, as appropriate.

The attribution of average common equity to the business segments is a non-GAAP financial measure. See &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein. 

Resolution and Recovery Planning 

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to periodically submit to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a resolution plan that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of our material financial distress or failure. Our next resolution plan submission will be a targeted resolution plan in July 2021. 

As described in our most recent resolution plan, which was submitted on June 28, 2019, our preferred resolution strategy is an SPOE strategy. In line with our SPOE strategy, the Parent Company has transferred, and has agreed to transfer on an ongoing basis, certain assets to its wholly owned, direct subsidiary Morgan Stanley Holdings LLC (the &#8220;Funding IHC&#8221;). In addition, the Parent Company has entered into an amended and restated support agreement with its material entities (including the Funding IHC) and certain other subsidiaries. In the event of a resolution scenario, the Parent Company would be obligated to contribute all of its Contributable Assets to our material entities and/or the Funding IHC. The Funding IHC 

June 2020 Form 10-Q 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

would be obligated to provide capital and liquidity, as applicable, to our material entities. The combined implication of the SPOE resolution strategy and the requirement to maintain certain levels of TLAC is that losses in resolution would be imposed on the holders of eligible long-term debt and other forms of eligible TLAC issued by the Parent Company before any losses are imposed on the holders of the debt securities of our operating subsidiaries or before putting U.S. taxpayers at risk. 

For more information about resolution and recovery planning requirements and our activities in these areas, including the implications of such activities in a resolution scenario, see &#8220; Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation&#8212;Financial Holding Company&#8212;Resolution and Recovery Planning ,&#8221; &#8220; Risk Factors&#8212;Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk &#8221; and &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Requirements&#8212;Resolution and Recovery Planning&#8221; in the 2019 Form 10-K . 

Regulatory Developments 

CFTC Final Rule on Capital Requirements for Swap Dealers 

The CFTC has finalized rules establishing capital requirements for CFTC-registered swap dealers not subject to regulation by a prudential regulator. Compliance with these rules, which will apply to a number of our subsidiaries that are CFTC-registered swap dealers, is required by October 6, 2021. 

Final Rule to Amend the Covered Fund Provisions of the Volcker Rule 

The Federal financial regulatory agencies responsible for the Volcker Rule&#8217;s implementing regulations have finalized a rule that revises the prohibition on certain investments by banking entities with defined covered funds. The final rule adds certain new exclusions from the definition of covered fund, while streamlining others. It also simplifies certain restrictions on inter-affiliate relationships with covered funds. The final rule is effective beginning October 1, 2020. 

Stress Capital Buffer Final Rule 

The Federal Reserve has adopted a final rule to integrate its annual capital planning and stress testing requirements with existing applicable regulatory capital requirements. The final rule, which applies to certain BHCs, introduces an SCB and related changes to the capital planning and stress testing processes. 

The SCB applies only with respect to Standardized Approach risk-based capital requirements and replaces the existing Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer, which is 2.5%. The SCB is the greater of (i) the maximum decline in our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the severely adverse 

&#160;

scenario over the supervisory stress test measurement period plus the sum of the four quarters of planned common stock dividends divided by the projected RWAs from the quarter in which the Firm&#8217;s projected Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio reaches its minimum in the supervisory stress test and (ii) 2.5%. Risk-based regulatory capital requirements under the Standardized Approach will include the SCB, as summarized above, as well as our Common Equity Tier 1 GSIB capital surcharge and any applicable Common Equity Tier 1 CCyB. 

The final rule makes related changes to capital planning and stress testing processes for BHCs subject to the SCB. In particular, the supervisory stress test will assume that BHCs generally maintain a constant level of assets and RWAs throughout the projection period. In addition, the supervisory stress test will no longer assume that BHCs make all planned capital distributions, although the SCB will incorporate the dollar amount of four quarters of planned common stock dividends, as summarized above. 

The final rule does not change regulatory capital requirements under the Advanced Approach, the Tier 1 leverage ratio or the SLR. 

Regulatory Developments in Response to COVID-19 

In the United States, the Federal Reserve, the other U.S. state and federal financial regulatory agencies and Congress have taken actions to mitigate disruptions to economic activity and financial stability resulting from COVID-19. 

Federal Reserve and other U.S. Banking Agency Actions 

The Federal Reserve has established, or has taken steps to establish, a range of facilities and programs to support the U.S. economy and U.S. marketplace participants in response to economic disruptions associated with COVID-19. Through these facilities and programs, the Federal Reserve has taken steps to directly or indirectly purchase assets or debt instruments from, or make loans to, U.S. companies, financial institutions, municipalities and other market participants. In the current year period, we have participated as principal, as well as on behalf of clients, in certain of these facilities and programs and we may participate in other of these facilities and programs in the future. 

In addition, the Federal Reserve has taken a range of other actions to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. For example, the Federal Reserve has set the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 0.25% and announced that it would increase its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, begin purchasing agency commercial mortgage-backed securities, and establish a facility to purchase corporate debt securities and shares of exchange-traded funds holding such securities. The Federal Reserve has also encouraged depository institutions to borrow from the discount window and has lowered the primary credit rate for such borrowings by 150 basis points to 0.25% while 

&#160; 

June 2020 Form 10-Q 

&#160; 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

extending the term of such loans up to 90 days. In addition, reserve requirements have been reduced to zero. 

Acting in concert with the other U.S. banking agencies, the Federal Reserve has also issued statements encouraging banking organizations to use their capital and liquidity buffers as they lend to households and businesses affected by COVID-19. 

Further, the Federal Reserve along with the other U.S. banking agencies, issued guidance stating that granting certain concessions to borrowers that are current on existing loans, either individually or as part of a program for creditworthy borrowers who are experiencing short-term financial or operational problems as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, generally would not be considered TDRs under applicable U.S. GAAP. This guidance also clarifies that efforts to work with borrowers of one-to-four family residential mortgages impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and meeting certain criteria will not result in such loans being deemed restructured or modified for purposes of regulatory capital requirements. 

The Federal Reserve and other U.S. banking agencies have also issued a series of rulemakings in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including to facilitate banking organizations&#8217; use of their capital buffers: 

&#8226; 

Supplementary Leverage Ratio Interim Final Rules. The Federal Reserve has adopted an interim final rule that excludes, on a temporary basis, U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from our supplementary leverage exposure from April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021. 

A similar interim final rule issued by the OCC along with the other U.S. banking agencies provides national banks, including MSBNA and MSPBNA, an optional election to apply similar relief. If elected, a national bank must receive prior approval from the OCC before making any capital distributions while the exclusion is in effect. As of June 30, 2020, neither MSBNA nor MSPBNA made this optional election. 

&#8226; 

Revisions to Definition of Eligible Retained Income. The U.S. banking agencies have adopted an interim final rule amending the definition of eligible retained income in their respective capital rules. As amended, eligible retained income is defined by the U.S. banking agencies as the greater of (i) net income for the four preceding calendar quarters, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income, and (ii) the average of net income over the preceding four quarters. This definition applies with respect to any payout restrictions applicable in the event of a breach of any regulatory capital buffers, including any applicable CCyB, G-SIB capital surcharge, capital conservation buffer, the enhanced SLR and, once effective, SCB, which replaces the capital conservation buffer under the Standardized Approach. The interim final rule became effective March 20, 2020. 

&#160;

Separately, the Federal Reserve has adopted an interim final rule amending the definition of eligible retained income under its TLAC rule to be consistent with the revised definition of eligible retained income in the regulatory capital framework, as summarized above. The interim final rule became effective March 26, 2020. 

&#8226; 

Regulatory Capital and Stress Testing Developments Related to Implementation of CECL. The U.S. banking agencies have adopted an interim final rule altering, for purposes of the regulatory capital and TLAC requirements, the required adoption time period for CECL. We have elected to apply a transition method provided by the rule, under which the effects of CECL on our regulatory capital and TLAC requirements are deferred for two years, followed by a three-year phase-in of the aggregate capital effects of the two-year deferral. 

Non-U.S. Central Bank Actions 

In addition to actions taken by the Federal Reserve, many non-U.S. central banks have announced similar facilities and programs in response to the economic and market disruptions associated with COVID-19. Firm subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. markets may participate, or perform customer facilitation roles, in such non-U.S. facilities or programs. 

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the &#8220;CARES Act&#8221;) 

The CARES Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020. Pursuant to the CARES Act, the U.S. Treasury has the authority to provide loans, guarantees and other investments in support of eligible businesses, states and municipalities affected by the economic effects of COVID-19. Some of these funds may also be used to support the several Federal Reserve programs and facilities described in &#8220;Federal Reserve Actions&#8221; previously or additional programs or facilities that are established by the Federal Reserve under its Section 13(3) authority and meet certain criteria. Among other provisions, the CARES Act also includes funding for the Small Business Administration to expand lending, relief from certain U.S. GAAP requirements to allow COVID-19-related loan modifications to not be categorized as TDRs and a range of incentives to encourage deferment, forbearance or modification of consumer credit and mortgage contracts. 

The CARES Act also includes several measures that temporarily adjust existing laws or regulations. These include providing the FDIC with additional authority to guarantee the deposits of solvent insured depository institutions held in non-interest-bearing business transaction accounts to a maximum amount specified by the FDIC, reinstating the FDIC&#8217;s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Authority to guarantee debt obligations of solvent insured depository institutions or depository institution holding companies, temporarily allowing the U.S. Treasury to fully guarantee money market mutual funds and granting

&#160; 

&#160; 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

additional authority to the OCC to provide certain exemptions to the lending limits imposed on national banks. 

Other Matters 

U.K. Withdrawal from the E.U. 

On January 31, 2020, the U.K. withdrew from the E.U. under the terms of a withdrawal agreement between the U.K. and the E.U. The withdrawal agreement provides for a transition period to the end of December 2020, during which time the U.K. will continue to apply E.U. law as if it were a member state, and U.K. firms&#8217; rights to provide financial services in E.U. member states will continue. Access to the E.U. market after the transition period remains subject to negotiation. 

We have prepared the structure of our European operations for a range of potential outcomes, including for the possibility that U.K. financial firms&#8217; access to E.U. markets after the transition period is limited, and we expect to be able to continue to serve our clients and customers under each of these potential outcomes. 

For more information on the U.K.&#8217;s withdrawal from the E.U., our related preparations and the potential impact on our operations, see &#8220; Risk Factors&#8212; International Risk &#8221; in the 2019 Form 10-K . For further information regarding our exposure to the U.K., see also &#8220; Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Country and Other Risks ." 

Planned Replacement of London Interbank Offered Rate and Replacement or Reform of Other Interest Rates 

Central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, have commissioned committees and working groups of market participants and official sector representatives to replace LIBOR and replace or reform other interest rate benchmarks (collectively, the &#8220;IBORs&#8221;). Accordingly, we have established and are undertaking a Firmwide IBOR transition plan to promote the transition to alternative reference rates, which takes into account the considerable uncertainty regarding the availability of LIBOR beyond 2021. 

For a further discussion of the expected replacement of the IBORs and/or reform of interest rate benchmarks, and the related risks and our transition plan, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Requirements&#8212;Other Matters&#8221; and &#8220; Risk Factors&#8212;Risk Management ,&#8221; respectively, in the 2019 Form 10-K .

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk 

Management believes effective risk management is vital to the success of our business activities. For a discussion of our Enterprise Risk Management framework and risk management functions, see &#8220; Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Risk Management &#8221; in the 2019 Form 10-K . 

Market Risk 

Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity, will result in losses for a position or portfolio. Generally, we incur market risk as a result of trading, investing and client facilitation activities, principally within the Institutional Securities business segment where the substantial majority of our VaR for market risk exposures is generated. In addition, we incur non-trading market risk, principally within the Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments. The Wealth Management business segment primarily incurs non-trading market risk from lending and deposit-taking activities. The Investment Management business segment primarily incurs non-trading market risk from capital investments in alternative and other funds. For a further discussion of market risk, see &#8220; Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Market Risk &#8221; in the 2019 Form 10-K . 

Trading Risks 

We are exposed to a wide range of risks related to interest rates and credit spreads, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices, and the associated implied volatilities and spreads, related to the global markets in which we conduct our trading activities. 

The statistical technique known as VaR is one of the tools we use to measure, monitor and review the market risk exposures of our trading portfolios. 

For information regarding our primary risk exposures and market risk management, VaR methodology, assumptions and limitations, see &#8220; Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Market Risk&#8212;Trading Risks &#8221; in the 2019 Form 10-K .

1. 

Diversification benefit equals the difference between the total Management VaR and the sum of the component VaRs. This benefit arises because the simulated one-day losses for each of the components occur on different days; similar diversification benefits also are taken into account within each component. 

2. 

The high and low VaR values for the total Management VaR and each of the component VaRs might have occurred on different days during the quarter, and therefore, the diversification benefit is not an applicable measure. 

Average and period-end total Management VaR and Management VaR for the Primary Risk Categories increased from the three months ended March 31, 2020 primarily as a result of increased historical market volatility early in the current quarter amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with the period-end VaR increase being partially offset by risk reduction in the Fixed Income business.

Distribution of VaR Statistics and Net Revenues 

We evaluate the reasonableness of our VaR model by comparing the potential declines in portfolio values generated by the model with corresponding actual trading results for the Firm, as well as individual business units. For days where losses exceed the VaR statistic, we examine the drivers of trading losses to evaluate the VaR model&#8217;s accuracy relative to realized trading results. There was one day with trading losses in the current quarter, which did not exceed the 95%/one-day Total Management VaR.

&#160; 

The previous histogram shows the distribution of daily net trading revenues for the current quarter. Daily net trading revenues include profits and losses from Interest rate and credit spread, Equity price, Foreign exchange rate, Commodity price, and Credit Portfolio positions and intraday trading activities for 

&#160;

our trading businesses. Certain items such as fees, commissions and net interest income are excluded from daily net trading revenues and the VaR model. Revenues required for Regulatory VaR backtesting further exclude intraday trading. 

Non-Trading Risks 

We believe that sensitivity analysis is an appropriate representation of our non-trading risks. The following sensitivity analyses cover substantially all of the non-trading risk in our portfolio.

The previous table presents an analysis of selected instantaneous upward and downward parallel interest rate shocks (subject to a floor of zero percent in the downward scenario) on net interest income over the next 12 months for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. These shocks are applied to our 12-month forecast for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, which incorporates market expectations of interest rates and our forecasted business activity. 

We do not manage to any single rate scenario but rather manage net interest income in our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries to optimize across a range of possible outcomes, including non-parallel rate change scenarios. The sensitivity analysis assumes that we take no action in response to these scenarios, assumes there are no changes in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates, and includes subjective assumptions regarding customer and market re-pricing behavior and other factors. The change in sensitivity to interest rates between June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020 was primarily driven by the effect of changes in the mix of our assets and liabilities and lower market rates.

We have exposure to public and private companies through direct investments, as well as through funds that invest in these assets. These investments are predominantly equity positions with long investment horizons, a portion of which is for business facilitation purposes. The market risk related to these investments is measured by estimating the potential reduction in net income associated with a 10% decline in investment values and related impact on performance-based fees, as applicable. 

Equity Market Sensitivity 

In the Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments, certain fee-based revenue streams are driven by the value of clients&#8217; equity holdings. The overall level of revenues for these streams also depends on multiple additional factors that include, but are not limited to, the level and duration of the equity market increase or decline, price volatility, the geographic and industry mix of client assets, the rate and magnitude of client investments and redemptions, and the impact of such market increase or decline and price volatility on client behavior. Therefore, overall revenues do not correlate completely with changes in the equity markets. 

Credit Risk 

Credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising when a borrower, counterparty or issuer does not meet its financial obligations to us. We are primarily exposed to credit risk from institutions and individuals through our Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments.

1. 

Investment Management business segment loans are related to certain of our activities as an investment advisor and manager. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , loans held at fair value are predominantly the result of the consolidation of CLO vehicles, managed by Investment Management, composed primarily of senior secured loans to corporations. 

2. 

Lending commitments represent the notional amount of legally binding obligations to provide funding to clients for lending transactions. Since commitments associated with these business activities may expire unused or may not be utilized to full capacity, they do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements. 

We provide loans and lending commitments to a variety of customers including large corporate and institutional clients as well as high to ultra-high net worth individuals. In addition, we 

June 2020 Form 10-Q 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Risk Disclosures 

purchase loans in the secondary market. Loans and lending commitments are either held for investment, held for sale or carried at fair value. For more information on these loan classifications, see Note 2 to the financial statements in the 2019 Form 10-K. 

Total loans and lending commitments increased by approximately $2 billion since December 31, 2019 , primarily due to growth in Corporate loans within the Institutional Securities business segment and across all the portfolios within the Wealth Management business segment, partially offset by a decrease in event-driven lending commitments and Commercial real estate loans within the Institutional Securities business segment. 

See Notes 4 , 9 and 13 to the financial statements for further information. 

Beginning late in the first quarter of 2020 and following in part from the U.S. government&#8217;s enactment of the CARES Act, we have received requests from certain clients for modifications of their credit agreements with us, which in some cases include deferral of their loan payments. Requests for loan payment deferrals related to Residential real estate loans are immediately granted, while Commercial real estate loan deferrals require careful consideration prior to approval. As of June 30, 2020, we have approved requests for forbearance, or deferral of principal and interest payments, on loans with unpaid principal balances of approximately: 

&#8226; 

$1 billion in our Wealth Management business segment tailored lending portfolio, which is included within Securities-based lending and Other. These loans are commercial real estate-related and generally linked to personal guarantees from high to ultra-high net worth individuals; 

&#8226; 

$1 billion in Wealth Management business segment Residential real estate loans; and 

&#8226; 

Less than $1 billion within our Institutional Securities business segment, primarily within Commercial real estate. 

In addition to the deferrals noted above, we are also working with clients regarding modifications of certain other terms under their original loan agreements that do not impact loan payments. As of June, 30 2020, we have granted such relief to certain borrowers, primarily within Secured lending facilities and Corporate loans. Such modifications include agreements to modify margin calls for Secured lending facilities, typically in return for additional payments which improve loan-to-value ratios. In some cases we have agreed to temporarily not enforce certain covenants, for example debt or interest coverage ratios, typically in return for other structural enhancements. 

Granting loan deferrals or modification requests does not necessarily mean that we will incur credit losses and we do not believe modifications have had a material impact on the risk 

&#160;

profile of our loan portfolio. Modifications are considered in our evaluation of overall credit risk. Generally, loans with payment deferrals remain on accrual status and loans with other modifications remain on current status. 

Requests for forbearance and other modifications could continue in future periods given the ongoing uncertain global economic and market conditions. See &#8220;Executive Summary&#8212;Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic,&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; herein for further information. See also &#8220;Forward Looking Statements&#8221; in the 2019 Form 10-K. For additional information on regulatory guidance which permits certain loan modifications for borrowers impacted by COVID-19 to not be accounted for and reported as TDRs and the Firm&#8217;s accounting policies for such modifications, see &#8220; Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Requirements&#8212;Regulatory Developments &#8221; and Note 2 to the financial statements, respectively.

ACL&#8212;Lending commitments 

1. 

At December 31, 2019, the ACL for Loans and Lending commitments was $349 million and $241 million, respectively. 

2. 

The provision for loan losses and provision (release) for losses on lending commitments were $246 million and $(7) million, respectively, in the current quarter and $538 million and $108 million, respectively, in the current year period. 

Credit exposure arising from our loans and lending commitments is measured in accordance with our internal risk management standards. Risk factors considered in determining the aggregate allowance for loan and commitment losses include the borrower&#8217;s financial strength, industry, facility structure, loan-to-value ratio, debt service ratio, collateral and covenants. Qualitative and environmental factors such as economic and business conditions, nature and volume of the portfolio and lending terms, and volume and severity of past due loans may also be considered. 

The aggregate allowance for loans and lending commitments increased in the current year period , principally reflecting a provision for credit losses within the Institutional Securities business segment primarily resulting from the economic impact of COVID-19. This provision was the result of higher actual and expected future downgrades, revisions to our forecasts reflecting expected future market and macroeconomic conditions and an increase in funded balances . The base scenario 

&#160; 

June 2020 Form 10-Q 

&#160; 

Risk Disclosures 

used in our ACL models as of June 30, 2020 was generated using a combination of industry consensus economic forecasts, forward rates, and internally developed and validated models. Given the nature of our lending portfolio, the most sensitive model input is U.S. GDP. The base scenario, among other things, includes a continued sharp drop in U.S. GDP in the current quarter, a U.S. recession, and a recovery supported by fiscal stimulus and monetary policy measures in the U.S. and around the world beginning in the second half of 2020. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the Firm&#8217;s ACL methodology under CECL.

NIG&#8211;Non-investment grade 

1. 

Counterparty credit ratings are internally determined by the Credit Risk Management Department (&#8220;CRM&#8221;). 

2. 

Unrated loans and lending commitments are primarily trading positions that are measured at fair value and risk-managed as a component of market risk. For a further discussion of our market risk, see &#8220; Market Risk &#8221; herein. 

As a result of the economic impacts of COVID-19, there was an increase in lending commitments funded during the current year period in the Institutional Securities business segment. In the first quarter of 2020, the increase was primarily driven by clients with non-investment grade credit ratings, who sought liquidity as capital markets alternatives to drawing on lines of credit were less available. In the current quarter, as capital markets became more active, many of these clients paid down on the lines which were drawn upon in the first quarter.

Sectors Currently in Focus due to COVID-19 

The continuing effect on economic activity of COVID-19 and related governmental actions have impacted borrowers in many sectors and industries. While we are carefully monitoring all of our Institutional Securities business segment exposures, certain sectors are more sensitive to the current economic environment and are continuing to receive heightened focus. The sectors currently in focus are: air travel, retail, upstream energy, lodging and leisure, and healthcare services and systems. As of June 30, 2020, exposures to these sectors are included across the Industrials, Financials, Real estate, Consumer discretionary, Energy and Healthcare industries in the previous table, and in aggregate represent approximately 10% of total Institutional Securities business segment lending exposure. The substantial majority of these exposures are either investment grade or secured by collateral. The future developments of COVID-19 and related government actions and their effect on the economic environment remain uncertain; therefore, the sectors impacted and the extent of the impacts may change over time. Refer to &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; herein. 

Institutional Securities Lending Activities 

The Institutional Securities business segment lending activities include Corporate, Secured lending facilities, Commercial real estate and Securities-based lending and Other. 

Corporate comprises relationship and event-driven loans and lending commitments, which typically consist of revolving lines of credit, term loans and bridge loans; may have varying terms; may be senior or subordinated; may be secured or unsecured; are generally contingent upon representations, warranties and contractual conditions applicable to the borrower; and may be syndicated, traded or hedged. For additional information on 

&#160;

event-driven loans, see &#8220;Institutional Securities Event-Driven Loans and Lending Commitments&#8221; herein. 

Secured lending facilities include loans provided to clients, which are primarily secured by loans, which are, in turn, collateralized by various assets including residential real estate, commercial real estate, corporate and financial assets. These facilities generally provide for overcollateralization. Credit risk with respect to these loans and lending commitments arises from the failure of a borrower to perform according to the terms of the loan agreement and/or a decline in the underlying collateral value. The Firm monitors collateral levels against the requirements of lending agreements. 

Commercial real estate loans are primarily senior, secured by underlying real estate and typically in term loan form. In addition, as part of certain of its trading and securitization activities, Institutional Securities may also hold residential real estate loans. 

Securities-based lending and Other includes financing extended to sales and trading customers and corporate loans purchased in the secondary market.

Event-driven loans and lending commitments are associated with a particular event or transaction, such as to support client merger, acquisition, recapitalization or project finance activities. Balances may fluctuate as such lending is related to transactions that vary in timing and size from period to period. Late in first quarter of 2020, credit spreads in the market for these loans and commitments widened significantly, resulting in a substantial slowdown in the volume of sales and syndications, which impacted this market into the current quarter. By the end of the current quarter, this market had largely normalized; however, liquidity may decline and volatility may return in the future given the current uncertain economic and market conditions.

Securities-based lending allows clients to borrow money against the value of qualifying securities, generally for any purpose other than purchasing, trading or carrying securities, or refinancing margin debt. For more information about our securities-based lending and residential real estate loans, see &#8220; Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Credit Risk &#8221; in the 2019 Form 10-K . 

For the current year period, Loans and Lending commitments associated with the Wealth Management business segment increased due to growth across all portfolios.

The Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments provide margin lending arrangements, which allow customers to borrow against the value of qualifying securities, primarily for the purpose of purchasing additional securities, as well as to collateralize short positions. Margin lending activities generally have lower credit risk due to the value of collateral held and their short-term nature. Amounts may fluctuate from period to period as overall client balances change as a result of market levels, client positioning and leverage.

The change in ACL includes a $124 million increase due to the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020. 

Employee loans are granted in conjunction with a program established primarily to recruit certain Wealth Management representatives and are full recourse and generally require periodic repayments. The ACL as of June 30, 2020 was calculated under CECL, while the ACL at December 31, 2019 was calculated under the prior incurred loss model. The related provision is recorded in Compensation and benefits expense in the income statements. See Note 2 for a description of the CECL allowance methodology, including credit quality indicators, for employee loans. For additional information on employee loans, see Note 9 .

Counterparty credit ratings are determined internally by CRM. 

We are exposed to credit risk as a dealer in OTC derivatives. Credit risk with respect to derivative instruments arises from the possibility that a counterparty may fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. In the current year period, our exposure to credit risk arising from OTC derivatives has increased, primarily as a function of the effect of market factors and

volatility on the valuation of our positions, although exposure has declined since peaking in March. For more information on derivatives, see &#8220; Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Credit Risk&#8212;Derivatives &#8221; in the 2019 Form 10-K and Note 6 to the financial statements. 

Country Risk 

Country risk exposure is the risk that events in, or that affect, a foreign country (any country other than the U.S.) might adversely affect us. We actively manage country risk exposure through a comprehensive risk management framework that combines credit and market fundamentals and allows us to effectively identify, monitor and limit country risk . For a further discussion of our country risk exposure see, &#8220; Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Country and Other Risks &#8221; in the 2019 Form 10-K . 

Our sovereign exposures consist of financial contracts and obligations entered into with sovereign and local governments. Our non-sovereign exposures consist of financial contracts and obligations entered into primarily with corporations and financial institutions. Index credit derivatives are included in the following country risk exposure table. Each reference entity within an index is allocated to that reference entity&#8217;s country of risk. Index exposures are allocated to the underlying reference entities in proportion to the notional weighting of each reference entity in the index, adjusted for any fair value receivable or payable for that reference entity. Where credit risk crosses multiple jurisdictions, for example, a CDS purchased from an issuer in a specific country that references bonds issued by an entity in a different country, the fair value of the CDS is reflected in the Net Counterparty Exposure row based on the country of the CDS issuer. Further, the notional amount of the CDS adjusted for the fair value of the receivable or payable is reflected in the Net Inventory row based on the country of the underlying reference entity .

Net inventory represents exposure to both long and short single-name and index positions ( i.e. , bonds and equities at fair value and CDS based on a notional amount assuming zero recovery adjusted for the fair value of any receivable or payable) . 

2. 

Net counterparty exposure ( e.g. , repurchase transactions, securities lending and OTC derivatives) is net of the benefit of collateral received and also is net by counterparty when legally enforceable master netting agreements are in place. For more information, see &#8220; Additional Information&#8212;Top 10 Non-U.S. Country Exposures &#8221; herein. 

3. 

Amounts represent net CDS hedges (purchased and sold) on net counterparty exposure and lending executed by trading desks responsible for hedging counterparty and lending credit risk exposures. Amounts are based on the CDS notional amount assuming zero recovery adjusted for any fair value receivable or payable. For further description of the contractual terms for purchased credit protection and whether they may limit the effectiveness of our hedges, see &#8220; Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Credit Risk&#8212;Derivatives &#8221; in the 2019 Form 10-K .

Country Risk Exposures Related to the U.K. 

At June 30, 2020 , our country risk exposures in the U.K. included net exposures of $19,009 million (as shown in the Top 10 Non-U.S. Country Exposures table) and overnight deposits of $6,225 million . The $19,464 million of exposures to non-sovereigns were diversified across both names and sectors and include $7,116 million to U.K.-focused counterparties that generate more than one-third of their revenues in the U.K., $5,618 million to geographically diversified counterparties, and $5,988 million to exchanges and clearinghouses. 

Operational Risk 

Operational risk refers to the risk of loss, or of damage to our reputation, resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, from human factors or from external events ( e.g. , fraud, theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage to physical assets). We may incur operational risk across the full scope of our business activities, including revenue-generating activities ( e.g ., sales and trading) and support and control groups ( e.g. , information technology and trade processing). For a further discussion about our operational risk, see &#8220; Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Operational Risk &#8221; in the 2019 Form 10-K . In addition, for further information on market and economic conditions and their effects on risk in general, see &#8220; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Executive Summary&#8212;Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic &#8221; and &#8220; Risk Factors &#8221; herein. 

Model Risk 

Model risk refers to the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs. Model risk can lead to financial loss, poor business and strategic decision making or damage to our reputation. The risk inherent in a model is a function of the materiality, complexity and uncertainty around inputs and assumptions. Model risk is generated from the use of models impacting financial statements, regulatory filings, capital adequacy assessments and the formulation of strategy. For a further discussion about our

model risk, see &#8220; Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Model Risk &#8221; in the 2019 Form 10-K . 

Liquidity Risk 

Liquidity risk refers to the risk that we will be unable to finance our operations due to a loss of access to the capital markets or difficulty in liquidating our assets. Liquidity risk also encompasses our ability (or perceived ability) to meet our financial obligations without experiencing significant business disruption or reputational damage that may threaten our viability as a going concern. For a further discussion about our liquidity risk, see &#8220; Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Liquidity Risk &#8221; in the 2019 Form 10-K and &#8220; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8221; herein. In addition, for further information on market and economic conditions and their effects on risk in general, see &#8220; Risk Factors &#8221; herein. 

Legal and Compliance Risk 

Legal and compliance risk includes the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, including fines, penalties, judgments, damages and/or settlements, or loss to reputation that we may suffer as a result of failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, related self-regulatory organization standards and codes of conduct applicable to our business activities. This risk also includes contractual and commercial risk, such as the risk that a counterparty&#8217;s performance obligations will be unenforceable. It also includes compliance with AML, terrorist financing, and anti-corruption rules and regulations. For a further discussion about our legal and compliance risk, see &#8220; Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Legal and Compliance Risk &#8221; in the 2019 Form 10-K .

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Morgan Stanley: 

&#160; 

Results of Review of Interim Financial Information 

We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of Morgan Stanley and subsidiaries (the &#8220;Firm&#8221;) as of June 30, 2020 , and the related condensed consolidated income statements, comprehensive income statements, and statements of changes in total equity for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 , and the cash flow statements for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 , and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;interim financial information&#8221;). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Firm as of December 31, 2019 , and the related consolidated income statement, comprehensive income statement, cash flow statement and statement of changes in total equity for the year then ended (not presented herein) included in the Firm&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K; and in our report dated February 27, 2020, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 

&#160;

Basis for Review Results 

This interim financial information is the responsibility of the Firm&#8217;s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

1 . Introduction and Basis of Presentation 

The Firm 

Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm that maintains significant market positions in each of its business segments&#8212;Institutional Securities, Wealth Management and Investment Management. Morgan Stanley, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, provides a wide variety of products and services to a large and diversified group of clients and customers, including corporations, governments, financial institutions and individuals. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms &#8220;Morgan Stanley&#8221; or the &#8220;Firm&#8221; mean Morgan Stanley (the &#8220;Parent Company&#8221;) together with its consolidated subsidiaries. See the &#8220;Glossary of Common Terms and Acronyms&#8221; for the definition of certain terms and acronyms used throughout this Form 10-Q. 

A description of the clients and principal products and services of each of the Firm&#8217;s business segments is as follows: 

Institutional Securities provides investment banking, sales and trading, lending and other services to corporations, governments, financial institutions and high to ultra-high net worth clients. Investment banking services consist of capital raising and financial advisory services, including services relating to the underwriting of debt, equity and other securities, as well as advice on mergers and acquisitions, restructurings, real estate and project finance. Sales and trading services include sales, financing, prime brokerage and market-making activities in equity and fixed income products, including foreign exchange and commodities. Lending activities include originating corporate loans and commercial real estate loans, providing secured lending facilities, and extending financing to sales and trading customers. Other activities include Asia wealth management services, investments and research. 

Wealth Management provides a comprehensive array of financial services and solutions to individual investors and small to medium-sized businesses and institutions covering: brokerage and investment advisory services; financial and wealth planning services; stock plan administration services; annuity and insurance products; securities-based lending, residential real estate loans and other lending products; banking; and retirement plan services. 

Investment Management provides a broad range of investment strategies and products that span geographies, asset classes, and public and private markets to a diverse group of clients across institutional and intermediary channels. Strategies and products, which are offered through a variety of investment vehicles, include equity, fixed income, liquidity and alternative/other products. Institutional clients include defined benefit/defined contribution plans, foundations, endowments, government entities, sovereign wealth funds, 

&#160;

insurance companies, third-party fund sponsors and corporations. Individual clients are generally served through intermediaries, including affiliated and non-affiliated distributors. 

Basis of Financial Information 

The financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the Firm to make estimates and assumptions regarding the valuations of certain financial instruments, the valuations of goodwill and intangible assets, the outcome of legal and tax matters, deferred tax assets, ACL, and other matters that affect its financial statements and related disclosures. The Firm believes that the estimates utilized in the preparation of its financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. 

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to conform to the current presentation. The Notes are an integral part of the Firm's financial statements. The Firm has evaluated subsequent events for adjustment to or disclosure in these financial statements through the date of this report and has not identified any recordable or disclosable events not otherwise reported in these financial statements or the notes thereto. 

The accompanying financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Firm&#8217;s financial statements and notes thereto included in the 2019 Form 10-K . Certain footnote disclosures included in the 2019 Form 10-K have been condensed or omitted from these financial statements as they are not required for interim reporting under U.S. GAAP. The financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for the fair presentation of the results for the interim period. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year. 

Consolidation 

The financial statements include the accounts of the Firm, its wholly owned subsidiaries and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest, including certain VIEs (see Note 14 ). Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. For consolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly owned, the third-party holdings of equity interests are referred to as noncontrolling interests. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented as Net income applicable to noncontrolling interests in the income statements. The portion of shareholders&#8217; equity that is attributable to noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented as noncontrolling interests, a component of Total equity, in the balance sheets. 

For a discussion of the Firm&#8217;s significant regulated U.S. and international subsidiaries and its involvement with VIEs, see Note 1 to the financial statements in the 2019 Form 10-K .

2 . Significant Accounting Policies 

For a detailed discussion about the Firm&#8217;s significant accounting policies and for further information on accounting updates adopted in the prior year, see Note 2 to the financial statements in the 2019 Form 10-K . 

During the six months ended June 30, 2020 (&#8220;current year period&#8221;), there were no significant revisions to the Firm&#8217;s significant accounting policies, other than for the accounting updates adopted. 

Accounting Updates Adopted in 2020 

Reference Rate Reform 

The Firm adopted the Reference Rate Reform accounting update in the current quarter. There was no impact to the Firm&#8217;s financial statements upon initial adoption. 

This accounting update provides optional accounting relief to entities with contracts, hedge accounting relationships or other transactions that reference LIBOR or other interest rate benchmarks for which the referenced rate is expected to be discontinued or replaced. The Firm is applying the accounting relief as relevant contract and hedge accounting relationship modifications are made during the course of the reference rate reform transition period. The optional relief generally allows for contract modifications solely related to the replacement of the reference rate to be accounted for as a continuation of the existing contract instead of as an extinguishment of the contract, and would therefore not trigger certain accounting impacts that would otherwise be required. It also allows entities to change certain critical terms of existing hedge accounting relationships that are affected by reference rate reform, and these changes would not require de-designating the hedge accounting relationship. The optional relief ends December 31, 2022. 

Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses 

The Firm adopted the Financial Instruments &#8212; Credit Losses accounting update on January 1, 2020. 

This accounting update impacted the impairment model for certain financial assets measured at amortized cost by requiring a CECL methodology to estimate expected credit losses over the entire life of the financial asset, recorded at inception or purchase. CECL replaced the loss model previously applicable to loans held for investment, HTM securities and other receivables carried at amortized cost, such as employee loans. 

The update also eliminated the concept of other-than-temporary impairment for AFS securities and instead requires impairments on AFS securities to be recognized in earnings through an allowance when the fair value is less than amortized cost and a credit loss exists, and through a permanent reduction of the 

&#160;

amortized cost basis when the securities are expected to be sold before recovery of amortized cost. 

For certain portfolios, we determined that there are de minimus or zero expected credit losses, for example, for lending and financing transactions, such as Securities borrowed, Securities purchased under agreements to resell and certain other portfolios where collateral arrangements are being followed. Also, we have zero expected credit losses for certain financial assets based on the credit quality of the borrower or issuer, such as U.S. government and agency securities. 

At transition on January 1, 2020, the adoption of this accounting standard resulted in an increase in the allowance for credit losses of $ 131 million with a corresponding reduction in Retained earnings of $ 100 million, net of tax. The adoption impact was primarily attributable to a $ 124 million increase in the allowance for credit losses on employee loans. 

The following discussion highlights changes to the Firm&#8217;s accounting policies as a result of this adoption. 

Instruments Measured at Amortized Cost and Certain Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The ACL for financial instruments measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet exposures ( e.g., HFI loans and lending commitments, HTM securities, customer and other receivables and certain guarantees) represents an estimate of expected credit losses over the entire life of the financial instrument. 

Factors considered by management when determining the ACL include payment status, fair value of collateral, expected payments of principal and interest, as well as internal or external information relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Firm&#8217;s three forecasts include assumptions about certain macroeconomic variables including, but not limited to, U.S. gross domestic product, equity market indices, unemployment rates, as well as commercial real estate and home price indices. At the conclusion of the Firm&#8217;s reasonable and supportable forecast period of 13 quarters, there is a gradual reversion back to historical averages. 

The ACL is measured on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist for multiple instruments considering all available information relevant to assessing the collectability of cash flows. Generally, the Firm applies a probability of default/loss given default model for instruments that are collectively assessed, under which the ACL is calculated as the product of probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default. These parameters are forecast for each collective group of assets using a scenario-based statistical model and at the conclusion of the Firm&#8217;s reasonable and supportable forecast period, the parameters gradually revert back to historical averages.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

(Unaudited) 

If the instrument does not share similar risk characteristics with other instruments, including when it is probable that the Firm will be unable to collect the full payment of principal and interest on the instrument when due, the ACL is measured on an individual basis. The Firm generally applies a discounted cash flow method for instruments that are individually assessed. 

The Firm may also elect to use an approach that considers the fair value of the collateral when measuring the ACL if the loan is collateral dependent ( i.e., repayment of the loan is expected to be provided substantially by the sale or operation of the underlying collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty). 

Additionally, the Firm can elect to use an approach to measure the ACL using the fair value of collateral where the borrower is required to, and reasonably expected to, continually adjust and replenish the amount of collateral securing the instrument to reflect changes in the fair value of such collateral. The Firm has elected to use this approach for certain securities-based loans, customer receivables representing margin loans, Securities purchased under agreements to resell and Securities borrowed. 

Credit quality indicators considered in developing the ACL include: 

&#8226; 

Corporate loans, Secured lending facilities, Commercial real estate loans and securities, and Other loans: Internal risk ratings developed by the Credit Risk Management Department which are refreshed at least annually, and more frequently as necessary. These ratings generally correspond to external ratings published by S&#38;P. The Firm also considers transaction structure, including type of collateral, collateral terms, and position of the obligation within the capital structure. In addition, for Commercial real estate, the Firm considers property type and location, net operating income, LTV ratios, among others, as well as commercial real estate price and credit spread indices and capitalization rates. 

&#8226; 

Residential real estate loans: Loan origination Fair Isaac Corporation (&#8220;FICO&#8221;) credit scores as determined by independent credit agencies in the United States and loan-to-value (&#8220;LTV&#8221;) ratios. 

&#8226; 

Employee loans: Employment status, which includes those currently employed by the Firm and for which the Firm can deduct any unpaid amounts due to it through certain compensation arrangements; and those no longer employed by the Firm where such compensation arrangements are no longer applicable. 

For Securities-based loans, the Firm generally measures the ACL based on the fair value of collateral. 

Qualitative and environmental factors such as economic and business conditions, the nature and volume of the portfolio, and 

&#160;

lending terms and the volume and severity of past due loans are also considered in the ACL calculations. 

Recognition . The Firm recognizes its ACL and provision for credit losses in its balance sheets and income statements, respectively, for on&#8211; and off&#8211;balance sheet instruments as follows. 

&#160;

Provision for credit losses

Employee loans

Troubled Debt Restructurings (&#8220;TDRs&#8221;) 

The Firm may modify the terms of certain loans for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties by granting one or more concessions that the Firm would not otherwise consider. Such modifications are accounted for and reported as a TDR, except for certain modifications related to the Coronavirus Disease (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) as noted in &#8220;Modifications and Nonaccrual Status for Borrowers Impacted by COVID-19&#8221; herein. A loan that has been modified in a TDR is generally considered to be impaired and is evaluated individually. TDRs are also generally classified as nonaccrual and may be returned to accrual status only after the Firm expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest and there is sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period. 

Nonaccrual 

The Firm places financial instruments on nonaccrual status if principal or interest is past due for a period of 90 days or more or payment of principal or interest is in doubt unless the obligation is well-secured and in the process of collection, or in certain cases when related to COVID-19 as noted in &#8220;Modifications and Nonaccrual Status for Borrowers Impacted by COVID-19&#8221; herein. For any instrument placed on nonaccrual status, the Firm reverses any unpaid interest accrued with an offsetting reduction to Interest income. Principal and interest payments received on nonaccrual instruments are applied to principal if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal. If collection of the principal is not in doubt, interest income is realized on a cash basis. If neither principal nor interest collection is in doubt and the instruments are brought current, instruments are generally placed on accrual status and interest income is recognized using the effective interest method.

&#160;

(Unaudited) 

Modifications and Nonaccrual Status for Borrowers Impacted by COVID-19 

In the first quarter of 2020, the Firm elected to apply the guidance issued by Congress in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (&#8220;CARES Act&#8221;) as well as by the U.S. banking agencies stating that certain concessions granted to borrowers that are current on existing loans, either individually or as part of a program for creditworthy borrowers who are experiencing short-term financial or operational problems as a result of COVID-19, generally would not be considered TDRs. Additionally, these loans generally would not be considered nonaccrual status unless collectability concerns exist despite the modification provided. For loans remaining on accrual status, the Firm elected to continue recognizing interest income during the modification periods. 

ACL Write-offs 

The Firm writes-off a financial instrument in the period that it is deemed uncollectible and records a reduction in the ACL and the balance of the financial instrument in the balance sheet. However, for accrued interest receivable balances that are separately recorded from the related financial instruments, the Firm's nonaccrual policy requires that accrued interest receivable be written off against Interest income when the related financial instrument is placed in nonaccrual status. Accordingly, the Firm elected not to measure an ACL for accrued interest receivables. However, in the case of loans which are modified as a result of COVID-19 and remain on accrual status due to the relief noted in &#8220;Modifications and Nonaccrual Status for Borrowers Impacted by COVID-19,&#8221; accrued interest receivable balances are assessed for any required ACL. 

Available-for-Sale (&#8220;AFS&#8221;) Investment Securities 

AFS securities are reported at fair value in the balance sheets. Interest income, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, is included in Interest income in the Income statements. AFS securities in an unrealized gain position at the end of the reporting period are reflected in AOCI and AFS securities in an unrealized loss position are treated as follows. 

Unrealized Losses on AFS Securities 

AFS securities in an unrealized loss position that the Firm either has the intent to sell or that the Firm is likely to be required to sell before recovery of its amortized cost basis require a write-off of any previously established ACL as well as a write-down of amortized cost basis to the security's fair value, with any incremental unrealized losses reported in Other revenues. 

For all other AFS securities in an unrealized loss position, the Firm assesses whether credit losses exist at the individual security level and reflects the credit losses in the ACL accordingly. When considering if a credit loss exists, the Firm considers relevant information as discussed in Note 2 of the 

&#160;

2019 Form 10-K. Upon the adoption of Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses , the Firm no longer considers the length of time the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis in determining whether a credit loss exists. 

Recognition . If a credit loss exists, the Firm recognizes its ACL and provision for credit losses for AFS securities in its balance sheets and income statements, respectively, as follows. 

&#160; 

ACL 

Provision for credit losses 

AFS securities 

Contra Investment securities 

Other revenue 

The Firm recognizes the non-credit loss component of the unrealized loss as an adjustment to the security&#8217;s value with an offsetting entry to AOCI in the balance sheets. 

Nonaccrual &#38; ACL Write-Offs on AFS Securities 

AFS securities follow the same nonaccrual and write-off guidance as discussed in &#8220;Instruments Measured at Amortized Cost and Certain Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures&#8221; herein, except as set forth in &#8220;Modifications and Nonaccrual Status for Borrowers Impacted by COVID-19.&#8221;

1. 

Net transfers in the current year period reflect the largely offsetting impacts of transfers in of $ 857 million of equity margin loans in the first quarter and transfers out of $ 707 million of equity margin loans in the current quarter. The loans were transferred in in the first quarter as the significance of the margin loan rate input increased as a result of reduced liquidity, and transferred out in the second quarter as liquidity conditions improved reducing the significance of the input. 

Level 3 instruments may be hedged with instruments classified in Level 1 and Level 2. The realized and unrealized gains or losses for assets and liabilities within the Level 3 category presented in the previous tables do not reflect the related realized and unrealized gains or losses on hedging instruments that have been classified by the Firm within the Level 1 and/or Level 2 categories. 

The unrealized gains (losses) during the period for assets and liabilities within the Level 3 category may include changes in fair value during the period that were attributable to both observable and unobservable inputs. Total realized and unrealized gains (losses) are primarily included in Trading revenues in the income statements. 

Additionally, in the previous tables, consolidations of VIEs are included in Purchases and deconsolidations of VIEs are included in Settlements.

1. 

A single amount is disclosed for range and average when there is no significant difference between the minimum, maximum and average. Amounts represent weighted averages except where simple averages and the median of the inputs are more relevant. 

2. 

Includes derivative contracts with multiple risks ( i.e. , hybrid products) . 

The previous tables provide information on the valuation techniques, significant unobservable inputs, and the ranges and averages for each major category of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis with a significant Level 3 balance. The level of aggregation and breadth of products cause the range of inputs to be wide and not evenly distributed across the inventory of financial instruments. Further, the range of unobservable inputs may differ across firms in the financial services industry because of diversity in the types of products included in each firm&#8217;s inventory. There are no predictable relationships between multiple significant unobservable inputs attributable to a given valuation technique. 

Other than as follows, during the current quarter, there were no significant revisions made to the descriptions of the Firm&#8217;s significant unobservable inputs. For margin loans, the margin loan rate is the annualized rate that reflects the possibility of losses as a result of movements in the price of the underlying margin loan collateral. The rate is calibrated from the previously disclosed discount rate, credit spread and/or volatility measures. For a description of the Firm&#8217;s significant unobservable inputs and qualitative information about the effect of hypothetical changes in the values of those inputs, see Note 3 to the financial statements in the 2019 Form 10-K .

Investments in hedge funds may be subject to initial period lock-up or gate provisions, which restrict an investor from withdrawing from the fund during a certain initial period or restrict the redemption amount on any redemption date, respectively. 

Amounts in the previous table represent the Firm&#8217;s carrying value of general and limited partnership interests in fund investments, as well as any related performance-based fees in the form of carried interest. The carrying amounts are measured based on the NAV of the fund taking into account the distribution terms applicable to the interest held. This same measurement applies whether the fund investments are accounted for under the equity method or fair value. 

For a description of the Firm&#8217;s investments in private equity funds, real estate funds and hedge funds, which are measured based on NAV, see Note 3 to the financial statements in the 2019 Form 10-K . 

See Note 13 for information regarding general partner guarantees, which include potential obligations to return performance fee distributions previously received. See Note 19 for information regarding unrealized carried interest at risk of reversal.

Gains and losses for Loans and Other assets&#8212;Other investments are classified in Other revenues. For other items, gains and losses are recorded in Other revenues if the item is held for sale; otherwise, they are recorded in Other expenses. 

2. 

Nonrecurring changes in the fair value of loans and lending commitments were calculated as follows: for the held-for-investment category, based on the value of the underlying collateral; and for the held-for-sale category, based on recently executed transactions, market price quotations, valuation models that incorporate market observable inputs where possible, such as comparable loan or debt prices and CDS spread levels adjusted for any basis difference between cash and derivative instruments, or default recovery analysis where such transactions and quotations are unobservable. 

3. 

Losses related to Other assets&#8212;Other investments were determined using techniques that included discounted cash flow models, methodologies that incorporate multiples of certain comparable companies and recently executed transactions. 

4. 

Losses related to Other assets&#8212;Premises, equipment and software generally include write-offs related to the disposal of certain assets.

The Firm believes that the notional amounts of derivative contracts generally overstate its exposure. In most circumstances, notional amounts are used only as a reference point from which to calculate amounts owed between the parties to the contract. Furthermore, notional amounts do not reflect the benefit of legally enforceable netting arrangements or risk mitigating transactions. 

For a discussion of the Firm's derivative instruments and hedging activities, see Note 5 to the financial statements in the 2019 Form 10-K .

The additional collateral or termination payments that may be called in the event of a future credit rating downgrade vary by contract and can be based on ratings by either or both of Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, Inc. (&#8220;Moody&#8217;s&#8221;) and S&#38;P Global Ratings. The previous table shows the future potential collateral amounts and termination payments that could be called or required by counterparties or exchange and clearing organizations in the event of one-notch or two-notch downgrade scenarios based on the relevant contractual downgrade triggers.

For AFS securities, t he Firm believes there are no securities in an unrealized loss position that have credit losses after performing the analysis described in Note 2 . Additionally, the Firm does not intend to sell the securities and is not likely to be required to sell the securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis. Furthermore, the securities have not experienced credit losses as they are predominantly investment grade and the Firm expects to recover the amortized cost basis. 

&#160;

As of June 30, 2020 , the HTM securities net carrying amount reflects an ACL of $ 28 million related to Non-agency CMBS. See Note 2 for a description of the ACL methodology used beginning in 2020 following the Firm&#8217;s adoption of CECL and see Note 2 to the financial statements in the 2019 Form 10-K for prior period credit loss considerations. There were no HTM securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2019 that were other-than-temporarily impaired. As of June 30, 2020 , and December 31, 2019, Non-Agency CMBS HTM securities were all on accrual status and were predominantly investment grade. 

See Note 14 for additional information on securities issued by VIEs, including U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, non-agency CMBS and FFELP student loan ABS .

1. 

The provision (release) for lending commitments was $( 7 ) million in the current quarter and $ 11 million in the prior year quarter. 

The aggregate allowance for loans and lending commitments increased in the current year period , principally reflecting a provision for credit losses within the Institutional Securities business segment primarily resulting from the economic impact of COVID-19. This provision was the result of higher actual and expected future downgrades, revisions to our forecasts reflecting expected future market and macroeconomic conditions and an increase in funded balances . The base scenario used in our ACL models as of June 30, 2020 was generated using a combination of industry consensus economic forecasts, forward rates, and internally developed and validated models. Given the nature of our lending portfolio, the most sensitive model input is U.S. GDP. The base scenario, among other things, includes a continued sharp drop in U.S. GDP in the current quarter, a U.S. recession, and a recovery supported by fiscal stimulus and monetary policy measures in the U.S. and around

These amounts include certain issued standby letters of credit participated to third parties, totaling $ 0.6 billion of notional and collateral/recourse, due to the nature of the Firm&#8217;s obligations under these arrangements. As of June 30, 2020 , the carrying amount of standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees issued includes an allowance for credit losses of $ 78 million . 

2. 

The carrying amounts of derivative contracts that meet the accounting definition of a guarantee are shown on a gross basis. For further information on derivatives contracts, see Note 6 . 

3. 

Primarily related to residential mortgage securitizations. 

The Firm has obligations under certain guarantee arrangements, including contracts and indemnification agreements, that contingently require the Firm to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying measure (such as an interest or foreign exchange rate, security or commodity price, an index, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of a specified event) related to an asset, liability or equity security of a guaranteed party. Also included as guarantees are 

&#160;

contracts that contingently require the Firm to make payments to the guaranteed party based on another entity&#8217;s failure to perform under an agreement, as well as indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others. 

Client Clearing Guarantees. In the first quarter of 2020, FICC&#8217;s sponsored clearing model was updated such that the Firm could be responsible for liquidation of a sponsored member&#8217;s account and guarantees any resulting loss to the FICC in the event the sponsored member fails to fully pay any net liquidation amount due from the sponsored member to the FICC. Accordingly, the Firm&#8217;s maximum potential payout amount as of June 30, 2020 reflects the total of the estimated net liquidation amounts for sponsored member accounts. 

For more information on the nature of the obligations and related business activities for our guarantees, see Note 13 to the financial statements in the 2019 Form 10-K . 

Other Guarantees and Indemnities 

In the normal course of business, the Firm provides guarantees and indemnifications in a variety of transactions. These provisions generally are standard contractual terms. Certain of these guarantees and indemnifications related to indemnities, exchange and clearinghouse member guarantees and merger and acquisition guarantees are described in Note 13 to the financial statements in the 2019 Form 10-K . 

In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Firm guarantees the debt and/or certain trading obligations (including obligations associated with derivatives, foreign exchange contracts and the settlement of physical commodities) of certain subsidiaries. These guarantees generally are entity or product specific and are required by investors or trading counterparties. The activities of the Firm&#8217;s subsidiaries covered by these guarantees (including any related debt or trading obligations) are included in the financial statements. 

Finance Subsidiary 

The Parent Company fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by Morgan Stanley Finance LLC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary. 

Contingencies 

Legal 

In addition to the matters described in the following paragraphs, in the normal course of business, the Firm has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services institution. Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the 

June 2020 Form 10-Q 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

(Unaudited) 

primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or are in financial distress. These actions have included, but are not limited to, residential mortgage and credit crisis-related matters. 

While the Firm has identified below any individual proceedings where the Firm believes a material loss to be reasonably possible and reasonably estimable, there can be no assurance that material losses will not be incurred from claims that have not yet been asserted or are not yet determined to be probable or possible and reasonably estimable losses. 

The Firm contests liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. Where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the Firm can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, the Firm accrues the estimated loss by a charge to income. 

In many proceedings and investigations, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss. In addition, even where a loss is possible or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the liability already accrued with respect to a previously recognized loss contingency, it is not always possible to reasonably estimate the size of the possible loss or range of loss. 

For certain legal proceedings and investigations, the Firm cannot reasonably estimate such losses, particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties. Numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages or other relief, and by addressing novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question, before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional range of loss can be reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation. 

For certain other legal proceedings and investigations, the Firm can estimate reasonably possible losses, additional losses, ranges of loss or ranges of additional loss in excess of amounts accrued but does not believe, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that such losses will have a material adverse effect on the Firm&#8217;s financial statements as a whole, other than the matters referred to in the following paragraphs. 

On July 15, 2010 , China Development Industrial Bank (&#8220;CDIB&#8221;) filed a complaint against the Firm, styled China Development Industrial Bank v. Morgan Stanley &#38; Co. Incorporated et al. , which is pending in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County (&#8220;Supreme Court of NY&#8221;). The complaint relates to a $ 275 million CDS referencing 

&#160;

the super senior portion of the STACK 2006-1 CDO. The complaint asserts claims for common law fraud, fraudulent inducement and fraudulent concealment and alleges that the Firm misrepresented the risks of the STACK 2006-1 CDO to CDIB, and that the Firm knew that the assets backing the CDO were of poor quality when it entered into the CDS with CDIB. The complaint seeks compensatory damages related to the approximately $ 228 million that CDIB alleges it has already lost under the CDS, rescission of CDIB&#8217;s obligation to pay an additional $ 12 million , punitive damages, equitable relief, fees and costs. On February 28, 2011, the court denied the Firm&#8217;s motion to dismiss the complaint. On December 21, 2018, the court denied the Firm&#8217;s motion for summary judgment and granted in part the Firm&#8217;s motion for sanctions relating to spoliation of evidence. On January 24, 2019, CDIB filed a notice of appeal from the court&#8217;s December 21, 2018 order, and on January 25, 2019, the Firm filed a notice of appeal from the same order. On March 7, 2019, the court denied the relief that CDIB sought in a motion to clarify and resettle the portion of the court&#8217;s December 21, 2018 order granting spoliation sanctions. On May 21, 2020, the Appellate Division, First Department (&#8220;First Department&#8221;), modified the Supreme Court of NY&#8217;s order to deny the Firm&#8217;s motion for sanctions relating to spoliation of evidence and otherwise affirmed the denial of the Firm&#8217;s motion for summary judgment. On June 19, 2020, the Firm moved for leave to appeal the First Department&#8217;s decision to the New York Court of Appeals (&#8220;Court of Appeals&#8221;). Based on currently available information, the Firm believes it could incur a loss in this action of up to approximately $ 240 million plus pre- and post-judgment interest, fees and costs. 

On July 8, 2013 , U.S. Bank National Association, in its capacity as trustee, filed a complaint against the Firm styled U.S. Bank National Association, solely in its capacity as Trustee of the Morgan Stanley Mortgage Loan Trust 2007-2AX (MSM 2007-2AX) v. Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC, Successor-by-Merger to Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Inc. and GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, Inc. , pending in the Supreme Court of NY. The complaint asserts claims for breach of contract and alleges, among other things, that the loans in the trust, which had an original principal balance of approximately $ 650 million , breached various representations and warranties. The complaint seeks, among other relief, specific performance of the loan breach remedy procedures in the transaction documents, unspecified damages and interest. On November 24, 2014, the court granted in part and denied in part the Firm&#8217;s motion to dismiss the complaint. On April 4, 2019, the court denied the Firm&#8217;s motion to renew its motion to dismiss. Based on currently available information, the Firm believes that it could incur a loss in this action of up to approximately $ 240 million , the total original unpaid balance of the mortgage loans for which the Firm received repurchase demands that it did not repurchase, plus pre- and post-judgment interest, fees and costs, but plaintiff is seeking to expand the number of loans at issue and the possible range of loss could increase.

On September 23, 2014, Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (&#8220;FGIC&#8221;) filed a complaint against the Firm in the Supreme Court of NY styled Financial Guaranty Insurance Company v. Morgan Stanley ABS Capital I Inc. et al. relating to the Morgan Stanley ABS Capital I Inc. Trust 2007-NC4. The complaint asserts claims for breach of contract and fraudulent inducement and alleges, among other things, that the loans in the trust breached various representations and warranties and defendants made untrue statements and material omissions to induce FGIC to issue a financial guaranty policy on certain classes of certificates that had an original balance of approximately $ 876 million . The complaint seeks, among other relief, specific performance of the loan breach remedy procedures in the transaction documents, compensatory, consequential and punitive damages, attorneys&#8217; fees and interest. On January 23, 2017, the court denied the Firm&#8217;s motion to dismiss the complaint. On September 13, 2018, the First Department affirmed in part and reversed in part the lower court&#8217;s order denying the Firm&#8217;s motion to dismiss. On December 20, 2018, the First Department denied plaintiff&#8217;s motion for leave to appeal its decision to the Court of Appeals or, in the alternative, for re-argument. Based on currently available information, the Firm believes that it could incur a loss in this action of up to approximately $ 277 million , the total original unpaid balance of the mortgage loans for which the Firm received repurchase demands from a certificate holder and FGIC that the Firm did not repurchase, plus pre- and post- judgment interest, fees and costs, as well as claim payments that FGIC has made and will make in the future. In addition, plaintiff is seeking to expand the number of loans at issue and the possible range of loss could increase. 

On January 23, 2015, Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, in its capacity as trustee, filed a complaint against the Firm styled Deutsche Bank National Trust Company solely in its capacity as Trustee of the Morgan Stanley ABS Capital I Inc. Trust 2007-NC4 v. Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC as Successor-by-Merger to Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Inc., and Morgan Stanley ABS Capital I Inc. , pending in the Supreme Court of NY. The complaint asserts claims for breach of contract and alleges, among other things, that the loans in the trust, which had an original principal balance of approximately $ 1.05 billion , breached various representations and warranties. The complaint seeks, among other relief, specific performance of the loan breach remedy procedures in the transaction documents, compensatory, consequential, rescissory, equitable and punitive damages, attorneys&#8217; fees, costs and other related expenses, and interest. On December 11, 2015, the court granted in part and denied in part the Firm&#8217;s motion to dismiss the complaint. On October 19, 2018, the court granted the Firm&#8217;s motion for leave to amend its answer and to stay the case pending resolution of Deutsche Bank National Trust Company&#8217;s appeal to the Court of Appeals in another case, styled Deutsche Bank National Trust Company v. Barclays Bank PLC , regarding the applicable statute of limitations. On January 17, 2019, the First Department reversed the trial court&#8217;s order to the extent that it had granted 

&#160;

in part the Firm&#8217;s motion to dismiss the complaint. On June 4, 2019, the First Department granted the Firm&#8217;s motion for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals. On March 19, 2020, the Firm filed a motion for partial summary judgment. Based on currently available information, the Firm believes that it could incur a loss in this action of up to approximately $ 277 million , the total original unpaid balance of the mortgage loans for which the Firm received repurchase demands from a certificate holder and a monoline insurer that the Firm did not repurchase, plus pre- and post-judgment interest, fees and costs, but plaintiff is seeking to expand the number of loans at issue and the possible range of loss could increase. 

Tax 

In matters styled Case number 15/3637 and Case number 15/4353 , the Dutch Tax Authority (&#8220;Dutch Authority&#8221;) is challenging in the Dutch courts, the prior set-off by the Firm of approximately &#8364; 124 million (approximately $ 139 million ) plus accrued interest of withholding tax credits against the Firm&#8217;s corporation tax liabilities for the tax years 2007 to 2013. The Dutch Authority alleges that the Firm was not entitled to receive the withholding tax credits on the basis, inter alia, that a Firm subsidiary did not hold legal title to certain securities subject to withholding tax on the relevant dates. The Dutch Authority has also alleged that the Firm failed to provide certain information to the Dutch Authority and keep adequate books and records. On April 26, 2018, the District Court in Amsterdam issued a decision dismissing the Dutch Authority&#8217;s claims with respect to certain of the tax years in dispute. On May 12, 2020, the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam granted the Dutch Authority&#8217;s appeal in matters re-styled Case number 18/00318 and Case number 18/00319 . On June 22, 2020, the Firm filed an appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam before the Dutch High Court.

Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities are presented in the previous tables after intercompany eliminations. Generally, most assets owned by consolidated VIEs cannot be removed unilaterally by the Firm and are not available to the Firm while the related liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are non-recourse to the Firm. However, in certain consolidated VIEs, the Firm either has the unilateral right to remove assets or provides additional recourse through derivatives such as total return swaps, guarantees or other forms of involvement. 

In general, the Firm&#8217;s exposure to loss in consolidated VIEs is limited to losses that would be absorbed on the VIE net assets recognized in its financial statements, net of amounts absorbed by third-party variable interest holders.

Where notional amounts are utilized in quantifying the maximum exposure related to derivatives, such amounts do not reflect changes in fair value recorded by the Firm. 

4. 

Additional VIE assets owned represents the carrying value of total exposure to non-consolidated VIEs for which the maximum exposure to loss is less than specific thresholds, primarily interests issued by securitization SPEs. The Firm&#8217;s maximum exposure to loss generally equals the fair value of the assets owned. These assets are primarily included in Trading assets and Investment securities and are measured at fair value (see Note 4 ). The Firm does not provide additional support in these transactions through contractual facilities, guarantees or similar derivatives. 

The majority of the VIEs included in the previous tables are sponsored by unrelated parties; examples of the Firm&#8217;s involvement with these VIEs include its secondary market-making activities and the securities held in its Investment securities portfolio (see Note 7 ). 

The Firm&#8217;s maximum exposure to loss is dependent on the nature of the Firm&#8217;s variable interest in the VIE and is limited to the notional amounts of certain liquidity facilities and other credit support, total return swaps and written put options, as well as the fair value of certain other derivatives and investments the Firm has made in the VIE. 

The Firm&#8217;s maximum exposure to loss in the previous tables does not include the offsetting benefit of hedges or any reductions associated with the amount of collateral held as part of a transaction with the VIE or any party to the VIE directly against a specific exposure to loss. 

Liabilities issued by VIEs generally are non-recourse to the Firm.

The Transferred Assets with Continuing Involvement tables include transactions with SPEs in which the Firm, acting as principal, transferred financial assets with continuing involvement and received sales treatment. 

2. 

Amounts include CLO transactions managed by unrelated third parties. 

3. 

Amounts include assets transferred by unrelated transferors. 

Transferred assets are carried at fair value prior to securitization, and any changes in fair value are recognized in the income statements. The Firm may act as underwriter of the beneficial interests issued by these securitization vehicles, for which Investment banking revenues are recognized. The Firm may retain interests in the securitized financial assets as one or more tranches of the securitization. These retained interests are generally carried at fair value in the balance sheets with changes in fair value recognized in the income statements. Fair value for these interests is measured using techniques that are consistent with the valuation techniques applied to the Firm&#8217;s major categories of assets and liabilities as described in Note 2 in the 2019 Form 10-K and Note 4 herein. Further, as permitted by applicable guidance, certain transfers of assets where the Firm&#8217;s only continuing involvement is a derivative are only reported in the following Assets Sold with Retained Exposure table.

Regulatory Capital Framework and Requirements 

For a discussion of the Firm&#8217;s regulatory capital framework, see Note 15 to the financial statements in the 2019 Form 10-K . 

The Firm is required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage-based capital ratios under regulatory capital requirements. A summary of the calculations of regulatory capital and RWA follows. 

Minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital (which includes Tier 2 capital). Capital standards require certain adjustments to, and deductions from, capital for purposes of determining these ratios. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , the Firm&#8217;s ratios for determining regulatory compliance are based on the Advanced Approach and the Standardized Approach rules, respectively. 

In the current year period, the U.S. banking agencies have adopted an interim final rule altering, for purposes of the regulatory capital rules, the required adoption time period for CECL. As of June 30, 2020 , the risk-based and leverage-based capital amounts and ratios, as well as RWA, adjusted average assets and supplementary leverage exposure are calculated excluding the effect of the adoption of CECL based on our election to defer this effect over a five-year transition period in accordance with the interim final rule. 

In addition to the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements, the Firm is subject to the following Common Equity Tier 1 buffers: 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

A greater than 2.5 % capital conservation buffer; 

&#8226; 

The G-SIB capital surcharge, currently at 3 % ; and 

&#8226; 

Up to a 2.5 % CCyB, currently set by U.S. banking agencies at zero .

Required ratios are inclusive of any buffers applicable as of the date presented. Failure to maintain the buffers would result in restrictions on the Firm&#8217;s ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. 

2. 

Adjusted average assets represents the denominator of the Tier 1 leverage ratio and is composed of the average daily balance of consolidated on-balance sheet assets for the quarters ending on the respective balance sheet dates, reduced by disallowed goodwill, intangible assets, investments in covered funds, defined benefit pension plan assets, after-tax gain on sale from assets sold into securitizations, investments in the Firm&#8217;s own capital instruments, certain defined tax assets and other capital deductions. 

3. 

Based on a Federal Reserve interim final rule in effect until March 31, 2021, the Firm&#8217;s SLR and Supplementary leverage exposure as of June 30, 2020 reflect the exclusion of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. 

4. 

Supplementary leverage exposure is the sum of Adjusted average assets used in the Tier 1 leverage ratio and other adjustments, primarily: (i) for derivatives, potential future exposure and the effective notional principal amount of sold credit protection offset by qualifying purchased credit protection; (ii) the counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions; and (iii) the credit equivalent amount for off-balance sheet exposures.

U.S. Bank Subsidiaries&#8217; Regulatory Capital and Capital Ratios 

The OCC establishes capital requirements for the Firm&#8217;s U.S. Bank Subsidiaries and evaluates their compliance with such capital requirements. Regulatory capital requirements for the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are calculated in a similar manner to the Firm&#8217;s regulatory capital requirements, although G-SIB capital surcharge requirements do not apply to the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. 

The OCC&#8217;s regulatory capital framework includes Prompt Corrective Action (&#8220;PCA&#8221;) standards, including &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; PCA standards that are based on specified regulatory capital ratio minimums. For the Firm to remain an FHC, the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must remain well-capitalized in accordance with the OCC&#8217;s PCA standards. In addition, failure by the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements may result in certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries&#8217; and the Firm&#8217;s financial statements. 

At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries&#8217; risk-based capital ratios are based on the Standardized Approach rules. At June 30, 2020 , the risk-based and leverage-based capital amounts and ratios are calculated excluding the effect of the adoption of CECL based on our election to defer this effect over a five-year transition period.

On March 15, 2020, the Financial Services Forum announced that each of its eight member banks, including the Firm, had voluntarily suspended their share repurchase programs. On June 25, 2020, the Federal Reserve published summary results of CCAR and announced that large BHCs, including the Firm, generally will be restricted in making share repurchases during the third quarter of 2020. 

A portion of common stock repurchases was conducted under a sales plan with MUFG, whereby MUFG sold shares of the Firm&#8217;s common stock to the Firm, as part of the Firm&#8217;s Share Repurchase Program. The sales plan is only intended to maintain MUFG&#8217;s ownership percentage below 24.9 % in order to comply with MUFG&#8217;s passivity commitments to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and has no impact on the strategic alliance between MUFG and the Firm, including the joint ventures in Japan.

18 . Income Taxes 

The Firm is under continuous examination by the IRS and other tax authorities in certain countries, such as Japan and the U.K., and in states and localities in which it has significant business operations, such as New York. 

The Firm believes that the resolution of these tax examinations will not have a material effect on the annual financial statements, although a resolution could have a material impact in the income statements and on the effective tax rate for any period in which such resolutions occur. 

&#160; 

June 2020 Form 10-Q 

&#160; 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

(Unaudited) 

The Firm has established a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, and associated interest, if applicable (&#8220;tax liabilities&#8221;), that it believes is adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, the Firm adjusts such tax liabilities only when new information is available or when an event occurs necessitating a change. 

It is reasonably possible that significant changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the next 12 months. At this time, however, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the expected change to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits and the impact on the Firm&#8217;s effective tax rate over the next 12 months.

1. Recurring discrete tax items are related to conversion of employee share-based awards. 

The current quarter and current year period included intermittent net discrete tax costs principally associated with the remeasurement of reserves and interest related to a foreign tax matter. 

The prior year period included intermittent net discrete tax benefits primarily associated with remeasurement of reserves and related interest as a result of new information pertaining to the resolution of multi-jurisdiction tax examinations.
