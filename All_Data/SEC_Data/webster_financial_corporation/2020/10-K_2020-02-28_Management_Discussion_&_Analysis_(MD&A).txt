The non-GAAP financial measures identified in the preceding table provide investors with information useful in understanding the Company's financial performance, performance trends and financial position. These measures are used by management for internal planning and forecasting purposes, as well as by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to compare peer company operating performance. Management believes that the presentation, together with the accompanying reconciliations provides a complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company's business and allows investors to view its performance in a similar manner. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis measures and results. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these measures with other companies that present measures having the same or similar names. 

The following tables reconcile non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures defined by GAAP:

(1) For purposes of yield/rate computation, unrealized gain (loss) balances on available-for-sale securities and senior fixed-rate notes hedges are excluded. 

Net interest income and net interest margin are impacted by the level of interest rates, mix of assets earning and liabilities bearing those interest rates, and the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. These factors are influenced by changes in economic conditions that impact interest rate policy, competitive conditions that impact loan and deposit pricing strategies, as well as the extent of interest lost to non-performing assets. 

Net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets, such as loans and investments, and interest expense on liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, which are used to fund those assets. Net interest income is the Company's largest source of revenue, representing 77.0% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. 

Net interest margin is the ratio of tax-equivalent net interest income to average earning assets for the period. 

Webster manages the risk of changes in interest rates on net interest income and net interest margin through ALCO and through related interest rate risk monitoring and management policies. ALCO meets at least monthly to make decisions on the investment securities and funding portfolios based on the economic outlook, its interest rate expectations, the portfolio risk position, and other factors. 

Four main tools are used for managing interest rate risk: 

&#8226; the size, duration and credit risk of the investment portfolio, 

&#8226; the size and duration of the wholesale funding portfolio, 

&#8226; interest rate contracts, and 

&#8226; the pricing and structure of loans and deposits. 

The federal funds rate target range was 1.50-1.75% at December 31, 2019, as compared to 2.25-2.50% at December 31, 2018 and 1.25-1.50% at December 31, 2017. Refer to the "Asset/Liability Management and Market Risk" section for further discussion of Webster's interest rate risk position. 

Comparison of 2019 to 2018 

Financial Performance 

For the year ended December 31, 2019, net income of $382.7 million increased 6.2% from the year ended December 31, 2018, due to increased net interest income, driven by strong loan growth and stable credit quality across all businesses. Although net interest income increased, net interest margin decreased 5 basis points to 3.55% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 3.60% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Non-interest income improved, led by growth in deposit service fees and mortgage banking activities, while a modest increase in non-interest expense partially offset the growth in revenues. 

Income before income tax expense was $486.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $45.1 million from $441.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. 

Income tax expense was $104.0 million, for an effective tax rate of 21.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $81.2 million, for an effective rate of 18.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2018. 

Net income of $382.7 million and diluted earnings per share of $4.06 for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased from net income of $360.4 million and diluted earnings per share of $3.81 for the year ended December 31, 2018. 

The efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure which quantifies the cost expended to generate a dollar of revenue, was 56.77% for 2019 and 57.75% for 2018. The improvement in the ratio highlights the Company's strong growth in revenues accelerating at a rate greater than the increase in non-interest expenses. 

Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases was 0.21% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 0.16% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Non-performing assets as a percentage of loans, leases, and other real estate owned (OREO) decreased to 0.79% at December 31, 2019 from 0.87% at December 31, 2018 due to growth in loan and lease balances, and also in part from the decrease in non-performing asset balances during the year. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income totaled $955.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $906.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $48.4 million. On a fully tax-equivalent basis, net interest income increased $49.1 million when compared to 2018. 

Net interest margin decreased 5 basis points to 3.55% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 3.60% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in net interest margin is primarily due to increases in rates for interest-bearing liabilities rising at a greater rate than increases in yields for interest-earning assets. 

Average interest-earning assets during 2019 increased $1.8 billion compared to 2018, primarily from loans and leases growth of $1.2 billion. The average yield on interest-earning assets increased 11 basis points to 4.29% during 2019 from 4.18% during 2018, primarily impacted by changes in market interest rates as well as changes in the volume and relative mix of interest-earning assets. Average interest-bearing liabilities during 2019 increased $1.6 billion compared to 2018, primarily from health savings account growth of $0.7 billion and an increase in borrowings of $0.9 billion. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 16 basis points to 0.78% during 2019 compared to 0.62% during 2018, from both the effects of the federal funds rate being increased throughout 2018 and then decreased only in the latter part of 2019, and higher borrowing levels. 

Changes in Net Interest Income 

The following table presents the components of the change in net interest income attributable to changes in rate and volume, and reflects net interest income on a fully tax-equivalent basis:

(1) The change attributable to mix, a combined impact of rate and volume, is included with the change due to rate. 

(2) Securities include: Investment securities, FHLB and FRB stock, and Interest-bearing deposits. 

Average loans and leases for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $1.2 billion compared to the average for the year ended December 31, 2018. The loan and lease portfolio comprised 70.7% of the average interest-earning assets at December 31, 2019 compared to 71.0% at December 31, 2018. The loan and lease portfolio yield increased 14 basis points to 4.83% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 4.69% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in the yield on the average loan and lease portfolio is primarily due to the impact of variable rate loans resetting higher and growth in commercial loans with higher yields. 

Average securities for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $598.8 million compared to the average for the year ended December 31, 2018. Securities comprised 29.2% of the average interest-earning assets at December 31, 2019 compared to 28.9% at December 31, 2018. Securities yield was 2.98% for both the year ended December 31, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2018. 

Average deposits for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $1.3 billion compared to the average for the year ended December 31, 2018, comprised of $115.2 million in non-interest-bearing deposits and $1.2 billion in interest-bearing deposits. The increase is primarily due to growth in health savings accounts and time deposits. The average cost of deposits increased 14 basis points to 0.56% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 0.42% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is due to selected deposit product rate increases and a change in mix into certificate of deposit accounts. Higher cost time deposits increased to 17.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 16.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018, as a percentage of total interest-bearing deposits. 

Average borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $328.3 million compared to the average for the year ended December 31, 2018. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings increased $223.7 million, while FHLB advances decreased $137.7 million. The Company completed an underwritten public offering of $300 million senior fixed-rate notes on March 25, 2019, which resulted in an increase of $242.2 million in average long-term debt. See "Sources of Funds and Liquidity" for further discussion of the notes issued. The average cost of borrowings increased 15 basis points to 2.62% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 2.47% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is largely a result of the senior notes and changes in the federal funds rate. 

Provision for Loan and Lease Losses 

The provision for loan and lease losses was $37.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which decreased $4.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This level of provision for loan and lease losses is primarily due to loan growth, mix and stable asset quality. Refer to the sections captioned "Loans and Leases" through "Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Methodology," contained elsewhere in this report for further details. 

Non-Interest Income 

##TABLE_START &#160; Years ended December 31, Increase (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) 2019 2018 Amount Percent Deposit service fees $ 168,022 &#160; $ 162,183 &#160; $ 5,839 &#160; 3.6 % Loan and lease related fees 31,327 &#160; 32,025 &#160; (698) &#160; (2.2) &#160; Wealth and investment services 32,932 &#160; 32,843 &#160; 89 &#160; 0.3 &#160; Mortgage banking activities 6,115 &#160; 4,424 &#160; 1,691 &#160; 38.2 &#160; Increase in cash surrender value of life insurance policies 14,612 &#160; 14,614 &#160; (2) &#160; &#8212; &#160; Gain on sale of investment securities, net 29 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 29 &#160; 100.0 &#160; Other income 32,278 &#160; 36,479 &#160; (4,201) &#160; (11.5) &#160; Total non-interest income $ 285,315 &#160; $ 282,568 &#160; $ 2,747 &#160; 1.0 % ##TABLE_END

Total non-interest income was $285.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $2.7 million compared to $282.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to higher deposit service fees and mortgage banking activities, partially offset by lower other income. 

Deposit service fees totaled $168.0 million for 2019 compared to $162.2 million for 2018. The increase was a result of higher checking account service charges and check card interchange fees attributable to health savings account growth. 

Mortgage banking activities totaled $6.1 million for 2019 compared to $4.4 million for 2018. The increase was primarily the result of higher originations for sale and higher rate lock activity due to lower rates. 

Other income totaled $32.3 million for 2019 compared to $36.5 million for 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a gain of $4.6 million on the sale of banking centers in 2018. Bank owned life insurance gains were substantially offset by a write-down in one equity method investment in 2019 compared to 2018. 

Non-Interest Expense

Total non-interest expense was $716.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $10.3 million compared to $705.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to higher compensation and benefits, technology and equipment, and other expense, partially offset by lower deposit insurance. 

Compensation and benefits totaled $395.4 million for 2019 compared to $381.5 million for 2018. The increase was due to strategic hires, annual merit increases, and other benefit costs. 

Technology and equipment totaled $105.3 million for 2019 compared to $97.9 million for 2018. The increase was due to higher service contracts to support strategic and infrastructure projects for continued investment in the businesses. 

Other expense totaled $98.6 million for 2019 compared to $91.0 million for 2018. The increase is due to a $1.7 million business optimization expense in 2019, as well as legal settlements and sales costs. 

Deposit insurance totaled $18.0 million for 2019 compared to $34.7 million for 2018. The decrease reflects the benefit of the temporary FDIC deposit insurance fund surcharge ending in 2018 and a $10.0 million charge in 2018 related to additional FDIC premiums. 

Income Taxes 

Webster recognized income tax expense of $104.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $81.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and the effective tax rates were 21.4% and 18.4%, respectively. The increase in tax expense reflects both the higher level of pre-tax income and a lower level of net discrete tax benefits in 2019, and the increase in the effective tax rate principally reflects the lower level of net discrete tax benefits recognized in 2019 compared to 2018, which included tax planning benefits related to the Tax Act. 

The Company's gross DTAs applicable to its net operating loss and credit carryforwards of $69.8 million, or $31.6 million net of the $38.2 related valuation allowance, pertain to state and local tax (SALT). The valuation allowance reflects management's estimates of the Company's taxable income projected through the year 2032 and includes assumptions about the content and apportionment of its income among its legal entities for SALT purposes. Those estimates and assumptions reflect the Company's plans and strategies for growth from its ordinary and recurring operations over the near term by legal entity, as well as a longer-term 4% growth rate assumption. Management believes the $31.6 million net DTAs are more likely than not realizable and their estimates form a reasonable basis for this determination. 

For additional information on Webster's income taxes, including its DTAs, refer to Note 9: Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report. 

Segment Reporting 

Webster&#8217;s operations are organized into three reportable segments that represent its primary businesses - Commercial Banking, HSA Bank, and Community Banking. These segments reflect how executive management responsibilities are assigned, the type of customer served, how products and services are provided, and how discrete financial information is currently evaluated. Certain Corporate Treasury activities, along with the amounts required to reconcile profitability metrics to amounts reported in accordance with GAAP, are included in the Corporate and Reconciling category. Refer to Note 20: Segment Reporting in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report for a reconciliation of segment information to amounts reported in accordance with GAAP and for a description of segment reporting methodology. 

Commercial Banking is comprised of Commercial Banking and Private Banking operating segments. 

Commercial Banking provides commercial and industrial lending and leasing, commercial real estate lending, and treasury and payment solutions. Specifically, Webster Bank deploys lending through middle market, commercial real estate, equipment financing, asset-based lending and specialty lending units. These groups utilize a relationship approach model throughout their footprint when providing lending, deposit, and cash management services to middle market companies. In addition, Commercial Banking serves as a referral source to the other lines of business. 

Private Banking provides asset management, financial planning services, trust services, loan products, and deposit products for high net worth clients, not-for-profit organizations, and business clients. These client relationships generate fee revenue on assets under management or administration, while a majority of the relationships also include lending and, or, deposit accounts which generates net interest income and other ancillary fees. 

HSA Bank offers comprehensive consumer directed healthcare solutions that include, health savings accounts, health reimbursement accounts, flexible spending accounts, and other financial solutions. Health savings accounts are used in conjunction with high deductible health plans in order to facilitate tax advantages for account holders with respect to health care spending and savings, in accordance with applicable laws. Health savings accounts are offered through employers for the benefit of their employees or directly to individual consumers and are distributed nationwide directly as well as through national and regional insurance carriers, benefit consultants and financial advisors. 

HSA Bank deposits provide long duration low-cost funding that is used to minimize the Company&#8217;s use of wholesale funding in support of the Company&#8217;s loan growth. In addition, non-interest revenue is generated predominantly through service fees and interchange income. 

Community Banking is comprised of Personal Banking and Business Banking operating segments. 

Through a distribution network, consisting of 157 banking centers and 309 ATMs, a customer care center, and a full range of web and mobile-based banking services, it serves consumer and business customers primarily throughout southern New England and into Westchester County, New York. 

Personal Banking offers consumer deposit and fee-based services, residential mortgages, home equity lines, or loans, unsecured consumer loans, and credit card products. In addition, investment and securities-related services, including brokerage and investment advice are offered through a strategic partnership with LPL, a broker dealer registered with the SEC, a registered investment advisor under federal and applicable state laws, a member of the FINRA, and a member of the SIPC.

Comparison of 2019 to 2018 

Pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue decreased $8.3 million in 2019 compared to 2018. Net interest income decreased $4.1 million, primarily due to decline in interest rate spreads in loans and deposits portfolio stemming from lower interest rate environment. Decrease in rate spreads was partially offset by growth in balances for loan and deposit portfolios. Non-interest income decreased $0.4 million, as increased income from mortgage banking activities and increased fees from loan servicing and interest rate hedging activities were offset by a $4.6 million gain from the sale of six banking centers recorded in the prior year. Non-interest expense increased $3.8 million, primarily due to higher compensation and benefits and continued investments in technology, partially offset by lower marketing-related costs and occupancy expenses. 

The provision for loan and lease losses increased by $2.8 million in large part due to loan growth. 

Comparison of 2018 to 2017 

Pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue increased $12.0 million in 2018 compared to 2017. Net interest income increased $21.2 million, primarily due to growth in deposit balances, as well as improved interest spreads on deposits. Non-interest income increased $2.3 million, due to a gain on the sale of six banking centers, coupled with growth in deposit and loan fees. These were partially offset by decreased fee income from mortgage banking activities as a result of lower mortgage production. Non-interest expense increased $11.5 million, primarily due to higher compensation related expenses and continued investments in technology. 

The provision for loan and lease losses increased by $2.8 million primarily due to changes in loan balances and asset quality.

Loan portfolio balances increased $509.2 million at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by growth in residential mortgage balances and business banking balances. Mortgage balances growth included a $242.2 million portfolio purchase in the first quarter. Growth in business banking balances also contributed. This overall growth was partially offset by continued net attrition in home equity balances as loan principal paydowns exceeded new loan production. Loan portfolio balances decreased $172.0 million at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. The decrease is related to net attrition in the residential mortgage and home equity balances as loan principal paydowns exceeded new loan production. These balance declines were partially offset by growth in the business banking portfolio. 

Loan originations were $2.2 billion, $1.3 billion, and $1.9 billion for the years ended 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase of $854.6 million in originations for the year ended December 31, 2019 is driven by increased production in residential mortgages, home equity, and business banking products. 

Deposits increased $671.3 million at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018, resulting from growth in savings, transaction, and time deposit products. Deposits increased $380.3 million at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, due to the Boston expansion and growth in time deposit balances. 

Additionally, at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, Webster Bank's investment services division held $3.7 billion, $3.4 billion, and $3.4 billion, respectively, of assets under administration through its strategic partnership with LPL.

&#8226; loans and leases of $19.8 billion, net of ALLL of $209.1 million, at December 31, 2019 increased $1.6 billion compared to loans and leases of $18.3 billion, net of ALLL of $212.4 million, at December 31, 2018.

Non-interest-bearing deposits increased 6.8%, and interest-bearing deposits increased 6.7% during the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to growth in health savings accounts balances. 

At December 31, 2019, total shareholders' equity was $3.2 billion compared to $2.9 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $321.3 million or, 11.1%. Changes in shareholders' equity for the year ended December 31, 2019 include:

&#8226; a reduction of $19.6 million for purchases of treasury stock, at cost.

Investment Securities 

Webster Bank's investment securities are managed within regulatory guidelines and corporate policy, which include limitations on aspects such as concentrations in and type of investments as well as minimum risk ratings per type of security. The OCC may establish additional individual limits on a certain type of investment if the concentration in such investment presents a safety and soundness concern. In addition to Webster Bank, the Holding Company also may directly hold investment securities from time-to-time. At December 31, 2019, the Company had no investments in obligations of individual states, counties, or municipalities which exceeded 10% of consolidated shareholders&#8217; equity. 

Webster maintains, through its Corporate Treasury function, investment securities that are primarily used to provide a source of liquidity for operating needs, to generate interest income, and as a means to manage interest-rate risk. Investment securities are classified into two major categories, available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. Available-for-sale currently consists of U.S. Treasury Bills, agency collateralized mortgage obligations (Agency CMO), agency mortgage-backed securities (Agency MBS), agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (Agency CMBS), non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), CLO, and corporate debt. Held-to-maturity currently consists of Agency CMO, Agency MBS, Agency CMBS, municipal bonds and notes, and CMBS. 

The carrying value of investment securities totaled $8.2 billion at December 31, 2019 and $7.2 billion at December 31, 2018. 

Available-for-sale investment securities increased by $27.1 million, primarily due to increases in market value more than offsetting portfolio activity. The tax-equivalent yield in the portfolio was 2.94% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2.89% for the year ended December 31, 2018. 

Held-to-maturity investment securities increased by $968.5 million, primarily due to principal purchase activity for Agency MBS and Agency CMBS more than offsetting principal paydowns throughout the portfolio. The tax-equivalent yield in the portfolio was 2.98% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2.96% for the year ended December 31, 2018. 

These investment securities were evaluated by management and were determined not to be other-than-temporarily impaired, at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The Company does not have the intent to sell these investment securities, and it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell these securities before the recovery of their cost basis. The total unrealized loss was $30.3 million at December 31, 2019. 

The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury rate decreased to 1.92% on December 31, 2019 from 2.69% on December 31, 2018.

Asset-based loans increased $78.1 million from December 31, 2018, reflective of $469.1 million in originations and line usage during the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by loan payments. 

Total commercial real estate loans were $6.0 billion at December 31, 2019, a net increase of $1.0 billion from December 31, 2018 as a result of originations of $1.8 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by loan payments. 

Equipment financing loans and leases were $533.0 million at December 31, 2019, a net increase of $28.7 million from December 31, 2018, primarily the result of increased originations during the year ended December 31, 2019. 

Total residential loans were $4.9 billion at December 31, 2019, a net increase of $554.6 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to originations of $1.0 billion, partially offset by loan repayments during the year ended December 31, 2019. 

Total consumer loans were $2.2 billion at December 31, 2019, a net decrease of $163.3 million from December 31, 2018, primarily the result of net paydowns in the equity line and loan products partially offset by originations of $575.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.

Credit Policies and Procedures 

Webster Bank has credit policies and procedures in place designed to support lending activity within an acceptable level of risk. Management reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis. To assist management with its review, reports related to loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies, non-performing loans, and potential problem loans are generated by loan reporting systems. 

Commercial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower&#8217;s ability to operate and service its debt. Assessment of management is a critical element of the underwriting process and credit decision. Once it is determined that the borrower&#8217;s management possesses sound ethics and solid business acumen, current and projected cash flows are examined to determine the ability of the borrower to repay obligations as agreed. Commercial and industrial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The cash flows of borrowers, however, may not be as expected, and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most commercial and industrial loans are secured by the assets being financed and may incorporate personal guarantees of the principals. 

Commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and industrial loans, in addition to those specific to real estate loans. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Repayment of these loans is largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan, the market in which the property is located, and the tenants of the property securing the loan. The properties securing the Company&#8217;s commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location, which reduces the Company's exposure to adverse economic events that may affect a particular market. Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral, geography, and risk grade criteria. Commercial real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. Management periodically utilizes third-party experts to provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting its commercial real estate loan portfolio. 

Consumer loans are subject to policies and procedures developed to manage the risk characteristics of the portfolio. Policies and procedures, coupled with relatively small individual loan amounts and predominately collateralized structures, spread across many different borrowers, minimize risk. Trend and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis, with policies and procedures modified, or developed, as needed. Underwriting factors for mortgage and home equity loans include the borrower&#8217;s Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score, the loan amount relative to property value, and the borrower&#8217;s debt to income level and are also influenced by regulatory requirements. Additionally, Webster Bank originates both qualified mortgage and non-qualified mortgage loans as defined by applicable CFPB rules. 

Asset Quality 

Management maintains asset quality within established risk tolerance levels through its underwriting standards, servicing, and management of loan and lease performance. Loans and leases, particularly where a heightened risk of loss has been identified, are regularly monitored to mitigate further deterioration which could potentially impact key measures of asset quality in future periods. Past due loans and leases, non-performing assets, and credit loss levels are considered to be key measures of asset quality. 

The following table provides key asset quality ratios:

Potential Problem Loans and Leases 

Potential problem loans and leases are defined by management as certain loans and leases that, for: 

&#8226; commercial, commercial real estate, and equipment financing are performing loans and leases classified as Substandard and have a well-defined weakness that could jeopardize the full repayment of the debt; and 

&#8226; residential and consumer are performing loans 60-89 days past due and accruing. 

Potential problem loans and leases exclude loans and leases past due 90 days or more and accruing, non-accrual loans and leases, and troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). 

Management monitors potential problem loans and leases due to a higher degree of risk associated with them. The current expectation of probable losses is included in the ALLL; however, management cannot predict whether these potential problem loans and leases ultimately will become non-performing or result in a loss. The Company had potential problem loans and leases of $216.7 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $226.9 million at December 31, 2018. 

Past Due Loans and Leases

Impaired Loans and Leases 

Loans are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan agreement, including scheduled principal and interest payments. Impairment is evaluated on a pooled basis for smaller-balance loans of a similar nature. Consumer and residential loans for which the borrower has been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy are considered collateral dependent impaired loans at the date of discharge. Commercial, commercial real estate, and equipment financing loans and leases over a specific dollar amount, risk rated substandard or worse and non-accruing are evaluated individually for impairment. All TDRs or loans that have had a partial charge-off are evaluated individually for impairment, as well. Impairment may be evaluated at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the original interest rate of the loan or at the fair value of collateral, less estimated selling costs. To the extent that an impaired loan or lease balance is collateral dependent, the Company determines the fair value of the collateral. 

For residential and consumer collateral dependent loans, a third-party appraisal is obtained upon loan default. Fair value of the collateral for residential and consumer collateral dependent loans is reevaluated every six months, by either a new appraisal or other internal valuation methods. Fair value is also reassessed, with any excess amount charged off, for consumer loans that reach 180 days past due per Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council guidelines. 

For commercial, commercial real estate, and equipment financing collateral dependent loans and leases, Webster's impairment process requires the Company to determine the fair value of the collateral by obtaining a third-party appraisal or asset valuation, an interim valuation analysis, blue book reference, or other internal methods. Fair value of the collateral for commercial loans is reevaluated quarterly. Whenever the Company has a third-party real estate appraisal performed by independent licensed appraisers, a licensed in-house appraisal officer or qualified individual reviews these appraisals for compliance with the Financial Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act and the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice. 

A fair value shortfall is recorded as an impairment reserve against the ALLL. Subsequent to an appraisal or other fair value estimate, should reliable information come to management's attention that the value has declined further, additional impairment may be recorded to reflect the particular situation, thereby increasing the ALLL. Any impaired loan for which no specific valuation allowance was necessary at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 is the result of either sufficient cash flow or sufficient collateral coverage of the book balance. 

At December 31, 2019, there were 1,423 impaired loans and leases with a recorded investment balance of $256.4 million, which included loans and leases of $125.8 million with an impairment allowance of $14.2 million, compared to 1,501 impaired loans and leases with a recorded investment balance of $259.3 million, which included loans and leases of $93.1 million, with an impairment allowance of $15.4 million at December 31, 2018. The reduction of $1.1 million in impairment allowance reflects management's current assessment on the resolution of these credits based on collateral considerations, guarantees, or expected future cash flows of the impaired loans. 

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

A modified loan is considered a TDR when two conditions are met: (i) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties; and (ii) the modification constitutes a concession. Modified terms are dependent upon the financial position and needs of the individual borrower. The Company considers all aspects of the restructuring in determining whether a concession has been granted, including the debtor's ability to access market rate funds. In general, a concession exists when the modified terms of the loan are more attractive to the borrower than standard market terms. The most common types of modifications include covenant modifications, forbearance, and/or other concessions. If the buyer does not perform in accordance with the modified terms, the loan is reevaluated to determine the most appropriate course of action, which may include foreclosure. Loans for which the borrower has been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy are considered collateral dependent TDRs and thus, impaired at the date of discharge and charged down to the fair value of collateral less cost to sell. 

The Company&#8217;s policy is to place each consumer loan TDR, except those that were performing prior to TDR status, on non-accrual status for a minimum period of six months. Commercial TDRs are evaluated on a case-by-case basis for determination of whether or not to place them on non-accrual status. Loans qualify for return to accrual status once they have demonstrated performance with the restructured terms of the loan agreement for a minimum of six months. Initially, all TDRs are reported as impaired. Generally, TDRs are classified as impaired loans and reported as TDR for the remaining life of the loan. Impaired and TDR classification may be removed if the borrower demonstrates compliance with the modified terms for a minimum of six months and through one fiscal year-end, and the restructuring agreement specifies a market rate of interest equal to that which would be provided to a borrower with similar credit at the time of restructuring. In the limited circumstance that a loan is removed from TDR classification, it is the Company&#8217;s policy to continue to base its measure of loan impairment on the contractual terms specified by the loan agreement. 

The following tables provide information for TDRs:

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Methodology 

The Company's policy for ALLL methodology is considered a critical accounting policy. Executive management reviews and advises on the adequacy of the ALLL reserve which is maintained on a quarterly basis at a level management deems sufficient to cover probable losses inherent within the loan and lease portfolios. 

The process for estimating probable losses is based on predictive models that measure the current risk profile of the loan portfolio and combines the measurement with other quantitative and qualitative factors, that together with an impairment reserve determines the overall reserve requirement. Management applies significant judgments and assumptions that influence the loss estimate and ALLL balance. Quantitative and qualitative considerations by management include factors such as the nature and volume of portfolio growth, national and regional economic conditions and trends, other internal performance metrics, and assumptions as to how each of these factors is expected to impact near term loss trends. While actual future conditions and losses realized may vary significantly from present judgments and assumptions, management believes the ALLL is adequate as of December 31, 2019. 

The Company&#8217;s methodology for assessing an appropriate level for the ALLL includes three key elements: 

&#8226; Impaired loans and leases are analyzed either on an individual or pooled basis and assessed for a specific reserve which is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate of the loan or lease, except that as a practical expedient impairment may be measured based on a loan or lease's observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral, if the loan or lease is collateral dependent. A loan or lease is collateral dependent if the repayment of the loan or lease is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral. Management considers the pertinent facts and circumstances for each impaired loan or lease when selecting an appropriate method to measure impairment then reviews and evaluates each selection to ensure its continued appropriateness. 

&#8226; Loans and leases that are not considered impaired and have similar risk characteristics are segmented into homogeneous pools and modeled using quantitative methods to determine a loss estimate. Loss estimates incorporate a loss emergence period (LEP) model which represents the period of time between a loss event first occurring and the confirming event of its charge-off. A LEP is determined for each loan type based on the Company's historical performance experience and is reassessed at least annually. Commercial portfolios utilize an expected loss methodology that is based on probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) models. PD and LGD models generally are derived using the Company's portfolio specific data over a defined look back period and are refreshed annually. The PD and LGD models based on borrower and facility risk ratings assigned to each loan are updated throughout the year should the financial condition of a borrower change. Residential and consumer portfolios use roll rate models to estimate probable inherent losses. The models calculate the roll rate at which loans migrate from one delinquency category to the next worse delinquency category and eventually to loss. The roll rate models use the recent delinquency and loss experience based upon a specified look back period and are segmented based on product type and common risk characteristics. The models also incorporate an estimated pay down factor by product type. The roll rate calculations are performed quarterly and are done consistently from period to period. The portfolio performance and assumptions utilized are regularly reviewed, while the roll rate model is evaluated on an annual basis. 

&#8226; Management also considers qualitative factors, consistent with inter-agency regulatory guidance, that are not explicitly factored in the quantitative models but that can have an incremental or regressive impact on losses incurred in the current loan and lease portfolio. 

At December 31, 2019, the ALLL was $209.1 million compared to $212.4 million at December 31, 2018. The decrease of $3.3 million in the reserve at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 is primarily due to lower reserves on impaired loans in the residential and home-equity loan portfolios. The ALLL reserve remains adequate to cover inherent losses in the loan and lease portfolios. ALLL as a percentage of loans and leases, also known as the reserve coverage, decreased to 1.04% at December 31, 2019 as compared to 1.15% at December 31, 2018, and reflects an updated assessment of inherent losses and impaired reserves conducted throughout the year. ALLL as a percentage of non-performing loans and leases increased to 138.56% at December 31, 2019 from 137.22% at December 31, 2018.

(1) Percentage represents allocated ALLL to total loans and leases within the comparable category. However, the allocation of a portion of the allowance to one category of loans and leases does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories. 

The ALLL reserve allocated to the commercial portfolio at December 31, 2019 decreased $7.0 million compared to December 31, 2018. The year-over-year decrease is primarily attributable to improved net rating migration. 

The ALLL reserve allocated to the commercial real estate portfolio at December 31, 2019 increased $5.1 million compared to December 31, 2018. The year-over-year increase is primarily attributable to loan growth of $1.0 billion, partially offset by improved net rating migration. 

The ALLL reserve allocated to the equipment financing portfolio at December 31, 2019 decreased $0.5 million compared to December 31, 2018. The year-over-year decrease is primarily attributable to improved net rating migration. 

The ALLL reserve allocated to the residential loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 increased $1.3 million compared to December 31, 2018. The year-over-year increase is primarily attributable to higher loss rates, partially offset by a decrease in TDR loans of $13.4 million. 

The ALLL reserve allocated to the consumer portfolio at December 31, 2019 decreased $2.2 million compared to December 31, 2018. The year-over-year decrease is primarily attributable to improved credit quality and a decrease in the loan portfolio balance.

Net charge-offs for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $41.1 million and $29.6 million, respectively. Net charge-offs increased by $11.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net charge-off activity is primarily due to a large commercial loan charge-off.

Reserve for Unfunded Credit Commitments 

A reserve for unfunded credit commitments provides for probable losses inherent with funding the unused portion of legal commitments to lend. Reserve calculation factors are consistent with the ALLL methodology for funded loans using the PD, LGD, and LEP applied to the underlying borrower risk and facility grades, and a draw down factor applied to utilization rates. 

The following tables provide detail of activity in the reserve for unfunded credit commitments:

Sources of Funds and Liquidity 

Sources of Funds. The primary source of Webster Bank&#8217;s cash flows for use in lending and meeting its general operational needs is deposits. Operating activities, such as loan and mortgage-backed securities repayments, and other investment securities sale proceeds and maturities also provide cash flows. While scheduled loan and investment security repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, loan and investment security prepayments and deposit inflows are influenced by prevailing interest rates and local economic conditions and are inherently uncertain. Additional sources of funds are provided by FHLB advances or other borrowings. 

Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank Stock. Webster Bank is a member of the FHLB System, which consists of eleven district Federal Home Loan Banks, each subject to the supervision and regulation of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. An activity-based capital stock investment in the FHLB of Boston is required in order for Webster Bank to access advances and other extensions of credit for sources of funds and liquidity purposes. The FHLB capital stock investment is restricted in that there is no market for it, and it can only be redeemed by the FHLB. Webster Bank held FHLB Boston capital stock of $89.3 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $98.6 million at December 31, 2018 for its membership and for outstanding advances and other extensions of credit. Webster Bank received $4.0 million in dividends from the FHLB Boston during 2019. 

Additionally, Webster Bank is required to hold FRB of Boston stock equal to 6% of its capital and surplus of which 50% is paid. The remaining 50% is subject to call when deemed necessary by the Federal Reserve System. The FRB capital stock investment is restricted in that there is no market for it, and it can only be redeemed by the FRB. Webster Bank held $59.8 million and $50.7 million of FRB of Boston capital stock at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Webster Bank received $1.0 million in dividends from the FRB of Boston during 2019. 

Deposits. Webster Bank offers a wide variety of deposit products for checking and savings (including: ATM and debit card use, direct deposit, ACH payments, combined statements, mobile banking services, internet-based banking, bank by mail, as well as overdraft protection via line of credit or transfer from another deposit account) designed to meet the transactional, savings, and investment needs for both consumer and business customers throughout its primary market area. Webster Bank manages the flow of funds in its deposit accounts and provides a variety of accounts and rates consistent with FDIC regulations. Webster Bank&#8217;s Retail Pricing Committee and its Commercial and Institutional Liability Pricing Committee meet regularly to determine pricing and marketing initiatives. 

Total deposits were $23.3 billion, $21.9 billion, and $21.0 billion at December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The trending increase is primarily due to health savings accounts growth. Time deposits that exceed the FDIC limit, presently $250 thousand, represent approximately 2.8%, 2.5%, and 2.7%, of total deposits at December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. For additional information related to period-end balances and rates, refer to Note 10: Deposits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report.

Total average deposits increased $1.3 billion, or 6.0%, in 2019 compared to 2018 and increased $1.1 billion, or 5.3%, in 2018 compared to 2017. The increases were driven by continued growth in health savings account deposits and time deposits. 

The following table presents time deposits with a denomination of $100,000 or more at December 31, 2019 by maturity periods: 

##TABLE_START (In thousands) Due within 3 months $ 750,372 &#160; Due after 3 months and within 6 months 307,748 &#160; Due after 6 months and within 12 months 354,561 &#160; Due after 12 months 221,994 &#160; Time deposits with a denomination of $100 thousand or more $ 1,634,675 &#160; ##TABLE_END

Borrowings. Borrowings primarily consist of FHLB advances which are utilized as a source of funding for liquidity and interest rate risk management purposes. At December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, FHLB advances totaled $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. Webster Bank had additional borrowing capacity from the FHLB of approximately $2.9 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Webster Bank also had additional borrowing capacity from the FRB of $0.9 billion and $0.6 billion at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. 

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase, whereby securities are delivered to counterparties under an agreement to repurchase the securities at a fixed price in the future, to a lesser extent, are also utilized as a source of funding. Unpledged investment securities of $5.5 billion at December 31, 2019 could have been used for collateral on borrowings such as repurchase agreements or, alternatively, to increase borrowing capacity by approximately $5.0 billion with the FHLB or approximately $5.2 billion with the FRB. In addition, Webster Bank may utilize term and overnight Fed funds to meet short-term borrowing needs. 

Long-term debt consists of senior fixed-rate notes maturing in 2024 and 2029, and junior subordinated notes maturing in 2033, and totaled $0.5 billion and $0.2 billion at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The Company completed an underwritten public offering of $300 million senior fixed-rate notes on March 25, 2019, of which it invested the net proceeds of $296 million in Webster Bank as permanent capital to be used for working capital needs and other general purposes. The notes carry a 4.10% coupon rate and mature on March 29, 2029. During 2019, the Company initiated a fair value hedging relationship for the notes to swap the fixed interest rate to a variable rate. As a result, the effective interest rate was 3.40% at December 31, 2019. 

Total borrowed funds were $3.5 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.5 billion, and represented 11.6%, 9.5% and 9.6% of total assets at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in 2019 compared to 2018 is due to loan and securities growth exceeding deposit growth. For additional information related to period-end balances and rates, refer to Note 11: Borrowings in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report.

Total average borrowings increased $328.3 million, or 14.0%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in 2019 compared to 2018 was due to the issuance of $300 million of senior fixed-rate notes in March 2019 and a related $17 million basis adjustment reflecting changes in the benchmark rate. Total average borrowings decreased $516.3 million, or 18.0%, in 2018 compared to 2017. The decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 was the result of deposits growing faster than loans which allowed for a lower usage of FHLB advances. Average borrowings represented 9.2%, 8.7%, and 10.9% of average total assets for December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

The Company also has the following obligations which have been excluded from the above table: 

&#8226; unfunded commitments remaining for particular investments in private equity funds of $42.3 million, for which neither the payment timing, nor eventual obligation is certain; 

&#8226; credit related financial instruments with contractual amounts totaling $6.4 billion, of which many of these commitments are expected to expire unused or only partially used, and therefore, the total amount of these commitments does not necessarily reflect future cash payments; and 

&#8226; liabilities for uncertain tax positions totaling $5.5 million, for which uncertainty exists regarding the amount that may ultimately be paid, as well as the timing of any such payment. 

Liquidity. Webster meets its cash flow requirements at an efficient cost under various operating environments through proactive liquidity management at both the Holding Company and Webster Bank. Liquidity comes from a variety of cash flow sources such as operating activities, including principal and interest payments on loans and investments; financing activities, including unpledged securities which can be sold or utilized to secure funding; and new deposits. Webster is committed to maintaining a strong, increasing base of core deposits, consisting of demand, checking, savings, health savings, and money market accounts, to support growth in its loan and lease portfolio. Liquidity is reviewed and managed in order to maintain stable, cost effective funding to promote overall balance sheet strength. Net cash provided by operating activities was $303.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $469.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The most significant impact was due to derivatives activity. 

Holding Company Liquidity. The primary source of liquidity at the Holding Company is dividends from Webster Bank. Webster Bank paid $360 million in dividends to the Holding Company during the year ended December 31, 2019. To a lesser extent, investment income, net proceeds from investment sales, borrowings, and public offerings may provide additional liquidity. The main uses of liquidity are the payment of principal and interest to holders of senior notes and junior subordinated debt, the payment of dividends to preferred and common shareholders, repurchases of its common stock, and purchases of investment securities. There are certain restrictions on the payment of dividends by Webster Bank to the Holding Company, which are described in the section captioned "Supervision and Regulation" in Item 1 contained elsewhere in this report. At December 31, 2019, there was $302.8 million of retained earnings available for the payment of dividends by Webster Bank to the Holding Company. 

The Company has a common stock repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors, with $200.0 million of remaining repurchase authority at December 31, 2019. In addition, Webster periodically acquires common shares outside of the repurchase program related to stock compensation plan activity. The Company records the purchase of shares of common stock at cost based on the settlement date for these transactions. During the year ended December 31, 2019, a total of 346,361 shares of common stock were repurchased at a cost of approximately $19.6 million, of which 227,199 shares were purchased under the common stock repurchase program at a cost of approximately $13.0 million, and 119,162 shares were purchased at market prices for a cost of approximately $6.6 million relating to stock compensation plan activity. 

Webster Bank Liquidity. Webster Bank's primary source of funding is core deposits. The primary use of this funding is for loan portfolio growth. Including time deposits, Webster Bank had a loan to total deposit ratio of 85.9% and 84.5% at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. 

Webster Bank is required by OCC regulations to maintain liquidity sufficient to ensure safe and sound operations. Whether liquidity is adequate, as assessed by the OCC, depends on such factors as the overall asset/liability structure, market conditions, competition, and the nature of the institution&#8217;s deposit and loan customers. Webster Bank exceeded all regulatory liquidity requirements as of December 31, 2019. Webster Bank's latest OCC CRA rating was Outstanding. The Company has a detailed liquidity contingency plan designed to respond to liquidity concerns in a prompt and comprehensive manner. The plan is designed to provide early detection of potential problems, and details specific actions required to address liquidity stress scenarios. 

Applicable OCC regulations require Webster Bank, as a commercial bank, to satisfy certain minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements. As an OCC regulated commercial institution, it is also subject to minimum tangible capital requirements. As of December 31, 2019, Webster Bank was in compliance with all applicable capital requirements and exceeded the FDIC requirements for a well-capitalized institution. Refer to Note 14: Regulatory Matters in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report for a further discussion of regulatory requirements applicable to Webster Financial Corporation and Webster Bank. 

The liquidity position of the Company is continuously monitored, and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate. Management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s liquidity, capital resources, or operations. In addition, management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity, which, if implemented, would have a material adverse effect on the Company. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Webster engages in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with GAAP, are not recorded in the financial statements or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts. Such transactions are utilized in the normal course of business, for general corporate purposes or for customer financing needs. Corporate purpose transactions are structured to manage credit, interest rate, and liquidity risks, or to optimize capital. Customer transactions are structured to manage their funding requirements or facilitate certain trade arrangements. These transactions give rise to, in varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate, and liquidity risk. For the year ended December 31, 2019, Webster did not engage in any off-balance sheet transactions that would have a material effect on its financial condition. 

Asset/Liability Management and Market Risk 

An effective asset/liability management process must balance the risks and rewards from both short and long-term interest rate risks in determining management strategy and action. To facilitate and manage this process, interest rate sensitivity is monitored on an ongoing basis by ALCO. The primary goal of ALCO is to manage interest rate risk to maximize net income and net economic value over time in changing interest rate environments subject to Board approved risk limits. The Board sets policy limits for earnings at risk for parallel ramps in interest rates over twelve months of plus and minus 100, 200, and 300 basis points, as well as interest rate curve twist shocks of plus and minus 50 and 100 basis points. Economic value, or equity at risk, limits are set for parallel shocks in interest rates of plus and minus 100, 200, and 300 basis points. 

Due to the federal funds rate target range set at 1.50-1.75% as of December 31, 2019, the declining interest rate scenarios of minus 200 basis points, or more, for both earnings at risk and equity at risk were not run per ALCO policy. Instead, scenarios were run with short and long term rates declining to zero, but not below. In 2019, ALCO implemented a balance sheet repositioning strategy with the goal of reducing asset sensitivity to falling rates which included the purchase of interest rate floors. ALCO also regularly reviews earnings at risk scenarios for non-parallel changes in rates, as well as longer-term scenarios of up to four years in the future. 

Management measures interest rate risk using simulation analysis to calculate earnings and equity at risk. These risk measures are quantified using simulation software. Key assumptions relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads, prepayment speeds, and the run-off of deposits. From such simulations, interest rate risk is quantified, and appropriate strategies are formulated and implemented. 

Earnings at risk is defined as the change in earnings, excluding provision for loan and lease losses and income tax expense, due to changes in interest rates. Interest rates are assumed to change up or down in a parallel fashion, and earnings results are compared to a flat rate scenario as a base. The flat rate scenario holds the end of the period yield curve constant over the twelve month forecast horizon. Earnings simulation analysis incorporates assumptions about balance sheet changes such as asset and liability growth and mix changes and loan and deposit pricing. It is a measure of short-term interest rate risk. 

Equity at risk is defined as the change in the net economic value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates compared to a base net economic value. Equity at risk analyzes sensitivity in the present value of cash flows over the expected life of existing assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts. It is a measure of the long-term interest rate risk to future earnings streams embedded in the current balance sheet. 

Asset sensitivity is defined as earnings or net economic value increasing compared to a base scenario when interest rates rise and decreasing when interest rates fall. In other words, assets are more sensitive to changing interest rates than liabilities and, therefore, re-price faster. Likewise, liability sensitivity is defined as earnings or net economic value decreasing compared to a base scenario when interest rates rise and increasing when interest rates fall. 

Key assumptions underlying the present value of cash flows include the behavior of interest rates and spreads, asset prepayment speeds, and attrition rates on deposits. Cash flow projections from the model are compared to market expectations for similar collateral types and adjusted based on experience with Webster Bank's own portfolio. The model's valuation results are compared to observable market prices for similar instruments whenever possible. The behavior of deposit and loan customers is studied using historical time series analysis to model future customer behavior under varying interest rate environments. 

The equity at risk simulation process uses multiple interest rate paths generated by an arbitrage-free trinomial lattice term structure model. The Base Case rate scenario, against which all others are compared, uses the month-end LIBOR/Swap yield curve as a starting point to derive forward rates for future months. Using interest rate swap option volatilities as inputs, the model creates multiple rate paths for this scenario with forward rates as the mean. In shock scenarios, the starting yield curve is shocked up or down in a parallel fashion. Future rate paths are then constructed in a similar manner to the Base Case. 

Cash flows for all instruments are generated using product specific prepayment models and account specific system data for properties such as maturity date, amortization type, coupon rate, repricing frequency, and repricing date. The asset/liability simulation software is enhanced with a mortgage prepayment model and a collateralized mortgage obligation database. Instruments with explicit options such as caps, floors, puts and calls, and implicit options such as prepayment and early withdrawal ability require such a rate and cash flow modeling approach to more accurately quantify value and risk. 

On the asset side, risk is impacted the most by mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities, which can typically prepay at any time without penalty and may have embedded caps and floors. In the loan portfolio, floors are a benefit to interest income in low rate environments. Floating-rate loans at floors pay a higher interest rate than a loan at a fully indexed rate without a floor, as with a floor there is a limit on how low the interest rate can fall. As market rates rise, however, the interest rate paid on these loans does not rise until the fully indexed rate rises through the contractual floor. 

On the liability side, there is a large concentration of customers with indeterminate maturity deposits who have options to add or withdraw funds from their accounts at any time. Implicit floors on deposits, based on historical data, are modeled. Webster Bank also has the option to change the interest rate paid on these deposits at any time. 

Webster's earnings at risk model incorporates net interest income (NII) and non-interest income and expense items, some of which vary with interest rates. These items include mortgage banking income, servicing rights, cash management fees, and derivative mark-to-market adjustments. 

Four main tools are used for managing interest rate risk: 

&#8226; the size, duration, and credit risk of the investment portfolio; 

&#8226; the size and duration of the wholesale funding portfolio; 

&#8226; interest rate contracts; and 

&#8226; the pricing and structure of loans and deposits. 

ALCO meets at least monthly to make decisions on the investment and funding portfolios based on the economic outlook, the Committee's interest rate expectations, the risk position, and other factors. ALCO delegates pricing and product design responsibilities to individuals and sub-committees but monitors and influences their actions on a regular basis. 

Various interest rate contracts, including futures and options, interest rate swaps, and interest rate caps and floors can be used to manage interest rate risk. These interest rate contracts involve, to varying degrees, credit risk and interest rate risk. Credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur if a counterparty transaction fails to perform according to the terms of the contract. The notional amount of interest rate contracts is the amount upon which interest and other payments are based. The notional amount is not exchanged, and therefore, should not be taken as a measure of credit risk. Refer to Note 16: Derivative Financial Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report for additional information. 

Certain derivative instruments, primarily forward sales of mortgage-backed securities, are utilized by Webster Bank in its efforts to manage risk of loss associated with its mortgage banking activities. Prior to closing and funds disbursement, an interest-rate lock commitment is generally extended to the borrower. During such time, Webster Bank is subject to risk that market rates of interest may change impacting pricing on loan sales. In an effort to mitigate this risk, forward delivery sales commitments are established, thereby setting the sales price. 

The following table summarizes the estimated impact that gradual parallel changes in interest rates of 100 and 200 basis points, over a twelve month period starting December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, might have on Webster&#8217;s NII for the subsequent twelve month period compared to NII assuming no change in interest rates: 

##TABLE_START -200bp -100bp +100bp +200bp December 31, 2019 n/a (1)

The following table summarizes the estimated impact that gradual parallel changes in interest rates of 100 and 200 basis points, over a twelve month period starting December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, might have on Webster&#8217;s pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) for the subsequent twelve month period, compared to PPNR assuming no change in interest rates: 

##TABLE_START -200bp -100bp +100bp +200bp December 31, 2019 n/a (1) 

(7.7)% &#160; 4.1% &#160; 7.1% &#160; December 31, 2018 (18.3)% &#160; (7.9)% &#160; 5.0% &#160; 9.2% &#160; ##TABLE_END

(1) Impact not calculated for scenarios with negative interest rates. Impact from -175bp scenario was (13.2)%. 

Interest rates are assumed to change up or down in a parallel fashion, and NII and PPNR results in each scenario are compared to a flat rate scenario as a base. The flat rate scenario holds the end of period yield curve constant over a twelve month forecast horizon. The flat rate scenario as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 assumed a federal funds rate of 1.75% and 2.50%, respectively. Asset sensitivity for both NII and PPNR on December 31, 2019 was lower as compared to December 31, 2018, with the exception of the minus 100 basis points NII scenario. This lower asset sensitivity is primarily due to repositioning the balance sheet by adding fixed-rate securities, buying interest rate floors, fixed rate loan growth, and shortening the weighted average life of the time deposits portfolio to 8 months as of December 31, 2019 versus 14 months as of December 31, 2018. 

Webster can also hold futures, options, and forward foreign currency contracts to minimize the price volatility of certain assets and liabilities. Changes in the market value of these positions are recognized in earnings. 

The following table summarizes the estimated impact that immediate non-parallel changes in interest rates might have on Webster&#8217;s NII for the subsequent twelve month period starting December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018: 

##TABLE_START Short End of the Yield Curve Long End of the Yield Curve -100bp -50bp +50bp +100bp -100bp -50bp +50bp +100bp December 31, 2019 (5.1)% &#160; (2.5)% &#160; 1.0 % &#160; 2.1 % &#160; (4.7)% &#160; (2.2)% &#160; 1.7 % &#160; 2.9 % &#160; December 31, 2018 (7.1)% &#160; (3.3)% &#160; 1.7% &#160; 3.4% &#160; (3.3)% &#160; (1.6)% &#160; 1.3% &#160; 2.3% &#160; ##TABLE_END

The following table summarizes the estimated impact that immediate non-parallel changes in interest rates might have on Webster&#8217;s PPNR for the subsequent twelve month period starting December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018: 

##TABLE_START Short End of the Yield Curve Long End of the Yield Curve &#160; -100bp -50bp +50bp +100bp -100bp -50bp +50bp +100bp December 31, 2019 (7.9)% &#160; (3.8)% &#160; 1.1% &#160; 2.4% &#160; (8.1)% &#160; (3.9)% &#160; 3.0% &#160; 5.1% &#160; December 31, 2018 (11.6)% &#160; (5.4)% &#160; 2.4% &#160; 4.8% &#160; (5.6)% &#160; (2.9)% &#160; 2.4% &#160; 4.2% &#160; ##TABLE_END

The non-parallel scenarios are modeled with the short end of the yield curve moving up or down 50 and 100 basis points while the long end of the yield curve remains unchanged, and vice versa. The short end of the yield curve is defined as terms of less than eighteen months, and the long end as terms of greater than eighteen months. These results above reflect the annualized impact of immediate rate changes. 

Sensitivity to increases in the short end of the yield curve for NII and PPNR decreased from December 31, 2018 due primarily to balance sheet repositioning and an increase in balances of fixed-rate loans. NII and PPNR were more sensitive to changes in the long end of the yield curve as of December 31, 2019 when compared to December 31, 2018 due to increased forecast prepayment speeds resulting from decreases in the long end of the yield curve, which shortens asset duration by increasing prepayments for MBS and residential mortgages. 

The following table summarizes the estimated economic value of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 and the projected change to economic values if interest rates instantaneously increase or decrease by 100 basis points:

Changes in economic value can be best described using duration. Duration is a measure of the price sensitivity of financial instruments for small changes in interest rates. For fixed-rate instruments, it can also be thought of as the weighted-average expected time to receive future cash flows. For floating-rate instruments, it can be thought of as the weighted-average expected time until the next rate reset. The longer the duration, the greater the price sensitivity for given changes in interest rates. Floating-rate instruments may have durations as short as one day and, therefore, have very little price sensitivity due to changes in interest rates. Increases in interest rates typically reduce the value of fixed-rate assets as future discounted cash flows are worth less at higher discount rates. A liability's value decreases for the same reason in a rising rate environment. A reduction in value of a liability is a benefit to Webster. 

Duration gap is the difference between the duration of assets and the duration of liabilities. A duration gap near zero implies that the balance sheet is matched and would exhibit no change in estimated economic value for a small change in interest rates. Webster's duration gap was negative 0.8 years at December 31, 2019 and negative 0.7 years at December 31, 2018 when measured using 50 basis point changes in rates. A negative duration gap implies that liabilities are longer than assets and, therefore, they have more price sensitivity than assets and will reset their interest rates slower than assets. Consequently, Webster's net estimated economic value would generally be expected to increase when interest rates rise as the benefit of the decreased value of liabilities would more than offset the decreased value of assets. The opposite would generally be expected to occur when interest rates fall. Earnings would also generally be expected to increase when interest rates rise and decrease when interest rates fall over the longer term absent the effects of new business booked in the future. As of December 31, 2019, long-term rates have fallen by 77 basis points when compared to December 31, 2018. This lower starting point shortens asset duration by increasing residential loans and MBS prepayment speeds. 

These estimates assume that management does not take any action to mitigate any positive or negative effects from changing interest rates. The earnings and economic values estimates are subject to factors that could cause actual results to differ. Management believes that Webster's interest rate risk position at December 31, 2019 represents a reasonable level of risk given the current interest rate outlook. Management, as always, is prepared to act in the event that interest rates do change rapidly. 

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 

The consolidated financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. 

Unlike most industrial companies, substantially all of the assets and liabilities of a banking institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on Webster's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Accounting Estimates 

The Company's significant accounting policies, as described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, are fundamental to understanding its results of operations and financial condition. As stated in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report, the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make judgments and accounting estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes. While the Company bases estimates on historical experience, current information and other factors deemed to be relevant, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 

Accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and procedures and can be susceptible to significant change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operation, and that require management to make the most difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and which could potentially result in materially different amounts using different assumptions or under different conditions. The two critical accounting policies identified by management, which are discussed with the appropriate committees of the Board of Directors, are summarized below. 

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses 

The ALLL is a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense, which represents management&#8217;s best estimate of probable losses that are inherent within the Company&#8217;s portfolio of loans and leases as of the balance sheet date. Changes in the ALLL and, therefore, in the related provision for loan and lease losses can materially affect net income. The level of the ALLL reflects management&#8217;s judgment based on continuing evaluation of specific credit risks, loss experience, current portfolio quality, present economic, political, adequacy of underlying collateral, present value of expected future cash flows and regulatory conditions and inherent risks not captured in quantitative modeling and methodologies, as well as trends therein. The allowance balance may be allocated for specific portfolio segments; however, the entire allowance balance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan and lease portfolio. 

While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of the ALLL is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond the Company&#8217;s control, including performance of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio, the economy, interest rate sensitivity, and other external factors. Management evaluates the composition of the ALLL on a quarterly basis. Composition of the ALLL, including valuation methodology, is more fully described in Note 4: Loans and Leases in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report and in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, section captioned "Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Methodology." 

Realizability of Deferred Tax Assets 

In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 740, " Income Taxes, " certain aspects of accounting for income taxes require significant management judgment, including assessing the realizability of DTAs. A DTA represents an item for which a benefit may be recognized for financial accounting purposes if it has been determined to be more likely than not realizable for tax purposes in a future period. A DTA valuation allowance represents the portion of a DTA determined unlikely to be realized in the future based on management's judgment. Such judgment is often subjective and involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, including with respect to the existence, and amount, of taxable income necessary to realize a DTA in future periods. 

While management believes it has utilized a reasonable method for its determination of DTAs and the related valuation allowance, should factors and conditions differ materially from those used by management, the actual realization of DTAs could differ materially from the reported amounts. Management evaluates the realizability and the sufficiency of the reported amounts on a quarterly basis. Income taxes are more fully described in Note 9: Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report and in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, section captioned "Income Taxes."
