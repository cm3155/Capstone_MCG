 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Introduction 

This discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is necessary to understand the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 as compared to 2021. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Webster Financial Corporation's Consolidated Financial Statements, and accompanying Notes thereto, for the year ended December 31, 2021, included in Webster Financial Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 25, 2022, and in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and accompanying Notes thereto, included in Item 1. Financial Statements. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the future results that may be attained for the entire year or other interim periods. 

Executive Summary 

Nature of Operations 

Webster Financial Corporation (the Holding Company) is a bank holding company and financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (BHC Act), incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 1986, and headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut. Webster Bank, National Association (Webster Bank) is the principal consolidated subsidiary of Webster Financial Corporation. Webster Bank, and its HSA Bank division (HSA Bank), deliver a wide range of banking, investment, and financial services to individuals, families, and businesses. Webster Bank serves consumer and business customers with mortgage lending, financial planning, trust, and investment services through a distribution network consisting of banking centers, ATMs, a customer care center, and a full range of web and mobile-based banking services throughout the northeastern U.S. from New York to Massachusetts, with certain businesses operating in extended geographies. Webster Bank also offers equipment financing, warehouse lending, commercial real estate lending, asset-based lending, and treasury management solutions. HSA Bank is a leading provider of health savings accounts (HSAs), and delivers health reimbursement arrangements and flexible spending and commuter benefit account administration services to employers and individuals in all 50 states. 

Mergers and Acquisitions 

On January 31, 2022, Webster completed its previously announced merger with Sterling in an all-stock transaction valued at $5.2 billion. The merger expanded Webster's geographic footprint and combined two complementary organizations to create one of the largest commercial banks in the northeastern U.S. At March 31, 2022, the combined company had $65.1 billion in assets, $43.5 billion in loans and leases, and $54.4 billion in deposits, and operated 202 financial centers throughout southern New England and metro and suburban New York. In addition, on February 18, 2022, Webster acquired 100% of the equity interests of Bend Financial, Inc. (Bend), a cloud-based platform solution provider for HSAs, in exchange for cash. The Bend acquisition accelerates Webster&#8217;s efforts underway to deliver enhanced user experiences at HSA Bank. Financial results for historical reporting periods reflect only the results of Webster's operations prior to the corresponding merger or acquisition. 

The successful integration of Webster and Sterling&#8217;s operations will depend on the Company&#8217;s ability to successfully consolidate operations, its management teams, corporate cultures, systems and procedures, and eliminate redundancies and costs. Noteworthy accomplishments include the rebranding of branches and digital assets, the implementation of strong governance controls and organizational structures, the coordination of credit policies and procedures, the selection of certain key operating systems, and the launch of culture-shaping offsite workshops attended by substantially all of the Company's senior leaders, with an expected rollout to the entire organization by the end of the year. Current initiatives under development include the outline of a preliminary corporate real estate consolidation strategy to reduce the Company&#8217;s corporate facility square footage by approximately 45%, primarily throughout New York and Connecticut. In addition, key operating systems and process integration activities are underway, and Webster is well positioned to successfully execute its core conversion targeted for mid-2023. 

In connection with the Sterling merger, Webster re-evaluated its strategic priorities as a combined organization, which resulted in modifications to the Company's strategic initiatives that were announced in December 2020. As a result, the Company released $3.8 million from its previously recorded severance accrual during the first quarter of 2022, with a corresponding adjustment to earnings. 

Additional information regarding Webster's mergers and acquisitions and its strategic initiatives can be found within Note 2: Mergers and Acquisitions and Note 3: Strategic Initiatives in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1. Financial Statements, respectively.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The non-GAAP financial measures identified in the preceding table provide both management and investors with information useful in understanding Webster's financial position, results of operations, the strength of its capital position, and overall business performance. These measures are used by management for internal planning and forecasting purposes, as well as by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties to assess peer company operating performance. Management believes this presentation, together with the accompanying reconciliations, provides a complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting Webster's business and allows investors to view its performance in a similar manner. 

Tangible book value per common share represents shareholders&#8217; equity less preferred stock and goodwill and other intangible assets (tangible common equity) divided by common shares outstanding at the end of the reporting period. The tangible common equity ratio represents tangible common equity divided by total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets (tangible assets). Both of these measures are used by management to evaluate the strength of Webster's capital position. The annualized return on average tangible common shareholders' equity is calculated using net income available to common shareholders, adjusted for the annualized tax-effected amortization of intangible assets, as a percentage of average tangible common equity. This measure is used by management to assess Webster's performance against its peer financial institutions. The efficiency ratio, which represents the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, is calculated excluding certain non-operational items in order to measure how well Webster is managing its recurring operating expenses. 

These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis financial measures. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these with other companies that present financial measures having the same or similar names. 

The following tables reconcile non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial measures defined by GAAP: At March 31, (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 2022 2021 Tangible book value per common share: Shareholders' equity $ 8,177,135 $ 3,272,928 Less: Preferred stock 283,979 145,037 Goodwill and other intangible assets 2,738,353 559,617 Tangible common shareholders' equity $ 5,154,803 $ 2,568,274 Common shares outstanding 178,102 90,410 Tangible book value per common share $ 28.94 &#160; $ 28.41 &#160; Tangible common equity ratio: Tangible common shareholders' equity $ 5,154,803 $ 2,568,274 Total assets $ 65,131,484 $ 33,259,037 Less: Goodwill and other intangible assets 2,738,353 559,617 Tangible assets $ 62,393,131 $ 32,699,420 Tangible common equity ratio 8.26 &#160; % 7.85 &#160; %

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is Webster's primary source of revenue, representing 79.1% and 74.5% of total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively, and is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and leases and investment securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, which are used to fund interest-earning assets and other activities. Net interest margin is calculated as the ratio of tax-equivalent net interest income to average interest-earning assets. Tax-equivalent adjustments are determined assuming a statutory federal income tax rate of 21%. 

Net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in interest rate levels, re-pricing frequencies, contractual maturities, prepayment behavior, and the use of interest rate derivative financial instruments. These factors are affected by changes in economic conditions, which impacts monetary policies, competition for loans and deposits, as well as the extent of interest lost on non-performing assets. 

Net interest income increased $170.4 million, or 76.2%, from $223.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, to $394.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. On a fully tax-equivalent basis, net interest income increased $176.1 million. Net interest margin increased 29 basis points from 2.92% for the three months ended March 31, 2021, to 3.21% for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase is primarily attributed to the merger with Sterling, and includes net purchase accounting accretion from acquired loans and leases, investment securities, and interest-bearing liabilities. 

Average interest-earning assets increased $19.2 billion, or 61.6%, from $31.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021, to $50.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to increases of $14.4 billion and $4.5 billion in average loans and leases and average investment securities, respectively. The average yield on interest-earning assets increased 25 basis points from 3.08% for the three months ended March 31, 2021, to 3.33% for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase in interest-earning assets and the increase in average yield were both impacted by the Sterling merger. 

Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $17.9 billion, or 60.7%, from $29.5 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021, to $47.4 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to increases of $17.6 billion and $0.3 billion in average deposits and average long-term debt, partially offset by a decrease of $124.9 million in average FHLB advances. Average deposit growth was primarily impacted by the merger with Sterling and the strong liquidity position of retail and commercial customers. The average rate on interest-bearing liabilities decreased 3 basis points from 0.16% for the three months ended March 31, 2021, to 0.13% for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to customers' migration from higher cost time deposits to more liquid, lower cost deposit products, which was partially offset by the the subordinated debt assumed from Sterling in the merger.

Average loans and leases increased $14.4 billion, or 67.2%, from $21.5 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $35.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022, which was primarily due to the merger with Sterling, as well as loan growth across the residential and commercial categories. This growth was partially offset by lower Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan balances. At March 31, 2022, and 2021, the loan and lease portfolio comprised 71.4% and 69.0% of total average interest-earning assets, respectively. The average yield on loans and leases increased 33 basis points from 3.57% for the three months ended March 31, 2021, to 3.90% for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to purchase accounting accretion on acquired loans and leases. 

Average taxable and non-taxable investment securities increased $4.5 billion, or 51.0%, from $8.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $13.4 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to the merger with Sterling. At March 31, 2022, and 2021, the investment securities portfolio comprised 26.7% and 28.5% of total average interest-earning assets, respectively. The average yield on investment securities decreased 10 basis points from 2.12% for the three months ended March 31, 2021, to 2.02% for the three months ended March 31, 2022. This was primarily due to the interest rate environment, which was partially offset by a higher average yield on the acquired Sterling investment securities net of purchase premium amortization. 

Average total deposits increased $17.6 billion, or 62.4%, from $28.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021, to $45.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022, reflecting increases of $4.8 billion and $12.8 billion in non-interest-bearing deposits and interest-bearing deposits, respectively. The overall increase in deposits was primarily due to the merger with Sterling, as well as the strong liquidity position of retail and commercial customers. At March 31, 2022, and 2021, deposits comprised 96.9% and 95.8% of total average interest-bearing liabilities, respectively. The average rate on deposits decreased 2 basis points from 0.09% for the three months ended March 31, 2021, to 0.07% for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to the interest rate environment and the run-off of higher cost time deposits. Higher cost time deposits as a percentage of total interest-bearing deposits decreased from 10.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2021, to 7.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to customers' migration to more liquid, lower cost deposit products. 

Average long-term debt increased $329.2 million, or 58.1%, from $567.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $896.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to the merger with Sterling. At March 31, 2022, and 2021, long-term debt comprised 1.89% and 1.92% of total average interest-bearing liabilities, respectively. The average rate on long-term debt increased 11 basis points from 3.23% for the three months ended March 31, 2021 to 3.34% for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to the subordinated debt assumed from Sterling in the merger. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses increased $214.6 million, or 833.4%, from a benefit of $25.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 to an expense of $188.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase is primarily attributed to the establishment of the initial ACL of $175.1 million for non-purchased credit-deteriorated (PCD) loans and leases that were acquired from Sterling. During the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, total net charge-offs were $8.9 million and $5.3 million, respectively. The $3.6 million increase is primarily attributed to an increased volume of net charge-offs in the commercial non-mortgage portfolio, partially offset by a decreased volume of net charge-offs in the commercial real estate and other consumer portfolios. 

Additional information regarding the Company's provision for credit losses and ACL can be found under the sections captioned "Loans and Leases" through "Allowance for Credit Losses" contained elsewhere in Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Non-Interest Income &#160; Three months ended March 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 Deposit service fees $ 47,827 $ 40,469 Loan and lease related fees 22,679 8,313 Wealth and investment services 10,597 9,403 Mortgage banking activities 428 2,642 Increase in cash surrender value of life insurance policies 6,732 3,533 Other income 15,772 12,397 Total non-interest income $ 104,035 $ 76,757 

Total non-interest income increased $27.3 million, or 35.5%, from $76.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $104.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to increases in deposit service fees, loan and lease related fees, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies, and other income, all of which were primarily driven by the merger with Sterling, partially offset by a decrease in mortgage banking activities. 

Deposit service fees increased $7.4 million, or 18.2%, from $40.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $47.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to the merger with Sterling, as well as higher interchange income from increased debit card spending in the HSA and Consumer Banking segments. 

Loan and lease related fees increased $14.4 million, or 172.8%, from $8.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $22.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to the merger with Sterling, which included $2.2 million of operating lease income, as well as an increase in prepayment penalties and other loan related fees. 

Mortgage banking activities decreased $2.2 million, or 83.8%, from $2.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to lower originations for sale, as the Company continues to execute on its strategic decision to originate residential mortgage loans for investment rather than for sale. 

The cash surrender value of life insurance policies increased $3.2 million, or 90.5%, from $3.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $6.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to the additional bank-owned life insurance policies acquired in the merger with Sterling. 

Other income increased $3.4 million, or 27.2%, from $12.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $15.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase in income due to the impact of the merger with Sterling, higher income from client interest rate derivative activities, and gains on sale of loans not originated for sale. 

Non-Interest Expense &#160; Three months ended March 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 Compensation and benefits $ 184,002 $ 107,600 Occupancy 18,615 15,650 Technology and equipment 55,401 28,516 Intangible assets amortization 6,387 1,139 Marketing 3,509 2,504 Professional and outside services 54,091 9,776 Deposit insurance 5,222 3,956 Other expense 32,558 18,841 Total non-interest expense $ 359,785 $ 187,982 

Total non-interest expense increased $171.8 million, or 91.4%, from $188.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $359.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits, occupancy, technology and equipment, intangible assets amortization, professional and outside services, and other expense, all of which were primarily driven by the merger with Sterling. 

Compensation and benefits increased $76.4 million, or 71.0%, from $107.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $184.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to $41.6 million of merger-related expenses, which included $26.9 million and $11.9 million of severance and retention, respectively, and higher salaries and incentives related to the increase in employees as a result of the merger, partially offset by a decrease in strategic initiatives severance charges. 

Occupancy increased $3.0 million, or 18.9%, from $15.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $18.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to the additional operating lease costs and depreciation related to the acquired Sterling branches and corporate offices, partially offset by a decrease in strategic initiatives charges. 

Technology and equipment increased $26.9 million, or 94.3%, from $28.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $55.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to $19.1 million of merger-related expenses, which included $17.7 million in contract termination costs, and an increase in technology and equipment service contracts due to the impact of the merger with Sterling. 

Intangible assets amortization increased $5.2 million, or 460.8%, from $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $6.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, due to the additional amortization expense related to the core deposits and customer relationship intangible assets acquired in connection with the Sterling merger and Bend acquisition. 

Professional and outside services increased $44.3 million, or 453.3%, from $9.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $54.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to $44.5 million of merger-related expenses, which included $32.1 million of advisory fees, as well as legal and consulting fees, and an increase in professional service costs due to the impact of the merger with Sterling, partially offset by a decrease in strategic initiative charges. 

Other expense increased $13.7 million, or 72.8%, from $18.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $32.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase in expenses due to the impact of the merger with Sterling, which included $1.6 million of operating lease depreciation and $3.0 million of merger-related expenses. 

Income Taxes 

Webster recognized income tax (benefit) expense of $(33.6) million and $30.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively, reflecting an effective tax benefit rate of 66.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2022, and an effective tax expense rate of 21.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2021. 

The income tax benefit and related effective tax benefit rate for the three months ended March 31, 2022, reflects the effects of the pre-tax loss, as well as tax-exempt income and tax credits recognized during the period, and a $13.7 million deferred state and local tax (SALT) benefit associated with the merger with Sterling, of which $9.9 million related to a change in management's estimate about the realizability of its SALT deferred tax assets (DTAs) due to an estimated increase in future taxable income. These effects were partially offset by the effect of $21.0 million of merger-related expenses recognized during the period that were estimated to be nondeductible for income tax purposes. 

At March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, Webster recorded a valuation allowance on its DTAs of $29.2 million and $37.4 million, respectively. The $29.2 million at March 31, 2022, reflects a reduction of $9.9 million for the change in estimate discussed above, and includes a $1.7 million valuation allowance related to the Bend acquisition. At March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, Webster's gross DTAs included $71.1 million and $64.4 million, respectively, applicable to SALT net operating loss carryforwards that are available to offset future taxable income. The $71.1 million at March 31, 2022, includes $5.6 million related to the Sterling merger and $1.1 million related to the Bend acquisition. Webster's total gross DTAs at March 31, 2022, also included $5.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively, of federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards related to the Sterling merger and Bend acquisition, which are subject to annual limitations on utilization. 

The ultimate realization of DTAs is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the net operating loss and credit carryforwards are available. In making its assessment, management considers the Company's forecasted future results of operations, estimates the content and apportionment of its income by legal entity over the near term for SALT purposes, and also applies longer-term growth rate assumptions. Based on its estimates, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize its DTAs, net of the valuation allowance, at March 31, 2022. However, it is possible that some or all of Webster's net operating loss and credit carryforwards could expire unused or that more net operating loss and credit carryforwards could be utilized than estimated, either as a result of changes in future forecasted levels of taxable income or if future economic or market conditions or interest rates were to vary significantly from the Company's forecasts and, in turn, impact its future results of operations. 

Additional information regarding Webster's income taxes, including its DTAs, can be found within Note 11: Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Segment Reporting 

Webster's operations are organized into three reportable segments that represent its primary businesses: Commercial Banking, HSA Bank, and Consumer Banking. These segments reflect how executive management responsibilities are assigned, how discrete financial information is evaluated, the type of customer served, and how products and services are provided. Segments are evaluated using pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue (PPNR). Certain Treasury activities, along with the amounts required to reconcile profitability metrics to those reported in accordance with GAAP, are included in the Corporate and Reconciling category. Additional information regarding the Company's reportable segments and its segment reporting methodology can be found within Note 17: Segment Reporting in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1. Financial Statements. 

Effective January 1, 2022, Webster realigned its investment services operations from Commercial Banking to Consumer Banking to better serve its customers and deliver operational efficiencies. Under this realignment, $125.4 million of deposits and $4.3 billion of assets under administration (off-balance sheet) were reassigned from Commercial Banking to Consumer Banking. There was no goodwill reallocation nor goodwill impairment as a result of the reorganization. In addition, the non-interest expense allocation methodology was modified to exclude certain overhead and merger-related costs that are not directly related to segment performance. Prior period results of operations have been recast accordingly to reflect the realignment. 

The following is a description of Webster&#8217;s three reportable segments and their primary services: 

Commercial Banking serves corporate customers with more than $2 million of revenues through its Commercial Real Estate, Business Banking, Capital Finance, Middle Market, Public Sector Finance, Sponsor and Specialty Finance, Mortgage Warehouse Lending, Private Banking, and Treasury Management components. 

HSA Bank offers a comprehensive consumer-directed healthcare solution that includes HSAs, health reimbursement arrangements, flexible spending accounts, and commuter benefits. HSAs are used in conjunction with high deductible health plans in order to facilitate tax advantages for account holders with respect to health care spending and savings, in accordance with applicable laws. HSAs are distributed nationwide directly to employers and individual consumers, as well as through national and regional insurance carriers, benefit consultants, and financial advisors. HSA Bank deposits provide long duration, low-cost funding that is used to minimize the Company&#8217;s use of wholesale funding in support of its loan growth. In addition, non-interest revenue is generated predominantly through service fees and interchange income. 

Consumer Banking serves individual customers and small businesses with less than $2 million of revenues by offering consumer deposits, residential mortgages, home equity lines, secured and unsecured loans, debit and credit card products, and investment services. Consumer Banking operates a distribution network consisting of 202 banking centers and 359 ATMs, a customer care center, and a full range of web and mobile-based banking services, primarily throughout southern New England and the New York Metro and Suburban markets. 

Commercial Banking 

Operating Results: Three months ended March 31, (In thousands) 2022 2021 Net interest income $ 287,069 $ 141,486 Non-interest income 38,743 18,376 Non-interest expense 89,240 46,284 Pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue $ 236,572 $ 113,578 

Commercial Banking's PPNR increased $123.0 million, or 108.3%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021, due to increases in both net interest income and non-interest income, partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense, all of which were primarily driven by the merger with Sterling. The $145.6 million increase in net interest income is primarily attributed to incremental loan and deposit balances acquired from Sterling, and loan and deposit growth. The $20.4 million increase in non-interest income is primarily attributed to incremental fee income due to the merger, and loan and lease related fees. The $43.0 million increase in non-interest expense is primarily attributed to incremental expenses incurred related to the acquired Sterling commercial business, which was partially offset by the benefits of costs savings initiatives implemented over the course of 2021. 

Selected Balance Sheet and Off-Balance Sheet Information: (In thousands) At March 31, 2022 At December 31, 2021 Loans and leases $ 34,928,169 $ 15,209,515 Deposits 21,527,954 9,519,362 Assets under administration/management (off-balance sheet) 2,692,402 2,869,385 

Loans and leases increased $19.7 billion, or 129.6%, at March 31, 2022, as compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to the merger with Sterling and growth within the sponsor and specialty line of business. Total portfolio originations for the three months ended March 31, 2022, and 2021 were $2.0 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. The $1.0 billion increase was primarily attributed to the merger with Sterling, along with increased commercial non-mortgage originations. 

Deposits increased $12.0 billion, or 126.1%, at March 31, 2022, as compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to the merger with Sterling, along with seasonality of municipal deposit products and client acquisitions. 

Commercial Banking held $0.7 billion and $0.8 billion in assets under administration and $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion in assets under management at March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. The combined $0.2 billion decrease, or 6.2%, was primarily due to valuations in the equity markets during the three months ended March 31, 2022. 

HSA Bank 

Operating Results: Three months ended March 31, (In thousands) 2022 2021 Net interest income $ 44,577 $ 42,109 Non-interest income 26,958 27,005 Non-interest expense 36,409 36,005 Pre-tax net revenue $ 35,126 $ 33,109 

HSA Bank's pre-tax net revenue increased $2.0 million, or 6.1%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in net interest income, which was partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense. Non-interest income remained flat on a comparative basis. The $2.5 million increase in net interest income is primarily attributed to an increase in the net interest rate spread on deposits and overall deposit growth. The $0.4 million increase in non-interest expense is primarily attributed to incremental expenses from Bend's acquired business, which was partially offset by lower compensation and benefits costs. 

Selected Balance Sheet and Off-Balance Sheet Information: (In thousands) At March 31, 2022 At December 31, 2021 Deposits $ 7,804,846 $ 7,397,997 Assets under administration, through linked investment accounts (off-balance sheet) 3,761,362 3,718,610 

Deposits increased $406.8 million, or 5.5%, at March 31, 2022, as compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in the number of account holders and organic deposit growth, which was partially offset by a decrease in third party administrator deposits. HSA deposits accounted for approximately 14.4% and 24.8% of Webster's total consolidated deposits at March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively, with the lower mix driven by the inflow of deposits as a result of the merger with Sterling. 

Assets under administration, through linked investment accounts, increased $42.8 million, or 1.1%, at March 31, 2022, as compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to additional account holders and balances from the acquisition of Bend, which was partially offset by valuations in the equity markets during the three months ended March 31, 2022. 

Consumer Banking 

Operating Results: Three months ended March 31, (In thousands) 2022 2021 Net interest income $ 136,580 $ 89,365 Non-interest income 27,892 22,872 Non-interest expense 95,747 75,311 Pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue $ 68,725 $ 36,926 

Consumer Banking's PPNR increased $31.8 million, or 86.1%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021, due to increases in both net interest income and non-interest income, partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense, all of which were primarily driven by the merger with Sterling. The $47.2 million increase in net interest income is primarily attributed to incremental loan and deposit balances acquired from Sterling, and loan and deposit growth. The $5.0 million increase in non-interest income is primarily attributed to incremental fee income due to the merger, and loan and lease related fees. The $20.4 million increase in non-interest expense is primarily attributed to incremental expenses incurred related to the acquired Sterling consumer business, which was partially offset by the benefits of costs savings initiatives implemented over the course of 2021. 

Selected Balance Sheet and Off-Balance Sheet Information: (In thousands) At March 31, 2022 At December 31, 2021 Loans $ 8,588,704 $ 7,062,182 Deposits 24,115,388 12,926,302 Assets under administration (off-balance sheet) 7,929,328 4,332,901 

Loans increased $1.5 billion, or 21.6%, at March 31, 2022, as compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to the merger with Sterling and residential mortgage loan growth, partially offset by net principal paydowns in home equity loans, and the continued run-off of consumer Lending Club loans. Total portfolio originations during the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 were $0.6 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively. The decrease was primarily attributed to an increase in market rates, which resulted in lower residential mortgage loan originations. 

Deposits increased $11.2 billion, or 86.6%, at March 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to the merger with Sterling. Customer preferences for maintaining liquidity resulted in higher balances in small business and consumer transaction accounts, particularly across savings accounts and money markets, as account holders with maturing certificates of deposit migrated to more liquid deposit products. 

Consumer Banking held $7.9 billion and $4.3 billion in assets under administration at March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. The $3.6 billion increase was primarily due to the merger with Sterling, partially offset by valuations in the equity markets during the three months ended March 31, 2022. 

Financial Condition 

Total assets increased $30.2 billion, or 86.5%, from $34.9 billion at December 31, 2021 to $65.1 billion at March 31, 2022. The change in total assets was primarily attributed to the following: 

&#8226; Total investment securities, net increased $4.7 billion, with increases of $4.5 billion and $164.1 million in the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios, respectively, primarily due to $4.4 billion of investment securities acquired from Sterling in the merger, all of which were classified as available-for-sale based on Webster's intent at closing; 

&#8226; Loans and leases increased $21.3 billion, with increases of $19.8 billion and $1.5 billion in the commercial and consumer portfolios, respectively, primarily due to $20.5 billion of gross loans and leases acquired from Sterling in the merger, which is inclusive of a $317.6 million purchase discount. Webster also originated $2.6 billion of loans and leases during the three months ended March 31, 2022, particularly across the commercial non-mortgage, commercial real estate, and residential mortgage categories. These increases were partially offset by the forgiveness of PPP loans, net paydowns in home equity loans, and the run-off of consumer Lending Club loans. In addition, Webster recorded $88.0 million and $175.1 million of initial ACL for the PCD and non-PCD loans and leases acquired from Sterling, respectively, which primarily contributed to the $268.2 million increase in the ACL on loans and leases; 

&#8226; Goodwill and other net intangible assets increased a combined $2.2 billion. Goodwill increased $2.0 billion, which reflects the $1.9 billion and $36.0 million recognized in connection with the Sterling merger and Bend acquisition, respectively. The $206.7 million increase in other net intangible assets is due to the $119.1 million core deposit and $94.0 million customer relationship intangible assets acquired from Sterling and Bend, respectively, partially offset by current period amortization charges; and 

&#8226; Accrued interest receivable and other assets increased $879.1 million primarily due to $959.5 million of balances acquired from Sterling in the merger. Notable increases include $103.4 million in accrued interest receivable, $59.1 million in alternative investments, $505.3 million in LIHTC investments, and a combined $73.7 million in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $77.8 million in treasury derivative assets. 

Total liabilities increased $25.5 billion, or 80.9%, from $31.5 billion at December 31, 2021 to $57.0 billion at March 31, 2022. The change in total liabilities was primarily attributed to the following: 

&#8226; Total deposits increased $24.5 billion, with increases of $6.5 billion and $18.0 billion in non-interest bearing deposits and interest-bearing deposits, respectively, primarily due to $23.3 billion of deposits assumed from Sterling in the merger; 

&#8226; Long-term debt increased $515.3 million, primarily due to $499.0 million aggregate par value of subordinated notes assumed from Sterling in the merger, adjusted for a $17.9 million purchase premium, which is being amortized over the remaining lives of the subordinated notes; 

&#8226; Accrued expenses and other liabilities increased $608.7 million, primarily due to the $595.3 million of balances assumed from Sterling in the merger. Notable increases include $106.9 million in derivative liabilities, $117.1 million in operating lease liabilities, and $247.2 million in unfunded commitments for LIHTC investments. 

Total shareholders' equity increased $4.7 billion, or 137.8%, from $3.4 billion at December 31, 2021 to $8.2 billion at March 31, 2022. The change in total shareholders' equity was attributed to the following: 

&#8226; Common shares issued in the merger with Sterling totaling approximately $5.0 billion, of which $43.9 million pertained to replacement share-based compensation awards; 

&#8226; The conversion of Sterling Series A preferred stock into Webster Series G preferred stock at a fair value of $138.9 million; 

&#8226; Net loss recognized of $16.7 million; 

&#8226; Dividends paid to common and preferred shareholders of $36.2 million and $3.4 million, respectively; 

&#8226; Other comprehensive loss, net of tax, of $253.1 million, primarily due to market value decreases in the Company's available-for-sale securities portfolio and cash flow hedges; 

&#8226; Employee share-based compensation plan activity of $9.0 million, inclusive of restricted stock amortization and forfeitures, and stock options exercised of $0.4 million; and 

&#8226; Repurchases of common stock of $122.2 million under the Company's common stock repurchase program and $19.0 million related to employee share-based compensation plans. 

Investment Securities 

Through its Corporate Treasury function, Webster maintains and invests in debt securities that are primarily used to provide a source of liquidity for operating needs, to generate interest income, and as a means to manage the Company's interest-rate risk. Webster's debt securities are classified into two major categories: available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. 

ALCO manages the Company's debt securities in accordance with regulatory guidelines and corporate policies, which include limitations on aspects such as concentrations in and types of investments, as well as minimum risk ratings per type of security. In addition, the OCC may further establish individual limits on certain types of investments if the concentration in such investment presents a safety and soundness concern. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, Webster had investment securities with a total net carrying value of $15.1 billion and $10.4 billion, respectively, with an average risk weighting for regulatory purposes of 19.5% and 12.5%, respectively. Although the Bank held the entirety of Webster's investment portfolio at both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Holding Company may also directly hold investments. 

The following table summarizes the balances and percentage composition of Webster's investment securities: &#160; At March 31, 2022 At December 31, 2021 (In thousands) Amount % Amount % Available-for-sale: U.S. Treasury notes $ 732,425 8.4 % $ 396,966 9.4 % Government agency debentures 217,219 2.5 &#8212; &#8212; Municipal bonds and notes 1,894,537 21.7 &#8212; &#8212; Agency CMO 79,513 0.9 90,384 2.2 Agency MBS 2,574,569 29.4 1,593,403 37.6 Agency CMBS 1,583,820 18.1 1,232,541 29.1 CMBS 864,157 9.9 886,263 20.9 CLO 14,233 0.1 21,847 0.5 Corporate debt 767,044 8.8 13,450 0.3 Other 17,380 0.2 &#8212; &#8212; Total available-for-sale $ 8,744,897 100.0 % $ 4,234,854 100.0 % Held-to-maturity: Agency CMO $ 36,533 0.6 % $ 42,405 0.7 % Agency MBS 2,915,114 45.8 2,901,593 46.8 Agency CMBS 2,548,347 40.1 2,378,475 38.4 Municipal bonds and notes (1)

(1) The balances at both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, exclude the allowance for credit losses recorded on held-to-maturity debt securities of $0.2 million. 

Available-for-sale debt securities increased $4.5 billion, or 106.5%, from $4.2 billion at December 31, 2021 to $8.7 billion at March 31, 2022, primarily due to the merger with Sterling, as the Company acquired $4.4 billion of debt securities at fair value on January 31, 2022, all of which were classified as available-for-sale based on Webster's intent at closing. The debt securities acquired from Sterling resulted in a $221.6 million net purchase premium over par value accounted for as a yield adjustment using the effective interest method. Webster also purchased an additional $714.2 million of available-for sale debt securities during the quarter. This total purchase activity was partially offset by paydowns and net premium amortization, particularly across the Agency MBS, Agency CMBS, and CMBS categories. 

The tax-equivalent yield in the available-for-sale portfolio was 1.98% for the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to 1.83% for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The 15 basis point increase is attributed to lower premium amortization and higher rates on securities purchased in the current period. Available-for-sale debt securities are evaluated for credit losses on a quarterly basis. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, gross unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities were $333.3 million and $34.3 million, respectively. The $299.0 million increase in unrealized losses is primarily due to the increased portfolio size from the merger with Sterling, and higher market rates. Because these unrealized losses were attributable to factors other than credit deterioration, no ACL was recorded during the period. At March 31, 2022, Webster did not intend to sell these investment securities, and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell these securities prior to the anticipated recovery of their cost basis. 

Held-to-maturity investment securities increased $164.1 million, or 2.6%, from $6.2 billion at December 31, 2021 to $6.4 billion at March 31, 2022, primarily due to purchases exceeding paydowns, calls, and net premium amortization, particularly across the Agency CMBS and Agency MBS categories. The tax-equivalent yield in the portfolio was 2.06% for the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to 2.29% for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The 23 basis point decrease is attributed to higher premium amortization and lower rates on securities purchased over the past year. Held-to-maturity debt securities are evaluated for credit losses on a quarterly basis under CECL. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, gross unrealized losses on held-to-maturity debt securities were $291.6 million and $55.7 million, respectively. The increase in unrealized losses is primarily due to higher market rates. The ACL on held-to-maturity debt securities was $0.2 million at both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

The following table summarizes the amortized cost of investment securities by contractual maturity, along with the respective weighted-average yields:

Credit Policies and Procedures 

Webster Bank has credit policies and procedures in place designed to support its lending activities within an acceptable level of risk, which are reviewed and approved by management and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. To assist with this process, management inspects reports generated by the Company's loan reporting systems related to loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies, non-performing loans, and potential problem loans. In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, management has implemented incremental policies and procedures to monitor credit risk. 

Commercial non-mortgage, asset-based, equipment finance, and warehouse lending loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower&#8217;s ability to operate and service its debt. Assessment of the borrower's management is a critical element of the underwriting process and credit decision. Once it has been determined that the borrower&#8217;s management possesses sound ethics and a solid business acumen, current and projected cash flows are examined to determine the ability of the borrower to repay obligations, as contracted. Commercial non-mortgage, asset-based, and equipment finance loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower, and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Warehouse lending loans are primarily made based on the borrower's ability to originate high-quality, first-mortgage residential loans that can be sold into the agency, government, or private jumbo markets, and secondarily on the underlying cash flows of the borrower. However, the cash flows of borrowers may not be as expected, and the collateral securing these loans, as applicable, may fluctuate in value. Most commercial non-mortgage, asset-based, and equipment finance loans are secured by the assets being financed and may incorporate personal guarantees of the principal balance. Warehouse lending loans are generally uncommitted facilities. 

Commercial real estate loans, including multi-family, are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to those for commercial non-mortgage, asset-based, equipment finance, and warehouse lending loans. These loans are primarily viewed as cash flow loans, and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Repayment of commercial real estate loans is largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan, the market in which the property is located, and the tenants of the property securing the loan. The properties securing the Company&#8217;s commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location, which reduces the Company's exposure to adverse economic events that may affect a particular market. Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral, geography, and risk grade criteria. All transactions are appraised to validate market value. Commercial real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. Management periodically utilizes third-party experts to provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting its commercial real estate loan portfolio. 

Consumer loans are subject to policies and procedures developed to manage the specific risk characteristics of the portfolio. These policies and procedures, coupled with relatively small individual loan amounts and predominately collateralized loan structures, are spread across many different borrowers, minimizing the level of credit risk. Trend and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis, and policies and procedures are modified or developed, as needed. Underwriting factors for residential mortgage and home equity loans include the borrower&#8217;s Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score, the loan amount relative to property value, and the borrower&#8217;s debt-to-income level. Webster Bank originates both qualified mortgage and non-qualified mortgage loans, as defined by applicable Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rules. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases 

The ACL on loans and leases increased $268.2 million, or 89.0%, from $301.2 million at December 31, 2021, to $569.4 million at March 31, 2022, primarily due to the initial ACL of $88.0 million and $175.1 million recorded for PCD and non-PCD loans and leases, respectively, that were acquired from Sterling. The establishment of the initial ACL for PCD loans and leases is net of $48.3 million in charge-offs, which were recognized upon completion of the merger in accordance with GAAP. 

The following table summarizes the percentage allocation of the ACL across the loans and leases categories:

(1) The ACL allocated to a single loan and lease category does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories. 

Methodology 

Webster's ACL on loans and leases is considered to be a critical accounting policy. The ACL on loans and leases is a contra-asset account that offsets the amortized cost basis of loans and leases for the credit losses that are expected to occur over the life of the asset. Executive management reviews and advises on the adequacy of the allowance, which is maintained at a level that management deems to be sufficient to cover expected losses within the loan and lease portfolios. 

The ACL on loans and leases is determined using the CECL model, whereby an expected lifetime credit loss is recognized at the origination or purchase of an asset, including those acquired through a business combination, which is then reassessed at each reporting date over the contractual life of the asset. The calculation of expected credit losses includes consideration of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. Generally, expected credit losses are determined through a pooled, collective assessment of loans and leases with similar risk characteristics. However, if the risk characteristics of a loan or lease change such that it no longer matches that of the collectively assessed pool, it is removed from the population and individually assessed for credit losses. The total ACL on loans and leases recorded by management represents the aggregated estimated credit loss determined through both the collective and individual assessments. 

Collectively Assessed Loans and Leases . Collectively assessed loans and leases are segmented based on product type, credit quality, risk ratings, and/or collateral types within its commercial and consumer portfolios, and expected losses are determined using a Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD), loss rate, or discounted cash flow framework. 

For portfolios using the PD/LGD/EAD framework, credit losses are calculated as the product of the probability of a loan defaulting, expected loss given the occurrence of a default, and the expected exposure of a loan at default. Summing the product across loans over their lives yields the lifetime expected credit losses for a given portfolio. Management's PD and LGD calculations are predictive models that measure the current risk profile of the loan pools using forecasts of future macroeconomic conditions, historical loss information, loan-level risk attributes, and credit risk ratings. The calculation of EAD follows an iterative process to determine the expected remaining principal balance of a loan based on historical paydown rates for loans of a similar segment within the same portfolio. The calculation of portfolio exposure in future quarters incorporates expected losses, the loan's amortization schedule, and prepayment rates. 

Under the loss rate method, expected credit losses are estimated using a loss rate that is multiplied by the amortized cost of the asset at the balance sheet date. For each loan segment identified above, we apply an expected historical loss trend based on third-party loss estimates, correlate them to observed economic metrics and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. Under the discounted cash flow method, expected credit losses are determined by comparing the amortized cost of the asset at the balance sheet date to the present value of estimated future principal and interest payments expected to be collected over the remaining life of the asset. Our loss model generates cash flow projections at the loan level based on reasonable and supportable projections, from which we estimate payment collections adjusted for curtailments, recovery time, probability of default and loss given default. 

Webster's models incorporate an economic forecast scenario and macroeconomic assumptions over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. The development of the reasonable and supportable forecast assumes each macroeconomic variable will revert to long-term expectations, with reversion characteristics unique to specific economic indicators and forecasts. Reversion towards long-term expectations generally begins two to three years from the forecast start date and is complete within three to five years. Certain models revert to mean historical portfolio loss rates on a straight-line basis in the third year of the forecast, and are therefore considered to be explicitly mean reverting at output level. In other models, the reasonable and supportable economic variable forecasts are mean reverting and therefore, the modeled results are considered to be implicitly mean reverting at input level. 

Webster incorporates forecasts of macroeconomic variables in the determination of expected credit losses. Macroeconomic variables are selected for each class of financing receivable based on relevant factors, such as asset type, the correlation of the variables to credit losses, among others. Data from the forecast scenario of these variables is used as an input to the modeled loss calculation. 

A portion of the collective ACL is comprised of qualitative adjustments for risk characteristics that are not reflected or captured in the quantitative models but are likely to impact the measurement of estimated credit losses. Qualitative factors are based on our judgement of the company, market, industry, or business specific data including loan trends, portfolio segment composition, and loan rating or credit scores. Qualitative adjustments may be applied in relation to economic forecasts when relevant facts and circumstances are expected to impact credit losses, particularly in times of significant volatility in economic activity. 

Individually Assessed Loans and Leases . If the risk characteristics of a loan or lease change such that it no longer matches the risk characteristics of the collectively assessed pool, it is removed from the population and individually assessed for credit losses. Generally, all non-accrual loans, TDRs, potential TDRs, loans with a charge-off, and collateral dependent loans where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, are individually assessed. The measurement method used to calculate the expected credit loss on an individually assessed loan or lease is dependent on the type and whether the loan or lease is considered to be collateral dependent. Methods for collateral dependent loans are either based on the fair value of the collateral less estimated cost to sell (when the basis of repayment is the sale of collateral), or the present value of the expected cash flows from the operation of the collateral. For non-collateral dependent loans, either a discounted cash flow method or other loss factor method is used. Any individually assessed loan or lease for which no specific valuation allowance is deemed necessary is either the result of sufficient cash flows or sufficient collateral coverage relative to the amortized cost of the asset. 

Additional information regarding Webster's ACL methodology can be found within Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Asset Quality Ratios 

Webster manages asset quality using risk tolerance levels established through the Company's underwriting standards, servicing, and management of its loan and lease portfolio. Loans and leases for which a heightened risk of loss has been identified are regularly monitored to mitigate further deterioration and preserve asset quality in future periods. Non-performing assets, credit losses, and net charge-offs are considered by management to be key measures of asset quality. 

The following table summarizes key asset quality ratios and their underlying components: (Dollars in thousands) At March 31, 2022 At December 31, 2021 Non-performing loans and leases $ 248,111 $ 109,778 Total loans and leases 43,536,485 22,271,729 Non-performing loans and leases as a percentage of loans and leases 0.57 % 0.49 % Non-performing assets $ 251,206 $ 112,590 Total loans and leases $ 43,536,485 $ 22,271,729 Add: OREO 3,095 2,812 Total loans and leases plus OREO $ 43,539,580 $ 22,274,541 Non-performing assets as a percentage of loans and leases plus OREO 0.58 % 0.51 % Non-performing assets $ 251,206 $ 112,590 Total assets 65,131,484 34,915,599 Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets 0.39 % 0.32 % ACL on loans and leases $ 569,371 $ 301,187 Non-performing loans and leases 248,111 109,778 ACL on loans and leases as a percentage of non-performing loans and leases 229.48 % 274.36 % ACL on loans and leases $ 569,371 $ 301,187 Total loans and leases 43,536,485 22,271,729 ACL on loans and leases as a percentage of loans and leases 1.31 % 1.35 % ACL on loans and leases $ 569,371 $ 301,187 Net charge-offs 35,716 3,829

Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases were 10 basis points for both the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. This was a result of a $7.8 million increase in net charge-offs taken in the commercial non-mortgage portfolio, partially offset by a reduced volume of net charge-offs in the commercial real estate and other consumer portfolios. Commercial real estate and other consumer portfolios contributed to a $4.1 million and $1.1 million decrease, respectively, from the three months ended March 31, 2021, to the three months ended March 31, 2022. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Webster manages its cash flow requirements through proactive liquidity measures at both the Holding Company and Webster Bank in order to maintain stable, cost-effective funding and to promote overall balance sheet strength. The liquidity position of the Company is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to balance sources and uses of funds, as needed. At March 31, 2022, management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s liquidity position, capital resources, or operating activities. Further, management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity, that if implemented, would have a material adverse effect on the Company. 

Cash inflows are provided through a variety of sources, including as operating activities such as principal and interest payments on loans and investments, financing activities, such as unpledged securities that can be sold or utilized to secure funding, and new deposits. Webster is committed to maintaining a strong base of core deposits, which consists of demand, interest-bearing checking, savings, health savings, and money market accounts, in order to support growth in its loan and lease portfolio. 

Holding Company Liquidity. The primary source of liquidity at the Holding Company is dividends from Webster Bank. To a lesser extent, investment income, net proceeds from investment sales, borrowings, and public offerings may provide additional liquidity. The Holding Company generally uses its funds for principal and interest payments on senior notes, subordinated notes, and junior subordinated debt, dividend payments to preferred and common shareholders, repurchases of its common stock, and purchases of investment securities, as applicable. 

There are certain restrictions on Webster Bank's payment of dividends to the Holding Company, which are described within Note 11: Regulatory Capital and Restrictions in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1. Financial Statements, and in the section captioned "Supervision and Regulation" in Part I - Item 1. Business of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, Webster Bank did not pay dividends to the Holding Company. At March 31, 2022, there were $484.7 million of retained earnings available for the payment of dividends by Webster Bank to the Holding Company. On April 27, 2022, Webster Bank was approved to pay the Holding Company $125.0 million in dividends during the second quarter of 2022. 

The quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders remained at $0.40 per common share during the three months ended March 31, 2022. On April 28, 2022, it was announced that Webster Financial Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors had declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share. Webster continues to monitor economic forecasts, anticipated earnings, and its capital position in the determination of its dividend payments. 

Webster maintains a common stock repurchase program, which was approved by the Board of Directors, that authorized management to purchase up to $200.0 million in shares of its common stock as of March 31, 2022. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company repurchased 2,173,936 shares under the program at a weighted-average price of $56.21 per share totaling $122.2 million. The remaining purchase authority at March 31, 2022 was $1.2 million. On April 27, 2022, the Board of Directors increased Webster's authority to repurchase shares of its common stock by $600.0 million in shares. In addition, the Company will periodically acquire common shares outside of the repurchase program related to stock compensation plan activity. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, a total of 318,600 shares were repurchased at a weighted average price of $59.53 per share totaling $19.0 million for this purpose. 

Webster Bank Liquidity. Webster Bank's primary source of funding is core deposits. Including time deposits, Webster Bank had a loan to total deposit ratio of 80.1% and 74.6% at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The 5.5% point increase is attributed to loan growth exceeding deposit growth, both within the legacy and acquired Sterling portfolios. 

Webster Bank is required by OCC regulations to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity to ensure safe and sound operations. The adequacy of liquidity, as assessed by the OCC, depends on factors such as overall asset and liability structure, market conditions, competition, and the nature of the institution&#8217;s deposit and loan customers. At March 31, 2022, Webster Bank exceeded all regulatory liquidity requirements. Webster has designed a detailed contingency plan in order to respond to any liquidity concerns in a prompt and comprehensive manner, including early detection of potential problems and corrective action to address liquidity stress scenarios. 

Capital Requirements. Webster Financial Corporation and Webster Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the Company&#8217;s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, both Webster Financial Corporation and Webster Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items calculated pursuant to regulatory directives. Capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 

Quantitative measures established by the Basel III Capital Rules to ensure capital adequacy require the Company to maintain minimum ratios of CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital to risk-weighted assets, and Tier 1 capital to average tangible assets (as defined in the regulations). At March 31, 2022, both Webster Financial Corporation and Webster Bank were classified as well-capitalized. Management believes that no events or changes have occurred subsequent to quarter-end that would change this designation. 

In accordance with regulatory capital rules, Webster elected an option to delay the estimated impact of the adoption of CECL on its regulatory capital over a two-year deferral period, which ended on January 1, 2022, and subsequent three-year transition period ending on December 31, 2024. During the three-year transition period, capital ratios will begin to phase out the aggregate amount of the regulatory capital benefit provided from the delayed CECL adoption during the initial two years. For 2022, 2023, and 2024, Webster is allowed 75%, 50%, and 25% of the regulatory capital benefit as of December 31, 2021, respectively, with full absorption occurring in 2025. At March 31, 2022, the benefit allowed from the delayed CECL adoption resulted in a 10, 10, and 8 basis point increase to Webster Financial Corporation's and Webster Bank's CET1 capital to total risk-weighted assets (CET1 risk-based capital), Tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets (Tier 1 risk-based capital), and Tier 1 capital to average tangible assets (Tier 1 leverage capital), respectively, and a 2 basis point decrease to Total capital to total risk-weighted assets (Total risk-based capital). Both Webster Financial Corporation's and Webster Bank's regulatory ratios remain in excess of being well-capitalized, even without the benefit of the delayed CECL adoption impact. 

Additional information regarding the required regulatory capital levels and ratios applicable to Webster Financial Corporation and Webster Bank can be found within Note 11: Regulatory Capital and Restrictions in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1. Financial Statements. 

Sources and Uses of Funds 

Sources of Funds . The primary source of cash flows for Webster Bank&#8217;s use in its lending activities and general operational needs is deposits. Operating activities, such as loan and securities repayments, proceeds from loans and securities held for sale, and maturities also provide cash flows. While scheduled loan and securities repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, prepayments and other deposit inflows are influenced by economic conditions and prevailing interest rates, the timing of which is inherently uncertain. Additional sources of funds are provided by both short-term and long-term borrowings, and to a lesser extent, dividends received as part of the Bank's membership with the FHLB and FRB. 

Deposits. Webster Bank offers a wide variety of checking and savings deposit products designed to meet the transactional and investment needs of both its consumer and business customers. The Bank&#8217;s deposit services include, but are not limited to, ATM and debit card use, direct deposit, ACH payments, mobile banking, internet-based banking, banking by mail, account transfers, and overdraft protection, among others. The Bank manages the flow of funds in its deposit accounts and interest rates consistent with Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) regulations. Both Webster Bank&#8217;s Retail Pricing Committee and its Commercial and Institutional Liability Pricing Committee meet regularly to determine pricing and marketing initiatives. 

Total deposits were $54.4 billion and $29.8 billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The $24.6 billion increase was primarily attributed to the deposits assumed from Sterling in the merger. Customer preferences for maintaining liquidity resulted in higher balances across savings and money market accounts, as customers with maturing higher cost time deposits opted to migrate to more liquid products. The aggregate amount of time deposits accounts that exceeded the FDIC limit of $250,000 represented 0.7% and 0.9% of total deposits at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

The following table summarizes daily average balances of deposits by type and the weighted-average rates paid thereon: Three months ended March 31, 2022 2021 (Dollars in thousands) Average Balance Average Rate Average Balance Average Rate Non-interest-bearing: Demand $ 11,263,282 &#8212; % $ 6,436,858 &#8212; % Interest-bearing: Checking 7,699,097 0.06 3,674,761 0.05 Health savings accounts 7,759,465 0.06 7,451,175 0.09 Money market 9,093,101 0.15 3,232,446 0.12 Savings 7,524,238 0.03 5,088,266 0.03 Time deposits 2,544,286 0.21 2,371,026 0.53 Total interest-bearing 34,620,187 0.09 21,817,674 0.12 Total average deposits $ 45,883,469 0.07 % $ 28,254,532 0.09 %

Additional information regarding period-end deposit balances and rates can be found within Note 8: Deposits in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1. Financial Statements. 

Borrowings. Webster Bank's borrowing sources include securities sold under agreements to repurchase, FHLB advances, and long-term debt. The Bank may also purchase term and overnight federal funds to meet its short-term liquidity needs. Total borrowed funds were $1.6 billion and $1.2 billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and represented 2.5% and 3.6% of total assets, respectively. The $0.4 billion increase is primarily attributed to the $0.5 billion increase in long-term debt, partially offset by a $156.2 million decrease in securities sold under agreements to repurchase. 

Webster Bank had additional borrowing capacity from the FHLB of $5.1 billion at both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The Bank also had additional borrowing capacity from the FRB of $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Unpledged investment securities of $6.8 billion at March 31, 2022 could have been used for collateral on borrowings or to increase borrowing capacity by $6.0 billion with the FHLB or $6.7 billion with the FRB. 

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are generally a form of short-term funding for the Bank in which it sells securities to counterparties with an agreement to buy them back in the future at a fixed price. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled $518.7 million and $674.9 million at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The $156.2 million decrease is primarily attributed to borrowings mix and the timing of maturities around close to period end. 

FHLB advances are not only utilized as a source of funding, but also for interest rate risk management purposes. FHLB advances remained flat on a comparative basis, totaling $10.9 million and $11.0 million at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

Long-term debt consists of senior fixed-rate notes maturing in 2024 and 2029 and floating-rate junior subordinated notes maturing in 2033. Long-term debt totaled $1.1 billion and $0.6 billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The $0.5 billion increase is primarily attributed to the subordinated notes assumed from Sterling in the merger. 

The following table summarizes daily average balances of borrowings by type and the weighted-average rates paid thereon: Three months ended March 31, 2022 2021 (Dollars in thousands) Average Balance Average Rate Average Balance Average Rate FHLB advances $ 10,936 2.03 % $ 135,787 1.51 % Securities sold under agreements to repurchase 577,039 0.66 457,694 0.54 Federal funds purchased &#8212; &#8212; 65,034 0.08 Long-term debt 896,310 3.34 567,058 3.23 Total average borrowings $ 1,484,285 2.26 % $ 1,225,573 1.82 %

Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank Stock. Webster Bank is a member of the FHLB System, which consists of eleven district Federal Home Loan Banks, each of which is subject to the supervision and regulation of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. An activity-based capital stock investment in the FHLB is required in order for Webster Bank to maintain its membership and access to advances and other extensions of credit for sources of funds and liquidity purposes. The FHLB capital stock investment is restricted as there is no market for it, and it can only be redeemed by the FHLB. Webster Bank held FHLB capital stock of $17.0 million and $11.3 million at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The most recent FHLB quarterly cash dividend was paid on March 2, 2022 in an amount equal to an annual yield of 2.05%. 

Webster Bank is also required to hold FRB stock equal to 6% of its capital and surplus, of which 50% is paid. The remaining 50% is subject to call when deemed necessary by the Federal Reserve System. Similar to FHLB stock, the FRB capital stock investment is restricted as there is no market for it, and it can only be redeemed by the FRB. Webster Bank held FRB capital stock of $189.1 million and $60.5 million at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The most recent FRB semi-annual cash dividend was paid on December 31, 2021 in an amount equal to an annual yield of 1.52%. 

Webster Bank will change its location for the purposes of Federal Reserve Regulation D from the Federal Reserve District of Boston to the Federal Reserve District of New York on June 1, 2022. 

Uses of Funds. Webster enters into various contractual obligations in the normal course of business that require future cash payments and could impact the Company's short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. The following table summarizes significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations at March 31, 2022. The actual timing and amounts of future cash payments may differ from the amounts presented. Based on Webster's current liquidity position, it is expected that our sources of funds will be sufficient to fulfill these obligations when they come due. 

&#160; &#160;

(1) Interest payments on borrowings have been excluded. 

In addition, in the normal course of business, Webster offers financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of its customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit, and commercial and standby letters of credit, which involve to a varying degree, elements of credit risk. Since many of these commitments are expected to expire unused or be only partially funded, the total commitment amount of $10.8 billion at March 31, 2022 does not necessarily reflect future cash payments. 

Webster also enters into commitments to invest in venture capital and private equity funds, as well as low income housing tax credit investments to assist the Bank in meeting its responsibilities under the CRA. The total unfunded commitment for these alternative investments was $302.3 million at March 31, 2022. However, the timing of capital calls cannot be reasonably estimated, and depending on the nature of the contract, the entirety of the capital committed by Webster may not be called. 

Pension obligations are funded by the Company, as needed, to provide for participant benefit payments as it relates to Webster's frozen, non-contributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan. Decisions to contribute to the defined benefit pension plan are made based upon pension funding requirements under the Pension Protection Act, the maximum amount deductible under the Internal Revenue Code, the actual performance of plan assets, and trends in the regulatory environment. Webster does not currently anticipate that it will make a contribution in 2022. Webster's non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plans and other post employment benefit plans, including those acquired from Sterling in the merger, are unfunded. 

At March 31, 2022, Webster's condensed consolidated balance sheet reflects a liability for uncertain tax positions of $11.7 million and $2.8 million of accrued interest and penalties. The ultimate timing and amount of any related future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty. 

Additional information regarding credit-related financial instruments, alternative investments, defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and income taxes can be found within Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies, Note 12: Variable Interest Entities, Note 16: Retirement Benefit Plans, and the under the section captioned "Income Taxes", respectively, in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1. Financial Statements and Item. 2 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, respectively. 

Asset/Liability Management and Market Risk 

An effective asset/liability management process must balance the risks and rewards from both short-term and long-term interest rate risks when determining management's strategy and action. To facilitate this, interest rate sensitivity is monitored on an ongoing basis by the Asset/Liability Committee (ALCO). The primary goal of ALCO is to manage interest rate risk and to maximize net income and net economic value over time in changing interest rate environments. ALCO meets at least monthly to make decisions on the investment securities and funding portfolios based on the economic outlook, its interest rate expectations, the portfolio risk position, and other factors. 

Four main tools are used for managing interest rate risk: 

&#8226; the size, duration, and credit risk of the investment portfolio; 

&#8226; the size and duration of the wholesale funding portfolio; 

&#8226; interest rate contracts; and 

&#8226; the pricing and structure of loans and deposits. 

Management measures interest rate risk using simulation analysis to calculate Webster's earnings at risk and equity at risk. Essentially, interest rates are assumed to change up or down in a parallel fashion, and the net interest income results in each scenario are compared to a flat rate based scenario. The flat rate scenario holds the end of period yield curve constant over a twelve month forecasted horizon. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the flat rate scenario assumed a federal funds rate of 0.50% and 0.25%, respectively. The federal funds rate target range was 0.25-0.50% at March 31, 2022 and 0-0.25% at December 31, 2021. Due to the lower rate environment, management did not run standard scenarios with negative interest rate assumptions to model the down rate scenarios that were previously modeled when market rates were higher. 

The following table summarizes the estimated impact that gradual parallel changes in interest rates of 100 and 200 basis points might have on Webster's net interest income over a twelve month period starting at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, as compared to actual net interest income and assuming no changes in interest rates: 

-200bp -100bp +100bp +200bp March 31, 2022 n/a n/a 4.5% 9.6% December 31, 2021 n/a n/a 4.9% 10.7% 

Asset sensitivity in terms of net interest income increased at March 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to changes in the overall composition and size of the balance sheet on a combined basis post-merger and the relative size and duration of the securities portfolio. Loans at floors have increased $3.1 billion from $4.5 billion at December 31, 2021 to $7.6 billion at March 31, 2022. While loans with floors, which are considered "in the money", have the impact of reducing overall asset sensitivity, as interest rates start to rise, these loans will move through their floors and begin to reprice accordingly. 

The following table summarizes the estimated impact that yield curve twists or immediate non-parallel changes in interest rates might have on Webster's net interest income for the subsequent twelve month period starting at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021: 

Short End of the Yield Curve Long End of the Yield Curve -100bp -50bp +50bp +100bp -100bp -50bp +50bp +100bp March 31, 2022 n/a n/a 2.8% 5.9% (2.1)% (1.1)% 1.1% 2.3% December 31, 2021 n/a n/a 3.2% 7.3% (3.1)% (1.4)% 1.3% 2.6% 

These non-parallel scenarios are modeled with the short end of the yield curve moving up or down 50 and 100 basis points, while the long end of the yield curve remains unchanged, and vice versa. The short end of the yield curve is defined as terms less than eighteen months and the long end of the yield curve is defined as terms greater than eighteen months. The results reflect the annualized impact of immediate interest rate changes. 

Sensitivity to the short end and long end of the yield curve for net interest income decreased at March 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to changes in the overall composition and size of the balance sheet on a combined basis post-merger, as well as the relative size and duration of the securities portfolio and slower forecasted prepayment speeds as a result of increases in the long end of the yield curve, which in turn, extends the duration for mortgage-backed securities and residential mortgage loans. 

The following table summarizes the estimated economic value of financial assets, financial liabilities, and off-balance sheet financial instruments and the corresponding estimated change in economic value if interest rates were to instantaneously increase or decrease by 100 basis points at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021: 

(Dollars in thousands) Book Value Estimated Economic Value Estimated Economic Value Change -100 bp +100 bp March 31, 2022 Assets $ 65,131,484 $ 62,178,077 n/a $ (1,337,389) Liabilities 56,954,349 52,044,545 n/a (1,871,504) Net $ 8,177,135 $ 10,133,532 n/a $ 534,115 Net change as % base net economic value n/a 5.3 % December 31, 2021 Assets $ 34,915,599 $ 34,515,422 n/a $ (801,524) Liabilities 31,477,274 30,015,357 n/a (988,401) Net $ 3,438,325 $ 4,500,065 n/a $ 186,877 Net change as % base net economic value n/a 4.2 % 

Changes in economic value can best be described through duration, which is a measure of the price sensitivity of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates. For fixed-rate financial instruments, it can be thought of as the weighted-average expected time to receive future cash flows, whereas for floating-rate financial instruments, it can be thought of as the weighted-average expected time until the next rate reset. Overall, the longer the duration, the greater the price sensitivity due to changes in interest rates. Generally, increases in interest rates reduce the economic value of fixed-rate financial assets as future discounted cash flows are worth less at higher interest rates. In a rising interest rate environment, the economic value of financial liabilities decreases for the same reason. A reduction in the economic value of financial liabilities is a benefit to Webster. Floating-rate financial instruments may have durations as short as one day, and therefore, may have very little price sensitivity due to changes in interest rates. 

Duration gap represents the difference between the duration of financial assets and financial liabilities. A duration gap at or near zero would imply that the balance sheet is matched, and therefore, would exhibit no change in estimated economic value for changes in interest rates. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, Webster's duration gap was negative 2.1 years and negative 1.8 years, respectively. A negative duration gap implies that the duration of financial liabilities is longer than the duration of financial assets, and therefore, liabilities have more price sensitivity than assets and will reset their interest rates at a slower pace. Consequently, Webster's net estimated economic value would generally be expected to increase when interest rates rise, as the benefit of the decreased value of financial liabilities would more than offset the decreased value of financial assets. The opposite would generally be expected to occur when interest rates fall. Earnings would also generally be expected to increase when interest rates rise, and decrease when interest rates fall over the long term, absent the effects of any new business booked in the future. At March 31, 2022, long-term rates have risen by 83 basis points as compared to December 31, 2021. This higher starting point extends financial asset duration by decreasing residential mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities prepayment speeds. 

These earnings and economic values estimates are subject to factors that could cause actual results to differ, and also assume that management does not take any additional action to mitigate any positive or negative effects from changing interest rates. Management believes that the Company's interest rate risk position at March 31, 2022 represents a reasonable level of risk given the current interest rate outlook. Management is prepared to take additional action in the event that interest rates do change rapidly. 

Additional information regarding Webster's asset/liability management process can be found under the section captioned "Asset/Liability Management and Market Risk" contained in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of Webster's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and accompanying notes thereto, are based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which can be found within Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1. Financial Statements, and in Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations, and that require management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and which could potentially result in materially different amounts using different assumptions or under different conditions. 

Accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and can be susceptible to significant change in the near term. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on Webster's financial condition or results of operations. Webster's most critical accounting policies and accounting estimates are those related to the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases and business combinations. These critical accounting policies, including its underlying estimates, are discussed directly with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases 

The ACL on loans and leases is a reserve established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense, which represents management&#8217;s best estimate of expected lifetime credit losses within Webster's loan and lease portfolios at the balance sheet date. The calculation of expected credit losses is determined using predictive methods and models that follow a PD/LGD/EAD, loss rate, or discounted cash flow framework, and include consideration of past events, current conditions, macroeconomic variables (such as unemployment, gross domestic product, property values, and interest rate spreads), and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. Changes to the ACL on loans and leases, and therefore, to the related provision for credit losses, can materially affect financial results. 

The determination of the appropriate level of ACL on loans and leases inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires Webster to make significant estimates of current credit risks and trends using existing qualitative and quantitative information and reasonable supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, all of which may undergo frequent and material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers and macroeconomic variables that Webster is more susceptible to, unforeseen events such as natural disasters and pandemics, along with new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problems loans, the fair value of underlying collateral, and other factors, both within and outside the Company's control, may indicate the need for an increase or decrease in the ACL on loans and leases. 

It is difficult to estimate the sensitivity of how potential changes in any one economic factor or input might affect the overall reserve because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in estimating the ACL and changes in those factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types. Further, changes in factors and inputs may also be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others. 

Executive management reviews and advises on the adequacy of the ACL on loans and leases on a quarterly basis. Although the overall balance is determined based on specific portfolio segments and individually assessed assets, the entire balance is available to absorb credit losses for any of the loan and lease portfolios. 

Business Combinations 

The acquisition method of accounting generally requires that the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. The determination of fair value often involves the use of internal or third-party valuation techniques, such as discounted cash flow analyses or appraisals. Particularly, the valuation techniques used to estimate the fair value of loans and leases and the core deposit intangible asset acquired in the Sterling merger include estimates related to discount rates, credit risk, and other relevant factors, which are inherently subjective. A description of the valuation methodologies used to estimate the fair values of the significant assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the Sterling merger can be found within Note 2: Mergers and Acquisitions in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1. Financial Statements.

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Nature of Operations 

Webster Financial Corporation is a bank holding company and financial holding company under the BHC Act, incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 1986, and headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut. Webster Bank is the principal consolidated subsidiary of Webster Financial Corporation. Webster Bank, and its HSA Bank division, deliver a wide range of banking, investment, and financial services to individuals, families, and businesses. Webster Bank serves consumer and business customers with mortgage lending, financial planning, trust, and investment services through a distribution network consisting of banking centers, ATMs, a customer care center, and a full range of web and mobile-based banking services throughout the northeastern U.S. from New York to Massachusetts, with certain businesses operating in extended geographies. Webster Bank also offers equipment financing, warehouse lending, commercial real estate lending, asset-based lending, and treasury management solutions. HSA Bank is a leading provider of HSAs, and delivers health reimbursement arrangements and flexible spending and commuter benefit account administration services to employers and individuals in all 50 states. 

Basis of Presentation 

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Webster have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Certain information and footnote disclosures required by GAAP for complete financial statements have been omitted or condensed. Therefore, the condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with Webster's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the future results that may be attained for the entire year or other interim periods. 

In the opinion of management, all necessary adjustments have been reflected to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the reporting periods presented. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Assets under administration or assets under management that Webster holds or manages in a fiduciary or agency capacity for customers are not included in the consolidated financial statements. 

Reclassifications 

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications did not have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Business Combinations 

Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method, in which the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are generally measured and recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date, with the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired capitalized as goodwill. Items such as acquired right-of-use (ROU) lease assets and operating lease liabilities as lessee, employee benefit plans, and income-tax related balances are recognized in accordance with other applicable GAAP, which may result in measurements that differ from fair value. Business combinations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition. Historical reporting periods reflect only the results of legacy Webster operations. Merger-related costs are expensed in their applicable non-interest expense categories in the period incurred. Additional information regarding Webster's mergers and acquisitions can be found within Note 2: Mergers and Acquisitions. 

Purchased Credit-Deteriorated Loans and Leases 

Purchased credit-deteriorated (PCD) loans and leases are defined as those that have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. Webster considers a variety of factors to evaluate and identify whether acquired loans are PCD, including but not limited to, nonaccrual status, delinquency, TDR classification, partial charge-offs, decreases in FICO scores, risk rating downgrades, and other factors. Upon acquisition, expected credit losses are added to the fair value of individual PCD loans and leases to determine the amortized cost basis. After initial recognition, any changes to the estimate of expected credit losses, favorable or unfavorable, are recorded as a provision for credit loss during the period of change. 

PCD accounting is also applied to loans and leases previously charged-off by the acquiree if Webster has contractual rights to the cash flows at the acquisition date. Webster recognizes an additional allowance for credit loss for these amounts previously charged-off by the acquiree with a corresponding increase to the amortized costs basis. Balances deemed to be uncollectible are immediately charged-off in accordance with Webster&#8217;s charge-off policies, resulting in the establishment of the initial allowance for credit losses for PCD loans and leases to be recorded net of these uncollectible balances. 

Relevant Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted 

In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02&#8212;Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures, which eliminates the accounting guidance for TDRs by creditors in Subtopic 310-40, Receivables&#8212;Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors, while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Specifically, rather than applying the recognition and measurement guidance for TDRs, an entity must apply the loan refinancing and restructuring guidance in paragraphs 310-20-35-9 through 35-11 to determine whether a modification results in a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan. In addition, ASU No. 2022-02 requires that an entity disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of Subtopic 326-20, Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses&#8212;Measured at Amortized Cost in the vintage disclosures required by paragraph 326-20-50-6. 

ASU No. 2022-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied prospectively, however, an entity has the option to apply a modified retrospective transition method related to the recognition and measurement of TDRs, which would result in a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings in the period of adoption. The Company is in the early assessment stage of evaluating the amendments, as well as determining under which transition method it plans to adopt for TDRs. Therefore, the Company is currently unable to reasonably estimate the impact of adoption on the consolidated financial statements. 

Note 2: Mergers and Acquisitions 

Merger with Sterling Bancorp 

On January 31, 2022, Webster completed its previously announced merger with Sterling pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated as of April 18, 2021 (the merger agreement), in which Sterling merged with and into Webster, with Webster continuing as the surviving corporation. Following the merger, on February 1, 2022, Sterling National Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sterling, merged with and into Webster Bank, with Webster Bank continuing as the surviving bank. Sterling was a full-service regional bank headquartered in Pearl River, New York, that primarily served the Greater New York metropolitan area. The merger expanded Webster's geographic footprint and combined two complementary organizations to create one of the largest commercial banks in the northeast U.S. 

Each share of Sterling common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the merger, other than certain shares held by Webster and Sterling, was converted into the right to receive a fixed 0.4630 share of Webster common stock. In connection with the completion of the merger and in accordance with the merger agreement, the number of authorized shares of Webster common stock was increased from 200.0 million shares to 400.0 million shares as of January 31, 2022. Cash was also paid to Sterling common shareholders in lieu of fractional shares, as applicable. 

In addition, each share of Sterling 6.50 % Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the merger was converted into the right to receive one share of newly created Webster 6.50 % Series G Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, having substantially the same terms. On January 31, 2022, Webster registered and issued 5,400,000 depositary shares, each representing 1/40th interest in a share of 6.50 % Series G Non-Cumulative Preferred Perpetual Stock, par value $ 0.01 per share, with a liquidation preference equal to $ 1,000 per share (equivalent to $ 25 per depositary share) (the Series G Preferred Stock). The Series G Preferred Stock ranks on parity with Webster 5.25 % Series F Non-Cumulative Preferred Perpetual Stock, par value $ 0.01 per share, with a liquidation preference of $ 25,000 per share (equivalent to $ 25 per depositary share), and senior to Webster common stock, with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions upon the liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of Webster. 

Series G Preferred Stock dividends are payable quarterly on the fifteenth day of each January, April, July, and December, if and when declared by the Board of Directors. Webster may redeem the Series G Preferred Stock at its option, in whole or in part, subject to the approval of Federal Reserve Board, on October 15, 2022, or any dividend payment date occurring thereafter, or in whole but not in part, upon the occurrence of a regulatory capital treatment event, at a redemption price equal to the liquidation preference plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. 

Further, certain equity awards granted under Sterling's equity compensation plans were converted into a corresponding award with respect to Webster common stock, generally subject to the same terms and conditions, with the number of shares underlying such awards adjusted based on the 0.4630 fixed exchange ratio. 

The following table summarizes the determination of the purchase price consideration: 

(In thousands, except share and price per share data) Webster common stock issued 87,965,239 &#160; Price per share of Webster common stock on January 31, 2022 $ 56.81 &#160; Consideration for outstanding common stock 4,997,305 &#160; Consideration for preferred stock exchanged 138,942 &#160; Consideration for replacement equity awards (1) 

43,877 &#160; Cash in lieu of fractional shares 176 &#160; Total purchase price consideration $ 5,180,300 &#160; 

(1) The fair value of the replacement equity awards issued by Webster and included in the consideration transferred pertain to services performed prior to the merger effective date. The fair value attributed to services performed after the merger effective date will be recognized over the required service vesting period for each award and recorded as compensation and benefits expense on the consolidated statements of income. Webster recognized an incremental $ 2.8 million of stock compensation expense related to the replacement equity awards during the three months ended March 31, 2022. 

The merger was accounted for as a business combination. Accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the merger effective date. The determination of fair value requires management to make estimates about discount rates, future expected cash flows, market conditions, and other future events that are highly subjective in nature and are subject to change. Fair value estimates of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be adjusted for a period up to one year (the measurement period) from the closing date of the merger if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the merger effective date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. 

Webster considers its valuations of loans and leases, tax receivables and payables, and certain other assets and other liabilities to be preliminary, as management continues to identify and assess information regarding the nature of these assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including extended information gathering, management review procedures, and any new information that may arise as a result of integration activities. Accordingly, the amounts recorded for current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are also considered preliminary, as Webster continues to evaluate the nature and extent of permanent and temporary differences between the book and tax bases of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed. While the Company believes that the information available as of January 31, 2022 provides a reasonable basis for estimating fair value, it is possible that additional information may become available during the measurement period that would result in changes to the fair values presented. Any adjustments identified during the measurement period would be recognized in the corresponding reporting period. 

The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Sterling at January 31, 2022:

(1) Includes $ 100.0 million of ROU lease assets and $ 106.9 million of operating lease liabilities reported within premises and equipment and accrued expenses and other liabilities, respectively, which were measured based upon the estimated present value of the remaining lease payments. In addition, ROU lease assets were adjusted for favorable and unfavorable terms of the lease when compared to market terms, as applicable. 

In connection with the merger, Webster recorded $ 1.9 billion of goodwill, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Information regarding the allocation of goodwill to the Company's reportable segments, as well as the carrying amounts and amortization of the core deposit intangible and customer relationship intangible assets, can be found within Note 17: Segment Reporting and Note 7: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, respectively. 

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used to estimate the fair values of the significant assets acquired and liabilities assumed: 

Cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits. The carrying amount of these assets is a reasonable estimate of fair value based on the short-term nature of these assets. 

Investment securities available-for-sale. The fair values for investment securities available-for-sale were based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices were not available, fair value estimates are based on observable inputs, including quoted market prices for similar instruments. Investment securities held-to-maturity were reclassified to investment securities available-for-sale based on the Company's intent at closing. 

Loans and leases. The fair values for loans and leases were estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology that considered factors including the type of loan or lease and the related collateral, classification status, fixed or variable interest rate, remaining term, amortization status, and current discount rates. In addition, the probability of default, loss given default, and prepayment assumptions that were derived based on loan and lease characteristics, historical loss experience, comparable market data, and current and forecasted economic conditions were used to estimate expected credit losses. Loans and leases generally were valued individually. The discount rates used for loans and leases were based on current market rates for new originations or comparable loans and leases and include adjustments for liquidity. The discount rate did not include credit losses as that was included as a reduction to the estimated cash flows. 

Premises and equipment. The fair values for land and buildings were based on appraised values using the cost approach, which estimates the price a buyer would pay if they were to rebuild or reconstruct a similar property on a comparable piece of land. 

Intangible assets. A core deposit intangible asset represents the value of relationships with deposit clients. The fair value of the core deposit intangible asset was estimated using a net cost savings method, a form of discounted cash flow methodology that gave appropriate consideration to expected client attrition rates and other applicable adjustments to the projected deposit balance, the interest cost and net maintenance cost associated with the client deposit base, alternative cost of funds, and a discount rate used to discount the future economic benefits of the core deposit intangible asset to present value. The core deposit intangible asset is being amortized on an accelerated basis over 10 years based upon the period over which the estimated economic benefits are estimated to be received. Customer relationship intangible assets for payroll finance, factoring receivables finance, and wealth businesses were estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology that reflects the estimated value of the future net earnings for each relationship with adjustments for attrition. The customer relationship intangible assets are being amortized on an accelerated basis over their estimated useful life of 10 years. 

Bank-owned life insurance policies. The cash surrender value of these insurance policies is a reasonable estimate of fair value since it reflects the amount that would be realized by the contract owner upon discontinuance or surrender. 

Deposits. The fair values used for the demand and savings deposits by definition equal the amount payable on demand at the merger date. The fair values for time deposits were estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology that applies interest rates currently being offered to the contractual interest rates on such time deposits. 

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings. The carrying amount of these liabilities is a reasonable estimate of fair value based on the short-term nature of these liabilities. 

Long-term debt. The fair values of long-term debt instruments are estimated based on quoted market prices for the instrument, if available, or for similar instruments, if not available, or by using a discounted cash flow methodology based on current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments. 

PCD Loans and Leases 

Purchased loans and leases that have experienced more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination are considered PCD. For PCD loans and leases, the initial estimate of expected credit losses was established through an adjustment to the unpaid principal balance and non-credit discount at acquisition. Subsequent to the merger effective date, Webster recorded an ACL for non-PCD loans and leases of $ 175.1 million through an increase to the provision for credit losses. There was no carryover of Sterling's previously recorded ACL on loans and leases. 

The following table reconciles the unpaid principal balance to the fair value of PCD loans and leases by portfolio segment: 

(In thousands) Commercial Consumer Total Unpaid principal balance $ 3,394,963 &#160; $ 541,471 &#160; $ 3,936,434 &#160; ACL at acquisition ( 115,464 ) ( 20,852 ) ( 136,316 ) Non-credit (discount) ( 40,947 ) ( 2,784 ) ( 43,731 ) Fair value 3,238,552 &#160; 517,835 &#160; 3,756,387 &#160; 

Supplemental Pro Forma Financial Information (Unaudited) 

The following table summarizes supplemental pro forma financial information giving effect to the merger as if it had been completed on January 1, 2021: 

Three months ended March 31, (In thousands) 2022 2021 Net interest income $ 433,349 &#160; $ 463,990 &#160; Non-interest income 114,836 &#160; 116,308 &#160; Net income 183,167 &#160; 21,998 &#160; 

The supplemental pro forma financial information does not necessarily reflect the results of operations that would have occurred had Webster merged with Sterling on January 1, 2021. The supplemental pro forma financial information includes the impact of (i) accreting and amortizing the discounts and premiums associated with the estimated fair value adjustments to acquired loans and leases, investment securities, deposits, and long-term debt, (ii) the amortization of recognized intangible assets, (iii) the elimination of Sterling's historical accretion and amortization of discounts and premiums and deferred origination fees and costs on loans and leases, (iv) the elimination of Sterling's historical accretion and amortization of discounts and premiums on investment securities, and (iv) the related estimated income tax effects. Costs savings and other business synergies related to the merger are not included in the supplemental pro forma financial information. 

In addition, the supplemental pro forma financial information was adjusted to include the $ 108.5 million of merger-related expenses recognized during three months ended March 31, 2022, as summarized in the following table: 

(In thousands) 

Compensation and benefits (1) 

$ 41,585 &#160; Occupancy 356 &#160; Technology and equipment (2) 

19,085 &#160; Professional and outside services (3) 

44,457 &#160; Other expense (4) 

3,012 &#160; Total merger-related expenses $ 108,495 &#160; 

(1) Comprised primarily of severance and employee retention costs. 

(2) Comprised primarily of technology contract termination fees. 

(3) Comprised primarily of advisory, legal, accounting, and other professional fees. 

(4) Comprised primarily of disposals on property and equipment, costs of shareholder matters, and other miscellaneous expenses. 

Webster's operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2022 includes the operating results of acquired assets and assumed liabilities of Sterling subsequent to the merger on January 31, 2022. Due to the various conversions of Sterling systems during the first quarter of 2022, as well as other streamlining and integration of operating activities into those of the Company, historical reporting for the former Sterling operations after January 31, 2022 is impracticable, and thus disclosures of Sterling's revenue and earnings since the merger effective date that are included in the condensed consolidated statements of income for the reporting period is impracticable. 

Bend Financial, Inc. Acquisition 

On February 18, 2022, Webster acquired 100 % of the equity interests of Bend, a cloud-based platform solution provider for HSAs, in exchange for cash of $ 55.3 million. The acquisition accelerates Webster&#8217;s efforts underway to deliver enhanced user experiences at HSA Bank. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination, and resulted in the addition of $ 19.3 million in net assets, which primarily comprises $ 15.9 million of internal use software and a $ 3.0 million customer relationship intangible asset. 

Note 3: Strategic Initiatives 

During the fourth quarter of 2020, Webster launched a strategic plan (the 2020 strategic initiatives) to drive incremental revenue and cost savings measures across the organization through the consolidation of banking centers and corporate facilities, process automation, ancillary spend reduction, and other organizational actions. By the end of 2021, key project milestones had been completed, including the completion of all planned banking center closures, the delivery of a new digital onboarding platform for retail consumers, an investment in foundational technology modernization, and the realignment of certain business banking and investment service operations across the Company's reportable segments. Collectively, these initiatives have contributed to the realization of operational efficiencies and ancillary spend reductions. 

In connection with the Sterling merger, Webster re-evaluated its strategic priorities as a combined organization, which resulted in modifications to the outstanding 2020 strategic initiatives. As a result, the Company released $ 3.8 million from its previously recorded severance accrual during the first quarter of 2022, with a corresponding adjustment to compensation and benefits expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, $ 0.6 million and $ 5.1 million of accrued severance and other benefits associated with the 2020 strategic initiatives was reported within accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, which will be paid out to the impacted employees over the course of 2022. 

Charges related to the 2020 strategic initiatives comprised the following for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021: 

Three months ended March 31, (In thousands) 2022 2021 Compensation and benefits $ ( 3,811 ) $ 2,060 &#160; Occupancy (1)

(1) Comprised primarily of a gain on an early lease termination in 2022 and accelerated depreciation and operating lease costs in 2021.

(1) Fair value represents net carrying value. No ACL has been recorded on available-for-sale debt securities at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, as the securities held are high credit quality and investment grade. 

The increase of $ 4.5 billion in available-for-sale debt securities from December 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022, is primarily attributed to $ 4.4 billion of investment securities acquired from Sterling in the merger, all of which were classified as available-for-sale based on Webster's intent at closing. Accrued interest receivable of $ 41.9 million and $ 7.5 million at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, is excluded from amortized cost and is reported within accrued interest receivable and other assets on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Unrealized Losses 

The following table summarizes the gross unrealized losses and fair value of available-for-sale debt securities by length of time each major security type has been in a continuous unrealized loss position:

Webster assesses each available-for-sale debt security that is in an unrealized loss position to determine whether the decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis resulted from a credit loss or other factors. The increase in unrealized losses from December 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022 is primarily due to increased portfolio size from the merger with Sterling, and higher market rates. Market prices will approach par as the securities approach maturity. 

At March 31, 2022, Webster had the intent to hold available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses through the anticipated recovery period, and it was more-likely-than-not that the Company would not have to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. The issuers of these securities have not, to the Company&#8217;s knowledge, established any cause for default on these securities. As a result, the Company expects to recover the securities' entire amortized cost basis. Accordingly, no available-for-sale debt securities were in non-accrual status and there was no ACL recorded at both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

Contractual Maturities 

The following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale debt securities by contractual maturity: At March 31, 2022 (In thousands) Amortized Cost Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 33,293 &#160; $ 33,216 &#160; Due after one year through five years 1,346,552 &#160; 1,311,044 &#160; Due after five through ten years 1,522,072 &#160; 1,474,896 &#160; Due after ten years 6,171,421 &#160; 5,925,741 &#160; Total available-for-sale debt securities $ 9,073,338 &#160; $ 8,744,897 &#160; 

Available-for-sale debt securities that are not due at a single maturity date have been categorized based on the maturity date of the underlying collateral. Actual principal cash flows may differ from this categorization as borrowers have the right to repay their obligations with or without prepayment penalties. 

Sales of Available-for Sale Debt Securities 

There were no sales of available-for-sale debt securities during the three months ended March 31, 2022, nor during the three months ended March 31, 2021. 

Other Information 

The following table summarizes available-for-sale debt securities pledged for deposits, borrowings, and other purposes:

Accrued interest receivable of $ 17.3 million and $ 21.2 million at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, is excluded from amortized cost and is reported in accrued interest receivable and other assets on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

An ACL on held-to-maturity debt securities is recorded for certain municipal bonds and notes to account for expected lifetime credit losses. Agency securities represent obligations issued by a U.S. government-sponsored enterprise or other federally-related entity and are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed and therefore, assumed to be zero loss. Held-to-maturity debt securities with gross unrealized losses and no ACL are considered to be of high credit quality and therefore, zero credit loss is recorded as of March 31, 2022. The current period unrealized loss position of certain Agency CMBS is primarily attributed to the changing interest rate environment. 

The following table summarizes the activity in the ACL on held-to-maturity debt securities: Three months ended March 31, (In thousands) 2022 2021 Balance, beginning of period $ 214 $ 299 (Benefit) provision for credit losses ( 10 ) 9 Balance, end of period $ 204 $ 308 

Contractual Maturities 

The following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair value of held-to-maturity debt securities by contractual maturity: At March 31, 2022 (In thousands) Amortized Cost Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 2,429 &#160; $ 2,448 &#160; Due after one year through five years 52,963 &#160; 54,861 &#160; Due after five years through ten years 309,859 &#160; 306,139 &#160; Due after ten years 5,997,207 &#160; 5,728,169 &#160; Total held-to-maturity debt securities $ 6,362,458 &#160; $ 6,091,617 &#160; 

Held-to-maturity debt securities that are not due at a single maturity date have been categorized based on the maturity date of the underlying collateral. Actual principal cash flows may differ from this categorization as borrowers have the right to repay their obligations with or without prepayment penalties. 

Credit Quality Information 

The Company monitors the credit quality of held-to-maturity debt securities through credit ratings provided by Standard &#38; Poor's Rating Services (S&#38;P), Moody's Investor Services (Moody's), Fitch Ratings, Inc., Kroll Bond Rating Agency, or DBRS Inc. Credit ratings express opinions about the credit quality of a debt security, and are updated at each quarter end. Investment grade debt securities are rated BBB- or higher by S&#38;P, or Baa3 or higher by Moody's, and are generally considered by the rating agencies and market participants to be of low credit risk. Conversely, debt securities rated below investment grade, which are labeled as speculative grade by the rating agencies, are considered to have distinctively higher credit risk than investment grade debt securities. There were no speculative grade held-to-maturity debt securities at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Held-to-maturity debt securities that are not rated are collateralized with U.S. Treasury obligations.

The increase of $ 21.3 billion in loans and leases from December 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022 is primarily attributed to $ 20.5 billion of loans and leases acquired from Sterling in the merger, which is inclusive of a $ 317.6 million purchase discount. The carrying amount of loans and leases at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 includes net unamortized (discounts)/premiums and net unamortized deferred (costs)/fees totaling $( 124.1 ) million and $ 12.3 million, respectively. Accrued interest receivable of $ 122.6 million and $ 50.7 million at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, is excluded from the carrying amount of loans and leases and is reported within accrued interest receivable and other assets on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. At March 31, 2022, Webster had pledged $ 7.6 billion and $ 0.2 billion of eligible loans as collateral to support borrowing capacity at the FHLB and FRB, respectively.

Credit Quality Indicators 

To measure credit risk for the commercial portfolio, the Company employs a dual grade credit risk grading system for estimating the PD and LGD. The credit risk grade system assigns a rating to each borrower and to the facility, which together form a Composite Credit Risk Profile. The credit risk grade system categorizes borrowers by common financial characteristics that measure the credit strength of borrowers and facilities by common structural characteristics. The Composite Credit Risk Profile has ten grades, with each grade corresponding to a progressively greater risk of loss. Grades (1) to (6) are considered pass ratings, and grades (7) to (10) are considered criticized, as defined by the regulatory agencies. A (7) "Special Mention" rating has a potential weakness that, if left uncorrected, may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset. A (8) "Substandard" rating has a well-defined weakness that jeopardizes the full repayment of the debt. A (9) "Doubtful" rating has all of the same weaknesses as a substandard asset with the added characteristic that the weakness makes collection or liquidation in full given current facts, conditions, and values improbable. Assets classified as a (10) "Loss" rating are considered uncollectible and are charged-off. Risk ratings, which are assigned to differentiate risk within the portfolio, are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised to reflect changes in a borrower's current financial position and outlook, risk profile, and the related collateral and structural position. Loan officers review updated financial information or other loan factors on at least an annual basis for all pass rated loans to assess the accuracy of the risk grade. Criticized loans undergo more frequent reviews and enhanced monitoring. 

The following tables summarize the amortized cost basis of commercial loans and leases by Composite Credit Risk Profile grade and origination year:

To measure credit risk for the consumer portfolio, the most relevant credit characteristic is the FICO score, which is a widely used credit scoring system that ranges from 300 to 850. A lower FICO score is indicative of higher credit risk and a higher FICO score is indicative of lower credit risk. FICO scores are updated at least on a quarterly basis.

Collateral Dependent Loans and Leases 

A loan or lease is considered collateral dependent when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is substantially expected to be provided through the operation or sale of collateral. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the carrying amount of collateral dependent commercial loans and leases totaled $ 102.2 million and $ 16.6 million, respectively, and the carrying amount of collateral dependent consumer loans totaled $ 32.1 million and $ 34.9 million, respectively. Commercial non-mortgage, asset-based, and equipment financing loans and leases are generally secured by machinery and equipment, inventory, receivables, or other non-real estate assets, whereas commercial real estate, multi-family, warehouse lending, residential, home equity, and other consumer loans are secured by real estate. The ACL for collateral dependent loans and leases is individually assessed based on the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell at the reporting date. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the collateral value associated with collateral dependent loans and leases totaled $ 139.9 million and $ 86.0 million, respectively.

(1) Webster de-designated its fair value hedging relationship on these senior notes in 2020. A basis adjustment of $ 37.5 million and $ 38.8 million at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, is included in the carrying value and is being amortized over the remaining life of the senior notes. 

(2) The interest rate on the Webster Statutory Trust I floating-rate notes, which varies quarterly based on 3-month LIBOR plus 2.95 %, was 3.87 % and 3.17 % at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

Webster assumed $ 274.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.00 % fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due on December 30, 2029 (the 2029 subordinated notes) in connection with the Sterling merger. The 2029 subordinated notes were issued by Sterling on December 16, 2019 through a public offering, and are redeemable at a price equal to the total principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, in whole or in part by Webster on December 30, 2024, or any interest payment date thereafter, upon the occurrence of certain specified events. Until December 30, 2024, the interest rate is fixed at 4.00 % and payable semi-annually in arrears on each June 30 and December 30. From December 30, 2024 through the earlier of maturity or redemption, the 2029 subordinated notes will bear interest at a floating rate per annum equal to three-month term SOFR plus 253 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears on each March 30, June 30, September 30, and December 30. 

In addition, Webster assumed $ 225.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.875 % fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due on November 1, 2030 (the 2030 subordinated notes) in connection with the Sterling merger. The 2030 subordinated notes were issued by Sterling on October 30, 2020 through a public offering, and are redeemable at a price equal to the total principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, in whole or in part by Webster on December 30, 2024, or any interest payment date thereafter, upon the occurrence of certain specified events. Until November 1, 2025, the interest rate is fixed at 3.875 % and payable semi-annually in arrears on each May 1 and December 30. From November 1, 2025 through the earlier of maturity or redemption, the 2030 subordinated notes will bear interest at a floating rate per annum equal to three-month term SOFR plus 369 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears on each February 1, May 1, August 1, and November 1. 

Webster recorded the 2029 and 2030 subordinated notes at their estimated fair value of $ 281.0 million and $ 235.9 million, respectively, on the merger effective date. The purchase premiums are being amortized into interest expense over the remaining lives of the subordinated notes.

Note 11: Regulatory Capital and Restrictions 

Capital Requirements 

Webster Financial Corporation and Webster Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the Company&#8217;s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, both Webster Financial Corporation and Webster Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items calculated pursuant to regulatory directives. Capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 

Quantitative measures established by the Basel III Capital Rules to ensure capital adequacy require the Company to maintain minimum ratios of CET1 capital to total risk-weighted assets (CET1 risk-based capital), Tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets (Tier 1 risk-based capital), Total capital to total risk-weighted assets (Total risk-based capital), and Tier 1 capital to average tangible assets (Tier 1 leverage capital), as defined in the regulations. 

CET1 capital consists of common shareholders&#8217; equity less deductions for goodwill and other intangible assets, and certain deferred tax adjustments. Upon adoption of the Basel III Capital Rules, Webster elected to opt-out of the requirement to include certain components of accumulated other comprehensive income in CET1 capital. Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 capital plus preferred stock. Total capital consists of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, as defined in the regulations. Tier 2 capital includes permissible portions of subordinated debt and the allowance for credit losses. 

At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, Webster Financial Corporation and Webster Bank were both classified as well-capitalized. Management believes that no events or changes have occurred subsequent to quarter-end that would change this designation. 

The following table provides information on the capital ratios for Webster Financial Corporation and Webster Bank: At March 31, 2022 &#160; Actual (1)

(1) In accordance with regulatory capital rules, Webster elected an option to delay the estimated impact of the adoption of CECL on its regulatory capital over a two-year deferral period, which ended on January 1, 2022, and a subsequent three-year transition period ending on December 31, 2024. Therefore, the December 31, 2021 capital ratios and amounts exclude the impact of the increased ACL on loans and leases, held-to-maturity debt securities, and unfunded loan commitments related to the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, adjusted for an approximation of the after-tax provision for credit losses attributable to CECL relative to the incurred loss methodology during the deferral period. During the three year transition period, capital ratios will begin to phase out the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided in the initial two years. For 2022, 2023, and 2024, Webster is allowed 75%, 50%, and 25% of the capital benefit as of December 31, 2021, respectively, with full absorption occurring in 2025. 

Dividend Restrictions 

Webster Financial Corporation is dependent upon dividends from Webster Bank to provide funds for the payment of dividends to shareholders and to provide for other cash requirements. Dividends paid by the Bank are subject to various federal and state regulatory limitations. Express approval by the OCC is required if the effect of dividends declared would cause the regulatory capital of the Bank to fall below specified minimum levels or if the amount would exceed the net income for that year combined with the undistributed net income for the preceding two years. During the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, Webster Bank paid no dividends and $ 60.0 million in dividends, respectively, to Webster Financial Corporation, to which no express approval from the OCC was required. 

Cash Restrictions 

Webster Bank is required under Federal Reserve regulations to maintain cash reserve balances in the form of vault cash or deposits held at a Federal Reserve Bank to ensure that it is able to meet customer demands. The reserve requirement ratio is subject to adjustment as economic conditions warrant. Effective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve reset the requirement to zero in order to address liquidity concerns resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Pursuant to this action, the Bank was not required to hold cash reserve balances at both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

Note 12: Variable Interest Entities 

Webster has an investment interest in the following entities that meet the definition of a variable interest entity. 

Consolidated 

Rabbi Trust. The Company established a Rabbi Trust to meet the obligations due under its Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors and Officers and to mitigate expense volatility. The funding of the Rabbi Trust and the discontinuation of the Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors and Officers occurred during 2012. In connection with the Sterling merger, Webster acquired assets held in a separate Rabbi Trust that had been previously established to fund obligations due under the Greater New York Savings Bank Directors' Retirement Plan, which was also assumed from Sterling. 

Investments held in the Rabbi Trusts consist primarily of mutual funds that invest in equity and fixed income securities. Webster is considered the primary beneficiary of these Rabbi Trusts as it has the power to direct the activities of the Rabbi Trusts that most significantly impact its economic performance and it has the obligation to absorb losses and/or the right to receive benefits of the Rabbi Trusts that could potentially be significant. 

The Rabbi Trusts' assets are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Investment earnings are included in other non-interest income, and depending on the nature of the underlying assets in the Rabbi Trusts, fair value changes are either recognized in other non-interest income or in other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax, on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income or on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, respectively. Information regarding the fair value of the Rabbi Trusts' investments can be found within Note 15: Fair Value Measurements. 

Non-Consolidated 

Tax Credit Finance Investments. Webster makes non-marketable equity investments in entities that sponsor affordable housing and other community development projects that qualify for the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) Program pursuant to Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose of these investments is not only to assist the Bank in meeting its responsibilities under the CRA, but also to provide a return, primarily through the realization of tax benefits. While Webster's investment in an entity may exceed 50% of its outstanding equity interests, the entity is not consolidated as the Company is not the primary beneficiary. Webster has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary due to its inability to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance and the Company does not have the obligation to absorb losses and/or the right to receive benefits. Webster applies the proportional amortization method to subsequently measure its investments in qualified affordable housing projects. 

The following table summarizes Webster's LIHTC investments and related unfunded commitments: 

(In thousands) March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 

Gross investment in LIHTC (1) 

$ 584,266 &#160; $ 68,635 &#160; Accumulated amortization ( 35,593 ) ( 25,216 ) Net investment in LIHTC $ 548,673 &#160; $ 43,419 &#160; 

Unfunded commitments for LIHTC investments (1) 

$ 258,297 &#160; $ 11,106 &#160; 

(1) In connection with the Sterling merger, Webster acquired $ 515.6 million of LIHTC investments and assumed $ 267.3 million of unfunded commitments for LIHTC investments on January 31, 2022. 

The aggregate carrying value of Webster's LIHTC investments is included in accrued interest receivable and other assets on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and represents the Company's maximum exposure to loss. The related unfunded commitments are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other than those acquired from Sterling, there were no additional commitments approved to fund LIHTC investments during the three months ended March 31, 2022, and 2021. 

Webster Statutory Trust. Webster owns all the outstanding common stock of Webster Statutory Trust, a financial vehicle that has issued, and in the future may issue, trust preferred securities. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of Webster Statutory Trust. Webster Statutory Trust's only assets are junior subordinated debentures that are issued by the Company, which were acquired using the proceeds from the issuance of trust preferred securities and common stock. The junior subordinated debentures are included in long-term debt on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the related interest expense is reported as interest expense on long-term debt on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Additional information regarding these junior subordinated debentures can be found within Note 9: Borrowings. 

Other Non-Marketable Investments. Webster invests in alternative investments comprising interests in non-public entities that cannot be redeemed since the investment is distributed as the underlying equity is liquidated. The ultimate timing and amount of these distributions cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty. For each of these alternative investments that is classified as a variable interest entity, the Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary due to its inability to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance. The aggregate carrying value of Webster's other non-marketable investments was $ 120.7 million and $ 61.5 million at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, which is included in accrued interest receivable and other assets on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and its maximum exposure to loss, including unfunded commitments, was $ 164.7 million and $ 95.9 million, respectively. Information regarding the fair value of other non-marketable investments can be found within Note 15: Fair Value Measurements. 

Additional Information regarding Webster's consolidation of variable interest entities can be found within Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of the Company's Annual Reporting on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Note 13: Earnings Per Common Share 

The following table summarizes the calculation of basic and diluted (loss) earnings per common share: &#160; Three months ended March 31, (In thousands, except per share data) 2022 2021 Net (loss) income $ ( 16,747 ) $ 108,078 &#160; Less: Preferred stock dividends 3,431 &#160; 1,969 &#160; Net (loss) income available to common shareholders ( 20,178 ) 106,109 &#160; Less: Earnings allocated to participating securities &#8212; &#160; 579 &#160; (Loss) earnings applicable to common shareholders $ ( 20,178 ) $ 105,530 &#160; Weighted-average common shares outstanding - basic 147,394 &#160; 89,809 &#160; Effect of dilutive securities &#8212; &#160; 299 &#160; Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted 147,394 &#160; 90,108 &#160; Basic (loss) earnings per common share $ ( 0.14 ) $ 1.18 &#160; Diluted (loss) earnings per common share ( 0.14 ) 1.17 &#160; 

Earnings per common share is calculated under the two-class method in which all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to common stock and participating securities based on their respective rights to receive dividends. Webster may grant restricted stock, restricted stock units, non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, or stock appreciation rights to certain employees and directors under its stock-based compensation programs, which entitle recipients to receive non-forfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. 

Potential common shares from stock options and performance-based restricted stock awards that were not included in the computation of dilutive earnings per common share because they were anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method were 341,904 for the three months ended March 31, 2022. There were no anti-dilutive stock options nor performance-based restricted shares excluded from the effect of dilutive securities for the three months ended March 31, 2021. 

Note 14: Derivative Financial Instruments 

Derivative Positions and Offsetting 

Derivatives Designated in Hedge Relationships . Interest rate swaps allow the Company to change the fixed or variable nature of an interest rate without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. Certain pay fixed/receive variable interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges to effectively convert variable-rate debt into fixed-rate debt, while certain receive fixed/pay variable interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges to effectively convert fixed-rate long-term debt into variable-rate debt. Certain purchased options are designated as cash flow hedges. Purchased options allow the Company to limit the potential adverse impact of variable interest rates by establishing a cap or floor rate in exchange for an upfront premium. The purchased options designated as cash flow hedges represent interest rate caps where payment is received from the counterparty if interest rates rise above the cap rate, and interest rate floors where payment is received from the counterparty when interest rates fall below the floor rate. 

Derivatives Not Designated in Hedge Relationships. The Company also enters into other derivative transactions to manage economic risks but does not designate the instruments in hedge relationships. Further, the Company enters into derivative contracts to accommodate customer needs. Derivative contracts with customers are offset with dealer counterparty transactions structured with matching terms to ensure minimal impact on earnings. 

The following table presents the notional amounts and fair values, including accrued interest, of derivative positions: At March 31, 2022 Asset Derivatives Liability Derivatives (In thousands) Notional Amounts Fair Value Notional Amounts Fair Value Designated as hedging instruments:

(1) Balances related to clearing houses are presented as a single unit of account. In accordance with their rule books, clearing houses legally characterize variation margin payments as settlement of derivatives rather than collateral against derivative positions. Notional amounts of interest rate swaps cleared through clearing houses include $ 2.0 billion and $ 0.4 billion for asset derivatives and $ 1.5 billion and $ 2.6 billion for liability derivatives at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The related fair values approximate zero . 

(2) Notional amounts related to residential loans exclude approved floating rate commitments of $ 0.9 million at March 31, 2022. 

(3) Other derivatives include foreign currency forward contracts related to lending arrangements and customer hedging activity, a Visa equity swap transaction, and risk participation agreements. Notional amounts of risk participation agreements include $ 68.0 million and $ 66.0 million for asset derivatives and $ 438.8 million and $ 338.2 million for liability derivatives at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, that have insignificant related fair values.

Purchased options designated as cash flow hedges exclude time-value premiums from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Time-value premiums are amortized on a straight-line basis. At March 31, 2022, the remaining unamortized balance of time-value premiums was $ 6.2 million. Over the next twelve months, an estimated $ 1.2 million decrease to interest expense will be reclassified from (AOCL) AOCI relating to cash flow hedges, and an estimated $ 0.3 million increase to interest expense will be reclassified from (AOCL) AOCI relating to hedge terminations. At March 31, 2022, the remaining unamortized loss on terminated cash flow hedges is $ 0.6 million. The maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is 2.3 years. Additional information about cash flow hedge activity impacting (AOCL) AOCI and the related amounts reclassified to interest expense is provided in Note 10: Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income, Net of Tax. Information about the valuation methods used to measure the fair value of derivatives is provided in Note 15: Fair Value Measurements. 

Derivative Exposure. At March 31, 2022, the Company had $ 83.9 million in initial margin collateral posted at clearing houses. In addition, $ 55.2 million of cash collateral received is included in cash and due from banks on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Webster regularly evaluates the credit risk of its derivative customers, taking into account the likelihood of default, net exposures, and remaining contractual life, among other related factors. Credit risk exposure is mitigated as transactions with customers are generally secured by the same collateral of the underlying transactions. Current net credit exposure relating to interest rate derivatives with Webster Bank customers was $ 44.6 million at March 31, 2022. In addition, the Company monitors potential future exposure, representing its best estimate of exposure to remaining contractual maturity. The potential future exposure relating to interest rate derivatives with Webster Bank customers totaled $ 47.8 million at March 31, 2022. Webster has incorporated a valuation adjustment to reflect nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement of its derivatives, which totaled $ 3.3 million and $( 0.4 ) million at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Various factors impact changes in the valuation adjustment over time, including changes in the credit spreads of the parties to the contracts, as well as changes in market rates and volatilities, which affect the total expected exposure of the derivative instruments. 

Note 15: Fair Value Measurements 

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The determination of fair value may require the use of estimates when quoted market prices are not available. Fair value estimates made at a specific point in time are based on management&#8217;s judgments regarding future expected losses, current economic conditions, the risk characteristics of each financial instrument, and other subjective factors that cannot be determined with precision. 

The framework for measuring fair value provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three levels within the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 

&#8226; Level 1: Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that Webster has the ability to access at the measurement date. 

&#8226; Level 2: Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (such as interest rates, rate volatility, prepayment speeds, and credit ratings), or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by market data, correlation, or other means. 

&#8226; Level 3: Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. This includes certain pricing models or other similar techniques that require significant management judgment or estimation. 

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 

Available-for-Sale Investment Securities. When unadjusted quoted prices are available in an active market, Webster classifies available-for-sale investment securities within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. U.S. Treasury notes have a readily determinable fair value, and therefore are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

When quoted market prices are not available, Webster employs an independent pricing service that utilizes matrix pricing to calculate fair value. These fair value measurements consider observable data such as dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, yield curves, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayments speeds, credit information, and the respective terms and conditions for debt instruments. Management maintains procedures to monitor the pricing service's results and has a process in place to challenge their valuations and methodologies that appear unusual or unexpected. Government agency debentures, municipal bonds and notes, Agency CMO, Agency MBS, Agency CMBS, CMBS, CLO, corporate debt, and other securities available-for-sale are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Derivative Instruments . The fair values presented for derivative instruments include any accrued interest. Foreign exchange contracts are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and accordingly are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Except for mortgage banking derivatives, all other derivative instruments are valued using third-party valuation software, which considers the present value of cash flows discounted using observable forward rate assumptions. The resulting fair value is then validated against valuations performed by independent third parties. These derivative instruments are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Mortgage Banking Derivatives . Webster uses forward sales of mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities to manage the risk of loss associated with its mortgage loan commitments and mortgage loans held for sale. Prior to closing and funding certain single-family residential mortgage loans, an interest rate lock commitment is generally extended to the borrower. During this in-between time period, Webster is subject to the risk that market interest rates may change. If rates rise, investors generally will pay less to purchase mortgage loans, which would result in a reduction in the gain on sale of the loans, or possibly a loss. In an effort to mitigate this risk, forward delivery sales commitments are established in which Webster agrees to either deliver whole mortgage loans to various investors or issue mortgage-backed securities. The fair value of mortgage banking derivatives is determined based on current market prices for similar assets in the secondary market. Accordingly, mortgage banking derivatives are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Originated Loans Held For Sale . Webster has elected to measure originated loans held for sale at fair value under the fair value option per ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments. Electing to measure originated loans held for sale at fair value reduces certain timing differences and better reflects the price Webster would expect to receive from the sale of these loans. The fair value of originated loans held for sale is based on quoted market prices of similar loans sold in conjunction with securitization transactions. Accordingly, originated loans held for sale are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

The following table compares the fair value to the unpaid principal balance of originated loans held for sale: At March 31, 2022 At December 31, 2021 (In thousands) Fair Value Unpaid Principal Balance Difference Fair Value Unpaid Principal Balance Difference Originated loans held for sale $ 1,333 &#160; $ 1,974 &#160; $ ( 641 ) $ 4,694 &#160; $ 5,034 &#160; $ ( 340 ) 

Rabbi Trust Investments. Investments held in each of the Rabbi Trusts consist primarily of mutual funds that invest in equity and fixed income securities. Shares of these mutual funds are valued based on the NAV as reported by the trustee of the funds, which represents quoted prices in active markets. Webster has elected to measure the Rabbi Trusts' investments at fair value. Accordingly, the Rabbi Trusts' investments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. At March 31, 2022, the cost basis of the Rabbi Trusts' investments was $ 9.0 million. 

Alternative Investments. Equity investments have a readily determinable fair value when unadjusted quoted prices are available in an active market for identical assets. Accordingly, these alternative investments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. At March 31, 2022, equity investments with a readily determinable fair value had a carrying amount of $ 1.1 million and no remaining unfunded commitment. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, there was a write-down in fair value of $ 0.7 million associated with these alternative investments. 

Equity investments that do not have a readily available fair value may qualify for the NAV practical expedient if they meet certain requirements. Webster's alternative investments measured at NAV consist of investments in non-public entities that cannot be redeemed since investments are distributed as the underlying equity is liquidated. Alternative investments measured at NAV are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. At March 31, 2022, these alternative investments had a carrying amount of $ 72.1 million and a remaining unfunded commitment of $ 18.2 million.

(2) Certain alternative investments are recorded at NAV. Assets measured at NAV are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. 

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 

Webster measures certain assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. 

Alternative Investments. The measurement alternative has been elected for alternative investments without readily determinable fair values that do not qualify for the NAV practical expedient. The measurement alternative requires investments to be measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus adjustments resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Accordingly, these alternative investments are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. At March 31, 2022, the carrying amount of these alternative investments was $ 29.3 million. There were no write-ups due to observable price changes or write-downs due to impairment in the current period. 

Loans Transferred to Held for Sale. Once a decision has been made to sell loans not previously classified as held for sale, these loans are transferred into the held for sale category and carried at the lower of cost or fair value. At the time of transfer into held for sale classification, any amount by which cost exceeds fair value is accounted for as a valuation allowance. This activity generally pertains to commercial loans with observable inputs, and therefore, are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. However, should these loans include adjustments for changes in loan characteristics based on unobservable inputs, the loans would then be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. At March 31, 2022, the carrying amount of loans transferred to held for sale was $ 16.6 million. 

Collateral Dependent Loans and Leases. Loans and leases for which repayment is substantially expected to be provided through the operation or sale of collateral are considered collateral dependent, and are valued based on the estimated fair value of the collateral, less estimated costs to sell at the reporting date, using customized discounting criteria. Accordingly, collateral dependent loans and leases are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Other Real Estate Owned and Repossessed Assets. Other real estate owned (OREO) and repossessed assets are held at the lower of cost or fair value and are considered to be measured at fair value when recorded below cost. The fair value of OREO is calculated using independent appraisals or internal valuation methods, less estimated selling costs, and may consider available pricing guides, auction results, and price opinions. Certain repossessed assets may also require assumptions about factors that are not observable in an active market when determining fair value. Accordingly, OREO and repossessed assets are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. At March 31, 2022, the total book value of OREO and repossessed assets was $ 3.1 million. In addition, the amortized cost of consumer loans secured by residential real estate property that are in process of foreclosure at March 31, 2022 was $ 14.5 million. 

Estimated Fair Values of Financial Instruments and Mortgage Servicing Assets 

Webster is required to disclose the estimated fair values of certain financial instruments and mortgage servicing assets. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used to estimate fair value for those assets and liabilities. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents . Given the short time frame to maturity, the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, which comprises cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits, approximates fair value. Cash and cash equivalents are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Held-to-Maturity Investment Securities . When quoted market prices are not available, Webster employs an independent pricing service that utilizes matrix pricing to calculate fair value. These fair value measurements consider observable data such as dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, yield curves, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayments speeds, credit information, and the respective terms and conditions for debt instruments. Management maintains procedures to monitor the pricing service's results and has a process in place to challenge their valuations and methodologies that appear unusual or unexpected. Held-to-maturity investment securities, which include Agency CMO, Agency MBS, Agency CMBS, CMBS, and municipal bonds and notes, are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Loans and Leases, net . Except for collateral dependent loans and leases, the fair value of loans and leases held for investment is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology, based on future prepayments and market interest rates inclusive of an illiquidity premium for comparable loans and leases. The associated cash flows are then adjusted for associated credit risks and other potential losses, as appropriate. Loans and leases are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Mortgage Servicing Assets . Mortgage servicing assets are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured using the amortization method. Webster assess mortgage servicing assets for impairment each quarter and establishes or adjusts the valuation allowance to the extent that amortized cost exceeds the estimated fair market value. Fair value is calculated as the present value of estimated future net servicing income and relies on market based assumptions for loan prepayment speeds, servicing costs, discount rates, and other economic factors. Accordingly, the primary risk inherent in valuing mortgage servicing assets is the impact of fluctuating interest rates on the related servicing revenue stream. Mortgage servicing assets are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Deposit Liabilities . The fair value of deposit liabilities, which comprises demand deposits, interest-bearing checking, savings, health savings, and money market accounts, reflects the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. Deposit liabilities are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Time Deposits . The fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit is estimated using rates that are currently offered for deposits with similar remaining maturities. Time deposits are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase and Other Borrowings . The fair value of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings that mature within 90 days approximates their carrying value. The fair value of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings that mature after 90 days is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology based on current market rates and adjusted for associated credit risks, as appropriate. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Federal Home Loan Bank Advances and Long-Term Debt . The fair value of FHLB advances and long-term debt is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology in which discount rates are matched with the time period of the expected cash flows and adjusted for associated credit risks, as appropriate. FHLB advances and long-term debt are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

The following table summarizes the carrying amounts, estimated fair values, and classifications within the fair value hierarchy of selected financial instruments and mortgage servicing assets:

(1) Any unamortized premiums/discounts, debt issuance costs, or basis adjustments to long-term debt, as applicable, are excluded from the determination of fair value. 

Note 16: Retirement Benefit Plans 

Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 

The following table summarizes the components of net periodic benefit (income) cost: Three months ended March 31, 2022 2021 (In thousands) Pension Plan SERP OPEB Pension Plan SERP OPEB Service cost $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 6 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Interest cost $ 1,377 &#160; $ 15 &#160; $ 144 &#160; $ 1,166 &#160; $ 7 &#160; $ 4 &#160; Expected return on plan assets ( 3,669 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 3,595 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Amortization of actuarial loss (gain) 422 &#160; 7 &#160; ( 18 ) 1,019 &#160; 8 &#160; ( 20 ) Net periodic benefit (income) cost $ ( 1,870 ) $ 22 &#160; $ 132 &#160; $ ( 1,410 ) $ 15 &#160; $ ( 16 ) 

The components of net periodic benefit (income) cost are included within other non-interest expense on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was 5.50 %, as determined at the beginning of the year. 

In connection with the Sterling merger, Webster assumed the benefit obligations of Sterling's pension and other postretirement benefit plans, which included the Astoria Excess and Supplemental Benefit Plans, Astoria Directors' Retirement Plan, Greater New York Savings Bank Directors' Retirement Plan, Astoria Bank Retiree Health Care Plan, and the Sterling Other Postretirement Life Insurance and Other Plans, totaling $ 30.5 million as of January 31, 2022. The underfunded status of these plans is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Note 17: Segment Reporting 

Webster's operations are organized into three reportable segments that represent its primary businesses: Commercial Banking, HSA Bank, and Consumer Banking. These segments reflect how executive management responsibilities are assigned, how discrete financial information is evaluated, the type of customer served, and how products and services are provided. Certain Treasury activities, along with the amounts required to reconcile profitability metrics to those reported in accordance with GAAP, are included in the Corporate and Reconciling category. 

Effective January 1, 2022, Webster realigned its investment services operations from Commercial Banking to Consumer Banking to better serve its customers and deliver operational efficiencies. Under this realignment, $ 125.4 million of deposits and $ 4.3 billion of assets under administration (off-balance sheet) were reassigned from Commercial Banking to Consumer Banking. There was no goodwill reallocation nor goodwill impairment as a result of the reorganization. In addition, the non-interest expense allocation methodology was modified to exclude certain overhead and merger-related costs that are not directly related to segment performance. Prior period results of operations have been recasted accordingly to reflect the realignment. 

As discussed in Note 2: Mergers and Acquisitions, Webster acquired Sterling on January 31, 2022, and the allocation of the purchase price is considered preliminary. Accordingly, of the total $ 1.9 billion in preliminary goodwill recorded, $ 1.7 billion and $ 0.2 million was preliminarily allocated to Commercial Banking and Consumer Banking, respectively. The $ 36.0 million of goodwill recorded in connection with the Bend acquisition was allocated entirely to HSA Bank. 

Segment Reporting Methodology 

Webster uses an internal profitability reporting system to generate information by reportable segment, which is based on a series of management estimates for funds transfer pricing and allocations for non-interest expense, provision for credit losses, income taxes, and equity capital. These estimates and allocations, certain of which are subjective in nature, are periodically reviewed and refined. Changes in estimates and allocations that affect the results of any one reportable segment do not affect the consolidated financial position or results of operations of Webster as a whole. The full profitability measurement reports, which are prepared for each reportable segment, reflect non-GAAP reporting methodologies. The differences between full profitability and GAAP results are reconciled in the Corporate and Reconciling category. 

Webster allocates interest income and interest expense to each business through an internal matched maturity Funds Transfer Pricing (FTP) process. The goal of the FTP allocation is to encourage loan and deposit growth consistent with the Webster&#8217;s overall profitability objectives. The FTP process considers the specific interest rate risk and liquidity risk of financial instruments and other assets and liabilities in each line of business. Loans and leases are assigned an FTP rate for funds used and deposits are assigned an FTP rate for funds provided. The allocation considers the origination date and the earlier of the maturity date or the repricing date of a financial instrument to assign an FTP rate for loans and leases and deposits originated each day. The FTP process transfers the corporate interest rate risk exposure to the treasury function included within the Corporate and Reconciling category, where such exposures are centrally managed. 

Webster allocates a majority of non-interest expense to each reportable segment using an activity and driver-based costing process. Costs, including shared services and back-office support areas, are analyzed, pooled by process, and assigned to the appropriate reportable segment. The combination of direct revenue, direct expenses, funds transfer pricing, and allocations of non-interest expense, produces PPNR, which is the basis the segments are reviewed by executive management. 

Webster also allocates the provision for credit losses to each reportable segment based on management's estimate of the inherent loss content in each of the specific loan and lease portfolios. The ACL on loans and leases is included in total assets within the Corporate and Reconciling category. Merger-related expenses and strategic initiatives charges are also generally included in the Corporate and Reconciling category.

(1) A portion of loan and lease related fees comprises income generated from factored receivables and payroll financing activities that is within the scope of ASC Topic 606. These revenue streams are new to Webster as of the first quarter of 2022 due to the businesses acquired in connection with the Sterling merger. 

Contracts with customers did not generate significant contract assets and liabilities at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

Revenue Streams 

Deposit service fees consist of fees earned from customer deposit accounts, such as account maintenance fees, insufficient funds, and other transactional service charges. Performance obligations for account maintenance services are satisfied on a monthly basis at a fixed transaction price, whereas performance obligations for other deposit service charges resulting from various customer-initiated transactions are satisfied at a point-in-time when the service is rendered. Payment for deposit service fees is generally received immediately or in the following month through a direct charge to the customers' accounts. On occasion, Webster may waive certain fees for its customers. Fee waivers are recognized as a reduction to revenue in the period the waiver is granted to the customer. Due to the insignificance of the amounts waived, Webster does not reduce its transaction price to reflect any variable consideration. 

The deposit service fees revenue stream also includes interchange fees earned from debit and credit card transactions. The transaction price for interchange services is based on the transaction value and the interchange rate set by the card network. Performance obligations for interchange fees are satisfied at a point-in-time when the cardholders' transaction is authorized and settled. Payment for interchange fees is generally received immediately or in the following month. 

Factored receivables non-interest income consists of fees earned from accounts receivable management services. Webster factors accounts receivable, with and without recourse, for customers whereby the Company purchases their accounts receivable at a discount and assumes the risk, as applicable, and ownership of the assets through direct cash receipt from the end consumer. Factoring services are performed in exchange for a non-refundable fee at a transaction price based on a percentage of the gross invoice amount of each receivable purchased, subject to a minimum required amount. The performance obligation for factoring services is generally satisfied at a point-in-time when the receivable is assigned to Webster. However, should the commission earned not meet or exceed the minimum required amount, the difference between that and the actual amount is recognized over the contract term using a time-based measurement of progress. Other fees associated with factoring receivables may include wire transfer and technology fees, field examination fees, and Uniform Commercial Code fees, where the performance obligations are satisfied at a point-in-time when the services are rendered. Payment from the customer for factoring services is generally received immediately or within the following month. 

Payroll finance non-interest income consists of fees earned from performing payroll financing and business process outsourcing services, including full back-office technology and tax accounting services, along with payroll preparation, making payroll tax payments, invoice billings, and collections for independently-owned temporary staffing companies nationwide. Performance obligations for payroll finance and business processing activities are either satisfied upon completion of the support services or as payroll remittances are made on behalf of customers to fund their employee payroll, which generally occurs on a weekly basis. The agreed-upon transaction price is based on a fixed-percentage per the terms of the contract, which could be subject to a hold-back reserve to provide for any balances that are assessed to be at risk of collection. When Webster collects on amounts due from end consumers on behalf of its customers and at the time of financing payroll, the Company retains the agreed-upon transaction price payable for the performance of its services and remits an amount to the customer net of any advances and payroll tax withholdings, as applicable. 

Wealth and investment services consist of fees earned from asset management, trust administration, and investment advisory services, and through facilitating securities transactions. Performance obligations for asset management and trust administration services are satisfied on a monthly or quarterly basis at a transaction price based on a percentage of the period-end market value of the assets under administration. Payment for asset management and trust administration services is generally received a few days after period-end through a direct charge to the customers' accounts. Performance obligations for investment advisory services are satisfied over the period in which the services are provided through a time-based measurement of progress, and the agreed-upon transaction price with the customer varies depending on the nature of the services performed. Performance obligations for facilitating securities transactions are satisfied at a point-in-time when the securities are sold at a transaction price that is based on a percentage of the contract value. Payment for both investment advisory services and facilitating securities transactions may be received in advance of the service, but generally is received immediately or in the following period, in arrears. 

Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies 

Credit-Related Financial Instruments 

In the normal course of business, Webster offers financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of its customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk. 

The following table summarizes the outstanding amounts of credit-related financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk: (In thousands) At March 31, 2022 At December 31, 2021 Commitments to extend credit $ 10,333,453 &#160; $ 6,870,095 &#160; Standby letters of credit 379,495 &#160; 224,061 &#160; Commercial letters of credit 68,544 &#160; 58,175 &#160; Total credit-related financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk $ 10,781,492 &#160; $ 7,152,331 &#160; 

Webster enters into contractual commitments to extend credit to its customers, such as revolving credit arrangements, term loan commitments, and short-term borrowing agreements, generally with fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and that require payment of a fee. Substantially all of the Company's commitments to extend credit are contingent upon its customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding, and are often secured by real estate collateral. Since the majority of the Company's commitments typically expire without being funded, the total contractual amount does not necessarily represent Webster's future payment requirements. 

Standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee its customers' performance to a third party. In the event the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of its agreement with a third-party, Webster would be required to fund the commitment. The contractual amount of each standby letter of credit represents the maximum amount of potential future payments the Company could be required to make. Historically, the majority of Webster's standby letters of credit expire without being funded. However, if the commitment were funded, the Company has recourse against the customer. Webster's standby letter of credit agreements are often secured by cash or other collateral. 

Commercial letters of credit are issued to finance either domestic or foreign customer trade arrangements. As a general rule, drafts are committed to be drawn when the goods underlying the transaction are in transit. Similar to standby letters of credit, Webster's commercial letter of credit agreements are often secured by the underlying goods subject to trade. 

An ACL is recorded within accrued expenses and other liabilities on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets to provide for the unused portion of commitments to lend that are not unconditionally cancellable by Webster. Under the CECL methodology, the calculation of the allowance generally includes the probability of funding to occur and a corresponding estimate of expected lifetime credit losses on amounts assumed to be funded. Loss calculation factors are consistent with those for funded loans using PD and LGD applied to the underlying borrower's risk and facility grades, a draw down factor applied to utilization rates, relevant forecast information, and management's qualitative factors. 

The following table summarizes the activity in the ACL on unfunded loan commitments: 

Three months ended March 31, (In thousands) 2022 2021 Balance, beginning of period $ 13,104 &#160; $ 12,755 &#160; ACL assumed from Sterling 6,749 &#160; &#8212; &#160; (Benefit) provision for credit losses ( 213 ) 45 &#160; Balance, end of period $ 19,640 &#160; $ 12,800 &#160; 

Litigation 

Webster is subject to certain legal proceedings and unasserted claims and assessments in the ordinary course of business. Legal contingencies are evaluated based on information currently available, including advice of counsel and assessment of available insurance coverage. The Company establishes an accrual for specific legal matters when it determines that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. Once established, each accrual is adjusted to reflect any subsequent developments. Legal contingencies are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings may occur that could cause Webster to either adjust its litigation accrual or incur actual losses that exceed the current estimate, which ultimately could have a material adverse effect, either individually or in the aggregate, on its business, financial condition, or operating results. Webster will consider settlement of cases when it is in the best interests of the Company and its stakeholders. Webster intends to defend itself in all claims asserted against it, and management currently believes that the outcome of these contingencies will not be material, either individually or in the aggregate, to Webster or its consolidated financial position. 

Note 20: Subsequent Events 

On April 27, 2022, the Board of Directors increased the Company's authority to repurchase shares of its common stock by $ 600.0 million in shares under its existing common stock repurchase program, which permits shares to be repurchased in open market or privately negotiated transactions, through block trades, and pursuant to any adopted predetermined trading plan, subject to the availability and trading price of stock, general market conditions, alternative uses for capital, regulatory considerations, and Webster's financial performance. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the remaining repurchase authority under the Company's common stock repurchase program is $ 601.2 million. 

The Company has evaluated subsequent events from the date of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes thereto, through the date of issuance, and determined that other than the above, there were no other significant events identified requiring recognition or disclosure.
