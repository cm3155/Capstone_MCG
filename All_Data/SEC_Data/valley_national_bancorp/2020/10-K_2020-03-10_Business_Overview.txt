The disclosures set forth in this item are qualified by Item 1A&#8212;Risk Factors and the section captioned &#8220;Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; in Item 7&#8212;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report and other cautionary statements set forth elsewhere in this report. 

Valley National Bancorp, headquartered in Wayne, New Jersey, is a New Jersey corporation organized in 1983 and is registered as a bank holding company with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (&#8220;Holding Company Act&#8221;). The words &#8220;Valley,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; refer to Valley National Bancorp and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless we indicate otherwise. At December 31, 2019 , Valley had consolidated total assets of $37.4 billion , total net loans of $29.5 billion , total deposits of $29.2 billion and total shareholders&#8217; equity of $4.4 billion . In addition to its principal subsidiary, Valley National Bank (commonly referred to as the &#8220;Bank&#8221; in this report), Valley owns all of the voting and common shares of GCB Capital Trust III, State Bancorp Capital Trusts I and II, and Aliant Statutory Trust II at December 31, 2019 through which trust preferred securities were issued. These trusts are not consolidated subsidiaries. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. 

Valley National Bank is a national banking association chartered in 1927 under the laws of the United States. Currently, the Bank has 238 branches serving northern and central New Jersey, the New York City boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens, Long Island, Florida and Alabama. The Bank offers a full suite of banking solutions through various commercial, retail, insurance and wealth management financial services products. These products include, but are not limited to, traditional commercial and industrial lending, commercial real estate financing, small business loans, equipment, basic consumer and commercial deposit products, personal financing solutions such as residential mortgages, home equity loans and automobile financing, as well as solutions for homeowners associations and a full service line of cash management solutions. The Bank provides a variety of banking services including automated teller machines, telephone and internet banking, remote deposit capture, overdraft facilities, drive-in and night deposit services, and safe deposit facilities. In addition, certain international banking services are available to customers including standby letters of credit, documentary letters of credit and related products, and certain ancillary services such as foreign exchange transactions, documentary collections, foreign wire transfers, as well as transaction accounts for non-resident aliens. 

Our primary focus is to build and develop profitable customer relationships across all lines of business and create a convenient and innovative omni-channel customer experience beyond our traditional branch footprint, including our recent launch of ValleyDirect on-line savings account. 

Valley National Bank&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiaries are all included in the consolidated financial statements of Valley (See Exhibit 21 at Part IV, Item 15 for a list of subsidiaries). These subsidiaries include, but are not limited to: 

##TABLE_START &#8226;

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

a subsidiary which owns and services New York commercial loans. 

##TABLE_END The Bank&#8217;s subsidiaries also include real estate investment trust subsidiaries (the REIT subsidiaries) which own real estate related investments and a REIT subsidiary, which owns some of the real estate utilized by the Bank and related real estate investments. Except for Valley&#8217;s REIT subsidiaries, all subsidiaries mentioned above are directly or indirectly wholly owned by the Bank. Because each REIT must have 100 or more shareholders to qualify as a REIT, each REIT has issued less than 20 percent of its outstanding non-voting preferred stock to individuals, most of whom are current and former (non-executive officer) Bank employees. The Bank owns the remaining preferred stock and all the common stock of the REITs. 

Recent Acquisitions 

Valley has grown significantly in the past five years primarily through bank acquisitions that expanded our branch footprint into Florida. Recent bank transactions are discussed further below.

##TABLE_END

Oritani Financial Corp. On December 1, 2019, Valley completed its acquisition of Oritani Financial Corp. ("Oritani") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Oritani Bank. Oritani had approximately $4.3 billion in assets, $3.4 billion in net loans, $2.9 billion in deposits, after purchase accounting adjustments, and a branch network of 26 locations. The acquisition represents a significant addition to Valley's New Jersey franchise, and will meaningfully enhance its presence in the Bergen County market. The common shareholders of Oritani received 1.60 shares of Valley common stock for each Oritani share that they owned prior to merger. The total consideration for the acquisition was approximately $835 million , consisting of approximately 71.1 million shares of Valley common stock and the outstanding Oritani stock-based awards. 

USAmeriBancorp, Inc. On January 1, 2018, Valley completed its acquisition of USAmeriBancorp, Inc. (USAB) headquartered in Clearwater, Florida. USAB, largely through its wholly-owned subsidiary, USAmeriBank, had approximately $5.1 billion in assets, $3.7 billion in net loans and $3.6 billion in deposits, after purchase accounting adjustments, and maintained a branch network of 29 offices at December 31, 2018. The acquisition represents a significant addition to Valley&#8217;s Florida presence, primarily in the Tampa Bay market. The acquisition also brought Valley to the Birmingham, Montgomery, and Tallapoosa areas in Alabama, where USAB maintained 15 of its branches. The common shareholders of USAB received 6.1 shares of Valley common stock for each USAB share they owned prior to merger. The total consideration for the acquisition was approximately $737 million, consisting of 64.9 million shares of Valley common stock and the outstanding USAB stock-based awards. 

CNLBancshares, Inc . On December 1, 2015, Valley completed its acquisition of CNLBancshares, Inc. (CNL) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, CNLBank, headquartered in Orlando, Florida, a commercial bank with approximately $1.6 billion in assets, $825 million in loans, $1.2 billion in deposits and 16 branch offices on the date of its acquisition by Valley. The acquired branches allowed us to service Florida's west coast markets of Naples, Bonita Springs, Fort Myers and Sarasota. We also added three offices in the Jacksonville area and expanded our presence in the Orlando market. The common shareholders of CNL received 0.705 of a share of Valley common stock for each CNL share they owned prior to the merger. The total consideration for the acquisition was approximately $230 million, consisting of 20.6 million shares of Valley common stock. 

Business Segments 

Our business segments are reassessed by management, at least on an annual basis, to ensure the proper identification and reporting of our operating segments. Valley currently reports the results of its operations and manages its business through four business segments: commercial lending, consumer lending, investment management, and corporate and other adjustments. Valley&#8217;s Wealth Management Division comprised of trust, asset management and insurance services, is included in the consumer lending segment. See Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for details of the financial performance of our business segments. We offer a variety of products and services within the commercial and consumer lending segments as described below. 

Commercial Lending Segment 

Commercial and industrial loans . Commercial and industrial loans totaled approximately $4.8 billion and represented 16.2 percent of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 . We make commercial loans to small and middle market businesses most often located in New Jersey, New York, Florida and Alabama. Loans originated from Florida accounted for approximately 30 percent of total commercial and industrial loans at December 31, 2019 as compared to 28 percent of such loans at December 31, 2018 . A significant proportion of Valley&#8217;s commercial and industrial loan portfolio is granted to long-standing customers of proven ability, strong repayment performance, and high character. Underwriting standards are designed to assess the borrower&#8217;s ability to generate recurring cash flow sufficient to meet the debt service requirements of loans granted. While such recurring cash flow serves as the primary source of repayment, most of the loans are collateralized by borrower assets intended to serve as a secondary source of repayment should the need arise. Anticipated cash flows of borrowers, however, may not occur as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the ability of the borrower to collect all amounts due from its customers may be impaired. Our loan decisions include consideration of a borrower&#8217;s willingness to repay debts, collateral coverage, standing in the community and other forms of support. Strong consideration is given to long-term existing customers that have maintained a favorable relationship with the Bank. Commercial loan products offered consist of term loans for equipment purchases, working capital lines of credit that assist our customers&#8217; financing of accounts receivable and inventory, and commercial mortgages for owner occupied properties. Working capital advances are generally used to finance seasonal requirements and are repaid at the end of the cycle. Short-term commercial business loans may be collateralized by a lien on accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and/or partly collateralized by real estate. Short-term loans may also be made on an unsecured basis based on a borrower&#8217;s financial strength and past performance. Whenever possible, we obtain the personal guarantee of the borrower&#8217;s principals to mitigate the risk. Unsecured loans, when made, are generally granted to the Bank&#8217;s most creditworthy borrowers. Unsecured commercial and industrial loans totaled $606.1 million at December 31, 2019 . In addition, we provide financing to the health care and industrial equipment leasing market through our leasing subsidiary, Highland Capital Corp.

The commercial portfolio also includes approximately $107.5 million and $7.3 million of New York City and Chicago taxi medallion loans at December 31, 2019 , respectively, which we continue to closely monitor due to the weakness exhibited in the taxi industry caused by strong competition from alternative ride-sharing services. At December 31, 2019 , the medallion portfolio included impaired loans totaling $87.1 million with related reserves of $35.5 million within the allowance for loan losses. While most of the taxi medallion loans within the portfolio at December 31, 2019 are currently performing to their contractual terms, negative trends in the market valuations of the underlying taxi medallion collateral and a decline in borrower cash flows, among other factors, could impact the future performance of this portfolio. See the &#8220;Non-performing Assets&#8221; section of &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; (MD&#38;A) for additional information regarding our taxi medallion loans. 

Commercial real estate loans. Commercial real estate and construction loans totaled $17.6 billion and represented 59.5 percent of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 . We originate commercial real estate loans that are secured by various diversified property types across the New York metropolitan area (New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania) along with Florida and our Alabama footprint. Property types in this portfolio range from multi-family residential properties to non-owner occupied commercial, industrial/warehouse and retail. Loans originated from Florida lending represented 25 percent of the total commercial real estate loans at December 31, 2019 as compared to 28 percent of such loans at December 31, 2018 . Loans are generally written on an adjustable basis with rates tied to a specifically identified market rate index. Adjustment periods generally range between five to ten years and repayment is generally structured on a fully amortizing basis for terms up to thirty years. Commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and industrial loans but generally they involve larger principal balances and longer repayment periods as compared to commercial and industrial loans. Commercial real estate loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real property. Repayment of most loans is dependent upon the cash flow generated from the property securing the loan or the business that occupies the property. Commercial real estate loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy and accordingly, conservative loan to value ratios are required at origination, as well as stress tested to evaluate the impact of market changes relating to key underwriting elements. The properties securing the commercial real estate portfolio represent diverse types, with most properties located within Valley&#8217;s primary markets. With respect to loans to developers and builders, we originate and manage construction loans structured on either a revolving or a non-revolving basis, depending on the nature of the underlying development project. Our construction loans totaling approximately $1.6 billion at December 31, 2019 are generally secured by the real estate to be developed and may also be secured by additional real estate to mitigate the risk. Within our construction portfolio we have a diverse mix of both residential (for sale and rental) and commercial development projects. Non-revolving construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantially all committed funds with repayment substantially dependent on the successful completion and sale, or lease, of the project. Sources of repayment for these types of loans may be from pre-committed permanent loans from other lenders, sales of developed property, or an interim loan commitment from Valley until permanent financing is obtained elsewhere. Revolving construction loans (generally relating to single-family residential construction) are controlled with loan advances dependent upon the presale of housing units financed. These loans are closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, general economic conditions and the availability of long-term financing. 

Consumer Lending Segment 

Residential mortgage loans . Residential mortgage loans totaled $4.4 billion and represented 14.7 percent of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 . Our residential mortgage loans include fixed and variable interest rate loans mostly located in New Jersey, New York and Florida. Valley&#8217;s ability to be repaid on such loans is closely linked to the economic and real estate market conditions in our lending markets. We also make mortgage loans secured by homes beyond this primary geographic area; however, lending outside this primary area is generally made in support of existing customer relationships, as well as targeted purchases of loans guaranteed by third parties. Mortgage loan originations are based on underwriting standards that generally comply with Fannie Mae and/or Freddie Mac requirements. Appraisals and valuations of real estate collateral are contracted through an approved appraisal management company. The appraisal management company adheres to all regulatory requirements. The Bank&#8217;s appraisal management policy and procedure is in accordance with regulatory requirements and guidance issued by the Bank&#8217;s primary regulator. Credit scoring, using FICO &#174; and other proprietary, credit scoring models is employed in the ultimate, judgmental credit decision by Valley&#8217;s underwriting staff. Valley does not use third party contract underwriting services. In deciding whether to originate each residential mortgage, Valley considers the qualifications of the borrower, the value of the underlying property and other factors that we believe are predictive of future loan performance. Valley originated first mortgages include both fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) products with 10-year to 30-year maturities. The adjustable rate loans have a fixed-rate, fixed payment, introductory period of 5 to 10 years that is selected by the borrower. The adjustable rate residential mortgage loans totaled approximately $1.0 billion and $898 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Additionally, Valley began to originate interest-only (i.e., non-amortizing) residential mortgage loans during 2017 due to demand for this type of loan product in the New York City and northern New Jersey markets. Valley's interest-only residential mortgage loans have 15-year to 30-year maturities and totaled $54.6 million (or 1.3 percent of the total residential mortgage loan portfolio) at December 31, 2019 . The

##TABLE_END

Bank is also a servicer of residential mortgage portfolios, and it is compensated for loan administrative services performed for mortgage servicing rights related primarily to loans originated and sold by the Bank. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further details. 

Other consumer loans . Other consumer loans totaled $2.9 billion and represented 9.6 percent of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 . Our other consumer loan portfolio is primarily comprised of direct and indirect automobile loans, loans secured by the cash surrender value of life insurance, home equity loans and lines of credit, and to a lesser extent, secured and unsecured other consumer loans (including credit card loans). Valley is an auto lender in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Florida, Connecticut, Delaware and Alabama offering indirect auto loans secured by either new or used automobiles. Automobile originations (including light truck and sport utility vehicles) are largely produced via indirect channels, originated through approved automobile dealers. Valley acquired an immaterial amount of automobile loans from its bank acquisitions in Florida since 2014, as auto lending was not a focus of the acquired operations. However, we implemented our indirect auto lending model in Florida during 2015, and Alabama in 2018 using our New Jersey based underwriting and loan servicing platform. The relatively new Florida auto dealer network generated over $169 million and $154 million of auto loans in 2019 and 2018 , respectively, while the auto loans originated from Alabama totaled $39.4 million in 2019 as compared to $5.4 million in 2018. Home equity lending consists of both fixed and variable interest rate products mainly to provide home equity loans to our residential mortgage customers or take a secondary position to another lender&#8217;s first lien position within the footprint of our primary lending territories. We generally will not exceed a combined (i.e., first and second mortgage) loan-to-value ratio of 80 percent when originating a home equity loan. Other consumer loans include direct consumer term loans, both secured and unsecured, but are largely comprised of personal lines of credit secured by cash surrender value of life insurance. The product is mainly originated through the Bank&#8217;s retail branch network and third party financial advisors. Unsecured consumer loans totaled approximately $53.9 million , including $8.2 million of credit card loans, at December 31, 2019 . 

Wealth Management. Our Wealth Management and Insurance Services Division provides asset management advisory services, trust services, commercial and personal insurance products, and title insurance. Asset management advisory services include investment services for individuals and small to medium sized businesses, trusts and custom -tailored investment strategies designed for various types of retirement plans. Trust services include living and testamentary trusts, investment management, custodial and escrow services, and estate administration, primarily to individuals. 

Investment Management Segment 

Although we are primarily focused on our lending and wealth management services, a large portion of our income is generated through investments in various types of securities, and depending on our liquid cash position, interest-bearing deposits with banks (primarily the Federal Reserve Bank of New York), as part of our asset/liability management strategies. As of December 31, 2019 , our total investment securities and interest bearing deposits with banks were $3.9 billion and $178.4 million , respectively. See the &#8220;Investment Securities Portfolio&#8221; section of the MD&#38;A and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning our investment securities. 

Changes in Loan Portfolio Composition 

At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , approximately 76 percent and 74 percent , respectively, of Valley&#8217;s gross loans totaling $29.7 billion and $25.0 billion , respectively, consisted of commercial real estate (including construction loans), residential mortgage, and home equity loans. The remaining 24 percent and 26 percent at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, consisted of loans not collateralized by real estate. Valley has no internally planned changes that would significantly impact the current composition of our loan portfolio by loan type. However, we have continued to diversify the geographic concentrations in the New Jersey and New York City Metropolitan area within our loan portfolio primarily through our bank acquisitions in Florida since 2014, including our acquisition of USAB on January 1, 2018. Many external factors outlined in &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221;, the &#8220;Executive Summary&#8221; section of our MD&#38;A, and elsewhere in this report may impact our ability to maintain the current composition of our loan portfolio. See the &#8220;Loan Portfolio&#8221; section of Item 7&#8212;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&#38;A) in this report for further discussion of our loan composition and concentration risks.

Risk Management 

Financial institutions must manage a variety of business risks that can significantly affect their financial performance. Significant risks we confront are credit risks and asset/liability management risks, which include interest rate and liquidity risks. Credit risk is the risk of not collecting payments pursuant to the contractual terms of loan, lease and investment assets. Interest rate risk results from changes in interest rates which may impact the re-pricing of assets and liabilities in different amounts or at different dates. Liquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to fund obligations to loan customers, depositors or other creditors at a reasonable cost. 

Valley&#8217;s Board performs its risk oversight function primarily through several standing committees, including the Risk Committee, all of which report to the full Board. The Risk Committee assists the Board by, among other things, establishing an enterprise-wide risk management framework that is appropriate for Valley&#8217;s capital, business activities, size and risk appetite. The Risk Committee also reviews and recommends to the Board appropriate risk tolerances and limits for strategic, credit, interest rate, liquidity, compliance, operational (including information security risk), reputation and price risk (and ensures that risks are managed within those tolerances), and monitors compliance with applicable laws and regulations. With guidance from and oversight by the Risk Committee, management continually refines and enhances its risk management policies, procedures and monitoring programs to maintain risk management programs and processes. 

In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;EGRRCPA&#8221;) was signed into law. On July 6, 2018, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a joint interagency statement regarding the impact of the EGRRCPA. As a result of this statement and the EGRRCPA, Valley and the Bank are no longer subject to Dodd-Frank Act stress testing requirements. While Valley is no longer required to publish company-run annual stress tests, it continues to internally run stress tests of its capital position that are subject to review by Valley's primary regulators. Additionally, the results of the internal stress tests are considered in combination with other risk management and monitoring practices at Valley to maintain an effective risk management program. 

Cyber Security 

Information security is a significant operational risk for Valley. Information security includes the risk of losses resulting from cyber-attacks. Valley frequently experiences attempted cyber security attacks against its systems. However, to date, none of these incidents have resulted in material losses, known breaches of customer data or significant disruption of services to our customers. Within the past few years, we have significantly increased the resources dedicated to cyber security. We believe that further increases are likely to be required in the future, in anticipation of increases in the sophistication and persistency of cyber-attacks. We employ personnel dedicated to overseeing the infrastructure and systems necessary to defend against cyber security incidents. Senior management is briefed on information and cyber security matters, preparedness and any incidents requiring a response. 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

2019 Form 10-K 

##TABLE_END

Valley&#8217;s Board through its Risk Committee has primary oversight responsibility for information security and receives regular updates and reporting from management on information and cyber security matters, including information related to any third-party assessments of Valley&#8217;s cyber program. The Risk Committee periodically approves Valley&#8217;s information security policies. 

We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures, to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures and if we experienced a cyber security breach of customer data, to make required notifications to customers and disclosure to government officials. As a result, cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of the controls and processes designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access is a high priority for us. While we have faith in our cyber security practices and personnel, we also know we are not immune from a costly and successful attack. 

Credit Risk Management and Underwriting Approach 

Credit risk management. For all loan types, we adhere to a credit policy designed to minimize credit risk while generating the maximum income given the level of risk appetite. Management reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis with subsequent approval by the Board of Directors annually. Credit authority relating to a significant dollar percentage of the overall portfolio is centralized and controlled by the Credit Risk Management Division and by a Credit Committee. A reporting system supplements the review process by providing management with frequent reports concerning loan production, loan quality, internal loan classifications, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies, non-performing, and potential problem loans. Loan portfolio diversification is an important factor utilized by us to manage the portfolio&#8217;s risk across business sectors and through cyclical economic circumstances. 

Our historical and current loan underwriting practice prohibits the origination of payment option adjustable residential mortgages which allow for negative interest amortization and subprime loans. Virtually all of our residential mortgage loan originations in recent years have conformed to rules requiring documentation of income, assets sufficient to close the transactions and debt to income ratios that support the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay under the loan&#8217;s proposed terms and conditions. These rules are applied to all loans originated for retention in our portfolio or for sale in the secondary market. 

Loan underwriting and loan documentation . Loans are well documented in accordance with specific and detailed underwriting policies and verification procedures. General underwriting guidance is consistent across all loan types with possible variations in procedures and due diligence dictated by specific loan requests. Due diligence standards require acquisition and verification of sufficient financial information to determine a borrower&#8217;s or guarantor&#8217;s credit worthiness, capital support, capacity to repay, collateral support, and character. Credit worthiness is generally verified using personal or business credit reports from independent credit reporting agencies. Capital support is determined by acquisition of independent verifications of deposits, investments or other assets. Capacity to repay the loan is based on verifiable liquidity and earnings capacity as shown on financial statements and/or tax returns, banking activity levels, operating statements, rent rolls or independent verification of employment. Finally, collateral valuation is determined via appraisals from independent, bank-approved, certified or licensed property appraisers, valuation services, or readily available market resources. 

Types of collateral. Loan collateral, when required, may consist of any one or a combination of the following asset types depending upon the loan type and intended purpose: commercial or residential real estate; general business assets including working assets such as accounts receivable, inventory, or fixed assets such as equipment or rolling stock; marketable securities or other forms of liquid assets such as bank deposits or cash surrender value of life insurance; automobiles; or other assets wherein adequate protective value can be established and/or verified by reliable outside independent appraisers. In addition to these types of collateral, we, in many cases, will obtain the personal guarantee of the borrower&#8217;s principals or an affiliated corporate entity to mitigate the risk of certain commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans. 

Many times, we will underwrite loans to legal entities formed for the limited purpose of the business which is being financed. Credit granted to these entities and the ultimate repayment of such loans is primarily based on the cash flow generated from the property securing the loan or the business that occupies the property. The underlying real property securing the loans is considered a secondary source of repayment, and normally such loans are also supported by guarantees of the legal entity members. Absent such guarantees or approval by our credit committee, our commercial real estate underwriting guidelines require that the loan to value ratio (at origination) should not exceed 60 percent, except for certain low risk loan categories where the loan to value ratio requirement may be higher, based on the estimated market value of the property as established by an independent licensed appraiser. 

Reevaluation of collateral values . Commercial loan renewals, refinancings and other subsequent transactions that include the advancement of new funds or result in the extension of the amortization period beyond the original term, require a new or updated appraisal. Renewals, refinancings and other subsequent transactions that do not include the advancement of new funds (other than for reasonable closing costs) or, in the case of commercial loans, the extension of the amortization period beyond the original term, do not require a new appraisal unless management believes there has been a material change in market conditions 

##TABLE_START 2019 Form 10-K 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

or the physical aspects of the property which may negatively impact the collectability of our loan. In general, the period of time an appraisal continues to be relevant will vary depending upon the circumstances affecting the property and the marketplace. Examples of factors that could cause material changes to reported values include the passage of time, the volatility of the local market, the availability of financing, the inventory of competing properties, new improvements to, or lack of maintenance of, the subject or competing surrounding properties, changes in zoning and environmental contamination. 

Certain impaired loans are reported at the fair value of the underlying collateral (less estimated selling costs) if repayment is expected solely from the collateral and are commonly referred to as &#8220;collateral dependent impaired loans.&#8221; Collateral values for such loans are typically estimated using individual appraisals performed every 12 months (or 18 months for impaired loans no greater than $1.0 million with current loan to value ratios less than 75 percent). Between scheduled appraisals, property values are monitored within the commercial portfolio by reference to recent trends in commercial property sales as published by leading industry sources. Property values are monitored within the residential mortgage portfolio by reference to available market indicators, including real estate price indices within Valley&#8217;s primary lending areas. 

All refinanced residential mortgage loans require new appraisals for loans held in our loan portfolio. However, certain residential mortgage loans may be originated for sale and sold without new appraisals when the investor (Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac) presents a refinance of an existing government sponsored enterprise loan without the benefit of a new appraisal. Additionally, all loan types are assessed for full or partial charge-off when they are between 90 and 120 days past due (or sooner when the borrowers&#8217; obligation has been released in bankruptcy) based upon their estimated net realizable value. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning our loan portfolio risk elements, credit risk management and our loan charge-off policy. 

Loan Renewals and Modifications 

In the normal course of our lending business, we may renew loans to existing customers upon maturity of the existing loan. These renewals are granted provided that the new loan meets our standard underwriting criteria for such loan type. Additionally, on a case-by-case basis, we may extend, restructure, or otherwise modify the terms of existing loans from time to time to remain competitive and retain certain profitable customers, as well as assist customers who may be experiencing financial difficulties. If the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a concession has been made at the time of such modification, the loan is classified as a troubled debt restructured loan (TDR). 

The majority of the concessions made for TDRs involve lowering the monthly payments on loans through either a reduction in interest rate below a market rate, an extension of the term of the loan without a corresponding adjustment to the risk premium reflected in the interest rate, or a combination of these two methods. The concessions rarely result in the forgiveness of principal or accrued interest. In addition, Valley frequently obtains additional collateral or guarantor support when modifying such loans. If the borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous terms and Valley&#8217;s underwriting process shows the borrower has the capacity to continue to perform under the restructured terms, the loan will continue to accrue interest. Non-accruing restructured loans may be returned to accrual status when there has been a sustained period of repayment performance (generally six consecutive months of payments) and both principal and interest are deemed collectible. 

Extension of Credit to Past Due Borrowers 

Loans are placed on non-accrual status generally when they become 90 days past due and the full and timely collection of principal and interest becomes uncertain. Valley prohibits the advancement of additional funds on non-accrual and TDR loans, except under certain workout plans if such extension of credit is intended to mitigate losses. 

Loans Originated by Third Parties 

From time to time, the Bank makes purchases of commercial real estate loans and loan participations, residential mortgage loans, automobile loans, and other loan types, originated by, and sometimes serviced by, other financial institutions. The purchase decision is usually based on several factors, including current loan origination volumes, market interest rates, excess liquidity, our continuous efforts to meet the credit needs of certain borrowers under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), as well as other asset/liability management strategies. Valley purchased approximately $35 million and $105 million of 1-4 family loans, qualifying for CRA purposes during 2019 and 2018, respectively. All of the purchased loans are selected using Valley&#8217;s normal underwriting criteria at the time of purchase, or in some cases guaranteed by third parties. Purchased commercial and industrial, and commercial real estate participation loans are generally seasoned loans with expected shorter durations. Additionally, each purchased participation loan is stress-tested by Valley to assure its credit quality. 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

2019 Form 10-K 

##TABLE_END

Purchased commercial loans (including commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans), and residential mortgage loans totaled approximately $741.7 million and $955.2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019 representing 3.56 percent, and 21.82 percent of our total commercial and residential mortgage loans, respectively. 

At December 31, 2019 , the commercial real estate loans originated by third parties had loans past due 30 days or more totaling 1.51 percent as compared to 0.12 percent for our total commercial real estate portfolio, including all delinquencies. Residential mortgage loans originated by third parties had loans past due 30 days or more totaling 1.85 percent of these loans at December 31, 2019 as compared to 0.53 percent for our total residential mortgage portfolio. 

Additionally, Valley has performed credit due diligence on the majority of the loans acquired in our bank acquisitions (disclosed under the "Recent Acquisitions" section above) in determining the estimated cash flows receivable from such loans. See the "Loan Portfolio" section of our MD&#38;A of this report below for additional information. 

Competition 

Valley National Bank is one of the largest commercial banks headquartered in New Jersey, with its primary markets located in northern and central New Jersey, the New York City boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens, Long Island, Florida and Alabama. Valley ranked 17th in competitive ranking and market share based on the deposits reported by 187 FDIC-insured financial institutions in the New York, Northern New Jersey and Long Island deposit markets as of June 30, 2019 . The FDIC also ranked Valley 7th, 37th, 22nd, and 16th in the states of New Jersey, New York, Florida, and Alabama, respectively, based on deposit market share as of June 30, 2019 . While our FDIC rankings reflect a solid foundation in our primary markets, the market for banking and bank-related services is highly competitive and we face substantial competition in all phases of our operations. In addition to the FDIC-insured commercial banks in our principal metropolitan markets, we also compete with other providers of financial services such as savings institutions, credit unions, mutual funds, captive finance companies, mortgage companies, title agencies, asset managers, insurance companies and a growing list of other local, regional and national companies which offer various financial services. Many of these competitors may have fewer regulatory constraints, broader geographic service areas, greater capital, and, in some cases, lower cost structures. 

In addition, competition has further intensified as a result of recent changes in regulation, and advances in technology and product delivery systems. We face strong competition for our borrowers, depositors, and other customers from financial technology (fintech) companies that provide innovative web-based solutions to traditional retail banking services and products. Fintech companies tend to have stronger operating efficiencies and fewer regulatory burdens than their traditional bank counterparts, including Valley. Within our markets, we also compete with some of the largest financial institutions in the world that have greater human and financial resources and are able to offer a large range of products and services at competitive rates and prices. In addition, we face an intense competition among direct banks because online banking provides customers the ability to rapidly deposit and withdraw funds and open and close accounts in favor of products and services offered by competitors. Nevertheless, we believe we can compete effectively as a result of utilizing various strategies including our long history of local customer service and convenience as part of a relationship management culture, in conjunction with the pricing of loans and deposits. Our customers are influenced by the convenience, quality of service from our knowledgeable staff, personal contacts and attention to customer needs, as well as availability of products and services and related pricing. We provide such convenience through our banking network of 238 branches, an extensive ATM network, and our telephone and on-line banking systems. Our competitive advantage also lies in our strong community presence with over 90 years of service. This longevity is especially appealing to customers seeking a strong, stable and service-oriented bank. 

We continually review our pricing, products, locations, alternative delivery channels and various acquisition prospects, and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible acquisitions to maintain and enhance our competitive position. 

Personnel 

At December 31, 2019 , Valley National Bank and its subsidiaries employed 3,174 full-time equivalent persons. Management considers relations with its employees to be satisfactory.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

The banking industry is highly regulated. Statutory and regulatory controls increase a bank holding company&#8217;s cost of doing business and limit the options of its management to deploy assets and maximize income. The following discussion is not intended to be a complete list of all the activities regulated by the banking laws or of the impact of such laws and regulations on Valley or Valley National Bank. It is intended only to briefly summarize some material provisions. 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

2019 Form 10-K 

##TABLE_END

Bank Holding Company Regulation 

Valley is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Holding Company Act. As a bank holding company, Valley is supervised by the FRB and is required to file reports with the FRB and provide such additional information as the FRB may require. 

The Holding Company Act prohibits Valley, with certain exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of five percent or more of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than that of banking, managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to subsidiary banks, except that it may, upon application, engage in, and may own shares of companies engaged in, certain businesses found by the FRB to be so closely related to banking &#8220;as to be a proper incident thereto.&#8221; The Holding Company Act requires prior approval by the FRB of the acquisition by Valley of five percent or more of the voting stock of any other bank. Satisfactory capital ratios, Community Reinvestment Act ratings, and anti-money laundering policies are generally prerequisites to obtaining federal regulatory approval to make acquisitions. The policy of the FRB provides that a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support the subsidiary bank in circumstances in which it might not do so absent that policy. Acquisitions through the Bank require approval of the OCC. The Holding Company Act does not place territorial restrictions on the activities of non-bank subsidiaries of bank holding companies. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, discussed below, allows Valley to expand into insurance, securities and other activities that are financial in nature if Valley elects to become a financial holding company. 

Regulation of Bank Subsidiary 

Valley National Bank is subject to the supervision of, and to regular examination by, the OCC. Various laws and the regulations thereunder applicable to Valley and its bank subsidiary impose restrictions and requirements in many areas, including capital requirements, the maintenance of reserves, establishment of new offices, the making of loans and investments, consumer protection, employment practices, bank acquisitions and entry into new types of business. There are various legal limitations, including Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which govern the extent to which a bank subsidiary may finance or otherwise supply funds to its holding company or its holding company&#8217;s non-bank subsidiaries. Under federal law, no bank subsidiary may, subject to certain limited exceptions, make loans or extensions of credit to, or investments in the securities of, its parent or the non-bank subsidiaries of its parent (other than direct subsidiaries of such bank which are not financial subsidiaries) or take their securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. Each bank subsidiary is also subject to collateral security requirements for any loans or extensions of credit permitted by such exceptions. 

Capital Requirements 

The FRB and the OCC have rules establishing a comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations, referred to as the Basel III rules. 

Under Basel III, the minimum capital ratios for us and Valley National Bank are as follows: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

4.5 percent CET1 (common equity Tier 1) to risk-weighted assets. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

6.0 percent Tier 1 capital (i.e., CET1 plus Additional Tier 1) to risk-weighted assets. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

8.0 percent Total capital (i.e., Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

4.0 percent Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the &#8220;leverage ratio&#8221;). 

##TABLE_END As of January 1, 2019, Basel III required us and Valley National Bank to also maintain a 2.5 percent &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; on top of the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0 percent, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5 percent, and (iii) total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5 percent. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets or (iii) total capital to risk-weighted assets above the respective minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers based on the amount of the shortfall. Basel III also provides for a number of complex deductions from and adjustments to its various capital components. 

Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), each federal banking agency has promulgated regulations, specifying the levels at which a financial institution would be considered &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized,&#8221; or &#8220;critically undercapitalized,&#8221; and to take certain mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions based on the capital level of the institution. 

With respect to Valley National Bank, Basel III also revised the &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; regulations of FDICIA, by (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each capital quality level (other than critically undercapitalized); (ii) increasing the 

##TABLE_START 2019 Form 10-K 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category; and (iii) requiring a leverage ratio of 5 percent to be well-capitalized. The OCC&#8217;s regulations implementing these provisions of FDICIA provide that an institution will be classified as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0 percent, (iii) has a CET1 ratio of at least 6.5 percent, (iv) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5.0 percent, and (v) meets certain other requirements. An institution will be classified as &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; if it meets the aforementioned minimum capital ratios under Basel III. An institution will be classified as &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 percent, (iii) has a CET1 ratio of less than 4.5 percent or (iv) has Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4.0 percent. An institution will be classified as &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0 percent, (iii) has a CET1 ratio of less than 3.0 percent or (iv) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 3.0 percent. An institution will be classified as &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a tangible equity to total assets ratio that is equal to or less than 2.0 percent. An insured depository institution may be deemed to be in a lower capitalization category if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating. Similar categories apply to bank holding companies. On January 1, 2019, the capital conservation buffer was fully phased in, and as a result, the capital ratios applicable to depository institutions under Basel III now exceed the ratios to be considered well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations. 

Valley National Bank&#8217;s capital ratios were all above the minimum levels required for it to be considered a &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; financial institution at December 31, 2019 , under the &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; regulations. 

In December 2018, the Federal Banking Agencies issued a final rule to address regulatory capital treatment of credit loss allowances under the current expected credit loss (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) model. The CECL model was effective for Valley as of January 1, 2020. The final rule revised the Federal Banking Agencies&#8217; regulatory capital rules to identify which credit loss allowances under the CECL model are eligible for inclusion in regulatory capital and to provide banking organizations the option to phase in over three years any day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the CECL model. 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act) 

The Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the bank regulatory landscape and has impacted the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. Some of the effects are discussed below. 

The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and shifted most of the federal consumer protection rules applicable to banks and the enforcement power with respect to such rules to the CFPB. 

Under the Durbin Amendment contained in the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) adopted rules applying to banks with more than $10 billion in assets which established a maximum permissible interchange fee equal to no more than 21 cents plus 5 basis points of the transaction value for many types of debit interchange transactions. The FRB also adopted a rule to allow a debit card issuer to recover 1 cent per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraud-related requirements required by the FRB. The FRB also has rules governing routing and exclusivity that require issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product. Because we exceed $10 billion in assets, we are subject to the interchange fee cap. 

On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;EGRRCPA&#8221;) was signed into law. On July 6, 2018, the Fed, the OCC and the FDIC issued a joint interagency statement regarding the impact of the EGRRCPA. As a result of this statement and the EGRRCPA, Valley and the Bank are no longer subject to Dodd-Frank Act stress testing requirements. However, under safety and soundness requirements we will continue to conduct stress testing of our own design. 

Volcker Rule 

The Volcker Rule (contained in the Dodd-Frank Act) prohibits an insured depository institution and its affiliates from: (i) engaging in &#8220;proprietary trading&#8221; and (ii) investing in or sponsoring certain types of funds (Covered Funds). The rule also effectively prohibits most short-term trading strategies investments and prohibits the use of some hedging strategies. We identified no investments held as of December 31, 2019 that meet the definition of Covered Funds. 

Incentive Compensation 

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal bank regulators and the SEC to maintain guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities, including us and our Bank, having at least $1 billion in total assets that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

2019 Form 10-K 

##TABLE_END

The Federal Reserve reviews, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as us, that are not &#8220;large, complex banking organizations.&#8221; These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization&#8217;s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. 

Dividend Limitations 

Valley is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. Valley&#8217;s revenues (on a parent company only basis) result in substantial part from dividends paid by the Bank. The Bank&#8217;s dividend payments, without prior regulatory approval, are subject to regulatory limitations. Under the National Bank Act, without consent, a national bank may declare, in any one year, dividends only in an amount aggregating not more than the sum of its net profits for such year and its retained net profits for the preceding two years. In addition, the bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit us from paying dividends if the supervising agency determines that such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. Among other things, consultation with the FRB supervisory staff is required in advance of our declaration or payment of a dividend to our shareholders that exceeds our earnings for the trailing four-quarter period in which the dividend is being paid. 

Transactions by the Bank with Related Parties 

Valley National Bank&#8217;s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10 percent shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of the National Bank Act, Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Regulation O of the FRB thereunder. Among other things, these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders (i) be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and (ii) not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the Bank&#8217;s capital. In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by the Bank&#8217;s Board of Directors. Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Valley and its subsidiaries, other than the Bank under the authority of Regulation O, may not extend or arrange for any personal loans to its directors and executive officers. 

Section 22 of the Federal Reserve Act prohibits the Bank from paying to a director, officer, attorney or employee a rate on deposits that is greater than the rate paid to other depositors on similar deposits with the Bank. Regulation W governs and limits transactions between the Bank and Valley. 

Community Reinvestment 

Under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), as implemented by OCC regulations, a national bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution&#8217;s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. The CRA requires the OCC, in connection with its examination of a national bank, to assess the association&#8217;s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such association. The CRA also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their CRA ratings. Valley National Bank received an overall &#8220;outstanding&#8221; CRA rating in its most recent examination. 

A bank which does not have a CRA program that is deemed satisfactory or better by its regulator may be prevented from making acquisitions. 

USA PATRIOT Act 

As part of the USA PATRIOT Act, Congress adopted the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001 (the &#8220;Anti Money Laundering Act&#8221;). The Anti Money Laundering Act authorizes the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, in consultation with the heads of other government agencies, to adopt special measures applicable to financial institutions such as banks, bank holding companies, broker-dealers and insurance companies. Among its other provisions, the Anti Money Laundering Act requires each financial institution: (i) to establish an anti-money laundering program; (ii) to establish due diligence policies, procedures and controls that are reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering in United States private banking accounts and correspondent accounts maintained for non-United States persons or their representatives; and (iii) to avoid establishing, maintaining, administering, or managing correspondent accounts in the United States for, or on behalf of, a foreign shell bank that does not have a physical presence in any country. 

Regulations implementing the due diligence requirements require minimum standards to verify customer identity and maintain accurate records, encourage cooperation among financial institutions, federal banking agencies, and law enforcement authorities regarding possible money laundering or terrorist activities, prohibit the anonymous use of &#8220;concentration accounts,&#8221; and require all covered financial institutions to have in place an anti-money laundering compliance program. 

##TABLE_START 2019 Form 10-K 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

The OCC, along with other banking agencies, have strictly enforced various anti-money laundering and suspicious activity reporting requirements using formal and informal enforcement tools to cause banks to comply with these provisions. 

A bank which is issued a formal or informal enforcement requirement with respect to its Anti Money Laundering program will be prevented from making acquisitions. 

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation (OFAC) 

The U.S. Treasury Department&#8217;s OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes, under authority of various laws, including designated foreign countries, nationals and others. OFAC publishes lists of specially designated targets and countries. We and our Bank are responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, such targets and countries, prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required. 

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Supervision 

As a financial institution with more than $10 billion in assets, Valley National Bank is supervised by the CFPB for consumer protection purposes. The CFPB&#8217;s regulation of Valley National Bank is focused on risks to consumers and compliance with the federal consumer financial laws and includes regular examinations of the Bank. The CFPB, along with the Department of Justice and bank regulatory authorities also seek to enforce discriminatory lending laws. In such actions, the CFPB and others have used a disparate impact analysis, which measures discriminatory results without regard to intent. Consequently, unintentional actions by Valley could have a material adverse impact on our lending and results of operations if the actions are found to be discriminatory by our regulators. 

Valley National Bank is subject to federal consumer protection statutes and regulations promulgated under those laws, including, but not limited to the following: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Truth-In-Lending Act and Regulation Z, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C, requiring financial institutions to provide certain information about home mortgage and refinanced loans; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed, or other prohibited factors in extending credit; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V, governing the provision of consumer information to credit reporting agencies and the use of consumer information; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies. 

##TABLE_END Valley National Bank&#8217;s deposit operations are also subject to the following federal statutes and regulations, among others: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

The Truth in Savings Act and Regulation DD, which requires disclosure of deposit terms to consumers; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Regulation CC, which relates to the availability of deposit funds to consumers; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

The Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain the confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E, governing automatic deposits to, and withdrawals from, deposit accounts and customers&#8217; rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services. 

##TABLE_END The CFPB examines Valley National Bank&#8217;s compliance with such laws and the regulations under them. 

Insurance of Deposit Accounts 

The Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. Under the FDIC&#8217;s risk-based system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors with less risky institutions paying lower assessments on their deposits. 

As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has adopted rules that revise the assessment base to consist of average consolidated total assets during the assessment period minus the average tangible equity during the assessment period. In addition, the rules eliminated the adjustment for secured borrowings, including Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances, and made certain other changes to the impact of unsecured borrowings and brokered deposits on an institution&#8217;s deposit insurance assessment. 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

2019 Form 10-K 

##TABLE_END

The rules also revised the assessment rate schedule to provide initial base assessment rates ranging from 5 to 35 basis points and total base assessment rates ranging from 2.5 to 45 basis points after adjustment. The Dodd-Frank Act made permanent a $250 thousand limit for federal deposit insurance. 

In 2016, the FDIC added a surcharge to the insurance assessments for banks with over $10 billion in assets, which became effective in July 2016 and continued until the Bank's December 2018 assessment invoice, which covered the assessment period from July 1, 2018 through September 30, 2018.

Central banks around the world, including the Fed, have commissioned working groups of market participants and official sector representatives with the goal of finding suitable replacements for the London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) based on observable market transactions because of the probable phase out of LIBOR. It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates will occur over the course of the next year. This change may have an adverse impact on the value of, return on and trading markets for a broad array of financial products, including any LIBOR-based securities, loans and derivatives that are included in our financial assets and liabilities. A transition away from LIBOR also requires extensive changes to the contracts that govern these LIBOR-based products, as well as our systems and processes. A number of the Bank's commercial loans, certain residential loans, derivative positions, trust preferred securities issued to our capital trusts, and the reset provisions for our preferred stock issuances are based upon LIBOR. The Bank has established a working group to identify and prepare replacement provisions. 

Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements 

Banks are subject to the prohibitions of 12 U.S.C. Section 1972 on certain tying arrangements. A depository institution is prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.
