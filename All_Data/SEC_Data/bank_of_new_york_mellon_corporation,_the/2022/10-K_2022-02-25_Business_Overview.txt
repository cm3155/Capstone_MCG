Competition 

BNY Mellon is subject to competition in all aspects and areas of our business. Our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services businesses compete with domestic and international financial services firms that offer custody services, corporate trust services, clearing services, collateral management services, credit services, securities brokerage, foreign exchange services, derivatives, depositary receipt services and integrated cash management solutions and related products, as well as a wide range of technology service providers, such as financial services data processing firms. Our Investment and Wealth Management business competes with domestic and international investment management and wealth management firms, hedge funds, investment banking companies and other financial services companies, including trust banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies, as well as a wide range of technology service providers. 

Competition in the financial services industry continues to be intense. Competition is based on a number of factors including, among others, customer service and convenience, transaction execution, capital or access to capital, quality and range of products and services offered, performance, technological innovation and expertise, price, reputation and lending limits. Competition also varies based on the types of clients, customers, industries and geographies served. Our ability to continue to compete effectively also depends in large part on our ability to attract new employees and retain 

and motivate our existing employees, while managing compensation and other costs. Our competitive position may be affected by institutions that are not similarly subject to extensive regulation, and as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services. 

For additional discussion regarding competition, see &#8220;MD&#38;A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Strategic Risk &#8211; We are subject to competition in all aspects of our business, which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability&#8221; and &#8220;MD&#38;A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Operational Risk &#8211; Our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate employees&#8221; in the Annual Report, which are incorporated herein by reference.
