“our,” “we,” “us,” “BNY Mellon,” the “Company” and
similar terms refer to The Bank of New York Mellon
Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. The term
“Parent” refers to The Bank of New York Mellon
Corporation but not its subsidiaries.

Certain business terms used in this report are defined in the
Glossary included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended Dec. 31, 2020 (“2020 Annual Report”).

The following should be read in conjunction with the

Overview

Established in 1784 by Alexander Hamilton, we were the
first company listed on the New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE: BK). With a history of more than 235 years, BNY
Mellon is a global company that manages and services
assets for financial institutions, corporations and individual
investors in 35 countries.

BNY Mellon has two business segments, Investment
Services and Investment and Wealth Management, which
offer a comprehensive set of capabilities and deep
expertise across the investment lifecycle, enabling the
Company to provide solutions to buy-side and sell-side
market participants, as well as leading institutional and
wealth management clients globally.

Other segment.

Key second quarter 2021 and subsequent events

Share repurchase program and increase in cash dividend
on common stock

In June 2021, our Board of Directors approved the
repurchase of up to $6.0 billion of common stock starting
in the third quarter of 2021 and continuing through the
fourth quarter of 2022.

Additionally, in July, our Board of Directors approved a
10% increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common
stock, from $0.31 to $0.34 per share. This increased
quarterly cash dividend will be paid on Aug. 9, 2021.

 
Highlights of second quarter 2021 results

 Capital and liquidity

Net income applicable to common shareholders was $991
million, or $1.13 per diluted common share, in the second
quarter of 2021. Net income applicable to common
shareholders was $901 million, or $1.01 per diluted
common share, in the second quarter of 2020. The
highlights below are based on the second quarter of 2021
compared with the second quarter of 2020, unless
otherwise noted.

• Total revenue of $4.0 billion decreased 1%, primarily

reflecting:

• Fee revenue increased 4%, primarily reflecting the
positive impact of higher markets, the favorable
impact of a weaker U.S. dollar and higher client
volumes, partially offset by money market fee
waivers. (See “Fee and other revenue” beginning on
page 7.)

• Other revenue decreased primarily reflecting lower
gains related to seed capital investments. (See “Fee
and other revenue” beginning on page 7.)

• Net interest revenue decreased 17%, primarily

reflecting lower interest rates on interest-earning
assets. This was partially offset by the benefit of
lower funding and deposit rates, lower debt
balances, a larger securities portfolio and higher
deposit balances. (See “Net interest revenue” on
page 11.)

• Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $86 million

primarily driven by an improvement in the
macroeconomic forecast. (See “Consolidated balance
sheet review – Allowance for credit losses” beginning
on page 31.)

• Noninterest expense increased 3%, primarily reflecting

the unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar,
investments in efficiency and growth initiatives and
higher revenue-related expenses. (See “Noninterest
expense” on page 14.)

• Effective tax rate of 19.0%. (See “Income taxes” on

page 14.)

• CET1 ratio was 12.6% at June 30, 2021, unchanged
compared with March 31, 2021. Capital generated
through earnings was offset by capital deployed through
common stock repurchases and dividends, and higher
risk-weighted assets. (See “Capital” beginning on page
38.)

• Tier 1 leverage was 6.0% at June 30, 2021, compared
with 5.8% at March 31, 2021. The increase reflects
capital generation and lower average assets. (See
“Capital” beginning on page 38.)

• Repurchased 12.8 million common shares for $618

million.

Highlights of our principal businesses

Investment Services

• Total revenue decreased 4%.

the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar.

Investment and Wealth Management
• Total revenue increased 13%.

•

Income before income taxes increased 48%.

• AUM of $2.3 trillion increased 18%, primarily

reflecting higher market values, the favorable impact of
a weaker U.S. dollar (principally versus the British
pound) and net inflows.

Impact of coronavirus pandemic on our business

See “Impact of coronavirus pandemic on our business” in
our 2020 Annual Report for the areas of our business that
have been impacted and could continue to be impacted by
the coronavirus pandemic and its effect on the global
macroeconomic environment. The following updates those
disclosures.

Short-term interest rates have remained low through the
second quarter of 2021, which has continued to result in
lower net interest revenue and higher money market fee
waivers. This has been partially offset by higher average
deposit balances and higher money market balances
compared with 2020.

Equity market levels have continued to improve in the first
six months of 2021, resulting in increased asset-based fees
in Investment Services and Investment and Wealth
Management.

The macroeconomic outlook continued to improve through
the first and second quarters of 2021, resulting in decreases
in the allowance for credit losses and benefits to the
provision for credit losses.

 The restrictions on common stock dividends and share
repurchases ended on June 30, 2021.

It is difficult to forecast the impact of the coronavirus,
together with related public health measures, on our results
with certainty because so much depends on how the health
crisis evolves and its impact on the global economy, as
well as actions taken by central banks and governments to
support the economy and the availability, use and
effectiveness of vaccines.

The current macroeconomic environment has also resulted
in responses by governmental and regulatory bodies. See
“Supervision and Regulation – Pandemic-Related
Measures” in our 2020 Annual Report for additional
information on legislative and regulatory developments in
response to the coronavirus pandemic.

For further discussion of the current and potential impact
of the coronavirus pandemic, see “Risk Factors – The
coronavirus pandemic is adversely affecting us and creates
significant risks and uncertainties for our business, and the
ultimate impact of the pandemic on us will depend on
future developments, which are highly uncertain and
cannot be predicted,” in our 2020 Annual Report.


(a)    Asset servicing fees include the fees from the Clearance and Collateral Management business and also include securities lending revenue of $45

million in the second quarter of 2021, $45 million in the first quarter of 2021, $56 million in the second quarter of 2020, $90 million in the first six
months of 2021 and $107 million in the first six months of 2020.

(b)    Clearing services fees are almost entirely earned by our Pershing business.
(c)    In the first quarter of 2021, we reclassified certain items within total revenue on the consolidated income statement and reclassified prior periods to be

comparable with the current period presentation. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

(d)    Consists of AUC/A primarily from the Asset Servicing business and, to a lesser extent, the Clearance and Collateral Management, Issuer Services,

Pershing and Wealth Management businesses. Includes the AUC/A of CIBC Mellon of $1.7 trillion at June 30, 2021, $1.6 trillion at March 31, 2021
and $1.3 trillion at June 30, 2020.

(e)    Excludes securities lending cash management assets and assets managed in the Investment Services business.
N/M – Not meaningful.

Fee revenue increased 4% compared with the second
quarter of 2020 and decreased 1% compared with the first
quarter of 2021. The increase compared with the second
quarter of 2020 primarily reflects higher investment
management and performance fees, asset servicing fees
and treasury services fees, partially offset by lower
financing-related fees and foreign exchange revenue. The
decrease compared with the first quarter of 2021 primarily
reflects lower foreign exchange revenue and clearing
services fees, partially offset by higher issuer services fees.

Other revenue decreased $50 million compared with the
second quarter of 2020 and increased $82 million
compared with the first quarter of 2021. The decrease
compared with the second quarter of 2020 primarily
reflects lower gains related to seed capital investments. The
increase compared with the first

 quarter of 2021 primarily reflects a $39 million impairment
related to a renewable energy investment recorded in the
first quarter of 2021, gains from other investments and
disposals, and higher other income.

Money market fee waivers

Given the continued low short-term interest rates, money
market mutual fund fees and other similar fees are being
waived to protect investors from negative returns. The fee
waivers have primarily impacted fee revenues in Pershing
and Investment Management, but also resulted in lower
distribution and servicing expense. The fee waivers also
began to impact fee revenues in our other businesses in the
second half of 2020. Money market fee waivers are highly
sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates and are
difficult to predict. Assuming no change in money market

BNY Mellon 7

 
balances, we expect to recover over 50% of the pre-tax
income related to fee waivers with a 25 basis point increase
in the Fed Funds rate and we expect to recover nearly
100% of the pre-tax income related to fee waivers when
the Fed Funds rate increases 100 basis points.

 net of distribution and servicing expense. In the second
quarter of 2021, the net impact of money market fee
waivers was $252 million, up from $188 million in the first
quarter of 2021, driven by lower short-term interest rates
and higher money market balances.

The following table presents the impact of money market
fee waivers on our consolidated fee revenue,
 
We expect the impact from money market fee waivers, net
of distribution and servicing expense, to approximate $225
million in the third quarter of 2021, based on implied
forward rates and money market balances as of the end of
the second quarter of 2021. Fee waivers in subsequent
periods will continue to be dependent on short-term
interest rates and the level of money market balances.

Investment services fees

Investment services fees increased 3% compared with the
second quarter of 2020 and 1% compared with the first
quarter of 2021, reflecting the following:

• Asset servicing fees increased 2% compared with the
second quarter of 2020 and was up slightly compared
with the first quarter of 2021. The increase compared
with the second quarter of 2020 primarily reflects
higher client activity, market values and tri-party
collateral management balances, partially offset by
higher

8 BNY Mellon

money market fee waivers, and lower intraday credit
fees and clearance volumes. The slight increase
compared with the first quarter of 2021 primarily
reflects higher tri-party collateral management
balances, partially offset by higher money market fee
waivers and lower clearance volumes.

• Clearing services fees increased 1% compared with the
second quarter of 2020 and decreased 4% compared
with the first quarter of 2021. The increase compared
with the second quarter of 2020 primarily reflects
higher market values, client activity and balances,
partially offset by higher money market fee waivers.
The decrease compared with the first quarter of 2021
primarily reflects lower clearance volumes, partially
offset by higher market values.

•

Issuer services fees increased 1% compared with the
second quarter of 2020 and 15% compared with the
first quarter of 2021. Both increases

 
 
primarily reflect higher Depositary Receipts revenue,
partially offset by money market fee waivers in
Corporate Trust. The increase compared with the
second quarter of 2020 also reflects higher Corporate
Trust revenue.

•

Treasury services fees increased 11% compared with
the second quarter of 2020 and 2% compared with the
first quarter of 2021. The increase compared with the
second quarter of 2020 primarily reflects higher
payment volumes. The increase compared with first
quarter of 2021 primarily reflects net new business.

See “Investment Services business” in “Review of
businesses” for additional details.

Investment management and performance fees

Investment management and performance fees increased
13% compared with the second quarter of 2020 and
decreased slightly compared with the first quarter of 2021.
The increase compared with the second quarter of 2020
primarily reflects the impact of higher market values, the
favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar, higher
performance fees and net inflows, partially offset by higher
money market fee waivers. The decrease compared with
the first quarter of 2021 primarily reflects the timing of
performance fees and higher money market fee waivers,
offset by the impact of higher market values, equity
investment gains and net inflows. Performance fees were
$14 million in the second quarter of 2021, $5 million in the
second quarter of 2020 and $40 million in the first quarter
of 2021. On a constant currency basis (Non-GAAP),
investment management and performance fees increased
9% compared with the second quarter of 2020.

AUM was $2.3 trillion at June 30, 2021, an increase of
18% compared with June 30, 2020, primarily reflecting
higher market values, the favorable impact of a weaker
U.S. dollar (principally versus the British pound) and net
inflows.

See “Investment and Wealth Management business” in
“Review of businesses” for additional details regarding the
drivers of investment management and performance fees,
AUM and AUM flows.

 Foreign exchange revenue

Foreign exchange revenue is primarily driven by the
volume of client transactions and the spread realized on
these transactions, both of which are impacted by market
volatility, the impact of foreign currency hedging activities
and foreign currency remeasurement gain (loss). In the
second quarter of 2021, foreign exchange revenue totaled
$184 million, decreases of 5% compared with the second
quarter of 2020 and 20% compared with the first quarter of
2021. The decrease compared with the second quarter of
2020 primarily reflects lower volatility, partially offset by
higher volumes. The decrease compared with the first
quarter of 2021 primarily reflects lower volumes and
volatility. Foreign exchange revenue is primarily reported
in the Investment Services business and, to a lesser extent,
the Investment and Wealth Management business and the
Other segment.

Financing-related fees

Financing-related fees, which are primarily reported in the
Investment Services business, include capital market fees,
loan commitment fees and credit-related fees. Financing-
related fees totaled $48 million in the second quarter of
2021, $58 million in the second quarter of 2020 and $51
million in the first quarter of 2021. Both decreases
primarily reflect lower underwriting fees.

Investment and other income

Investment and other income includes income or loss from
consolidated investment management funds, seed capital
gains or losses, other trading revenue or loss, renewable
energy investments losses, corporate and bank-owned life
insurance contracts, other investment gains or losses, gains
or losses from disposals, expense reimbursements from our
CIBC Mellon joint venture and other income or loss. The
income or loss from consolidated investment management
funds should be considered together with the net income or
loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, which reflects
the portion of the consolidated funds for which we do not
have an economic interest and is reflected below net
income as a separate line item on the consolidated income
statement. Other trading revenue or loss primarily includes
the impact of market-risk hedging activity related to our
seed capital investments in investment management funds,
non-foreign currency derivative

BNY Mellon 9

 
and fixed income trading, and other hedging activity.
Investments in renewable energy generate losses in other
income that are more than offset by benefits and credits
recorded to the provision for income taxes. Other
investment gains or losses includes fair value changes of
non-readily marketable equity securities,

 private equity and other investments. Expense
reimbursements from our CIBC Mellon joint venture relate
to expenses incurred by BNY Mellon on behalf of the
CIBC Mellon joint venture. Other income or loss includes
various miscellaneous revenues.

The following table provides the components of investment and other income.

(a)    In the first quarter of 2021, we reclassified certain items within total revenue on the consolidated income statement and reclassified prior periods to be

comparable with the current period presentation. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

(b)    Includes gains (losses) on investments in BNY Mellon funds which hedge deferred incentive awards.
(c)    Includes strategic equity, private equity and other investments.

Investment and other income was $89 million in the
second quarter of 2021 compared with $132 million in the
second quarter of 2020 and $9 million in the first quarter of
2021. The decrease compared with the second quarter of
2020 primarily reflects lower gains related to seed capital
investments reflected in the income from consolidated
investment management funds and seed capital gains
(losses) line items. The increase compared with the first
quarter of 2021 primarily reflects the $39 million
impairment related to a renewable energy investment
recorded in the first quarter of 2021, gains from other
investments and disposals and higher other income.

Year-to-date 2021 compared with year-to-date 2020

Fee revenue increased 2% compared with the first six
months of 2020, primarily reflecting higher investment
management and performance fees and

 asset servicing fees, partially offset by lower foreign
exchange revenue and financing-related fees. The 8%
increase in investment management and performance fees
primarily reflects higher market values, the favorable
impact of a weaker U.S. dollar, equity investment gains
and net inflows, partially offset by higher money market
fee waivers. The 3% increase in asset servicing fees
primarily reflects higher client activity, market values and
the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar, partially
offset by money market fee waivers.

The decrease in other revenue primarily reflects one-time
fees in the Asset Servicing and Pershing businesses
recorded in the first six months of 2020, an impairment
related to a renewable energy investment recorded in the
first quarter of 2021 and lower derivative and fixed income
trading results, partially offset by higher gains related to
seed capital.

(a)    Net interest revenue (FTE) – Non-GAAP and net interest margin (FTE) – Non-GAAP include the tax equivalent adjustments on tax-exempt income

which allows for comparisons of amounts arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practice. The adjustment to
an FTE basis has no impact on net income.

N/M – Not meaningful.
bps – basis points.

Net interest revenue decreased 17% compared with the
second quarter of 2020 and 2% compared with the first
quarter of 2021. The decrease compared with the second
quarter of 2020 primarily reflects lower interest rates on
interest-earning assets, partially offset by the benefit of
lower funding and deposit rates, lower debt balances, a
larger securities portfolio and higher deposit balances. The
decrease compared with the first quarter of 2021 was
primarily driven by lower interest rates on interest-earning
assets, partially offset by the benefit of lower funding and
deposit rates.

Net interest margin decreased 21 basis points compared
with the second quarter of 2020 and increased 1 basis point
compared with the first quarter of 2021. The decrease
compared with the second quarter of 2020 primarily
reflects the factors mentioned above.

Average interest-earning assets increased 9% compared
with the second quarter of 2020 and decreased 2%
compared with the first quarter of 2021. The increase
compared with the second quarter of 2020 primarily
reflects higher interest-bearing deposits with the Federal
Reserve and other central banks, a larger securities
portfolio and higher loan balances. The decrease compared
with the first quarter of 2021 primarily reflects lower
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and
other central banks, partially offset by higher loan
balances.

 Average non-U.S. dollar deposits comprised approximately
25% of our average total deposits in the second quarter of
2021. Approximately 40% of the average non-U.S. dollar
deposits in the second quarter of 2021 were euro
denominated.

Net interest revenue in future periods will depend on the
level and mix of client deposits and deposit rates, as well
as the level and shape of the yield curve, which may result
in lower yields on interest-earning assets.

Due to lower interest rates, net interest revenue has been
trending lower and we expect net interest revenue to
decrease in 2021 compared with 2020.

Year-to-date 2021 compared with year-to-date 2020

Net interest revenue decreased 18% compared with the
first six months of 2020, primarily driven by lower interest
rates on interest-earning assets, partially offset by the
benefit of lower deposit and funding rates, a larger
securities portfolio, higher deposit balances and lower debt
balances. The decrease in the net interest margin primarily
reflects the factors mentioned above.

Average interest-earning assets increased 15% compared
with the first six months of 2020. The increase primarily
reflects higher interest-bearing deposits with the Federal
Reserve and other central banks and a larger securities
portfolio.


(a)    Includes the average impact of offsetting under enforceable netting agreements of approximately $41 billion for the second quarter of 2021, $37 billion for the first

quarter of 2021 and $67 billion for the second quarter of 2020. On a Non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of offsetting, the yield on federal funds sold and securities
purchased under resale agreements would have been 0.15% for the second quarter of 2021, 0.19% for the first quarter of 2021 and 0.26% for the second quarter of 2020.

On a Non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of offsetting, the rate on federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements would have been (0.04)%
for the second quarter of 2021, (0.02)% for the first quarter of 2021 and 0.00% for the second quarter of 2020. We believe providing the rates excluding the impact of

netting is useful to investors as it is more reflective of the actual rates earned and paid.

(b)    In the second quarter of 2021, we reclassified the impact of hedging within the categories comprising total investment securities to align the impact of hedging with the

securities being hedged and reclassified prior periods to be comparable. The change reduced the income and average rates previously reported for U.S. government

obligations and U.S. government agency obligations and increased the income and average rates for Other securities.

(c)    Average rates were calculated on an FTE basis, at tax rates of approximately 21%.
(d)    See “Net interest revenue” on page 11 for the reconciliation of this Non-GAAP measure.

(a)    Includes the average impact of offsetting under enforceable netting agreements of approximately $39 billion for the first six months of 2021 and $73 billion for the first six

months of 2020. On a Non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of offsetting, the yield on federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements would have
been 0.17% for the first six months of 2021 and 0.87% for the first six months of 2020. On a Non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of offsetting, the rate on federal funds

purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements would have been (0.03)% for the first six months of 2021 and 0.64% for the first six months of 2020. We
believe providing the rates excluding the impact of netting is useful to investors as it is more reflective of the actual rates earned and paid.

(b)    In the second quarter of 2021, we reclassified the impact of hedging within the categories comprising total investment securities to align the impact of hedging with the

obligations and U.S. government agency obligations and increased the income and average rates for Other securities.

 Year-to-date 2021 compared with year-to-date 2020

Noninterest expense increased 4% compared with the first
six months of 2020, primarily reflecting investments in
efficiency and growth initiatives, the unfavorable impact of
a weaker U.S. dollar and higher revenue-related expenses,
partially offset by lower distribution and servicing, net
occupancy and business development (travel and
marketing) expenses.

Income taxes

BNY Mellon recorded an income tax provision of $241
million (19.0% effective tax rate) in the second quarter of
2021, $216 million (18.3% effective tax rate) in the second
quarter of 2020 and $221 million (19.2% effective tax rate)
in the first quarter of 2021. For additional information, see
Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Total noninterest expense increased 3% compared with the
second quarter of 2020 and decreased 3% compared with
the first quarter of 2021. The increase compared with the
second quarter of 2020 primarily reflects the unfavorable
impact of a weaker U.S. dollar, investments in efficiency
and growth initiatives and higher revenue-related expenses.
The investments in efficiency and growth initiatives are
primarily included in staff, software and equipment, and
professional, legal and other purchased services expenses.
The decrease compared with the first quarter of 2021
primarily reflects lower staff expense driven by increased
expense for awards to retirement eligible employees
recorded in the first quarter of 2021.

We expect total reported noninterest expense to increase
approximately 3% for the full-year 2021 compared to
2020. This is driven by an unfavorable impact of foreign
exchange rates, incremental investments in growth and
efficiency opportunities and higher volume- and revenue-
related expenses, partially offset by the impact of 2020
notable items, which were litigation expense, severance
and real estate charges. Notable items comprised 1% of
total noninterest expense in 2020. Noninterest expense
could be impacted if foreign exchange rates change from
June 30, 2021 levels, volume- and revenue-related
expenses increase or there are unexpected charges or
expenses.

Review of businesses

We have an internal information system that produces
performance data along product and service lines for our
two principal businesses, Investment Services and
Investment and Wealth Management, and the Other
segment.

Business accounting principles

Our business data has been determined on an internal
management basis of accounting, rather than the generally
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) used for
consolidated financial reporting. These measurement
principles are designed so that reported results of the
businesses will track their economic performance.

For information on the accounting principles of our
businesses, see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. For information on the primary
products and services in each line of business, the primary
types of revenue by business and how our businesses are
presented and analyzed, see Note 24 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2020 Annual
Report.

Business results are subject to reclassification when
organizational changes are made, or for refinements in
revenue and expense allocation methodologies.
Refinements are typically reflected on a prospective basis.
There were no reclassification or organizational changes in
the second quarter of 2021.

The results of our businesses may be influenced by client
and other activities that vary by quarter. In the first quarter,
staff expense typically increases reflecting the vesting of
long-term stock awards for retirement-eligible employees.
In the third quarter, Depositary Receipts revenue is
typically higher due to an increased level of client dividend
payments. Also in the third quarter, volume-related fees
may decline

Investment Services business

 due to reduced client activity, and staff expense typically
increases reflecting the annual employee merit increase. In
the fourth quarter, we typically incur higher business
development and marketing expenses; however, 2020 was
an exception given the impact of the coronavirus
pandemic. In our Investment and Wealth Management
business, performance fees are typically higher in the
fourth and first quarters, as those quarters represent the end
of the measurement period for many of the performance
fee-eligible relationships.

The results of our businesses may also be impacted by the
translation of financial results denominated in foreign
currencies to the U.S. dollar. We are primarily impacted by
activities denominated in the British pound and the euro.
On a consolidated basis and in our Investment Services
business, we typically have more foreign currency-
denominated expenses than revenues. However, our
Investment and Wealth Management business typically has
more foreign currency-denominated revenues than
expenses. Overall, currency fluctuations impact the year-
over-year growth rate in the Investment and Wealth
Management business more than the Investment Services
business. However, currency fluctuations, in isolation, are
not expected to significantly impact net income on a
consolidated basis.

Fee revenue in Investment and Wealth Management, and to
a lesser extent in Investment Services, is impacted by the
value of market indices. At June 30, 2021, we estimated
that a 5% change in global equity markets, spread evenly
throughout the year, would impact fee revenue by less than
1% and diluted earnings per common share by $0.04 to
$0.07.

See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for the consolidating schedules which show the
contribution of our businesses to our overall profitability.

Review of financial results

AUC/A of $45.0 trillion increased 21% compared with
June 30, 2020, primarily reflecting higher market values,
net new business and the favorable impact of a weaker
U.S. dollar. AUC/A consisted of 38% equity securities and
62% fixed-income securities at June 30, 2021 and 33%
equity securities and 67% fixed-income securities at June
30, 2020.

Total revenue of $3.0 billion decreased 4% compared with
the second quarter of 2020 and decreased slightly
compared with the first quarter of 2021. The drivers of
total revenue by line of business are indicated below.

Asset Servicing revenue of $1.4 billion decreased 6%
compared with the second quarter of 2020 and 3%
compared with the first quarter of 2021. The decrease
compared with the second quarter of 2020 includes lower
net interest revenue, higher money market fee waivers and
lower foreign exchange revenue, partially offset by higher
client activity and market values. The decrease compared
with the first quarter of 2021 primarily reflects lower
foreign exchange revenue and higher money market fee
waivers.

Pershing revenue of $590 million increased 2% compared
with the second quarter of 2020 and decreased 2%
compared with the first quarter of 2021. The increase
compared with the second quarter of 2020 primarily
reflects higher market values, client activity and balances,
partially offset by higher money market fee waivers. The
decrease compared with the first quarter of 2021 primarily
reflects lower

18 BNY Mellon

 clearance volumes, partially offset by higher market
values.

Issuer Services revenue of $405 million decreased 6%
compared with the second quarter of 2020 and increased
12% compared with the first quarter of 2021. The decrease
compared with the second quarter of 2020 primarily
reflects higher money market fee waivers and lower net
interest revenue in Corporate Trust, partially offset by
higher Depositary Receipts revenue. The increase
compared with the first quarter of 2021 primarily reflects
higher Depositary Receipts revenue, partially offset by
higher money market fee waivers in Corporate Trust.

Treasury Services revenue of $319 million decreased 6%
compared with the second quarter of 2020 and increased
1% compared with the first quarter of 2021. The decrease
compared with the second quarter of 2020 primarily
reflects lower interest rates and higher money market fee
waivers, partially offset by higher payment volumes and
deposits. The increase compared with the first quarter of
2021 primarily reflects higher net interest revenue and net
new business, partially offset by higher money market fee
waivers.

Clearance and Collateral Management revenue of $283
million decreased 4% compared with the second quarter of
2020 and increased 1% compared with the first quarter of
2021. The decrease compared with the second quarter of
2020 primarily reflects lower net interest revenue, intraday
credit fees and clearance volumes, partially offset by
higher tri-party collateral management balances. The
increase compared with the first quarter of 2021 primarily
reflects higher tri-party collateral management balances,
partially offset by lower clearance volumes.

Market and regulatory trends are driving investable assets
toward lower fee asset management products at reduced
margins for our clients. These dynamics are also negatively
impacting our investment services fees. However, at the
same time, these trends are providing additional
outsourcing opportunities as clients and other market
participants seek to comply with regulations and reduce
their operating costs.

Noninterest expense of $2.1 billion increased 3%
compared with the second quarter of 2020 and decreased
2% compared with the first quarter of 2021. The increase
compared with the second quarter of 2020 primarily
reflects the unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar,
investments in efficiency and

 
growth initiatives and higher revenue-related expenses.
The decrease compared with the first quarter of 2021
primarily reflects lower staff and litigation expenses,
partially offset by higher revenue-related expenses.

Year-to-date 2021 compared with year-to-date 2020

Total revenue of $6.0 billion decreased 6% compared with
the first six months of 2020. Asset Servicing revenue of
$2.8 billion decreased 6%, primarily reflecting lower net
interest revenue, higher money market fee waivers and
lower foreign exchange revenue, partially offset by higher
client activity and market values. Pershing revenue of $1.2
billion decreased 3%, primarily reflecting higher money
market fee waivers, partially offset by higher market values
and client volumes. Issuer Services revenue of

 $768 million decreased 10%, primarily reflecting lower net
interest revenue and higher money market fee waivers in
Corporate Trust. Treasury Services revenue of $636 million
decreased 6%, primarily reflecting lower interest rates and
higher money market fee waivers, partially offset by higher
payment volumes and deposits. Clearance and Collateral
Management revenue of $564 million decreased 5%,
primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue, intra-day
credit fees and clearance volumes.

Noninterest expense of $4.2 billion increased 4%
compared with the first six months of 2020 primarily
reflects investments in efficiency and growth initiatives,
the unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar, higher
revenue-related expenses and litigation expense.

Business description

Our Investment and Wealth Management business consists
of two distinct lines of business, Investment Management
and Wealth Management. Our investment firms deliver a
highly diversified portfolio of investment strategies
independently, and through our global distribution
network, to institutional and retail clients globally. BNY
Mellon Wealth Management provides investment
management, custody, wealth and estate planning, private
banking services, investment servicing and information
management. See pages 19 and 20 of our 2020 Annual
Report for additional information on our Investment and
Wealth Management business.

Review of financial results

AUM increased 18% compared with June 30, 2020
primarily reflecting higher market values, the favorable
impact of a weaker U.S. dollar (principally versus the
British pound) and net inflows.

 Net long-term strategy inflows were $12 billion in the
second quarter of 2021, driven by inflows of liability-
driven and fixed income investments, partially offset by
outflows of index and equity funds. Short-term strategy
inflows were $13 billion in the second quarter of 2021.
Market and regulatory trends have resulted in increased
demand for lower fee asset management products and for
performance-based fees.

Total revenue of $999 million increased 13% compared
with the second quarter of 2020 and 1% compared with the
first quarter of 2021.

Investment Management revenue of $700 million increased
13% compared with the second quarter of 2020 and
increased slightly compared with the first quarter of 2021.
The increase compared with the second quarter of 2020
primarily reflects the impact of higher market values, the
favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar, higher
performance fees and net inflows, partially offset by the
impact of money market fee waivers. The slight increase
compared

BNY Mellon 21

with the first quarter of 2021 primarily reflects the impact
of higher market values, equity investment gains (net of
hedges), including seed capital, and net inflows, partially
offset by the timing of performance fees and higher money
market fee waivers.

Wealth Management revenue of $299 million increased
13% compared with the second quarter of 2020 and 2%
compared with the first quarter of 2021. Both increases
primarily reflect the impact of higher market values.

Revenue generated in the Investment and Wealth
Management business included 38% from non-U.S.
sources in the second quarter of 2021, compared with 40%
in the second quarter of 2020 and 38% in the first quarter
of 2021.

 weaker U.S. dollar and higher staff expense, partially offset
by lower distribution and servicing expense. The decrease
compared with the first quarter of 2021 primarily reflects
lower staff expense.

Year-to-date 2021 compared with year-to-date 2020

Total revenue of $2.0 billion increased 12% compared with
the first six months of 2020. Investment Management
revenue of $1.4 billion increased 13% primarily reflecting
higher market values, the favorable impact of a weaker
U.S. dollar, and equity investment gains (net of hedges),
including seed capital, partially offset by higher money
market fee waivers. Wealth Management revenue of $592
million increased 9%, primarily reflecting higher market
values.

Noninterest expense of $677 million increased 3%
compared with the second quarter of 2020 and decreased
5% compared with the first quarter of 2021. The increase
compared with the second quarter of 2020 primarily
reflects the unfavorable impact of a

Noninterest expense of $1.4 billion increased 2%
compared with the first six months of 2020, primarily
reflecting the unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar
and higher staff expense, partially offset by lower
distribution and servicing expense.

Review of financial results

Total revenue includes corporate treasury and other
investment activity, including hedging activity which has
an offsetting impact in fee and other revenue and net
interest expense.

 Fee and other revenue decreased $16 million compared
with the second quarter of 2020 and increased $49 million
compared with the first quarter of 2021. The decrease
compared with the second quarter of 2020 was impacted
by lower net securities gains. The increase compared with
the first quarter of 2021 primarily reflects an impairment of
a renewable energy investment recorded in the first quarter
of 2021.

22 BNY Mellon

 
Noninterest expense increased $10 million compared with
the second quarter of 2020 and $8 million compared with
the first quarter of 2021. Both increases primarily reflect
higher staff expense.

Year-to-date 2021 compared with year-to-date 2020

(Loss) before income taxes increased $82 million
compared with the first six months of 2020. Total fee and
other revenue decreased $73 million, primarily reflecting
an impairment of a renewable energy investment recorded
in the first quarter of 2021 and lower net securities gains.
Noninterest expense increased $21 million compared with
the first six months of 2020, primarily reflecting higher
staff expense.

Critical accounting estimates

Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our
2020 Annual Report. Our critical accounting estimates are
those related to the allowance for credit losses, fair value
of financial instruments and derivatives, goodwill and
other intangibles and litigation and regulatory
contingencies, as referenced below.

Litigation and regulatory
contingencies

“Legal proceedings” in Note 17 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Goodwill and other intangible assets

BNY Mellon’s business segments include six reporting
units for which goodwill impairment testing is performed
on an annual basis. The Investment Services segment is
comprised of four reporting units and the Investment and
Wealth Management segment is comprised of two
reporting units.

In the second quarter of 2021, we performed our annual
goodwill impairment test on all six reporting units using an
income approach to estimate fair

 values of each reporting unit. Estimated cash flows used in
the income approach were based on management’s
projections as of March 31, 2021. The discount rate applied
to these cash flows was 10% and incorporated a 6% market
equity risk premium. Estimated cash flows extend far into
the future, and, by their nature, are difficult to estimate
over such an extended time frame.

As a result of the annual goodwill impairment test of the
six reporting units, no goodwill impairment was
recognized. The fair values of all six of the Company’s
reporting units were substantially in excess of the
respective reporting units’ carrying value. The Investment
Management reporting unit, with $7.3 billion of allocated
goodwill, which is one of the two reporting units in the
Investment and Wealth Management segment, exceeded its
carrying value by approximately 25%. For the Investment
Management reporting unit, in the future, small changes in
the assumptions, such as changes in the level of AUM and
operating margin, could produce a non-cash goodwill
impairment. See “Critical accounting estimates” in our
2020 Annual Report for additional information on the
annual goodwill impairment test.

Consolidated balance sheet review

One of our key risk management objectives is to maintain a
balance sheet that remains strong throughout market cycles
to meet the expectations of our major stakeholders,
including our shareholders, clients, creditors and
regulators.

We also seek to undertake overall liquidity risk, including
intraday liquidity risk, that stays within our risk appetite.
The objective of our balance sheet management strategy is
to maintain a balance sheet that is characterized by strong
liquidity and asset quality, ready access to external funding
sources at competitive rates and a strong capital structure
that supports our risk-taking activities and is adequate to
absorb potential losses. In managing the balance sheet,
appropriate consideration is given to balancing the
competing needs of maintaining sufficient levels of
liquidity and complying with applicable regulations and
supervisory expectations while optimizing profitability.

At June 30, 2021, total assets were $467 billion, compared
with $470 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The decrease in total
assets was primarily driven by lower

BNY Mellon 23

 
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and
other central banks, partially offset by higher loans.
Deposits totaled $339 billion at June 30, 2021, compared
with $342 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The decrease reflects
lower interest-bearing deposits in both non-U.S. and U.S.
offices, partially offset by higher noninterest-bearing
deposits (principally U.S. offices). Total interest-bearing
deposits as a percentage of total interest-earning assets
were 61% at June 30, 2021 and 63% at Dec. 31, 2020.

At June 30, 2021, available funds totaled $183 billion,
which include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing
deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks,
interest-bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold
and securities purchased under resale agreements. This
compares with available funds of $196 billion at Dec. 31,
2020. Total available funds as a percentage of total assets
were 39% at June 30, 2021 and 42% at Dec. 31, 2020. For
additional information on our available funds, see
“Liquidity and dividends.”

Securities were $155.9 billion, or 33% of total assets, at
June 30, 2021, compared with $156.4 billion, or 33% of
total assets, at Dec. 31, 2020. The decrease primarily
reflects lower agency residential mortgage-backed
securities (“RMBS”) and a decrease in unrealized pre-tax
gain, partially offset by an increase in U.S. Treasury
securities. For additional information on our securities
portfolio, see “Securities” and Note 3 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Loans were $63.5 billion, or 14% of total assets, at June
30, 2021, compared with $56.5 billion, or 12% of total
assets, at Dec. 31, 2020. The increase was

24 BNY Mellon

 primarily driven by higher margin loans and overdrafts.
For additional information on our loan portfolio, see
“Loans” and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Long-term debt totaled $25.6 billion at June 30, 2021 and
$26.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. Redemptions, a maturity
and a decrease in the fair value of hedged long-term debt
were partially offset by issuances. For additional
information on long-term debt, see “Liquidity and
dividends.”

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total
shareholders’ equity decreased to $45.3 billion at June 30,
2021 from $45.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. For additional
information, see “Capital.”

Country risk exposure

The following table presents BNY Mellon’s top 10
exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of June 30,
2021, as well as certain countries with higher risk profiles,
and is presented on an internal risk management basis. We
monitor our exposure to these and other countries as part of
our internal country risk management process.

The country risk exposure below reflects the Company’s
risk to an immediate default of the counterparty or obligor
based on the country of residence of the entity which
incurs the liability. If there is credit risk mitigation, the
country of residence of the entity providing the risk
mitigation is the country of risk. The country of risk for
securities is generally based on the domicile of the issuer
of the security.

Events in recent years have resulted in increased focus on
Italy and Brazil. The country risk exposure to Italy
primarily consists of investment grade sovereign debt. The
country risk exposure to Brazil is primarily short-term
trade finance loans extended to large financial institutions.
We also have operations in Brazil providing investment
services and investment management services.

 Securities

In the discussion of our securities portfolio, we have
included certain credit ratings information because the
information can indicate the degree of credit risk to which
we are exposed. Significant changes in ratings
classifications could indicate increased credit risk for us
and could be accompanied by an increase in the allowance
for credit losses and/or a reduction in the fair value of our
securities portfolio.

(i)    Includes unrealized gains of $1,129 million at June 30, 2021 related to available-for-sale securities, net of hedges, and $594 million related to held-to-maturity securities.

The fair value of our securities portfolio, including related
hedges, was $155.6 billion at June 30, 2021, compared
with $156.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The decrease
primarily reflects lower agency RMBS and a decrease in
unrealized pre-tax gain, partially offset by an increase in
U.S. Treasury securities.

 The unrealized gain (after-tax) on our available-for-sale
securities portfolio, net of hedges, included in accumulated
other comprehensive income was $854 million at June 30,
2021, compared with $1.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The
decrease in the unrealized gain, net of tax, was primarily
driven by higher market interest rates.

At June 30, 2021, the securities portfolio had a net
unrealized gain, including the impact of related hedges, of
$1.7 billion, compared with $3.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2020.
The decrease in the net unrealized gain, including the
impact of hedges, was primarily driven by higher market
interest rates.

The fair value of the available-for-sale securities totaled
$102.7 billion at June 30, 2021, net of hedges, or 66% of
the securities portfolio, net of hedges. The fair value of the
held-to-maturity securities totaled $52.9 billion at June 30,
2021, or 34% of the securities portfolio, net of hedges.

At June 30, 2021, total lending-related exposure of $112.9
billion increased 6% compared with Dec. 31, 2020,
primarily reflecting higher margin loans, overdrafts and
wealth management loans and mortgages, partially offset
by lower financial institutions exposure.

 Our financial institutions and commercial portfolios
comprise our largest concentrated risk. These portfolios
comprised 51% of our total exposure at June 30, 2021 and
55% at Dec. 31, 2020. Additionally, most of our overdrafts
relate to financial institutions.

The financial institutions portfolio exposure was $43.1
billion at June 30, 2021, a decrease of 2% compared with
Dec. 31, 2020, primarily reflecting lower exposure to the
securities industry and banks portfolios, partially offset by
higher exposure to the asset managers portfolio.

Financial institution exposures are high-quality, with 96%
of the exposures meeting the investment grade equivalent
criteria of our internal credit rating classification at June
30, 2021. Each customer is assigned an internal credit
rating, which is mapped to an equivalent external rating
agency grade based upon a number of dimensions, which
are continually evaluated and may change over time. For
ratings of non-U.S. counterparties, our internal credit rating
is generally capped at a rating equivalent to the sovereign
rating of the country where the counterparty resides,
regardless of the internal credit rating assigned to the
counterparty or the underlying collateral.

The exposure to financial institutions is generally short-
term, with 87% of the exposures expiring within one year.
At June 30, 2021, 16% of the exposure to financial
institutions had an expiration within 90 days, compared
with 18% at Dec. 31, 2020.

 In addition, 71% of the financial institutions exposure is
secured. For example, securities industry clients and asset
managers often borrow against marketable securities held
in custody.

At June 30, 2021, the secured intra-day credit provided to
dealers in connection with their tri-party repo activity
totaled $17.2 billion and was included in the securities
industry portfolio. Dealers secure the outstanding intraday
credit with high-quality liquid collateral having a market
value in excess of the amount of the outstanding credit.

The asset managers portfolio exposure is high-quality, with
98% of the exposures meeting our investment grade
equivalent ratings criteria as of June 30, 2021. These
exposures are generally short-term liquidity facilities, with
the majority to regulated mutual funds.

Our banks exposure primarily relates to our global trade
finance. These exposures are short-term in nature, with
95% due in less than one year. The investment grade
percentage of our banks exposure was 85% at both June
30, 2021 and Dec. 31, 2020. Our non-investment grade
exposures are primarily trade finance loans in Brazil.

 Wealth management loans and mortgages

Our wealth management exposure was $18.6 billion at
June 30, 2021, compared with $17.5 billion at Dec. 31,
2020. Wealth management loans and mortgages primarily
consist of loans to high-net-worth individuals, which are
secured by marketable securities and/or residential
property. Wealth management mortgages are primarily
interest-only, adjustable-rate mortgages with a weighted-
average loan-to-value ratio of 62% at origination. Less
than 1% of the mortgages were past due at June 30, 2021.

At June 30, 2021, the wealth management mortgage
portfolio consisted of the following geographic
concentrations: California – 22%; New York – 16%;
Massachusetts – 9%; Florida – 9%; and other – 44%.

The commercial portfolio exposure was $14.0 billion at
June 30, 2021, a decrease of 1% from Dec. 31, 2020,
primarily driven by lower exposure to the services and
other portfolio.

We have $676 million of total direct exposure to the oil and
gas industry at June 30, 2021, most of which is reflected in
the energy and utilities portfolio in the table above. This
exposure is to exploration and production, refining and
integrated companies and was 65% investment grade at
June 30, 2021 and 66% at Dec. 31, 2020.

Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade clients
that are active users of our non-credit services. The

Our commercial real estate exposure totaled $9.6 billion at
June 30, 2021 and $9.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. Our
income-producing commercial real estate facilities are
focused on experienced owners and are structured with
moderate leverage based on existing cash flows. Our
commercial real estate lending activities also include
construction and renovation facilities. Our client base
consists of experienced developers and long-term holders
of real estate assets. Loans are approved on the basis of
existing or projected cash flows and supported by
appraisals and knowledge of local market conditions.
Development loans are structured with moderate leverage,
and in many instances, involve some level of recourse to
the developer.

At June 30, 2021, the unsecured portfolio consisted of real
estate investment trusts (“REITs”) and real estate operating
companies, which are both primarily investment grade.

At June 30, 2021, our commercial real estate portfolio
consisted of the following concentrations: New York metro
– 35%; REITs and real estate operating companies – 40%;
and other – 25%.

 freight-related rail cars. Assets are both domestic and
foreign-based, with primary concentrations in the Germany
and the U.S.

Other residential mortgages

The other residential mortgages portfolio primarily consists
of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and totaled $339
million at June 30, 2021 and $389 million at Dec. 31,
2020. Included in this portfolio at June 30, 2021 were $59
million of mortgage loans purchased in 2005, 2006 and the
first quarter of 2007.

Overdrafts

Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities
clearance clients and are generally repaid within two
business days.

Other loans

Other loans primarily include loans to consumers that are
fully collateralized with equities, mutual funds and fixed-
income securities.

Lease financings

Margin loans

The lease financings portfolio exposure totaled $0.9 billion
at June 30, 2021 and $1.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. At June
30, 2021, approximately 98% of leasing exposure was
investment grade, or investment grade equivalent and
consisted of exposures backed by well-diversified assets,
primarily real estate and large-ticket transportation
equipment. The largest component of our lease residual
value exposure is

Margin loan exposure of $20.0 billion at June 30, 2021 and
$15.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2020 was collateralized with
marketable securities. Borrowers are required to maintain a
daily collateral margin in excess of 100% of the value of
the loan. Margin loans included $7.3 billion at June 30,
2021 and $4.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2020 related to a term
loan program that offers fully collateralized loans to
broker-dealers.

Allowance for credit losses

Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade clients who are active users of our non-credit services. Our primary exposure
to the credit risk of a customer consists of funded loans, unfunded contractual commitments to lend, standby letters of credit
and overdrafts associated with our custody and securities clearance businesses.

(a)    Includes allowance for credit losses on federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements, available-for-sale securities, held-to-

maturity securities, accounts receivable, cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits with banks.

The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $86 million
in the second quarter of 2021, primarily driven by an
improved macroeconomic forecast.

We had $19.9 billion of secured margin loans on our
balance sheet at June 30, 2021 compared with $15.4 billion
at Dec. 31, 2020. We have rarely suffered a loss on these
types of loans. As a result, we believe that the ratio of
allowance for loan losses and lending-related commitments
as a percentage of non-margin loans is a more appropriate
metric to measure the adequacy of the reserve.

 The allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-
related commitments represent management’s estimate of
lifetime expected losses in our credit portfolio. This
evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and
judgments. To the extent actual results differ from forecasts
or management’s judgment, the allowance for credit losses
may be greater or less than future charge-offs.

Based on an evaluation of the allowance for credit losses as
discussed in “Critical accounting estimates,” in our 2020
Annual Report, we have allocated our allowance for loans
and lending-related commitments as presented below.

 the downside scenario than the upside scenario. From a
sensitivity perspective, at June 30, 2021, if we had applied
100% weighting to the downside scenario, the quantitative
allowance for credit losses would have been approximately
$150 million higher.

mortgages.

The allocation of the allowance for credit losses is
inherently judgmental, and the entire allowance for credit
losses is available to absorb credit losses regardless of the
nature of the losses.

Our allowance for credit losses is sensitive to a number of
inputs, most notably the credit ratings assigned to each
borrower, as well as macroeconomic forecast assumptions
that are incorporated in our estimate of credit losses
through the expected life of the loan portfolio. Thus, as the
macroeconomic environment and related forecasts change,
the allowance for credit losses may change materially. The
following sensitivity analyses do not represent
management’s expectations of the deterioration of our
portfolios or the economic environment, but are provided
as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the
allowance for credit losses to changes in key inputs. If each
credit were rated one grade better, the quantitative
allowance would have decreased by $84 million, and if
each credit were rated one grade worse, the quantitative
allowance would have increased by $112 million. Our
multi-scenario based macroeconomic forecast used in
determining the June 30, 2021 allowance for credit losses
consisted of three scenarios. The baseline scenario reflects
moderate and flat GDP growth and unemployment
recovery but with declining commercial real estate prices
that begin to recover later in 2021. The upside scenario
reflects faster GDP growth and unemployment recovery
and less severe commercial real estate declines than the
baseline. The downside scenario contemplates negative
GDP growth and increasing unemployment throughout
2021 and steeper declines in commercial real estate prices
than the baseline. Consistent with the first quarter of 2021,
we placed the most weight on our baseline scenario, with
the remaining weighting resulting in slightly more weight
placed on

Nonperforming assets increased slightly compared with

loans, offset by lower other residential mortgages and
wealth management loans and mortgages.

Lost interest

Interest revenue would have increased by $1 million in the
second quarter of 2021, first quarter of 2021, second
quarter of 2020, $2 million in the first six months of 2021
and $3 million in the first six months of 2020, if
nonperforming loans at period-end had been performing
for the entire respective periods.

Loan modifications

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, there have been two
forms of relief provided for classifying loans as troubled
debt restructurings (“TDRs”): The Coronavirus Aid, Relief,
and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), the
relevant provisions of which were extended by the
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, and the
Interagency Guidance. See Note 1

 
32 BNY Mellon

of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our
2020 Annual Report for additional details on this guidance.
Financial institutions may account for eligible loan
modifications either under the CARES Act or the
Interagency Guidance and we have elected to apply both,
as applicable, in providing borrowers with loan
modification relief in response to the coronavirus
pandemic. We modified loans of $3 million in the second
quarter of 2021, $282 million in the second quarter of 2020
and $6 million in the first quarter of 2021. Nearly all of the
modifications were short-term loan payment forbearances
or modified principal and/or interest payments. These loans
were primarily residential mortgage and commercial real
estate loans. We did not identify any of the modifications
as TDRs. At June 30, 2021, the unpaid principal balance of
the loans modified under the CARES Act or Interagency
Guidance was $77 million.

Deposits

Total deposits were $338.7 billion at June 30, 2021, a
decrease of 1%, compared with $341.5 billion at Dec. 31,
2020. The decrease reflects lower interest-bearing deposits
in both non-U.S. and U.S. offices, partially offset by higher
noninterest-bearing deposits (principally U.S. offices).

Noninterest-bearing deposits were $94.1 billion at June 30,
2021 compared with $83.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2020.
Interest-bearing deposits were $244.6 billion at June 30,
2021, compared with $257.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2020.

Short-term borrowings

We fund ourselves primarily through deposits and, to a
lesser extent, other short-term borrowings and long-term
debt. Short-term borrowings consist of federal funds
purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, payables to customers and broker-dealers,
commercial paper and other borrowed funds. Certain short-
term borrowings, for example, securities sold under
repurchase agreements, require the delivery of securities as
collateral.

 Information related to federal funds purchased and
securities sold under repurchase agreements is presented
below.

average rates compared with June 30, 2020 primarily
reflects lower interest rates and repurchase agreement
activity with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (the
“FICC”), where we record interest expense gross, but the
ending and average balances reflect the impact of
offsetting under enforceable netting agreements. This
activity primarily relates to government securities
collateralized resale and repurchase agreements executed
with clients that are novated to and settle with the FICC.

commercial paper that matures within 397 days from the
date of issue and is not redeemable prior to maturity or
subject to voluntary prepayment. The decrease in the
commercial paper compared with June 30, 2020 primarily
reflects the continuation of elevated deposit levels.

Other borrowed funds primarily include overdrafts of sub-
custodian account balances in our Investment Services
businesses, finance lease liabilities and borrowings under
lines of credit by our Pershing subsidiaries. Borrowings
from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston under the Money
Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (the “MMLF”)
program are also included in other borrowed funds at June
30, 2020. Overdrafts typically relate to timing differences
for settlements. The decrease in other borrowed funds
compared with June 30, 2020 reflects a decline in
borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston
under the MMLF program. The increase in other borrowed
funds compared with March 31, 2021 reflects higher
overdrafts of sub-custodian account balances in our
Investment Services businesses.

Liquidity and dividends

BNY Mellon defines liquidity as the ability of the Parent
and its subsidiaries to access funding or convert assets to
cash quickly and efficiently, or to roll over or issue new
debt, especially during periods of market stress, at a
reasonable cost, and in order to meet its short-term (up to
one year) obligations. Funding liquidity risk is the risk that
BNY Mellon cannot meet its cash and collateral
obligations at a reasonable cost for both expected and
unexpected cash flow and collateral needs without
adversely affecting daily operations or our financial
condition. Funding liquidity risk can arise from funding
mismatches, market constraints from the inability to
convert assets into cash, the inability to hold or raise cash,
low overnight deposits, deposit run-off or contingent
liquidity events.

Changes in economic conditions or exposure to credit,
market, operational, legal and reputational

 
risks also can affect BNY Mellon’s liquidity risk profile
and are considered in our liquidity risk framework. For
additional information, see “Risk Management – Liquidity
Risk” in our 2020 Annual Report.

The Parent’s policy is to have access to sufficient
unencumbered cash and cash equivalents at each quarter-
end to cover maturities and other forecasted debt
redemptions, net interest payments and net tax payments
for the following 18-month period, and to provide
sufficient collateral to satisfy transactions subject to
Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. As of June 30,
2021, the Parent was in compliance with this policy.

We monitor and control liquidity exposures and funding
needs within and across significant legal entities, branches,
currencies and business lines, taking into account, among
other factors, any

 applicable restrictions on the transfer of liquidity among
entities.

BNY Mellon also manages potential intraday liquidity
risks. We monitor and manage intraday liquidity against
existing and expected intraday liquid resources (such as
cash balances, remaining intraday credit capacity, intraday
contingency funding and available collateral) to enable
BNY Mellon to meet its intraday obligations under normal
and reasonably severe stressed conditions.

We define available funds for internal liquidity
management purposes as cash and due from banks,
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and
other central banks, interest-bearing deposits with banks
and federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements. The following table presents our total
available funds at period end and on an average basis.

Total available funds were $182.5 billion at June 30, 2021,
compared with $196.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The
decrease was primarily due to lower interest-bearing
deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks,
partially offset by higher interest-bearing deposits with
banks.

Average non-core sources of funds, such as federal funds
purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, trading liabilities, other borrowed funds and
commercial paper were $17.1 billion for the first six
months of 2021 and $18.2 billion the first six months of
2020. The decrease primarily reflects lower other borrowed
funds and commercial paper, partially offset by higher
federal funds purchased and securities sold under
repurchase agreements and trading liabilities.

Average foreign deposits, primarily from our European-
based Investment Services business, were $114.5 billion
for the first six months of 2021,

 compared with $103.1 billion for the first six months of
2020. Average interest-bearing domestic deposits were
$127.7 billion for the first six months of 2021 and $101.0
billion for the first six months of 2020. The increase
primarily reflects increased client activity.

Average payables to customers and broker-dealers were
$17.2 billion for the first six months of 2021 and $17.6
billion for the first six months of 2020. Payables to
customers and broker-dealers are driven by customer
trading activity and market volatility.

Average long-term debt was $25.7 billion for the first six
months of 2021 and $27.7 billion for the first six months of
2020.

Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased to $84.6
billion for the first six months of 2021 from $66.5 billion
for the first six months of 2020, primarily reflecting client
activity.

Long-term debt totaled $25.6 billion at June 30, 2021 and
$26.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. Redemptions of $2.3
billion, a maturity of $500 million and a decrease in the
fair value of hedged long-term debt were partially offset by
issuances of $2.7 billion. The Parent has $1.5 billion of
long-term debt that will mature in the remainder of 2021.

In July 2021, the Parent issued $500 million of fixed rate
senior notes maturing in 2026 at an annual interest rate of
1.05% and $500 million of fixed rate senior notes maturing
in 2031 at an annual interest rate of 1.80%.

The Bank of New York Mellon may issue notes and CDs.
At June 30, 2021 and Dec. 31, 2020, $30 million of notes
were outstanding. There were no CDs outstanding at June
30, 2021 and $100 million was outstanding at Dec. 31,
2020.

 The Bank of New York Mellon also issues commercial
paper that matures within 397 days from the date of issue
and is not redeemable prior to maturity or subject to
voluntary prepayment. There was no commercial paper
outstanding at June 30, 2021 and Dec. 31, 2020. The
average commercial paper outstanding was $886 million
for the first six months of 2020.

Subsequent to June 30, 2021, our U.S. bank subsidiaries
could declare dividends to the Parent of approximately
$1.6 billion, without the need for a regulatory waiver. In
addition, at June 30, 2021, non-bank subsidiaries of the
Parent had liquid assets of approximately $3.3 billion.
Restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our
subsidiaries are discussed in more detail in “Supervision
and Regulation – Capital Planning and Stress Testing –

Capital Distributions” and in Note 19 of the Notes to

Consolidated Financial Statements, both in our 2020
Annual Report.

Pershing LLC has uncommitted lines of credit in place for
liquidity purposes which are guaranteed by the Parent.
Pershing LLC has two separate uncommitted lines of credit
amounting to $350 million in aggregate. There were no
borrowings under these lines in the second quarter of 2021.
Pershing Limited, an indirect UK-based subsidiary of BNY
Mellon, has two separate uncommitted lines of credit
amounting to $269 million in aggregate. Average
borrowings under these lines were $14 million, in
aggregate, in the second quarter of 2021.

The double leverage ratio is the ratio of our equity
investment in subsidiaries divided by our consolidated
Parent company equity, which includes our noncumulative
perpetual preferred stock. In short, the double leverage
ratio measures the extent to which equity in subsidiaries is
financed by Parent company debt. As the double leverage
ratio increases, this can reflect greater demands on a
company’s cash flows in order to service interest payments
and debt maturities. BNY Mellon’s double leverage ratio is
managed in a range considering the high level of
unencumbered available liquid assets held in its principal
subsidiaries (such as central bank deposit placements and
government securities), the Company’s cash generating
fee-based business model, with fee revenue representing
81% of total revenue in the second quarter of 2021, and the
dividend capacity of our banking subsidiaries. Our double
leverage ratio was 114.4% at June 30, 2021 and 114.3% at
Dec. 31, 2020, and within the range targeted by
management.

Uses of funds

The Parent’s major uses of funds are repurchases of
common stock, payment of dividends, principal and
interest payments on its borrowings, acquisitions and
additional investments in its subsidiaries.

In May 2021, a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per common
share was paid to common shareholders. Our common
stock dividend payout ratio was 27% for the second quarter
of 2021.

In July 2021, our Board of Directors approved a 10%
increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock,
from $0.31 to $0.34 per share. This increased quarterly
cash dividend will be paid on Aug. 9, 2021.

 In the second quarter of 2021, we repurchased 12.8 million
common shares at an average price of $48.17 per common
share, for a total cost of $618 million.

In June 2021, our Board of Directors approved the
repurchase of up to $6.0 billion of common stock starting
in the third quarter of 2021 and continuing through the
fourth quarter of 2022.

See “Recent regulatory developments” for additional
information on the 2021 CCAR. Also see “Supervision and
Regulation – Capital Planning and Stress Testing –
Payment of Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Other
Capital Distributions” in our 2020 Annual Report for
additional information related to the 2020 CCAR.

Liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”)

U.S. regulators have established an LCR that requires
certain banking organizations, including BNY Mellon, to
maintain a minimum amount of unencumbered high-
quality liquid assets (“HQLA”) sufficient to withstand the
net cash outflow under a hypothetical standardized acute
liquidity stress scenario for a 30-day time horizon.

The following table presents BNY Mellon’s consolidated
HQLA at June 30, 2021, and the average HQLA and
average LCR for the second quarter of 2021.

Statement of cash flows

The following summarizes the activity reflected on the
consolidated statement of cash flows. While this
information may be helpful to highlight certain macro
trends and business strategies, the cash flow analysis may
not be as relevant when analyzing changes in our net
earnings and net assets. We believe that in addition to the
traditional cash flow analysis, the discussion related to
liquidity and dividends and asset/liability management
herein may provide more useful context in evaluating our
liquidity position and related activity.

Net cash used for operating activities was $345 million in
the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared with net
cash provided by operations of $5.1 billion in the six
months ended June 30, 2020. In the six months ended June
30, 2021 cash flows used for operations primarily resulted
from changes in accruals, partially offset by earnings. In
the six months ended June 30, 2020, cash flows provided
by operations primarily resulted from earnings and changes
in accruals.

Net cash provided by investing activities was $3.9 billion
in the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared with net
cash used for investing activities of $58.7 billion in the six
months ended June 30,

 2020. In the six months ended June 30, 2021, net cash
provided by investing activities primarily reflects change
in interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and
other central banks, partially offset by net changes in loans
and changes in interest-bearing deposits with banks. In the
six months ended June 30, 2020, net cash used for
investing activities primarily reflects net changes in
securities, change in interest-bearing deposits with the
Federal Reserve and other central banks and changes in
federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale
agreements.

Net cash used for financing activities was $3.5 billion in
the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared with net
cash provided by financing activities of $53.4 billion in the
six months ended June 30, 2020. In the six months ended
June 30, 2021, net cash used for financing activities
primarily reflects repayments of long-term debt, changes in
deposits, changes in payables to customers and broker-
dealers and treasury stock acquired, partially offset by net
proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and change
in federal funds purchased and securities sold under
repurchase agreements. In the six months ended June 30,
2020, net cash provided by financing activities primarily
reflects changes in deposits and payables to customers and
broker-dealers, partially offset by changes in commercial
paper.

38 BNY Mellon

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total
shareholders’ equity decreased to $45.3 billion at June 30,
2021 from $45.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The decrease
primarily reflects common stock repurchases, dividend
payments and unrealized losses on securities available-for-
sale, partially offset by earnings.

The unrealized gain (after-tax) on our available-for-sale
securities portfolio, net of hedges, included in accumulated
other comprehensive income was $854 million at June 30,
2021, compared with $1.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The
decrease in the unrealized gain, net of tax, was primarily
driven by higher market interest rates.

In the first six months of 2021, we repurchased 29.6
million common shares at an average price of $44.49 per
common share for a total of $1.3 billion under the share
repurchase program that was in place through the second
quarter of 2021.

In December 2020, the Federal Reserve released the results
of the second round of CCAR stress tests during 2020 and
extended the restriction on common stock dividends and
open market common stock repurchases applicable to
participating CCAR BHCs, including us, to the first quarter
of 2021, with certain modifications. In March 2021, the
Federal Reserve extended these restrictions through the
second quarter of 2021. The temporary restrictions on
dividends and share repurchases ended for BNY Mellon
after June 30, 2021. Starting in the third quarter of 2021,
BNY Mellon will continue to be subject to the normal
constraints under the stress capital buffer (“SCB”)
framework.

In June 2021, the Federal Reserve released the results of its
stress tests for 2021. Our Board of Directors subsequently
authorized the repurchase of up to $6.0 billion of common
shares over the six quarters

 beginning in the third quarter of 2021 and continuing
through the fourth quarter of 2022. This new share
repurchase plan replaces all previously authorized share
repurchase plans. See “Recent regulatory developments”
for additional information on the 2021 CCAR results.

Capital adequacy

Regulators establish certain levels of capital for BHCs and
banks, including BNY Mellon and our bank subsidiaries, in
accordance with established quantitative measurements.
For the Parent to maintain its status as a financial holding
company (“FHC”), our U.S. bank subsidiaries and BNY
Mellon must, among other things, qualify as “well
capitalized.” As of June 30, 2021 and Dec. 31, 2020, BNY
Mellon and our U.S. bank subsidiaries were “well
capitalized.” Failure to satisfy regulatory standards,
including “well capitalized” status or capital adequacy
rules more generally, could result in limitations on our
activities and adversely affect our financial condition. See
the discussion of these matters in “Supervision and
Regulation – Regulated Entities of BNY Mellon and
Ancillary Regulatory Requirements” and “Risk Factors –
Operational Risk – Failure to satisfy regulatory standards,
including “well capitalized” and “well managed” status or
capital adequacy and liquidity rules more generally, could
result in limitations on our activities and adversely affect
our business and financial condition,” both of which are in
our 2020 Annual Report.

The U.S. banking agencies’ capital rules are based on the
framework adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision (“BCBS”), as amended from time to time. For
additional information on these capital requirements, see
“Supervision and Regulation” in our 2020 Annual Report.

(a)    Minimum requirements for June 30, 2021 include minimum thresholds plus currently applicable buffers. The U.S. global systemically important banks

(“G-SIB”) surcharge of 1.5% is subject to change. The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set to 0%. The stress capital buffer (“SCB”)
requirement is 2.5%, equal to the regulatory minimum for Standardized Approach capital ratios.

(b)    For our CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, our effective capital ratios under U.S. capital rules are the lower of the ratios as calculated

under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is based on Tier 1 capital and quarterly average total assets.

(c)    The Federal Reserve’s regulations do not establish well capitalized thresholds for these measures for BHCs.
(d)    The SLR is based on Tier 1 capital and total leverage exposure, which includes certain off-balance sheet exposures.
(e)     The consolidated SLR at March 31, 2021 and Dec. 31, 2020 reflects the temporary exclusion of U.S. Treasury securities from total leverage exposure
which increased our consolidated SLR by 68 basis points and 72 basis points, respectively. The temporary exclusion ceased to apply beginning April 1,
2021.

Our CET1 ratio under the Standardized Approach was
12.6% at June 30, 2021 and was 13.1% at Dec. 31, 2020
under the Advanced Approaches. The decrease was
primarily driven by common stock repurchases, unrealized
losses on securities available-for-sale, dividend payments
and an increase in RWAs, partially offset by capital
generated through earnings.

Capital ratios vary depending on the size of the balance
sheet at period-end and the levels and types of investments
in assets. The balance sheet size fluctuates from period to
period based on levels of customer and market activity. In
general, when servicing clients are more actively trading
securities, deposit balances and the balance sheet as a
whole are higher. In addition, when markets experience
significant volatility or stress, our balance sheet size may
increase considerably as client deposit levels increase.

 Our capital ratios are necessarily subject to, among other
things, anticipated compliance with all necessary
enhancements to model calibration, approval by regulators
of certain models used as part of RWA calculations, other
refinements, further implementation guidance from
regulators, market practices and standards and any changes
BNY Mellon may make to its businesses. As a
consequence of these factors, our capital ratios may
materially change, and may be volatile over time and from
period to period.

Under the Advanced Approaches, our operational loss risk
model is informed by external losses, including fines and
penalties levied against institutions in the financial services
industry, particularly those that relate to businesses in
which we operate, and as a result external losses have
impacted and could in the future impact the amount of
capital that we are required to hold.

From April 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, BHCs were
permitted to temporarily exclude U.S. Treasury securities
from total leverage exposure used in the SLR calculation.
This temporary exclusion increased our consolidated SLR
by 68 basis points at March 31, 2021 and 72 basis points at
Dec. 31, 2020. The temporary exclusion also impacted the
TLAC and LTD calculations. BNY Mellon and The Bank
of New York Mellon, as custody banks, will continue to be
able to exclude certain central bank placements from the
total leverage exposure used in the SLR calculation,
consistent with the amendments to the SLR finalized by
the U.S. banking agencies in 2019 pursuant to the
Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer
Protection Act.

Stress capital buffer

In August 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that BNY
Mellon’s SCB requirement would be 2.5%, equal to the
regulatory floor, effective as of Oct. 1, 2020. The SCB
replaces the current 2.5% capital conservation buffer for
Standardized Approach capital ratios for CCAR BHCs.
The SCB does not apply to bank subsidiaries, which
remain subject to the static 2.5% capital conservation
buffer. See “Recent regulatory developments” for
additional information on the SCB.

The SCB final rule generally eliminates the requirement
for prior approval of common stock repurchases in excess
of the distributions in a firm’s capital plan, provided that
such distributions are consistent with applicable capital
requirements and buffers, including the SCB. In
conjunction with the release of the 2020 CCAR results, the
Federal Reserve imposed restrictions on capital
distributions as described earlier in “Capital.”

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (“TLAC”)

The final TLAC rule establishing external TLAC, external
long-term debt (“LTD”) and related requirements for U.S.
G-SIBs, including BNY Mellon, at the top-tier holding
company level became effective on Jan. 1, 2019. The
following summarizes the minimum requirements for
BNY Mellon’s external TLAC and external LTD ratios,
plus currently applicable buffers.

(a)    RWA is the greater of Standardized and Advanced Approaches.
(b)    Buffer to be met using only CET1.
(c)    Buffer to be met using only Tier 1 capital.

External TLAC consists of the Parent’s Tier 1 capital and
eligible unsecured LTD issued by it that has a remaining
term to maturity of at least one year and satisfies certain
other conditions. Eligible LTD consists of the unpaid
principal balance of eligible unsecured debt securities,
subject to haircuts for amounts due to be paid within two
years, that satisfy certain other conditions. Debt issued
prior to Dec. 31, 2016 has been permanently grandfathered
to the extent these instruments otherwise would be
ineligible only due to containing impermissible
acceleration rights or being governed by foreign law.

The following table presents our external TLAC and
external LTD ratios.

If BNY Mellon maintains risk-based ratio or leverage

with a risk-based ratio or leverage below the minimum
level with buffers, we will face constraints on dividends,
equity repurchases and discretionary executive
compensation based on the amount of the shortfall and
eligible retained income.

Trading activities and risk management

Our trading activities are focused on acting as a market-
maker for our customers, facilitating customer trades and
risk-mitigating hedging in compliance with the Volcker
Rule. The risk from market-making activities for customers
is managed by our traders and limited in total exposure
through a system of position limits, value-at-risk (“VaR”)
methodology and other market sensitivity measures. VaR is
the potential loss in value due to adverse market
movements over a defined time horizon with a specified
confidence level. The calculation of our VaR used by
management and presented below assumes a one-day
holding period, utilizes a 99% confidence level and
incorporates non-linear product characteristics. VaR
facilitates comparisons across portfolios of different risk
characteristics. VaR also captures the diversification of
aggregated risk at the firm-wide level.

VaR represents a key risk management measure and it is
important to note the inherent limitations to VaR, which
include:

• VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer time

horizons where moves may be extreme;

• VaR does not take account of potential variability of

market liquidity; and

• Previous moves in market risk factors may not produce

accurate predictions of all future market moves.

See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information on the VaR
methodology.

The following tables indicate the calculated VaR amounts
for the trading portfolio for the designated periods using
the historical simulation VaR model.

The interest rate component of VaR represents instruments
whose values are predominantly driven by interest rate
levels. These instruments include, but are not limited to,
U.S. Treasury securities, swaps, swaptions, forward rate
agreements, exchange-traded futures and options, and other
interest rate derivative products.

 
BNY Mellon 43

The foreign exchange component of VaR represents
instruments whose values predominantly vary with the
level or volatility of currency exchange rates or interest
rates. These instruments include, but are not limited to,
currency balances, spot and forward transactions, currency
options and other currency derivative products.

The equity component of VaR consists of instruments that
represent an ownership interest in the form of domestic and
foreign common stock or other equity-linked instruments.
These instruments include, but are not limited to, common
stock, exchange-traded funds, preferred stock, listed equity
options (puts and calls), OTC equity options, equity total
return swaps, equity index futures and other equity
derivative products.

The credit component of VaR represents instruments whose
values are predominantly driven by credit spread levels,
i.e., idiosyncratic default risk. These instruments include,
but are not limited to, securities with exposures from
corporate and municipal credit spreads.

The diversification component of VaR is the risk reduction
benefit that occurs when combining portfolios and
offsetting positions, and from the correlated behavior of
risk factor movements.

During the second quarter of 2021, interest rate risk
generated 33% of average gross VaR, foreign exchange
risk generated 39% of average gross VaR, equity risk
generated 1% of average gross VaR and credit risk
generated 27% of average gross VaR. During the second
quarter of 2021, our daily trading loss exceeded our
calculated VaR amount of the overall portfolio on one
occasion.

(a)    Trading revenue (loss) includes realized and unrealized gains and losses
primarily related to spot and forward foreign exchange transactions,

derivatives and securities trades for our customers and excludes any
associated commissions, underwriting fees and net interest revenue.

Trading assets include debt and equity instruments and
derivative assets, primarily interest rate and foreign
exchange contracts, not designated as hedging instruments.
Trading assets were $15.5 billion at June 30, 2021 and
$15.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2020.

Trading liabilities include debt and equity instruments and
derivative liabilities, primarily interest rate and foreign
exchange contracts, not designated as hedging instruments.
Trading liabilities were $6.5 billion at June 30, 2021 and
$6.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2020.

Under our fair value methodology for derivative contracts,
an initial “risk-neutral” valuation is performed on each
position assuming time-discounting based on a AA credit
curve. In addition, we consider credit risk in arriving at the
fair value of our derivatives.

We reflect external credit ratings as well as observable
credit default swap spreads for both ourselves and our
counterparties when measuring the fair value of our
derivative positions. Accordingly, the valuation of our
derivative positions is sensitive to the current changes in
our own credit spreads, as well as those of our
counterparties.

At June 30, 2021, our OTC derivative assets, including
those in hedging relationships, of $4.8 billion included a
credit valuation adjustment (“CVA”) deduction of $28
million. Our OTC derivative liabilities, including those in
hedging relationships, of $3.3 billion included a debit
valuation adjustment (“DVA”) of $1 million related to our
own credit spread. Net of hedges, the CVA decreased $1
million and the DVA increased by less than $1 million in
the second quarter of 2021, which increased other trading
revenue by $1 million. The net impact decreased other
trading revenue by $1

 
million in the first quarter of 2021 and $2 million in the
second quarter of 2020.

The table below summarizes the distribution of credit
ratings for our foreign exchange and interest rate derivative
counterparties over the past five quarters, which indicates
the level of counterparty credit associated with these
trading activities. Significant changes in counterparty
credit ratings could alter the level of credit risk faced by
BNY Mellon.

 In the table below, we use the earnings simulation model to
run various interest rate ramp scenarios from a baseline
scenario. The interest rate ramp scenarios examine the
impact of large interest rate movements. In each scenario,
all currencies’ interest rates are shifted higher or lower.
Typically, the baseline scenario uses the average deposit
balances of the last month of the quarter. The 100 basis
point ramp scenario assumes rates change 25 basis points
above or below the yield curve in each of the next four
quarters and the 200 basis point ramp scenario assumes a
50 basis point per quarter change. Interest rate sensitivity is
quantified by calculating the change in pre-tax net interest
revenue between the scenarios over a 12-month
measurement period. The net interest revenue sensitivity
methodology assumes static deposit levels and also
assumes that no management actions will be taken to
mitigate the effects of interest rate changes.

for BNY Mellon.

Asset/liability management

Our diversified business activities include processing
securities, accepting deposits, investing in securities,
lending, raising money as needed to fund assets and other
transactions. The market risks from these activities include
interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. Our primary
market risk is exposure to movements in U.S. dollar
interest rates and certain foreign currency interest rates. We
actively manage interest rate sensitivity and use earnings
simulation and discounted cash flow models to identify
interest rate exposures.

An earnings simulation model is the primary tool used to
assess changes in pre-tax net interest revenue. The model
incorporates management’s assumptions regarding interest
rates, market spreads, changes in the prepayment behavior
of loans and securities and the impact of derivative
financial instruments used for interest rate risk
management purposes. These assumptions have been
developed through a combination of historical analysis and
future expected pricing behavior and are inherently
uncertain. Actual results may differ materially from
projected results due to timing, magnitude and frequency
of interest rate changes, and changes in market conditions
and management’s strategies, among other factors.

(b)    Long-term is equal to or greater than one year.

The decreases in the ramp up sensitivities compared with
March 31, 2021 are primarily driven by a decrease in
deposit levels and the impact of hedging long-term debt.

While the net interest revenue sensitivity scenarios
calculations assume static deposit balances to facilitate
consistent period-over-period comparisons, it is likely that
a portion of the recent monetary policy-driven deposit
inflows would run-off in rising rate environments, such as
the up 100 bps and up 200 bps parallel ramps. Noninterest-
bearing deposits are particularly sensitive to changes in
short-term rates.

 
BNY Mellon 45

To illustrate the net interest revenue sensitivity to deposit
runoff, we note that a $5 billion instantaneous reduction of
U.S. dollar denominated noninterest-bearing deposits
would reduce the net interest revenue sensitivity results in
the ramp up 100 basis point and 200 basis point scenarios
in the table above by approximately $30 million and
approximately $65 million, respectively. The impact would
be smaller if

 the runoff was assumed to be a mixture of interest-bearing
and noninterest-bearing deposits.

For a discussion of factors impacting the growth or
contraction of deposits, see “Risk Factors – Our business,
financial condition and results of operations could be
adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our
liquidity,” in our 2020 Annual Report.

Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP
and Non-GAAP financial measures

BNY Mellon has included in this Form 10-Q certain Non-
GAAP financial measures on a tangible basis as a
supplement to GAAP information, which exclude goodwill
and intangible assets, net of deferred tax liabilities. We
believe that the return on tangible common equity – Non-
GAAP is additional useful information for investors
because it presents a measure of those assets that can
generate income, and the tangible book value per common
share – Non-GAAP is additional useful information
because it presents the level of tangible assets in relation to
shares of common stock outstanding.

The presentation of the growth rates of investment
management and performance fees on a constant currency
basis permits investors to assess the significance of
changes in foreign currency exchange

 rates. Growth rates on a constant currency basis were
determined by applying the current period foreign currency
exchange rates to the prior period revenue. We believe that
this presentation, as a supplement to GAAP information,
gives investors a clearer picture of the related revenue
results without the variability caused by fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates.

BNY Mellon has also included the adjusted pre-tax
operating margin – Non-GAAP, which is the pre-tax
operating margin for the Investment and Wealth
Management business, net of distribution and servicing
expense that was passed to third parties who distribute or
service our managed funds. We believe that this measure is
useful when evaluating the performance of the Investment
and Wealth Management business relative to industry
competitors.

Recent regulatory developments

 EU/UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement

For a summary of additional regulatory matters relevant to
our operations, see “Recent regulatory developments” in
our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 and
“Supervision and Regulation” in our 2020 Annual Report.
The following discussions summarize certain regulatory,
legislative and other developments that may affect BNY
Mellon.

CCAR 2021 Results

On June 24, 2021, the Federal Reserve released the results
of its stress tests for 2021. The Federal Reserve also
notified BNY Mellon that its indicative SCB requirement
for the present stress test cycle will be 2.5%, which equals
the regulatory floor. BNY Mellon expects that its final SCB
will be confirmed later in 2021. The SCB will be effective
on Oct. 1, 2021.

The temporary restrictions on dividends and share
repurchases imposed as a result of the coronavirus
pandemic ended for BNY Mellon after June 30, 2021.
Starting in the third quarter of 2021, BNY Mellon will
continue to be subject to the normal constraints under the
SCB framework. For additional information regarding the
SCB, see “Supervision and Regulation – Capital Planning
and Stress Testing” in our 2020 Annual Report.

Consistent with the SCB framework, BNY Mellon
increased its quarterly common stock dividend to $0.34 per
share in the third quarter of 2021 and our Board has
authorized the repurchase of up to $6.0 billion of common
shares over the six quarters beginning in the third quarter
of 2021 and continuing through the fourth quarter of 2022.
This new share repurchase plan replaces all previously
authorized share repurchase plans.

NSFR Compliance Date

The final NSFR rule became effective on July 1, 2021.
Under the final rule, the NSFR is expressed as a ratio of
available stable funding to the required stable funding
amount. BNY Mellon is required to maintain an NSFR of
1.0 and is in compliance with the NSFR. NSFR disclosure
requirements will be effective in 2023.

The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (“EU-UK
Agreement”) entered into force and became provisionally
effective on Jan. 1, 2021. The EU-UK Agreement was
ratified by the European Parliament in April 2021 and
became fully effective. Under the EU-UK Agreement, the
EU and UK have agreed to make their best endeavors to
ensure that internationally agreed standards in the financial
services sector for regulation and supervision are
implemented and applied in their territory and establish a
framework for structured regulatory cooperation on
financial services. For more information regarding the
impact of Brexit on the UK regulatory framework and
related developments, see “Supervision and Regulation –
Effects of ‘Brexit’ on UK Regulatory Framework” in the
2020 Annual Report.

Financial Services Act 2021 (UK)

The Financial Services Act 2021 (previously the Financial
Services Bill 2020) received royal assent and entered into
force in April 2021. The Financial Services Act 2021
makes several changes to the UK financial services
regulatory framework. This includes providing the
framework for implementation of the elements of the EU
Capital Requirements Regulation 2 (“CRR2”) that do not
already form part of EU retained law in the UK, and the
framework for implementation of the EU Investment Firms
Directive / Regulation (“IFD/IFR”) in the UK (modified
for the UK environment as “UK IFPR”).

The Financial Services Act 2021 grants rulemaking powers
to the Prudential Regulatory Authority (“PRA”) with
respect to UK capital requirements directive/regulation
matters, and the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”),
with respect to UK IFPR matters. The Financial Services
Act 2021 also enables Her Majesty’s Treasury to set
commencement dates for various UK CRR2/UK IFPR
provisions. Pursuant to this authority, Her Majesty’s
Treasury has confirmed that the UK’s version of the CRR2
(“UK CRR2”) and the UK IFPR will come into effect on
Jan. 1, 2022. For more information regarding the CRR2
and the UK IFPR, see “Supervision and Regulation –
Operations and Regulations Outside the United States” and
“Supervision and Regulation – Effects of ‘Brexit’ on UK
Regulatory Framework” in the 2020 Annual Report.

EU Leverage Ratio

 Website information

On June 28, 2021, the CRR2 leverage ratio became a
binding requirement for EU credit institutions, such as The
Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV. The European Central
Bank (“ECB”) granted an optional exclusion for central
bank deposits from the leverage ratio calculation that came
into effect on the same date and will expire on March 31,
2022. It replaces the central bank deposits exclusion
granted by the ECB in April 2020 in relation to the
leverage ratio reporting requirements. The Bank of New
York Mellon SA/NV is planning to use the exclusion.

Other matters

On March 5, 2021, the administrator of LIBOR announced
that it would cease the publication of non-U.S. dollar
London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) settings and
one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings on
Dec. 31, 2021 and would cease the publication of the other
U.S. dollar LIBOR settings on June 30, 2023. On the same
day, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) made a
related announcement regarding when LIBOR settings will
cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be
representative. The International Swaps and Derivatives
Association (“ISDA”) also announced that the FCA’s
announcement was an index cessation event under its
fallbacks protocol for all LIBOR settings and that
consequently, the fallback spread adjustment was fixed as
of the date of the announcement.

In April 2021, New York state adopted legislation that
provides a statutory fallback mechanism to replace LIBOR
with a benchmark rate based on SOFR for New York-law
governed contracts that reference U.S. dollar LIBOR and
either have no fallback provisions or provisions that are
based on LIBOR. The New York legislation also has a safe
harbor regarding the selection and use of that SOFR-based
benchmark rate.

The U.S. bank regulators have issued guidance strongly
encouraging banking organizations to cease using U.S.
dollar LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts as soon
as practicable and in any event by Dec. 31, 2021. We are
continuing to work to facilitate an orderly transition from
interbank offered rates, including LIBOR, to alternative
reference rates for us and our clients.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1–Basis of presentation

In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, references to
“our,” “we,” “us,” “BNY Mellon,” the “Company” and
similar terms refer to The Bank of New York Mellon
Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. The term
“Parent” refers to The Bank of New York Mellon
Corporation but not to its subsidiaries.

Basis of presentation

The accounting and financial reporting policies of BNY
Mellon, a global financial services company, conform to
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)
and prevailing industry practices. For information on our
significant accounting and reporting policies, see Note 1 in
our 2020 Annual Report.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are
unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
necessary, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, for a
fair presentation of financial position, results of operations
and cash flows for the periods presented have been made.
These financial statements should be read in conjunction
with our 2020 Annual Report.

In order to combine items of a similar nature within total
revenue and to simplify our income statement presentation,
in the first quarter of 2021, we made the following
reporting changes. The reclassifications had no impact on
consolidated total revenue or total revenue for the business
segments. Prior periods were reclassified to be comparable
with the current period presentation.

• Other trading revenue was reclassified from foreign

exchange and other trading revenue to investment and
other income.

•

•

•

Foreign exchange and other trading revenue was
renamed foreign exchange revenue.

The impact of foreign currency remeasurement was
reclassified from investment and other income to
foreign exchange revenue.

Income (loss) from consolidated investment
management funds was reclassified to investment and
other income.

 •

Investment and other income was reclassified from fee
revenue to other revenue. Other revenue includes
investment and other income and net securities gains
(losses).

In addition, the assets and liabilities of consolidated
investment management funds were reclassified to other
assets and other liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated
balance sheet. The reclassifications had no impact on total
assets or total liabilities. Prior periods were reclassified to
be comparable with the current period presentation.

The table below summarizes the effects of the
reclassifications on the consolidated income statement.

Certain additional immaterial reclassifications have been
made to prior periods to place them on a basis comparable
with the current period presentation.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates based
upon assumptions about future economic and market
conditions which affect reported amounts and related
disclosures in our financial statements. Although our
current estimates contemplate current conditions and how
we expect them to change in the future, it is reasonably
possible that actual conditions could be worse than
anticipated in those estimates, which could materially
affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Note 2–Acquisitions and dispositions

In the fourth quarter of 2020, BNY Mellon entered into
agreements to sell two legal entities, with one of the sales
closing in the first quarter of 2021 and the other closing in
July 2021. BNY Mellon recorded a total after-tax loss of
$34 million on these transactions in the fourth quarter of
2020.

Note 3–Securities

The following tables present the amortized cost, the gross
unrealized gains and losses and the fair value of securities

In the second quarter of 2021, U.S. Treasury securities and
agency commercial MBS with an aggregate amortized cost
of $5.95 billion and fair value of $5.96 billion were
transferred from available-for-sale securities to held-to-
maturity securities to reduce the impact of changes in
interest rates on accumulated other comprehensive income.

The allowance for credit losses related to securities was
$10 million at June 30, 2021 and $11 million at Dec. 31,
2020, and primarily relates to the available-for-sale CLO
portfolio.

Credit quality indicators – Securities

At June 30, 2021, the gross unrealized losses on the
securities portfolio were primarily attributable to an
increase in credit spreads from the date of purchase, and
for certain securities that were transferred from available-
for-sale to held-to-maturity, an increase in interest rates
through the date they were transferred. Specifically, $85
million of the unrealized losses at June 30, 2021 and $44
million at Dec. 31, 2020 reflected in the available-for-sale
sections of the tables below relate to certain securities
(primarily U.S. Treasury securities and agency RMBS) that
were transferred in the second quarter of 2021 and prior
periods from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity. The
unrealized losses will be amortized into net

 
contractual lives of the securities.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

interest revenue over the contractual lives of the securities.
The transfer created a new cost basis for the securities. As
a result, if these securities have experienced unrealized
losses since the date of transfer, the corresponding fair
value and unrealized losses would be reflected in the held-
to-maturity securities portfolio in the following tables. We
do not intend to sell these securities, and it is not more
likely than not that we will have to sell these securities.

ratings classifications could indicate increased credit risk for us and could be accompanied by an increase in the allowance for
credit losses and/or a reduction in the fair value of our securities portfolio.

Pledged assets

At June 30, 2021, BNY Mellon had pledged assets of $141
billion, including $111 billion pledged as collateral for
potential borrowings at the Federal Reserve Discount
Window and $7 billion pledged as collateral for borrowing
at the Federal Home Loan Bank. The components of the
assets pledged at June 30, 2021 included $123 billion of
securities, $13 billion of loans, $5 billion of trading assets
and less than $1 billion of interest-bearing deposits with
banks.

If there has been no borrowing at the Federal Reserve
Discount Window, the Federal Reserve generally

 allows banks to freely move assets in and out of their
pledged assets account to sell or repledge the assets for
other purposes. BNY Mellon regularly moves assets in and
out of its pledged assets account at the Federal Reserve.

At Dec. 31, 2020, BNY Mellon had pledged assets of $141
billion, including $113 billion pledged as collateral for
potential borrowing at the Federal Reserve Discount
Window and $5 billion pledged as collateral for borrowing
at the Federal Home Loan Bank. The components of the
assets pledged at Dec. 31, 2020 included $124 billion of
securities, $11 billion of loans, $6 billion of trading assets
and less

than $1 billion of interest-bearing deposits with banks.

 Note 4–Loans and asset quality

At June 30, 2021 and Dec. 31, 2020, pledged assets
included $22 billion and $18 billion, respectively, for
which the recipients were permitted to sell or repledge the
assets delivered.

We also obtain securities as collateral, including receipts
under resale agreements, securities borrowed, derivative
contracts and custody agreements, on terms which permit
us to sell or repledge the securities to others. At June 30,
2021 and Dec. 31, 2020, the market value of the securities
received that can be sold or repledged was $111 billion and
$121 billion, respectively. We routinely sell or repledge
these securities through delivery to third parties. As of June
30, 2021 and Dec. 31, 2020, the market value of securities
collateral sold or repledged was $65 billion and $84
billion, respectively.

Restricted cash and securities

Cash and securities may be segregated under federal and
other regulations or requirements. At June 30, 2021 and
Dec. 31, 2020, cash segregated under federal and other
regulations or requirements was $4 billion and $3 billion,
respectively. Restricted cash is included in interest-bearing
deposits with banks on the consolidated balance sheet.
Securities segregated under federal and other regulations or
requirements were $2 billion at June 30, 2021 and $6
billion at Dec. 31, 2020. Restricted securities were sourced
from securities purchased under resale agreements and are
included in federal funds sold and securities purchased
under resale agreements on the consolidated balance sheet.

commercial, lease financings and mortgages. We manage
our portfolio at the class level, which consists of six classes
of financing receivables: commercial, commercial real
estate, financial institutions, lease financings, wealth
management loans and mortgages and other residential
mortgages.

The following tables are presented for each class of
financing receivables and provide additional information

Loan modifications

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, there have been two
forms of relief provided for classifying loans as TDRs: The
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the
“CARES Act”), the relevant provisions of which were
extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021,
and the Interagency Guidance. See Note 1 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2020 Annual
Report for additional details on the CARES Act,
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, and Interagency
Guidance. Financial institutions may account for eligible
loan modifications either under the CARES Act or the
Interagency Guidance. The

68 BNY Mellon

 Company has elected to apply both the CARES Act and the
Interagency Guidance, as applicable, in providing
borrowers with loan modification relief in response to the
coronavirus pandemic. We modified loans of $3 million in
the second quarter of 2021, $282 million in the second
quarter of 2020 and $6 million in the first quarter of 2021.
Nearly all of the modifications were short-term loan
payment forbearances or modified principal and/or interest
payments. These loans were primarily residential mortgage
and commercial real estate loans. We did not identify any
of the modifications as TDRs. At June 30, 2021, the unpaid
principal balance of the loans modified under the CARES
Act or Interagency Guidance was $77 million.

Credit quality indicators

Our credit strategy is to focus on investment-grade clients that are active users of our non-credit services. Each customer is
assigned an internal credit rating, which is mapped to an external rating agency grade equivalent, if possible, based upon a
number of dimensions, which are continually evaluated and may change over time.

The tables below provide information about the credit profile of the loan portfolio by the period of origination.

Commercial

 Financial institutions

The commercial loan portfolio is divided into investment
grade and non-investment grade categories based on the
assigned internal credit ratings, which are generally
consistent with those of the public rating agencies.
Customers with ratings consistent with BBB- (S&P)/Baa3
(Moody’s) or better are considered to be investment grade.
Those clients with ratings lower than this threshold are
considered to be non-investment grade.

Commercial real estate

Our income-producing commercial real estate facilities are
focused on experienced owners and are structured with
moderate leverage based on existing cash flows. Our
commercial real estate lending activities also include
construction and renovation facilities.

Financial institution exposures are high quality, with 96%
of the exposures meeting the investment grade equivalent
criteria of our internal credit rating classification at June
30, 2021. In addition, 71% of the financial institutions
exposure is secured. For example, securities industry
clients and asset managers often borrow against marketable
securities held in custody. The exposure to financial
institutions is generally short-term, with 87% expiring
within one year.

Wealth management loans and mortgages

Wealth management non-mortgage loans are not typically
rated by external rating agencies. A majority of the wealth
management loans are secured by the customers’
investment management accounts or custody accounts.
Eligible assets pledged for these loans are typically
investment grade fixed-income securities, equities and/or
mutual funds. Internal ratings for this portion of the wealth
management portfolio, therefore, would equate to
investment grade

 totaled $339 million at June 30, 2021 and $389 million at
Dec. 31, 2020. These loans are not typically correlated to
external ratings. Included in this portfolio at June 30, 2021
were $59 million of mortgage loans purchased in 2005,
2006 and the first quarter of 2007.

Overdrafts

Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities
clearance clients and totaled $4.3 billion at June 30, 2021
and $2.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. Overdrafts occur on a
daily basis and are generally repaid within two business
days.

Other loans

Other loans primarily include loans to consumers that are
fully collateralized with equities, mutual funds and fixed-
income securities.

Margin loans

We had $19.9 billion of secured margin loans at June 30,
2021, compared with $15.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2020.
Margin loans are collateralized with marketable securities,
and borrowers are required to maintain a daily collateral
margin in excess of 100% of the value of the loan. We have
rarely suffered a loss on these types of loans.

Reverse repurchase agreements

Reverse repurchase agreements at June 30, 2021 were fully
secured with high quality collateral. As a result, there was
no allowance for credit losses related to these assets at June
30, 2021.

BNY Mellon 71

external ratings. Wealth management loans are provided to
select customers based on the pledge of other types of
assets, including business assets, fixed assets or a modest
amount of commercial real estate. For the loans
collateralized by other assets, the credit quality of the
obligor is carefully analyzed, but we do not consider this
portfolio of loans to be investment grade.

Credit quality indicators for wealth management mortgages
are not correlated to external ratings. Wealth management
mortgages are typically loans to high-net-worth
individuals, which are secured primarily by residential
property. These loans are primarily interest-only, adjustable
rate mortgages with a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio
of 62% at origination. Delinquency rate is a key indicator
of credit quality in the wealth management portfolio. At
June 30, 2021, less than 1% of the mortgages were past
due.

At June 30, 2021, the wealth management mortgage
portfolio consisted of the following geographic
concentrations: California – 22%; New York – 16%;
Massachusetts – 9%; Florida – 9%; and other – 44%.

Lease financings

At June 30, 2021, the lease financings portfolio consisted
of exposures backed by well-diversified assets, primarily
real estate and large-ticket transportation equipment. The
largest component of our lease residual value exposure is
freight-related rail cars. Assets are both domestic and
foreign-based, with primary concentrations in Germany
and the U.S.

Other residential mortgages

The other residential mortgages portfolio primarily consists
of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and

Impairment testing

The goodwill impairment test is performed at least
annually at the reporting unit level. Intangible assets not
subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually
or more often if events or circumstances indicate they may
be impaired.

BNY Mellon’s three business segments include six
reporting units for which goodwill impairment testing is
performed on an annual basis. The Investment Services
segment is comprised of four reporting units and the
Investment and Wealth Management segment is comprised
of two reporting units. As a result of the annual goodwill
impairment test of the six reporting units conducted in the
second quarter of 2021, no goodwill impairment was
recognized.

plus or minus changes resulting from observable price
changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar
investment of the same issuer. The observable price

Qualified affordable housing project investments

We invest in affordable housing projects primarily to
satisfy the Company’s requirements under the Community
Reinvestment Act. Our total investment in qualified
affordable housing projects totaled $1.1 billion at June 30,
2021 and Dec. 31, 2020. Commitments to fund future
investments in qualified affordable housing projects totaled
$450 million at June 30, 2021 and $514 million at Dec. 31,
2020 and are recorded in other liabilities on the
consolidated balance sheet. A summary of the
commitments to

 fund future investments is as follows: 2021 – $132 million;
2022 – $110 million; 2023 – $151 million; 2024 – $36
million; 2025 – $1 million; and 2026 and thereafter – $20
million.

Tax credits and other tax benefits recognized were $38
million in the second quarter of 2021, $38 million in the
first quarter of 2021, $38 million in the second quarter of
2020, $76 million in the first six months of 2021 and $76

Investments valued using net asset value (“NAV”) per
share

In our Investment and Wealth Management business, we
make seed capital investments in certain funds we manage.
We also hold private equity investments, specifically small
business investment companies (“SBICs”), which are
compliant with the Volcker Rule, and certain other
corporate investments. Seed capital, private equity and
other corporate investments are included in other assets on
the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of certain of
these investments was estimated using the NAV per share
for our ownership interest in the funds.

Contract balances

Our clients are billed based on fee schedules that are
agreed upon in each customer contract. Receivables from
customers were $2.7 billion at June 30, 2021 and $2.4
billion at Dec. 31, 2020.

Contract assets represent accrued revenues that have not
yet been billed to the customers due to certain contractual
terms other than the passage of time and were $113 million
at June 30, 2021 and $32 million at Dec. 31, 2020. Accrued
revenues recorded as contract assets are usually billed on
an annual basis.

Both receivables from customers and contract assets are
included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.

Contract liabilities represent payments received in advance
of providing services under certain contracts and were
$189 million at June 30, 2021 and $167 million at Dec. 31,
2020. Contract liabilities are included in other liabilities on
the consolidated balance sheet. Revenue recognized in the
second quarter of 2021 relating to contract liabilities as of
March 31, 2021 was $67 million. Revenue recognized in
the first six months of 2021 relating to contract liabilities
as of Dec. 31, 2020 was $83 million.

76 BNY Mellon

 Changes in contract assets and liabilities primarily relate to
either party’s performance under the contracts.

Contract costs

Incremental costs for obtaining contracts that are deemed
recoverable are capitalized as contract costs. Such costs
result from the payment of sales incentives, primarily in
the Wealth Management business, and totaled $67 million
at June 30, 2021 and $73 million at Dec. 31, 2020.
Capitalized sales incentives are amortized based on the
transfer of goods or services to which the assets relate and
typically average nine years. The amortization of
capitalized sales incentives, which is primarily included in
staff expense on the consolidated income statement, totaled
$5 million in the second quarter of 2021, second quarter of
2020 and first quarter of 2021 and $10 million in the first
six months of 2021 and first six months of 2020.

Costs to fulfill a contract are capitalized when they relate
directly to an existing contract or a specific anticipated
contract, generate or enhance resources that will be used to
fulfill performance obligations, and are recoverable. Such
costs generally represent set-up costs, which include any
direct cost incurred at the inception of a contract which
enables the

 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

fulfillment of the performance obligation, and totaled $18
million at June 30, 2021 and $15 million at Dec. 31, 2020.
These capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line
basis over the expected contract period, which generally
ranges from seven to nine years. The amortization is
included in professional, legal and other purchased services
and other expenses on the consolidated income statement
and totaled less than $1 million in the second quarter of
2021, $2 million in the second quarter of 2020, less than $1
million in the first quarter of 2021, $1 million in the first
six months of 2021 and $3 million in the first six months of
2020.

Note 8–Net interest revenue

 Unsatisfied performance obligations

We do not have any unsatisfied performance obligations
other than those that are subject to a practical expedient
election under ASC 606, Revenue From Contracts With
Customers. The practical expedient election applies to (i)
contracts with an original expected length of one year or
less, and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at
the amount to which we have the right to invoice for
services performed.

Note 10–Income taxes

BNY Mellon recorded an income tax provision of $241
million (19.0% effective tax rate) in the second quarter of
2021, $216 million (18.3% effective tax rate) in the second
quarter of 2020 and $221 million (19.2% effective tax rate)
in the first quarter of 2021.

Our total tax reserves as of June 30, 2021 were $117
million compared with $119 million at Dec. 31, 2020. If
these tax reserves were unnecessary, $117 million would
affect the effective tax rate in future periods. We recognize
accrued interest and penalties, if applicable, related to
income taxes in income tax expense. Included in the
balance sheet at June 30, 2021 is accrued interest, where
applicable, of $31 million. The additional tax expense
related to interest for the six months ended June 30, 2021
was $4 million, compared with $3 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2020.

It is reasonably possible the total reserve for uncertain tax
positions could decrease within the next 12 months by
approximately $1 million as a result of adjustments related
to tax years that are still subject to examination.

 Our federal income tax returns are closed to examination
through 2016. Our New York State income tax returns are
closed to examination through 2014. Our New York City
income tax returns are closed to examination through 2012.
Our UK income tax returns are closed to examination
through 2018.

Note 11–Variable interest entities and
securitization

We have variable interests in variable interest entities
(“VIEs”), which include investments in retail, institutional
and alternative investment funds, including CLO structures
in which we provide asset management services, some of
which are consolidated.

We earn management fees from these funds as well as
performance fees in certain funds and may also provide
start-up capital for new funds. The funds are primarily
financed by our customers’ investments in the funds’ equity
or debt.

Additionally, we invest in qualified affordable housing and
renewable energy projects, which are designed to generate
a return primarily through the

78 BNY Mellon

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

realization of tax credits. The projects, which are structured
as limited partnerships and limited liability companies, are
also VIEs, but are not consolidated.

The following table presents the incremental assets and
liabilities included in the consolidated balance

 sheet as of June 30, 2021 and Dec. 31, 2020. The net assets
of any consolidated VIE are solely available to settle the
liabilities of the VIE and to settle any investors’ ownership
liquidation requests, including any seed capital we invested
in the VIE.

Note 14–Fair value measurement

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to
sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. A three-level hierarchy for fair value
measurements is utilized based upon the transparency of
inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the
measurement date. BNY Mellon’s own creditworthiness is
considered when valuing liabilities. See Note 20 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2020
Annual Report for

 information on how we determine fair value and the fair
value hierarchy.

The following tables present the financial instruments
carried at fair value at June 30, 2021 and Dec. 31, 2020, by
caption on the consolidated balance sheet and by the three-
level valuation hierarchy. We have included credit ratings
information in certain of the tables because the information
indicates the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed,
and significant changes in ratings classifications could
result in increased risk for us.

Note 15–Fair value option

We elected fair value as an alternative measurement for
selected financial assets and liabilities that are not
otherwise required to be measured at fair value, including
the assets and liabilities of consolidated investment
management funds and certain long-term debt. The
following table presents the assets and liabilities of
consolidated investment management funds, at fair value.

 prices for similar assets or liabilities. Quoted prices for
either identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive
markets may also be used. Accordingly, fair value best
reflects the interests BNY Mellon holds in the economic
performance of the consolidated investment management
funds. Changes in the value of the assets and liabilities are
recorded as income (loss) from consolidated investment
management funds, which is included in investment and
other income in the consolidated income statement.

We have elected the fair value option on $240 million of
long-term debt. The fair value of this long-term debt was
$400 million at June 30, 2021 and $400 million at Dec. 31,
2020. The long-term debt is valued using observable
market inputs and is included in Level 2 of the valuation
hierarchy.

The following table presents the changes in fair value of
long-term debt recorded in other trading revenue which is
included in investment and other income in the
consolidated income statement.

Note 16–Derivative instruments

We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk,
including interest rate risk, equity price risk and foreign
currency risk, as well as credit risk. Our trading activities
are focused on acting as a market-maker for our customers
and facilitating customer trades in compliance with the
Volcker Rule.

The notional amounts for derivative financial instruments
express the dollar volume of the transactions; however,
credit risk is much smaller. We perform credit reviews and
enter into netting agreements and collateral arrangements
to minimize the credit risk of derivative financial
instruments. We enter into offsetting positions to reduce
exposure to foreign currency, interest rate and equity price
risk.

Use of derivative financial instruments involves reliance
on counterparties. Failure of a counterparty to honor its
obligation under a derivative contract is a risk we assume
whenever we engage in a derivative contract. There were
no counterparty default losses recorded in the second
quarter of 2021.

Hedging derivatives

We utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage our
exposure to interest rate fluctuations. We enter into fair
value hedges as an interest rate risk management strategy
to reduce fair value variability by converting certain fixed
rate interest payments associated with available-for-sale
securities and long-term debt to floating interest rates. We
also utilize interest rate swaps and forward exchange
contracts as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to
interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes.

The available-for-sale securities hedged consist of U.S.
Treasury, agency and non-agency commercial MBS,
sovereign debt/sovereign guaranteed, corporate bonds and
foreign covered bonds. At June 30, 2021, $24.4 billion par
value of available-for-sale securities were hedged with
interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges that had
notional values of $24.4 billion.

The fixed rate long-term debt instruments hedged generally
have original maturities of five to 30 years. In fair value
hedging relationships, fixed rate debt is hedged with
“receive fixed rate, pay variable rate” swaps. At June 30,
2021, $22.6 billion par value of debt was hedged with
interest rate swaps designated

 as fair value hedges that had notional values of $22.6
billion.

In addition, we utilize forward foreign exchange contracts
as hedges to mitigate foreign exchange exposures. We use
forward foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges to
convert certain forecasted non-U.S. dollar revenue and
expenses into U.S. dollars. We use forward foreign
exchange contracts with maturities of 15 months or less as
cash flow hedges to hedge our foreign exchange exposure
to currencies such as Indian rupee, British pound, Hong
Kong dollar, Polish zloty, Singapore dollar and euro used
in revenue and expense transactions for entities that have
the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. As of June 30,
2021, the hedged forecasted foreign currency transactions
and designated forward foreign exchange contract hedges
were $360 million (notional), with a net pre-tax gain of $2
million recorded in accumulated OCI. Over the next 12
months, a gain of $3 million will be reclassified to
earnings.

We also utilize forward foreign exchange contracts as fair
value hedges of the foreign exchange risk associated with
available-for-sale securities. Forward points are designated
as an excluded component and amortized into earnings
over the hedge period. The unamortized derivative value
associated with the excluded component is recognized in
accumulated OCI. At June 30, 2021, $147 million par
value of available-for-sale securities was hedged with
foreign currency forward contracts that had a notional
value of $147 million.

Forward foreign exchange contracts are also used to hedge
the value of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
These forward foreign exchange contracts have maturities
of less than one year. The derivatives employed are
designated as hedges of changes in value of our foreign
investments due to exchange rates. The change in fair
market value of these forward foreign exchange contracts
is reported within foreign currency translation adjustments
in shareholders’ equity, net of tax. At June 30, 2021,
forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts
totaling $8.4 billion were designated as net investment
hedges.

In addition to forward foreign exchange contracts, we also
designate non-derivative financial instruments as hedges of
our net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Those non-
derivative financial instruments

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

designated as hedges of our net investments in foreign
subsidiaries were all long-term liabilities of BNY Mellon
and, at June 30, 2021, had a combined U.S. dollar
equivalent carrying value of $181 million.

Trading activities (including trading derivatives)

Our trading activities are focused on acting as a market-

risk-mitigating economic hedging in compliance with the
Volcker Rule. The change in the fair value of the
derivatives utilized in our trading activities is recorded in
foreign exchange revenue and investment and other
income on the consolidated income statement.

The following table presents our foreign exchange revenue
and other trading revenue.

(a)    In the first quarter of 2021, we reclassified certain items within total
revenue on the consolidated income statement and reclassified prior
periods to be comparable with the current period presentation. See
Note 1 for additional information.

 Foreign exchange revenue includes income from
purchasing and selling foreign currencies, currency
forwards, futures and options as well as foreign currency
remeasurement. Other trading revenue reflects results from
trading in cash instruments, including fixed income and
equity securities, and trading and economic hedging
activity with non-foreign exchange derivatives.

We also use derivative financial instruments as risk-
mitigating economic hedges, which are not formally
designated as accounting hedges. This includes hedging the
foreign currency, interest rate or market risks inherent in
some of our balance sheet exposures, such as seed capital
investments and deposits, as well as certain investment
management fee revenue streams. We also use total return
swaps to economically hedge obligations arising from the
Company’s deferred compensation plan whereby the
participants defer compensation and earn a return linked to
the performance of investments they select. The gains or
losses on these total return swaps are recorded in staff
expense on the consolidated income statement and were
gains of $13 million in the second quarter of 2021, $28
million in the second quarter of 2020, $10 million in the
first quarter of 2021 and $23

 Disclosure of contingent features in over-the-counter
(“OTC”) derivative instruments

We manage trading risk through a system of position
limits, a value-at-risk (“VaR”) methodology based on
historical simulation and other market sensitivity measures.
Risk is monitored and reported to senior management by a
separate unit, independent from trading, on a daily basis.
Based on certain assumptions, the VaR methodology is
designed to capture the potential overnight pre-tax dollar
loss from adverse changes in fair values of all trading
positions. The calculation assumes a one-day holding
period, utilizes a 99% confidence level and incorporates
non-linear product characteristics. The VaR model is one of
several statistical models used to develop economic capital
results, which are allocated to lines of business for
computing risk-adjusted performance.

VaR methodology does not evaluate risk attributable to
extraordinary financial, economic or other occurrences. As
a result, the risk assessment process includes a number of
stress scenarios based upon the risk factors in the portfolio
and management’s assessment of market conditions.
Additional stress scenarios based upon historical market
events are also performed. Stress tests may incorporate the
impact of reduced market liquidity and the breakdown of
historically observed correlations and extreme scenarios.
VaR and other statistical measures, stress testing and
sensitivity analysis are incorporated into other risk
management materials.

Counterparty credit risk and collateral

We assess the credit risk of our counterparties through
regular examination of their financial statements,
confidential communication with the management of those
counterparties and regular monitoring of publicly available
credit rating information. This and other information is
used to develop proprietary credit rating metrics used to
assess credit quality.

Collateral requirements are determined after a
comprehensive review of the credit quality of each
counterparty. Collateral is generally held or pledged in the
form of cash and/or highly liquid government securities.
Collateral requirements are monitored and adjusted daily.

Additional disclosures concerning derivative financial
instruments are provided in Note 14.

92 BNY Mellon

Certain OTC derivative contracts and/or collateral
agreements contain credit risk-contingent features
triggered upon a rating downgrade in which the
counterparty has the right to request additional collateral or
the right to terminate the contracts in a net liability
position.

The following table shows the aggregate fair value of OTC
derivative contracts in net liability positions that contained
credit risk-contingent features and the value of collateral

The Bank of New York Mellon, our largest banking

If The Bank of New York Mellon’s debt rating had fallen

 have required us to post additional collateral of $43 million

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Secured borrowings

The following table presents the contract value of repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions accounted for as
secured borrowings by the type of collateral provided to counterparties.

Repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions accounted for as secured borrowings

BNY Mellon’s repurchase agreements and securities
lending transactions primarily encounter risk associated
with liquidity. We are required to pledge collateral based
on predetermined terms within the agreements. If we were
to experience a decline in the fair value of the collateral
pledged for these transactions, we could be required to
provide additional collateral to the counterparty, therefore
decreasing the amount of assets available for other
liquidity needs that may arise. BNY Mellon also offers tri-
party collateral agency services in the tri-party repo market
where we are exposed to credit risk. In order to mitigate
this risk, we require dealers to fully secure intraday credit.

 Note 17–Commitments and contingent liabilities

Off-balance sheet arrangements

In the normal course of business, various commitments and
contingent liabilities are outstanding that are not reflected
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Our significant trading and off-balance sheet risks are
securities, foreign currency and interest rate risk
management products, commercial lending commitments,
letters of credit and securities lending indemnifications. We
assume these risks to reduce interest rate and foreign
currency risks, to provide customers with the ability to
meet credit and liquidity needs and to hedge foreign
currency and interest rate risks. These items involve, to
varying degrees, credit, foreign currency and interest rate
risks not recognized on the balance sheet. Our off-balance
sheet risks are managed and monitored in manners similar
to those used for on-balance sheet risks.



(a) Net of participations totaling $129 million at June 30, 2021 and

$154 million at Dec. 31, 2020.

(b) Excludes the indemnification for securities for which BNY Mellon
acts as an agent on behalf of CIBC Mellon clients, which totaled
$61 billion at June 30, 2021 and $62 billion at Dec. 31, 2020.
Includes cash collateral, invested in indemnified repurchase
agreements, held by us as securities lending agent of $47 billion at
June 30, 2021 and $41 billion at Dec. 31, 2020.

(c)

The total potential loss on undrawn lending commitments,
standby and commercial letters of credit, and securities
lending indemnifications is equal to the total notional
amount if drawn upon, which does not consider the value
of any collateral.

Since many of the lending commitments are expected to
expire without being drawn upon, the total amount does
not necessarily represent future cash requirements. A
summary of lending commitment maturities is as follows:
$29.5 billion in less than one year, $17.0 billion in one to
five years and $638 million over five years.

SBLCs principally support obligations of corporate clients
and were collateralized with cash and securities of $131
million at June 30, 2021 and $194 million at Dec. 31,
2020. At June 30, 2021, $1.5 billion of the SBLCs will
expire within one year, $702 million in one to five years
and none over five years.

We must recognize, at the inception of an SBLC and
foreign and other guarantees, a liability for the fair value of
the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The fair
value of the liability, which was recorded with a
corresponding asset in other assets, was estimated as the
present value of contractual customer fees. The estimated
liability for losses related to SBLCs and foreign and other
guarantees, if any, is included in the allowance for lending-
related commitments.

96 BNY Mellon

 Payment/performance risk of SBLCs is monitored using
both historical performance and internal ratings criteria.
BNY Mellon’s historical experience is that SBLCs
typically expire without being funded. SBLCs below
investment grade are monitored closely for
payment/performance risk. The table below shows SBLCs
by investment grade:



A commercial letter of credit is normally a short-term
instrument used to finance a commercial contract for the
shipment of goods from a seller to a buyer. Although the
commercial letter of credit is contingent upon the
satisfaction of specified conditions, it represents a credit
exposure if the buyer defaults on the underlying
transaction. As a result, the total contractual amounts do
not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
Commercial letters of credit totaled $98 million at June 30,
2021 and $60 million at Dec. 31, 2020.

We expect many of the lending commitments and letters of
credit to expire without the need to advance any cash. The
revenue associated with guarantees frequently depends on
the credit rating of the obligor and the structure of the
transaction, including collateral, if any. The allowance for
lending-related commitments was $50 million at June 30,
2021 and $121 million at Dec. 31, 2020.

A securities lending transaction is a fully collateralized
transaction in which the owner of a security agrees to lend
the security (typically through an agent, in our case, The
Bank of New York Mellon) to a borrower, usually a broker-
dealer or bank, on an open, overnight or term basis, under
the terms of a prearranged contract.

We typically lend securities with indemnification against
borrower default. We generally require the borrower to
provide collateral with a minimum value of 102% of the
fair value of the securities borrowed, which is monitored
on a daily basis, thus reducing credit risk. Market risk can
also arise in securities lending transactions. These risks are
controlled through policies limiting the level of risk that
can be undertaken. Securities lending transactions are
generally entered into only with highly rated

 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

counterparties. Securities lending indemnifications were
secured by collateral of $522 billion at June 30, 2021 and
$493 billion at Dec. 31, 2020.

CIBC Mellon, a joint venture between BNY Mellon and
the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (“CIBC”),
engages in securities lending activities.  CIBC Mellon,
BNY Mellon and CIBC jointly and severally indemnify
securities lenders against specific types of borrower
default. At June 30, 2021 and Dec. 31, 2020, $61 billion
and $62 billion, respectively, of borrowings at CIBC
Mellon, for which BNY Mellon acts as agent on behalf of
CIBC Mellon clients, were secured by collateral of $64
billion and $66 billion, respectively. If, upon a default, a
borrower’s collateral was not sufficient to cover its related
obligations, certain losses related to the indemnification
could be covered by the indemnitors.

Unsettled repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements

In the normal course of business, we enter into repurchase
agreements and reverse repurchase agreements that settle
at a future date. In repurchase agreements, BNY Mellon
receives cash from and provides securities as collateral to a
counterparty at settlement. In reverse repurchase
agreements, BNY Mellon advances cash to and receives
securities as collateral from the counterparty at settlement.
These transactions are recorded on the consolidated
balance sheet on the settlement date. At June 30, 2021, we
had $2.6 billion of unsettled repurchase agreements and
$6.4 billion of unsettled reverse repurchase agreements.

Industry concentrations

We have significant industry concentrations related to
credit exposure at June 30, 2021. The tables below present
our credit exposure in the financial institutions and
commercial portfolios.

Financial institutions
portfolio exposure
(in billions)

Major concentrations in securities lending are primarily to
broker-dealers and are generally collateralized with cash
and/or securities.

Sponsored member repo program

BNY Mellon is a sponsoring member in the FICC
sponsored member program, where we submit eligible
overnight repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions
in U.S. Treasury securities (“Sponsored Member
Transactions”) between BNY Mellon and our sponsored
member clients for novation and clearing through FICC
pursuant to the FICC Government Securities Division
rulebook (the “FICC Rules”). We also guarantee to FICC
the prompt and full payment and performance of our
sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under the
FICC Rules in connection with such clients’ Sponsored
Member Transactions. We minimize our credit exposure
under this guaranty by obtaining a security interest in our
sponsored member clients’ collateral and rights under
Sponsored Member Transactions. See “Offsetting assets
and liabilities” in Note 16 for additional information on our
repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements.

Indemnification arrangements

We have provided standard representations for
underwriting agreements, acquisition and divestiture
agreements, sales of loans and commitments, and other
similar types of arrangements and customary
indemnification for claims and legal proceedings related to
providing financial services that are not otherwise included
above. Insurance has been purchased to mitigate certain of
these risks. Generally, there are no stated or notional
amounts included in these indemnifications and the
contingencies triggering the obligation for indemnification
are not expected to occur. Furthermore, often
counterparties to these transactions provide us with
comparable indemnifications. We are unable to develop an
estimate of the maximum payout under these
indemnifications for several reasons. In addition to

 
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

BNY Mellon 97

the lack of a stated or notional amount in a majority of
such indemnifications, we are unable to predict the nature
of events that would trigger indemnification or the level of
indemnification for a certain event. We believe, however,
that the possibility that we will have to make any material
payments for these indemnifications is remote. At June 30,
2021 and Dec. 31, 2020, we have not recorded any
material liabilities under these arrangements.

 understanding, we do not believe that judgments,
settlements or orders, if any, arising from these matters
(either individually or in the aggregate, after giving effect
to applicable reserves and insurance coverage) will have a
material adverse effect on the consolidated financial
position or liquidity of BNY Mellon, although they could
have a material effect on our results of operations in a
given period.

Clearing and settlement exchanges

We are a noncontrolling equity investor in, and/or member
of, several industry clearing or settlement exchanges
through which foreign exchange, securities, derivatives or
other transactions settle. Certain of these industry clearing
and settlement exchanges require their members to
guarantee their obligations and liabilities and/or to provide
liquidity support in the event other members do not honor
their obligations. We believe the likelihood that a clearing
or settlement exchange (of which we are a member) would
become insolvent is remote. Additionally, certain
settlement exchanges have implemented loss allocation
policies that enable the exchange to allocate settlement
losses to the members of the exchange. It is not possible to
quantify such mark-to-market loss until the loss occurs.
Any ancillary costs that occur as a result of any mark-to-
market loss cannot be quantified. In addition, we also
sponsor clients as members on clearing and settlement
exchanges and guarantee their obligations. At June 30,
2021 and Dec. 31, 2020, we did not record any material
liabilities under these arrangements.

Legal proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, The Bank of New York
Mellon Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely
named as defendants in or made parties to pending and
potential legal actions. We also are subject to governmental
and regulatory examinations, information-gathering
requests, investigations and proceedings (both formal and
informal). Claims for significant monetary damages are
often asserted in many of these legal actions, while claims
for disgorgement, restitution, penalties and/or other
remedial actions or sanctions may be sought in
governmental and regulatory matters. It is inherently
difficult to predict the eventual outcomes of such matters
given their complexity and the particular facts and
circumstances at issue in each of these matters. However,
on the basis of our current knowledge and

98 BNY Mellon

In view of the inherent unpredictability of outcomes in
litigation and regulatory matters, particularly where (i) the
damages sought are substantial or indeterminate, (ii) the
proceedings are in the early stages, or (iii) the matters
involve novel legal theories or a large number of parties, as
a matter of course there is considerable uncertainty
surrounding the timing or ultimate resolution of litigation
and regulatory matters, including a possible eventual loss,
fine, penalty or business impact, if any, associated with
each such matter. In accordance with applicable accounting
guidance, we establish accruals for litigation and
regulatory matters when those matters proceed to a stage
where they present loss contingencies that are both
probable and reasonably estimable. In such cases, there
may be a possible exposure to loss in excess of any
amounts accrued. We regularly monitor such matters for
developments that could affect the amount of the accrual,
and will adjust the accrual amount as appropriate. If the
loss contingency in question is not both probable and
reasonably estimable, we do not establish an accrual and
the matter continues to be monitored for any developments
that would make the loss contingency both probable and
reasonably estimable. We believe that our accruals for legal
proceedings are appropriate and, in the aggregate, are not
material to the consolidated financial position of BNY
Mellon, although future accruals could have a material
effect on the results of operations in a given period. In
addition, if we have the potential to recover a portion of an
estimated loss from a third party, we record a receivable up
to the amount of the accrual that is probable of recovery.

For certain of those matters described here for which a loss
contingency may, in the future, be reasonably possible
(whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where
there is no accrued liability), BNY Mellon is currently
unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss. For
those matters described here where BNY Mellon is able to
estimate a reasonably possible loss, the aggregate range of
such reasonably possible loss is up to $735 million in

 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

excess of the accrued liability (if any) related to those
matters. For matters where a reasonably possible loss is
denominated in a foreign currency, our estimate is adjusted
quarterly based on prevailing exchange rates. We do not
consider potential recoveries when estimating reasonably
possible losses.

The following describes certain judicial, regulatory and
arbitration proceedings involving BNY Mellon:

Mortgage-Securitization Trusts Proceedings
The Bank of New York Mellon has been named as a
defendant in a number of legal actions brought by MBS
investors alleging that the trustee has expansive duties
under the governing agreements, including the duty to
investigate and pursue breach of representation and
warranty claims against other parties to the MBS
transactions. Three actions commenced in December 2014,
December 2015 and February 2017 are pending in New
York federal court; and one action commenced in May
2016 is pending in New York state court.

Matters Related to R. Allen Stanford
In late December 2005, Pershing LLC (“Pershing”)
became a clearing firm for Stanford Group Co. (“SGC”), a
registered broker-dealer that was part of a group of entities
ultimately controlled by R. Allen Stanford (“Stanford”).
Stanford International Bank, also controlled by Stanford,
issued certificates of deposit (“CDs”). Some investors
allegedly wired funds from their SGC accounts to purchase
CDs. In 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission
charged Stanford with operating a Ponzi scheme in
connection with the sale of CDs, and SGC was placed into
receivership. Alleged purchasers of CDs have filed two
putative class action proceedings against Pershing: one in
November 2009 in Texas federal court, and one in May
2016 in New Jersey federal court. After dismissals, three
lawsuits remain against Pershing in Louisiana and New
Jersey federal courts, which were filed in January 2010,
October 2015 and May 2016. The purchasers allege that
Pershing, as SGC’s clearing firm, assisted Stanford in a
fraudulent scheme and assert contractual, statutory and
common law claims. In March 2019, a group of investors
filed a putative class action against The Bank of New York
Mellon in New Jersey federal court, making the same
allegations as in the prior actions brought against Pershing.
All the cases that have been brought in federal court
against Pershing and the case brought against The Bank of
New York Mellon have been consolidated in Texas federal
court for discovery

 purposes. In July 2020, after being enjoined from pursuing
claims before the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority,
Inc. (“FINRA”), an investment firm filed an action against
Pershing in Texas federal court. This action has been
resolved. Various alleged Stanford CD purchasers asserted
similar claims in FINRA arbitration proceedings, all of
which have been settled or decided.

Brazilian Postalis Litigation
BNY Mellon Servicos Financeiros DTVM S.A.
(“DTVM”), a subsidiary that provides asset services in
Brazil, acts as administrator for certain investment funds in
which a public pension fund for postal workers called
Postalis-Instituto de Seguridade Social dos Correios e
Telégrafos (“Postalis”) invested. On Aug. 22, 2014,
Postalis sued DTVM in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for losses
related to a Postalis fund for which DTVM is
administrator. Postalis alleges that DTVM failed to
properly perform duties, including to conduct due diligence
of and exert control over the manager. On March 12, 2015,
Postalis filed a lawsuit in Rio de Janeiro against DTVM
and BNY Mellon Administração de Ativos Ltda. (“Ativos”)
alleging failure to properly perform duties relating to
another fund of which DTVM is administrator and Ativos
is manager. On Dec. 14, 2015, Associacão dos
Profissionais dos Correios (“ADCAP”), a Brazilian postal
workers association, filed a lawsuit in São Paulo against
DTVM and other defendants alleging that DTVM
improperly contributed to Postalis investment losses. On
March 20, 2017, the lawsuit was dismissed without
prejudice, and ADCAP has appealed that decision. On Dec.
17, 2015, Postalis filed three lawsuits in Rio de Janeiro
against DTVM and Ativos alleging failure to properly
perform duties with respect to investments in several other
funds. On May 20, 2021, the court in one of those lawsuits
entered a $3 million judgment against DTVM and Ativos,
which DTVM and Ativos intend to appeal. On Feb. 4,
2016, Postalis filed a lawsuit in Brasilia against DTVM,
Ativos and BNY Mellon Alocação de Patrimônio Ltda.
(“Alocação de Patrimônio”), an investment management
subsidiary, alleging failure to properly perform duties and
liability for losses with respect to investments in various
funds of which the defendants were administrator and/or
manager. On Jan. 16, 2018, the Brazilian Federal
Prosecution Service (“MPF”) filed a civil lawsuit in São
Paulo against DTVM alleging liability for Postalis losses
based on alleged failures to properly perform certain duties
as administrator to certain funds in which Postalis invested
or as controller of Postalis’s own

BNY Mellon 99

 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

investment portfolio. On April 18, 2018, the court
dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice, and the MPF has
appealed that decision. In addition, the Tribunal de Contas
da União (“TCU”), an administrative tribunal, has initiated
two proceedings with the purpose of determining liability
for losses to two investment funds administered by DTVM
in which Postalis was the exclusive investor. On Sept. 9,
2020, TCU rendered a decision in one of the proceedings,
finding DTVM and two former Postalis directors jointly
and severally liable for approximately $45 million. TCU
also imposed on DTVM a fine of approximately $2
million. DTVM has filed an administrative appeal of the
decision. On Oct. 4, 2019, Postalis and another pension
fund filed a request for arbitration in São Paulo against
DTVM and Ativos alleging liability for losses to an
investment fund for which DTVM was administrator and
Ativos was manager. On March 26, 2021, DTVM and
Ativos filed a lawsuit challenging the decision rendered by
the Arbitration Court with respect to its jurisdiction over
the case. On Oct. 25, 2019, Postalis filed a lawsuit in Rio
de Janeiro against DTVM and Alocação de Patrimônio,
alleging liability for losses in another fund for which
DTVM was administrator and Alocação de Patrimônio and
Ativos were managers. On June 19, 2020, a lawsuit was
filed in federal court in Rio de Janeiro against DTVM,
Postalis, and various other defendants alleging liability
against DTVM for certain Postalis losses in an investment
fund of which DTVM was administrator. On Feb. 10,
2021, Postalis and another pension fund served DTVM in a
lawsuit filed in Rio de Janeiro, alleging liability for losses
in another investment fund for which DTVM was
administrator and the other defendant was manager.

Brazilian Silverado Litigation
DTVM acts as administrator for the Fundo de Investimento
em Direitos Creditórios Multisetorial Silverado Maximum
(“Silverado Maximum Fund”), which invests in
commercial credit receivables. On June 2, 2016, the
Silverado Maximum Fund sued DTVM in its capacity as
administrator, along with Deutsche Bank S.A. - Banco
Alemão in its capacity as custodian and Silverado Gestão e
Investimentos Ltda. in its capacity as investment manager.
The Fund alleges that each of the defendants failed to
fulfill its respective duty, and caused losses to the Fund for
which the defendants are jointly and severally liable.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

 German Tax Matters
German authorities are investigating past “cum/ex”
trading, which involved the purchase of equity securities
on or shortly before the dividend date, but settled after that
date, potentially resulting in an unwarranted refund of
withholding tax. German authorities have taken the view
that past cum/ex trading may have resulted in tax
avoidance or evasion. European subsidiaries of BNY
Mellon have been informed by German authorities about
investigations into potential cum/ex trading by certain
third-party investment funds, where one of the subsidiaries
had acquired entities that served as depositary and/or fund
manager for those third-party investment funds. We have
received information requests from the authorities relating
to pre-acquisition activity and are cooperating fully with
those requests. In August 2019, the District Court of Bonn
ordered that one of these subsidiaries be joined as a
secondary party in connection with the prosecution of
unrelated individual defendants. Trial commenced in
September 2019. In March 2020, the court stated that it
would refrain from taking action against the subsidiary in
order to expedite the conclusion of the trial. The court
convicted the unrelated individual defendants, and
determined that the cum/ex trading activities of the
relevant third-party investment funds were unlawful. In
November and December 2020, we received secondary
liability notices from the German tax authorities totaling
approximately $150 million related to pre-acquisition
activity in various funds for which the entities we acquired
were depositary and/or fund manager. We have appealed
the notices. In connection with the acquisition of the
subject entities, we obtained an indemnity for liabilities
from the sellers that we intend to pursue as necessary.

Note 18–Lines of business

We have an internal information system that produces
performance data along product and service lines for our
two principal businesses and the Other segment. The
primary products and services and types of revenue for our
principal businesses and a description of the Other segment
are presented in Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in our 2020 Annual Report.

 
Business accounting principles

Our business data has been determined on an internal
management basis of accounting, rather than GAAP which
is used for consolidated financial reporting. These
measurement principles are designed so that reported
results of the businesses will track their economic
performance.

Business results are subject to reclassification when
organizational changes are made, or for refinements in
revenue and expense allocation methodologies.
Refinements are typically reflected on a prospective basis.
There were no reclassification or organization changes in
the second quarter of 2021.

The accounting policies of the businesses are the same as
those described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in our 2020 Annual Report.

The results of our businesses are presented and analyzed
on an internal management reporting basis.

• Revenue amounts reflect fee and other revenue

generated by each business and include revenue for
services provided between the segments that are also
provided to third parties. Fee and other revenue
transferred between businesses under revenue transfer
agreements is included within other revenue in each
business.

• Revenues and expenses associated with specific client
bases are included in those businesses. For example,
foreign exchange activity associated with clients using
custody products is included in Investment Services.

• Net interest revenue is allocated to businesses based on
the yields on the assets and liabilities generated by each
business. We employ a funds transfer pricing system
that matches funds with the

specific assets and liabilities of each business based on
their interest sensitivity and maturity characteristics.

• The provision for credit losses associated with the

respective credit portfolios is reflected in each business
segment.
Incentives expense related to restricted stock and RSUs
is allocated to the businesses.

•

• Support and other indirect expenses, including services
provided between segments that are not provided to
third parties or not subject to a revenue transfer
agreement, are allocated to businesses based on
internally developed methodologies and reflected in
noninterest expense.

• Recurring FDIC expense is allocated to the businesses

based on average deposits generated within each
business.

• Litigation expense is generally recorded in the business

in which the charge occurs.

• Management of the securities portfolio is a shared

service contained in the Other segment. As a result,
gains and losses associated with the valuation of the
securities portfolio are generally included in the Other
segment.

• Client deposits serve as the primary funding source for

our securities portfolio. We typically allocate all interest
revenue to the businesses generating the deposits.
Accordingly, accretion related to the portion of the
securities portfolio restructured in 2009 has been
included in the results of the businesses.

• Balance sheet assets and liabilities and their related
income or expense are specifically assigned to each
business. Businesses with a net liability position have
been allocated assets.

• Goodwill and intangible assets are reflected within

individual businesses.
