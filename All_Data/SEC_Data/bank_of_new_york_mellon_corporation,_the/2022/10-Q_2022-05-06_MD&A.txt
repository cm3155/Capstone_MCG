Overview
Established in 1784 by Alexander Hamilton, we were the first
company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: BK).
With a history of more than 235 years, BNY Mellon is a global
company dedicated to helping its clients manage and service their
financial assets throughout the investment lifecycle. Whether
providing financial services for institutions, corporations or
individual investors, BNY Mellon delivers informed investment
and wealth management and investment services in 35 countries.
BNY Mellon has three business segments, Securities Services,
Market and Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth
Management, which offer a comprehensive set of capabilities and
deep expertise across the investment lifecycle, enabling the
Company to provide solutions to buy-side and sell-side market
participants, as well as leading institutional and wealth
management clients globally.
The diagram below presents our three business segments and lines
of business, with the remaining operations in the Other segment.
Key first quarter 2022 events
Leadership succession
In March 2022, Todd Gibbons announced his decision to retire as
Chief Executive Officer and member of the Board of Directors
effective Aug. 31, 2022. The Board of Directors appointed Robin
Vince to the position of President and CEO-Elect, and intends to
appoint Mr. Vince to serve as CEO, in addition to his current role
as President, when Mr. Gibbons retires. Since 2020, Mr. Vince has
served as Vice Chair of BNY Mellon and CEO of Global Market
Infrastructure, which includes BNY Mellon’s Pershing, Treasury
Services, and Clearance and Collateral Management lines of
business, as well as Markets & Execution Services.
Impact of sanctions and actions related to Russia
As a result of the war in Ukraine, BNY Mellon has ceased new
banking business in Russia and suspended investment management
purchases of Russian securities. Government sanctions and our
actions resulted in an approximately $90 million reduction in fee
revenue in the first quarter of 2022, and is expected to impact the
Company’s annual
4 BNY Mellon
revenue by an estimated $80 million to $100 million going
forward. We will continue to work with multinational clients that
depend on our custody and recordkeeping services to manage their
exposures.
Highlights of first quarter 2022 results
Net income applicable to common shareholders was $699 million,
or $0.86 per diluted common share, in the first quarter of 2022. Net
income applicable to common shareholders was $858 million, or
$0.97 per diluted common share, in the first quarter of 2021. The
highlights below are based on the first quarter of 2022 compared
with the first quarter of 2021, unless otherwise noted.
• Total revenue of $3.9 billion was flat, primarily reflecting:
• Fee and other revenue decreased 1%, primarily reflecting:
• Fee revenue decreased 3%, mainly reflecting an $88
million reduction primarily due to accelerated
amortization of deferred costs for depositary receipts
services related to Russia. The decrease also reflects the
impact of lost business in the prior year in both Pershing
and Corporate Trust, the unfavorable impact of a stronger
U.S. dollar and lower foreign exchange revenue, partially
offset by higher market values. (See “Fee and other
revenue” beginning on page 6.)
• Investment and other revenue increased, primarily
reflecting a strategic equity investment gain in the first
quarter of 2022 and a $39 million impairment for a
renewable energy investment recorded in the first quarter
of 2021, partially offset by lower seed capital results. (See
“Fee and other revenue” beginning on page 6.)
• Net interest revenue increased 7%, primarily reflecting
higher interest rates on interest-earning assets, a change in
asset mix and lower funding expense, partially offset by
lower interest-earning assets. (See “Net interest revenue” on
page 9.)
• Provision for credit losses was $2 million compared with a
benefit of $83 million. (See “Consolidated balance sheet review
– Allowance for credit losses” beginning on page 27.)
• Noninterest expense increased approximately 5.5%, primarily
reflecting higher investments in growth, infrastructure and
efficiency initiatives and higher revenue-related expenses,
partially offset by the favorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.
(See “Noninterest expense” on page 11.)
• Effective tax rate of 16.7% includes a benefit from the annual
vesting of stock-based awards. (See “Income taxes” on page
11.)
Metrics
• AUC/A of $45.5 trillion increased 9%, primarily reflecting
client inflows, net new business and higher market values,
partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S.
dollar.
• AUM of $2.3 trillion increased 2%, primarily reflecting net
inflows and higher market values, partially offset by the
unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.
Capital and liquidity
• CET1 ratio was 10.1% at March 31, 2022, compared with
11.2% at Dec. 31, 2021. The decrease primarily reflects
unrealized losses on securities available-for-sale, higher riskweighted assets (“RWAs”) driven by the implementation of the
Standardized Approach to Counterparty Credit Risk and capital
deployed through dividends, partially offset by capital generated
through earnings. (See “Capital” beginning on page 33.)
• Tier 1 leverage was 5.3% at March 31, 2022, compared with
5.5% at Dec. 31, 2021. The decrease was driven by the decrease
in capital, partially offset by lower average assets. (See
“Capital” beginning on page 33.)
• Repurchased 1.9 million common shares for $118 million and
dividends to common shareholders were $278 million
(including dividend-equivalents on share-based awards).

N/M – Not meaningful.
Fee revenue decreased 3% compared with the first quarter of 2021
and 2% compared with the fourth quarter of 2021. The decreases
compared with the first quarter of 2021 and fourth quarter of 2021
mainly reflect an $88 million reduction primarily due to
accelerated amortization of deferred costs for depositary receipts
services related to Russia. The decrease compared with the first
quarter of 2021 also reflects the impact of lost business in the prior
year in both Pershing and Corporate Trust, the unfavorable impact
of a stronger U.S. dollar and lower foreign exchange revenue,
partially offset by higher market values. The decrease compared
with the fourth quarter of 2021 also reflects lower market values,
partially offset by lower money market fee waivers.
Investment and other revenue increased $61 million compared with
the first quarter of 2021 and decreased $37 million compared with
the fourth quarter of 2021.
The increase compared with the first quarter of 2021 primarily
reflects a strategic equity investment gain in the first quarter of
2022 and a $39 million impairment for a renewable energy
investment recorded in the first quarter of 2021, partially offset by
lower seed capital results. The decrease compared with the fourth
quarter of 2021 primarily reflects lower seed capital results.
Money market fee waivers
Given the continued low short-term interest rates, money market
mutual fund fees and other similar fees are being waived to protect
investors from negative returns. The fee waivers have impacted fee
revenues in most of our businesses, but also resulted in lower
distribution and servicing expense. Money market fee waivers are
highly sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates and are
difficult to predict.
6 BNY Mellon
The following table presents the impact of money market fee
waivers on our consolidated fee revenue, net of distribution and
servicing expense. In the first quarter of 2022, the net impact of
money market fee waivers was $199 million, down from $243
million in the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by higher interest
rates, partially offset by higher balances.

Investment services fees
Investment services fees decreased 3% compared with the first
quarter of 2021 and fourth quarter of 2021. Both decreases mainly
reflect the reduction primarily due to accelerated amortization of
deferred costs for depositary receipts services related to Russia.
The decrease compared with the first quarter of 2021 also reflects
the impact of lost business in the prior year in both Pershing and
Corporate Trust and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S.
dollar, partially offset by higher market values. The decrease
compared with the fourth quarter of 2021
was partially offset by lower money market fee waivers.
See “Securities Services business segment” and “Market and
Wealth Services business segment” in “Review of business
segments” for additional details.
Investment management and performance fees
Investment management and performance fees decreased 1%
compared with the first quarter of 2021 and fourth quarter of 2021.
The decrease compared with the first quarter of 2021 primarily
reflects the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and lower
equity income, partially offset by higher market values. The
decrease compared with the fourth quarter of 2021 primarily
reflects lower market values, partially offset by lower money
market fee waivers. Performance fees were $34 million in the first
quarter of 2022, $40 million in the first quarter of 2021 and $32
million in the fourth quarter of 2021. On a constant currency basis
(Non-GAAP), investment management and performance fees
increased 1% compared with the first quarter of 2021. See
“Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP and NonGAAP financial measures” beginning on page 41 for the
reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures.
AUM was $2.3 trillion at March 31, 2022, an increase of 2%
compared with March 31, 2021, primarily reflecting net inflows
and higher market values, partially offset by the unfavorable
impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.
See “Investment and Wealth Management business segment” in
“Review of business segments” for additional details regarding the
drivers of investment management and performance fees, AUM
and AUM flows.
Foreign exchange revenue
Foreign exchange revenue is primarily driven by the volume of
client transactions and the spread realized on these transactions,
both of which are impacted by market volatility, the impact of
foreign currency hedging activities and foreign currency
remeasurement gain (loss). Foreign exchange revenue decreased
10% compared with the first quarter of 2021 and increased 4%
compared with the fourth quarter of 2021. The decrease compared
with the first quarter of 2021 primarily reflects lower
BNY Mellon 7
volumes. The increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2021
primarily reflects higher volumes and volatility. Foreign exchange
revenue is primarily reported in the Securities Services business
segment and, to a lesser extent, the Market and Wealth Services
and Investment and Wealth Management business segments and
the Other segment.
Investment and other revenue
Investment and other revenue includes income or loss from
consolidated investment management funds, seed capital gains or
losses, other trading revenue or loss, renewable energy investments
losses, income from corporate and bank-owned life insurance
contracts, other investment gains or losses, gains or losses from
disposals, expense reimbursements from our CIBC Mellon joint
venture, other income or loss and net securities gains or losses. The
income or loss from consolidated investment management funds
should be considered together with the net income or loss
attributable to noncontrolling interests, which reflects the portion
of the consolidated funds for which we do not have an economic
interest and is reflected below net income as a separate line item on
the consolidated income statement. Other trading revenue or loss
primarily includes the impact of market-risk hedging activity
related to our seed capital investments in investment management
funds, non-foreign currency derivative and fixed income trading,
and other hedging activity. Investments in renewable energy
generate losses in investment and other revenue that are more than
offset by benefits and credits recorded to the provision for income
taxes. Other investment gains or losses includes fair value changes
of non-readily marketable equity securities, private equity and
other investments.
Expense reimbursements from our CIBC Mellon joint venture
relate to expenses incurred by BNY Mellon on behalf of the CIBC
Mellon joint venture. Other income or loss includes various
miscellaneous revenues.

other revenue.

Investment and other revenue was $70 million in the first quarter
of 2022 compared with $9 million in the first quarter of 2021 and
$107 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. The increase compared
with the first quarter of 2021 primarily reflects a strategic equity
investment gain in the first quarter of 2022 and a $39 million
impairment for a renewable energy investment recorded in the first
quarter of 2021, partially offset by lower seed capital results. The
decrease compared with the fourth quarter of 2021 primarily
reflects lower seed capital results.

income.
N/M – Not meaningful.
bps – basis points.
Net interest revenue increased 7% compared with the first quarter
of 2021 and 3% compared with the fourth quarter of 2021. The
increase compared with the first quarter of 2021 primarily reflects
higher interest rates on interest-earning assets, a change in asset
mix and lower funding expense, partially offset by lower interestearning assets. The increase compared with the fourth quarter of
2021 primarily reflects higher interest rates on interest-earning
assets, partially offset by higher funding expense and lower
interest-earning assets.
Net interest margin increased 9 basis points compared with the first
quarter of 2021 and 4 basis points compared with the fourth quarter
of 2021. The changes compared with the first quarter of 2021 and
the fourth quarter of 2021 primarily reflect the factors mentioned
above.
Average interest-earning assets decreased 6% compared with the
first quarter of 2021 and 2% compared with the fourth quarter of
2021. Both decreases primarily reflect lower interest-bearing
deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks, interestbearing deposits with banks and securities balances. These
decreases were partially offset by larger loan balances.
Average non-U.S. dollar deposits comprised approximately 25% of
our average total deposits in the first quarter of 2022.
Approximately 40% of the average non-U.S. dollar deposits in the
first quarter of 2022 were euro-denominated.

(a) Includes the average impact of of setting under enforceable netting agreements of approximately $53 billion for the first quarter of 2022, $54 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021 and $37
billion for the first quarter of 2021. On a Non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of of setting, the yield on federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements would have been
0.19% for the first quarter of 2022, 0.15% for the fourth quarter of 2021 and 0.19% for the first quarter of 2021. On a Non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of of setting, the rate on federal
funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements would have been 0.07% for the first quarter of 2022, 0.01% for the fourth quarter of 2021 and (0.02)% for the first quarter of
2021. We believe providing the rates excluding the impact of netting is useful to investors as it is more reflective of the actual rates earned and paid.

Total noninterest expense increased approximately 5.5% compared
with the first quarter of 2021 and 1% compared with the fourth
quarter of 2021. The increase compared with the first quarter of
2021 primarily reflects higher investments in growth, infrastructure
and efficiency initiatives and higher revenue-related expenses,
partially offset by the favorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.
The investments in growth, infrastructure and efficiency initiatives
are primarily included in staff, software and equipment, and
professional, legal and other purchased services expenses. The
increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2021 primarily
reflects higher staff and software and equipment expenses, partially
offset by lower professional, legal and other purchased services,
business development and net occupancy expenses. The increase in
staff expense was primarily driven by the annual vesting of stockbased awards to retirement eligible employees.
Income taxes
BNY Mellon recorded an income tax provision of $153 million
(16.7% effective tax rate) in the first quarter of 2022, $221 million
(19.2% effective tax rate) in the first quarter of 2021 and $196
million (18.4% effective tax rate) in the fourth quarter of 2021. For

Review of business segments
We have an internal information system that produces performance
data along product and service lines for our three principal business
segments: Securities Services, Market and Wealth Services and
Investment and Wealth Management, and the Other segment.
Business segment accounting principles
Our business data has been determined on an internal management
basis of accounting, rather than the generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”) used for consolidated financial reporting.
These measurement principles are designed so that reported results
of the businesses will track their economic performance.
For information on the accounting principles of our businesses, see
Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For
information on the primary products and services in each line of
business, the primary types of revenue by line of business and how
our business segments are presented and analyzed, see Note 24 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2021 Annual
Report.
Business segment results are subject to reclassification when
organizational changes are made, or for refinements in revenue and
expense allocation methodologies. Refinements are typically
reflected on a prospective basis. There were no reclassification or
organizational changes in the first quarter of 2022.
The results of our business segments may be influenced by client
and other activities that vary by quarter. In the first quarter, staff
expense typically increases reflecting the vesting of long-term
stock awards for retirement-eligible employees. Prior to 2022, in
the third quarter, staff expense typically increased reflecting the
annual employee merit increase. In 2022, this increase is expected
to be reflected in the second quarter.
In the third quarter, volume-related fees may decline due to
reduced client activity. In the fourth quarter, we typically incur
higher business development and marketing expenses. In our
Investment and Wealth Management business segment,
performance fees are typically higher in the fourth and first
quarters, as those quarters represent the end of the measurement
period for many of the performance fee-eligible relationships.
The results of our business segments may also be impacted by the
translation of financial results denominated in foreign currencies to
the U.S. dollar. We are primarily impacted by activities
denominated in the British pound and the euro. On a consolidated
basis and in our Securities Services and Market and Wealth
Services business segments, we typically have more foreign
currency-denominated expenses than revenues. However, our
Investment and Wealth Management business segment typically
has more foreign currency-denominated revenues than expenses.
Overall, currency fluctuations impact the year-over-year growth
rate in the Investment and Wealth Management business segment
more than the Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services
business segments. However, currency fluctuations, in isolation,
are not expected to significantly impact net income on a
consolidated basis.
Fee revenue in the Investment and Wealth Management business
segment, and to a lesser extent the Securities Services and Market
and Wealth Services business segments, is impacted by the global
market fluctuations. At March 31, 2022, we estimated that a 5%
change in global equity markets, spread evenly throughout the
year, would impact fee revenue by less than 1% and diluted
earnings per common share by $0.04 to $0.07.
See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
the consolidating schedules which show the contribution of our
business segments to our overall profitability.

Business segment description
The Securities Services business segment consists of two distinct
lines of business, Asset Servicing and Issuer Services, which
provide business solutions across the transaction lifecycle to our
global asset owner and asset manager clients. We are one of the
leading global investment services providers with $33.7 trillion of
AUC/A at March 31, 2022. For information on the drivers of the
Securities Services
fee revenue, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in our 2021 Annual Report.
The Asset Servicing business provides a comprehensive suite of
solutions. We are one of the largest global custody and front to
back outsourcing partners. We offer services for the safekeeping of
assets in capital markets globally as well as fund accounting
services, exchange-traded funds servicing, transfer agency, trust
and depository, front-to-back capabilities as well as data and
analytics solutions for
BNY Mellon 13
our clients. We deliver foreign exchange, and securities lending
and financing solutions, on both an agency and principal basis. Our
agency securities lending program is one of the largest lenders of
U.S. and non-U.S. securities, servicing a lendable asset pool of
approximately $4.8 trillion in 34 separate markets. Our marketleading liquidity services portal enables cash investments for
institutional clients and includes fund research and analytics.
The Issuer Services business includes Corporate Trust and
Depositary Receipts. Our Corporate Trust business delivers a full
range of issuer and related investor services, including trustee,
paying agency, fiduciary, escrow and other financial services. We
are a leading provider to the debt capital markets, providing
customized and market-driven solutions to investors,
bondholders and lenders. Our Depositary Receipts business
drives global investing by providing servicing and value-added
solutions that enable, facilitate and enhance cross-border trading,
clearing, settlement and ownership. We are one of the largest
providers of depositary receipts services in the world, partnering
with leading companies from more than 50 countries.
Review of financial results
AUC/A of $33.7 trillion increased 7% compared with March 31,
2021, primarily reflecting net new business, higher market values
and client inflows, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a
stronger U.S. dollar.
Total revenue of $1.8 billion was flat compared with the first
quarter of 2021 and decreased 3% compared with the fourth
quarter of 2021. The drivers of total revenue by line of business
are indicated below.
Asset Servicing revenue of $1.5 billion increased 6% compared
with the first quarter of 2021 and 4% compared with the fourth
quarter of 2021. The increase compared with the first quarter of
2021
primarily reflects a gain on a strategic equity investment and
higher market values and net interest revenue, partially offset by
lower foreign exchange revenue. The increase compared with the
fourth quarter of 2021 primarily reflects lower money market fee
waivers, higher strategic equity investment gains, increased
activity from existing clients and higher net interest revenue.
Issuer Services revenue of $268 million decreased 26%
compared with the first quarter of 2021 and 29% compared with
the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily reflecting the accelerated
amortization of deferred costs for depositary receipts services
related to Russia. The decrease compared with the first quarter of
2021 also reflects lower depositary receipts fees and the impact
of lost business in the prior year in Corporate Trust, partially
offset by higher net interest revenue. The decrease compared
with the fourth quarter of 2021 also reflects lower depositary
receipts fees, partially offset by lower money market fee waivers.
Market and regulatory trends are driving investable assets toward
lower fee asset management products at reduced margins for our
clients. These dynamics are also negatively impacting our
investment services fees. However, at the same time, these trends
are providing additional outsourcing opportunities as clients and
other market participants seek to comply with regulations and
reduce their operating costs.
Noninterest expense of $1.5 billion increased 6% compared with
the first quarter of 2021 and 1% compared with the fourth
quarter of 2021, primarily reflecting higher investments in
growth, infrastructure and efficiency initiatives. The increase
compared with the first quarter of 2021 also reflects higher
revenue-related expenses, partially offset by the favorable impact
of a stronger U.S. dollar. The increase compared with the fourth
quarter of 2021 was partially offset by lower litigation reserves
and revenue-related expenses.

Review of financial results
AUC/A of $11.6 trillion increased 17% compared with March 31,
2021, primarily reflecting client activity.
Total revenue of $1.2 billion was flat compared with the first
quarter of 2021 and increased 2% compared with the fourth quarter
of 2021. The drivers of total revenue by line of business are
indicated below.
Pershing revenue of $570 million decreased 6% compared with the
first quarter of 2021 and increased 3% compared with the fourth
quarter of 2021. The decrease compared with the first quarter of
2021 primarily reflects the impact of prior year lost business and
elevated first quarter 2021 transaction activity, partially offset by
higher market values and growth from existing clients. The
increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2021 primarily
reflects higher transaction activity from existing clients.
Treasury Services revenue of $338 million increased 7% compared
with the first quarter of 2021 and 2% compared with the fourth
quarter of 2021. The increase compared with the first quarter of
2021 primarily reflects higher net interest revenue and client
activity from both new and existing clients. The increase compared
with the fourth quarter of 2021 primarily reflects lower money
market fee waivers and higher net interest revenue, partially offset
by lower payment volumes.
Clearance and Collateral Management revenue of $294 million
increased 5% compared with the first quarter of 2021 and 2%
compared with the fourth quarter of 2021. The increase compared
with the first quarter of 2021 primarily reflects higher balances and
clearance volumes. The increase compared with the fourth quarter
of 2021 primarily reflects higher clearance volumes.
Noninterest expense of $708 million increased 4% compared with
the first quarter of 2021 and 5% compared with the fourth quarter
of 2021. Both increases primarily reflect higher investments in
growth, infrastructure and efficiency initiatives. The increase
compared with the fourth quarter of 2021 also reflects higher staff
expense.

Business segment description
Our Investment and Wealth Management business segment
consists of two distinct lines of business, Investment Management
and Wealth Management. Our investment firms deliver a highly
diversified portfolio of investment strategies independently, and
through our global distribution network, to institutional and retail
clients globally. BNY Mellon Wealth Management provides
investment management, custody, wealth and estate planning,
private banking services, investment servicing and information
management. See pages 20 and 21 of our 2021 Annual Report for
additional information on our Investment and Wealth Management
business segment.
Review of financial results
AUM increased 2% compared with March 31, 2021, primarily
reflecting net inflows and higher market values, partially offset by
the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.
Net long-term strategy outflows were $1 billion in the first quarter
of 2022, driven by outflows of fixed income, index, equity and
multi-asset and alternative investments, partially offset by inflows
of liability-driven investments. Short-term strategy outflows were
$11 billion in the first quarter of 2022. Market and regulatory
trends have resulted in increased demand for lower fee asset
management products and for performance-based fees.
Total revenue of $1.0 billion decreased 3% compared with the first
quarter of 2021 and 5% compared with the fourth quarter of 2021.
Investment Management revenue of $658 million decreased 6%
compared with the first quarter of 2021 and 7% compared with the
fourth quarter of 2021. The decrease compared with the first
quarter of 2021 primarily reflects lower seed capital results, the
unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and lower equity
income, partially offset by higher market values. The decrease
compared with the fourth quarter of 2021 primarily reflects a
strategic equity
18 BNY Mellon
gain recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021, seed capital losses and
lower market values, partially offset by lower money market fee
waivers.
Wealth Management revenue of $306 million increased 4%
compared with the first quarter of 2021 and decreased 2%
compared with the fourth quarter of 2021. The increase compared
with the first quarter of 2021 reflects higher net interest revenue
and market values. The decrease compared with the fourth quarter
of 2021 primarily reflects lower market values, partially offset by
higher net interest revenue.
Revenue generated in the Investment and Wealth Management
business segment included 39% from
non-U.S. sources in the first quarter of 2022, compared with 38%
in the first quarter of 2021 and fourth quarter of 2021.
Noninterest expense of $755 million increased 6% compared with
the first quarter of 2021 and 1% compared with the fourth quarter
of 2021. The increase compared with the first quarter of 2021
primarily reflects higher investments in growth initiatives and
revenue-related expenses, partially offset by the favorable impact
of a stronger U.S. dollar. The increase compared with the fourth
quarter of 2021 primarily reflects higher staff expense.

Review of financial results
Total revenue includes corporate treasury and other investment
activity, including hedging activity, which has an offsetting impact
between fee and other revenue and net interest expense.
Total revenue increased $53 million compared with the first quarter
of 2021 and $5 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2021.
The increase compared with the first quarter of 2021 primarily
reflects a $39 million impairment for a renewable energy
investment recorded in the first quarter of 2021.
The provision for credit losses was $17 million in the first quarter
of 2022 and was primarily related to interest-bearing deposits with
banks in Russia.
Noninterest expense decreased $8 million compared with the first
quarter of 2021 and $22 million compared with the fourth quarter
of 2021. Both decreases primarily reflect lower staff expense.
Critical accounting estimates
Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2021 Annual
Report. Our critical accounting estimates are those related to the
allowance for credit losses, goodwill and other intangibles and
litigation and regulatory contingencies, as referenced below.

Consolidated balance sheet review
One of our key risk management objectives is to maintain a
balance sheet that remains strong throughout market cycles to meet
the expectations of our major stakeholders, including our
shareholders, clients, creditors and regulators.
We also seek to undertake overall liquidity risk, including intraday
liquidity risk, that stays within our risk appetite. The objective of
our balance sheet management strategy is to maintain a balance
sheet that is characterized by strong liquidity and asset quality,
ready access to external funding sources at competitive rates and a
strong capital structure that supports our risk-taking activities and
is adequate to absorb potential losses. In managing the balance
sheet, appropriate consideration is given to balancing the
competing needs of maintaining sufficient levels of liquidity and
complying with applicable regulations and supervisory
expectations while optimizing profitability.
At March 31, 2022, total assets were $474 billion, compared with
$444 billion at Dec. 31, 2021. The increase in total assets was
primarily driven by higher interest-bearing deposits with the
Federal Reserve and other central banks, partially offset by lower
securities. Deposits totaled $346 billion at March 31, 2022,
compared with $320 billion at Dec. 31, 2021. The increase reflects
higher interest-bearing deposits in U.S. offices, noninterest-bearing
deposits (principally U.S. offices) and interest-bearing deposits in
non-U.S. offices. Total interest-bearing deposits as a percentage of
total interest-earning assets were 61% at March 31, 2022 and 60%
at Dec. 31, 2021.
At March 31, 2022, available funds totaled $187 billion and
includes cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits with
the Federal Reserve and other central banks, interest-bearing
deposits with banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased
under resale agreements. This compares with available funds of
$155 billion at Dec. 31, 2021. Total available funds as a percentage
of total assets were 40% at March 31, 2022 and 35% at Dec. 31,
2021. For additional information on our available funds, see
“Liquidity and dividends.”
Securities were $153 billion, or 32% of total assets, at March 31,
2022, compared with $159 billion, or 36% of total assets, at Dec.
31, 2021. The decrease primarily reflects unrealized pre-tax losses
and lower agency residential mortgage-backed securities
(“RMBS”), partially offset by an increase in U.S. government
agency securities. For additional information on our securities
portfolio, see “Securities” and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Loans were $68.1 billion, or 14% of total assets, at March 31,
2022, compared with $67.8 billion, or 15% of total assets, at Dec.
31, 2021. The increase was primarily driven by higher overdrafts,
capital call financing and wealth management loans, partially
offset by lower loans to financial institutions. For additional
information on our loan portfolio, see “Loans” and Note 4 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Long-term debt totaled $25 billion at March 31, 2022 and $26
billion at Dec. 31, 2021. Redemptions and a decrease in the fair
value of hedged long-term debt were partially offset by issuances.
For additional information on long-term debt, see “Liquidity and
dividends.”
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total shareholders’
equity decreased to $42 billion at March 31, 2022 from $43 billion
at Dec. 31, 2021. For additional information, see “Capital.”

Country risk exposure
The following table presents BNY Mellon’s top 10 exposures by
country (excluding the U.S.) as of March 31, 2022, as well as
certain countries with higher risk profiles. The exposure is
presented on an internal risk management basis and has not been
reduced by the allowance for credit losses. We monitor our
exposure to these and other countries as part of our internal country
risk management process.
The country risk exposure below reflects the Company’s risk to an
immediate default of the counterparty or obligor based on the
country of residence of the entity which incurs the liability. If there
is credit risk mitigation, the country of residence of the entity
providing the risk mitigation is the country of risk. The country of
risk for securities is generally based on the domicile of the issuer of
the security.

Events in recent years have resulted in increased focus on Brazil.
The country risk exposure to Brazil is primarily short-term trade
finance loans extended to large financial institutions. We also have
operations in Brazil providing investment services and investment
management services.
The war in Ukraine has increased our focus on Russia. The country
risk exposure to Russia consists of interest-bearing deposits and a
letter of credit. BNY Mellon has ceased new banking business in
Russia and suspended investment management purchases of
Russian securities. At March 31, 2022, less than 0.1% of our
AUC/A and less than 0.01% of our AUM consisted of Russian
securities. We will
continue to work with multinational clients that depend on our
custody and record keeping services to manage their exposures.
Securities
In the discussion of our securities portfolio, we have included
certain credit ratings information because the information can
indicate the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed.
Significant changes in ratings classifications could indicate
increased credit risk for us and could be accompanied by an
increase in the allowance for credit losses and/or a reduction in the
fair value of our securities portfolio.

(h) Includes unrealized losses of $1,505 million at March 31, 2022 related to available-for-sale securities, net of hedges, and $2,943 million related to held-to-maturity securities.
The fair value of our securities portfolio, including related hedges,
was $151.4 billion at March 31, 2022, compared with $158.0
billion at Dec. 31, 2021. The decrease primarily reflects unrealized
pre-tax losses and lower agency RMBS, partially offset by an
increase in U.S. government agency securities.
At March 31, 2022, the securities portfolio had a net unrealized
loss, including the impact of related hedges, of $4.4 billion,
compared with a net unrealized gain, including the impact of
related hedges, of $384 million at Dec. 31, 2021. The increase in
the net unrealized loss, including the impact of hedges, was
primarily driven by higher market interest rates.
The fair value of the available-for-sale securities totaled $93.7
billion at March 31, 2022, net of hedges, or 62% of the securities
portfolio, net of hedges. The fair value of the held-to-maturity
securities totaled $57.7 billion at March 31, 2022, or 38% of the
securities portfolio, net of hedges.
The unrealized loss (after-tax) on our available-for-sale securities
portfolio, net of hedges, included in accumulated other
comprehensive income was $1.1 billion at March 31, 2022,
compared with an unrealized gain (after-tax), net of hedges, of
$362 million at Dec. 31, 2021. The increase in the unrealized loss,
net of tax, was primarily driven by higher market interest rates.
At March 31, 2022, 97% of the securities in our portfolio were
rated AAA/AA-, compared with 96% at Dec. 31, 2021.

At March 31, 2022, total lending-related exposure of $117.4 billion
increased 1% compared with Dec. 31, 2021, primarily reflecting
higher overdrafts and higher exposure in the commercial real
estate, capital call financing and wealth management loan
portfolios, partially offset by lower exposure in the financial
institutions portfolio and lower margin loans.
Our financial institutions and commercial portfolios comprise our
largest concentrated risk. These portfolios comprised 46% of our
total exposure at March 31, 2022 and 47% at Dec. 31, 2021.
Additionally, most of our overdrafts relate to financial institutions.

The financial institutions portfolio exposure was $40.3 billion at
March 31, 2022, a decrease of 1% compared with Dec. 31, 2021,
primarily reflecting lower exposure to the securities industry and
bank portfolios, partially offset by higher exposure to the asset
managers, insurance and other portfolios.
Financial institution exposures are high-quality, with 97% of the
exposures meeting the investment grade equivalent criteria of our
internal credit rating classification at March 31, 2022. Each
customer is assigned an internal credit rating, which is mapped to
an equivalent external rating agency grade based upon a number of
dimensions, which are continually evaluated and may change over
time. For ratings of non-U.S. counterparties, our internal credit
rating is generally capped at a rating equivalent to the sovereign
rating of the country where the counterparty resides, regardless of
the internal credit rating assigned to the counterparty or the
underlying collateral.
The exposure to financial institutions is generally short-term, with
84% of the exposures expiring within one year. At March 31, 2022
and Dec. 31, 2021, 17% of the exposure to financial institutions
had an expiration within 90 days.
In addition, 64% of the financial institutions exposure is secured.
For example, securities industry clients
and asset managers often borrow against marketable securities held
in custody.
At March 31, 2022, the secured intra-day credit provided to dealers
in connection with their tri-party repo activity totaled $16.4 billion
and was included in the securities industry portfolio. Dealers
secure the outstanding intraday credit with high-quality liquid
collateral having a market value in excess of the amount of the
outstanding credit. Secured intraday credit facilities represent
approximately 41% of the exposure in the financial institutions
portfolio and are reviewed and reapproved annually.
The asset managers portfolio exposure is high-quality, with 99% of
the exposures meeting our investment grade equivalent ratings
criteria as of March 31, 2022. These exposures are generally shortterm liquidity facilities, with the majority to regulated mutual
funds.
Our banks exposure primarily relates to our global trade finance.
These exposures are short-term in nature, with 97% due in less
than one year. The investment grade percentage of our banks
exposure was 88% at March 31, 2022 and Dec. 31, 2021. Our noninvestment grade exposures are primarily trade finance loans in
Brazil.

Wealth management loans
Our wealth management loan exposure was $10.6 billion at March
31, 2022, compared with $10.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2021. Wealth
management loans
primarily consist of loans to high-net-worth individuals, a majority
of which are secured by the customers’ investment management
accounts or custody accounts.
Wealth management mortgages
Our wealth management mortgage exposure was $8.9 billion at
March 31, 2022, compared with $8.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2021.
Wealth management mortgages primarily consist of loans to highnet-worth individuals, which are secured by residential property.
Wealth management mortgages are primarily interest-only,
adjustable-rate mortgages with a weighted-average loan-to-value
ratio of 61% at origination. At March 31, 2022, less than 1% of the
mortgages were past due.
At March 31, 2022, the wealth management mortgage portfolio
consisted of the following geographic concentrations: California –

Our commercial real estate exposure totaled $9.7 billion at March
31, 2022 and $9.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2021. Our income-producing
commercial real estate facilities are focused on experienced owners
and are structured with moderate leverage based on existing cash
flows. Our commercial real estate lending activities also include
construction and renovation facilities. Our client base consists of
experienced developers and long-term holders of real estate assets.
Loans are approved on the basis of existing or projected cash flows
and supported by appraisals and knowledge of local market
conditions. Development loans are structured with moderate
leverage, and in many instances, involve some level of recourse to
the developer.
At March 31, 2022, the unsecured portfolio consisted of real estate
investment trusts (“REITs”) and real estate operating companies,
which are both primarily investment grade.
At March 31, 2022, our commercial real estate portfolio consisted
of the following concentrations: New York metro – 37%; REITs
and real estate operating companies – 31%; and other – 32%.
Lease financings
The lease financings portfolio exposure totaled $707 million at
March 31, 2022 and $731 million at Dec. 31, 2021. At March 31,
2022, approximately 99% of leasing exposure was investment
grade, or investment grade equivalent and consisted of exposures
backed by well-diversified assets, primarily real estate and largeticket transportation equipment. The largest components of our
lease residual value exposure relate to aircraft and freight-related
rail cars. Assets
are both domestic and foreign-based, with primary concentrations
in the Germany and the U.S.
Other residential mortgages
The other residential mortgages portfolio primarily consists of 1-4
family residential mortgage loans and totaled $285 million at
March 31, 2022 and $299 million at Dec. 31, 2021.
Overdrafts
Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities clearance
clients and are generally repaid within two business days.
Capital call financing
Capital call financing includes loans to private equity funds that are
secured by the fund investors’ capital commitments and the funds’
rights to call capital.
Other loans
Other loans primarily include loans to consumers that are fully
collateralized with equities, mutual funds and fixed-income
securities.
Margin loans
Margin loan exposure of $22.1 billion at March 31, 2022 and $22.5
billion at Dec. 31, 2021 was collateralized with marketable
securities. Borrowers are required to maintain a daily collateral
margin in excess of 100% of the value of the loan. Margin loans
included $7.8 billion at March 31, 2022 and $7.7 billion at Dec. 31,
2021 related to a term loan program that offers fully collateralized
loans to broker-dealers.
26 BNY Mellon
Allowance for credit losses
Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade clients who are active users of our non-credit services. Our primary exposure to the credit risk
of a customer consists of funded loans, unfunded contractual commitments to lend, standby letters of credit and overdrafts associated with our
custody and securities clearance businesses.
The following table details changes in our allowance for credit losses.

(a) Includes allowance for credit losses on federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements, available-for-sale securities, held-to-maturity securities,
accounts receivable, cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits with banks.
The provision for credit losses was $2 million in the first quarter of
2022 compared with a benefit of $83 million in the first quarter of
2021 and a benefit of $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.
The allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-related
commitments represent management’s estimate of lifetime
expected losses in our credit portfolio. This evaluation process is
subject to numerous estimates and judgments. To the
extent actual results differ from forecasts or management’s
judgment, the allowance for credit losses may be greater or less
than future charge-offs.
Based on an evaluation of the allowance for credit losses as
discussed in “Critical accounting estimates,” in our 2021 Annual
Report, we have allocated our allowance for loans and lendingrelated commitments as presented below.

BNY Mellon 27
The allocation of the allowance for credit losses is inherently
judgmental, and the entire allowance for credit losses is available
to absorb credit losses regardless of the nature of the losses.
Our allowance for credit losses is sensitive to a number of inputs,
most notably the credit ratings assigned to each borrower, as well
as macroeconomic forecast assumptions that are incorporated in
our estimate of credit losses through the expected life of the loan
portfolio. Thus, as the macroeconomic environment and related
forecasts change, the allowance for credit losses may change
materially. The following sensitivity analyses do not represent
management’s expectations of the deterioration of our portfolios or
the economic environment, but are provided as hypothetical
scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses
to changes in key inputs. If commercial real estate property values
were increased 10% and all other credit were rated one grade
better, the quantitative allowance would have decreased by
$37 million, and if commercial real estate property values were
decreased 10% and all other credit were rated one grade worse, the
quantitative allowance would have increased by $80 million. Our
multi-scenario based macroeconomic forecast used in determining
the March 31, 2022 allowance for credit losses consisted of three
scenarios. The weightings applied to those scenarios and
qualitative judgments to determine the March 31, 2022 allowance
for credit losses incorporated information related to the estimated
impacts to the macroeconomic outlook and our exposures as a
result of the war in Ukraine as well as the status of COVID-19.

Deposits
Total deposits were $345.6 billion at March 31, 2022, an increase
of 8%, compared with $319.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2021. The
increase reflects higher interest-bearing deposits in U.S. offices,
noninterest-bearing deposits (principally U.S. offices) and interestbearing deposits in non-U.S. offices.
Noninterest-bearing deposits were $100.0 billion at March 31,
2022, compared with $93.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2021. Interestbearing deposits were primarily demand deposits and totaled
$245.6 billion at March 31, 2022, compared with $226.0 billion at
Dec. 31, 2021.
Short-term borrowings
We fund ourselves primarily through deposits and, to a lesser
extent, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Short-term
borrowings consist of federal funds purchased and securities sold
under repurchase agreements, payables to customers and brokerdealers, commercial paper and other borrowed funds. Certain
short-term borrowings, for example, securities sold under
repurchase agreements, require the delivery of securities as
collateral.
Federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements include repurchase agreement activity with the Fixed
Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”), where we record interest
expense gross,
28 BNY Mellon
but the ending and average balances reflect the impact of offsetting
under enforceable netting agreements. This activity primarily
relates to government securities collateralized resale and
repurchase agreements executed with clients that are novated to
and settle with the FICC.
Payables to customers and broker-dealers represent funds awaiting
reinvestment and short sale proceeds payable on demand. Payables
to customers and broker-dealers are driven by customer trading
activity and market volatility.
The Bank of New York Mellon may issue commercial paper that
matures within 397 days from the date of issue and is not
redeemable prior to maturity or subject to voluntary prepayment.
Other borrowed funds primarily include overdrafts of subcustodian account balances in our Securities Services businesses,
finance lease liabilities and borrowings under lines of credit by our
Pershing subsidiaries. Overdrafts typically relate to timing
differences for settlements.
Liquidity and dividends
BNY Mellon defines liquidity as the ability of the Parent and its
subsidiaries to access funding or convert assets to cash quickly and
efficiently, or to roll over or issue new debt, especially during
periods of market stress, at a reasonable cost, and in order to meet
its short-term (up to one year) obligations. Funding liquidity risk is
the risk that BNY Mellon cannot meet its cash and collateral
obligations at a reasonable cost for both expected and unexpected
cash flow and collateral needs without adversely affecting daily
operations or our financial condition. Funding liquidity risk can
arise from funding mismatches, market constraints from the
inability to convert assets into cash, the inability to hold or raise
cash, low overnight deposits, deposit run-off or contingent liquidity
events.
Changes in economic conditions or exposure to credit, market,
operational, legal and reputational risks also can affect BNY
Mellon’s liquidity risk profile and are considered in our liquidity
risk framework. For additional information, see “Risk Management
– Liquidity Risk” in our 2021 Annual Report.
The Parent’s policy is to have access to sufficient unencumbered
cash and cash equivalents at each quarter-end to cover maturities
and other forecasted debt redemptions, net interest payments and
net tax payments for the following 18-month period, and to provide
sufficient collateral to satisfy transactions subject to Section 23A of
the Federal Reserve Act. As of March 31, 2022, the Parent was in
compliance with this policy.
We monitor and control liquidity exposures and funding needs
within and across significant legal entities, branches, currencies
and business lines, taking into account, among other factors, any
applicable restrictions on the transfer of liquidity among entities.
BNY Mellon also manages potential intraday liquidity risks. We
monitor and manage intraday liquidity against existing and
expected intraday liquid resources (such as cash balances,
remaining intraday credit capacity, intraday contingency funding
and available collateral) to enable BNY Mellon to meet its intraday
obligations under normal and reasonably severe stressed
conditions.
We define available funds for internal liquidity management
purposes as cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits
with the Federal Reserve and other central banks, interest-bearing
deposits with banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased
under resale agreements. The following table presents our total
available funds at period end and on an average basis.

Total available funds as a percentage of total assets 40 % 35 % 34 % 35 % 40 %
Total available funds were $187.2 billion at March 31, 2022,
compared with $154.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2021. The increase was
primarily due to higher interest-bearing deposits with the Federal
Reserve and other central banks and interest-bearing deposits with
banks, partially offset by lower federal funds sold and securities
purchased under resale agreements.
Average non-core sources of funds, such as federal funds
purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements, trading
liabilities, other borrowed funds and commercial paper were $16.7
billion for the first three months of 2022 and $17.8 billion for the
first three months of 2021. The decrease reflects lower federal
funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements,
partially offset by higher trading liabilities.
Average interest-bearing foreign deposits, primarily from our
European-based businesses included in the Securities Services and
Market and Wealth Services segments, were $107.0 billion for the
first three months of 2022, compared with $116.6 billion for the
first three months of 2021. Average interest-bearing domestic
deposits were $116.3 billion for the first three months of 2022 and
$128.5 billion for the first three months of 2021. The decreases
primarily reflect client activity.
Average payables to customers and broker-dealers were $16.7
billion for the first three months of 2022 and $17.7 billion for the
first three months of 2021.
Payables to customers and broker-dealers are driven by customer
trading activity and market volatility.
Average long-term debt was $25.6 billion for the first three months
of 2022 and $26.2 billion for the first three months of 2021.
Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased to $90.2 billion for
the first three months of 2022 from $83.4 billion for the first three
months of 2021, primarily reflecting client activity.
A significant reduction of client activity in our Securities Services
and Market and Wealth Services business segments would reduce
our access to deposits. See “Asset/liability management” for
additional factors that could impact our deposit balances.
Sources of liquidity
The Parent’s major sources of liquidity are access to the debt and
equity markets, dividends from its subsidiaries, and cash on hand
and cash otherwise made available in business-as-usual
circumstances to the Parent through a committed credit facility
with our intermediate holding company (“IHC”).
Our ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms, or at
all, is partially dependent on our credit ratings, which are as
follows:
30 BNY Mellon

NR – Not rated.
Long-term debt totaled $25.2 billion at March 31, 2022 and $25.9
billion at Dec. 31, 2021. Redemptions of $1.3 billion and a
decrease in the fair value of hedged long-term debt were partially
offset by issuances of $1.3 billion. The Parent has $1.0 billion of
long-term debt maturing in the remainder of 2022.
In April 2022, the Parent issued $950 million of fixed rate senior
notes maturing in 2025 at an annual interest rate of 3.350%, $400
million of floating rate senior notes maturing in 2025 at an annual
interest rate of the compounded secured overnight financing rate
(“SOFR”) plus 62 basis points and $350 million of fixed rate
senior notes maturing in 2029 at an annual interest rate of 3.850%.
The Bank of New York Mellon may issue notes and certificates of
deposit (“CDs”). At March 31, 2022 and Dec. 31, 2021, $30
million of notes were outstanding. At March 31, 2022, $36 million
of CDs were outstanding. There were no CDs outstanding at Dec.
31, 2021.
The Bank of New York Mellon also issues commercial paper that
matures within 397 days from the date of issue and is not
redeemable prior to maturity or subject to voluntary prepayment.
There was no commercial paper outstanding at March 31, 2022 and
Dec. 31, 2021. The average commercial paper outstanding was $4
million for the first three
months of 2022. There was no average commercial paper
outstanding for the first three months of 2021.
Subsequent to March 31, 2022, our U.S. bank subsidiaries could
declare dividends to the Parent of approximately $1.6 billion,
without the need for a regulatory waiver. In addition, at March 31,
2022, non-bank subsidiaries of the Parent had liquid assets of
approximately $3.9 billion. Restrictions on our ability to obtain
funds from our subsidiaries are discussed in more detail in
“Supervision and Regulation – Capital Planning and Stress Testing
– Payment of Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Other Capital
Distributions” and in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, both in our 2021 Annual Report.
Pershing LLC has uncommitted lines of credit in place for liquidity
purposes which are guaranteed by the Parent. Pershing LLC has
two separate uncommitted lines of credit amounting to $350
million in aggregate. There were no borrowings under these lines
in the first quarter of 2022. Pershing Limited, an indirect UK-based
subsidiary of BNY Mellon, has two separate uncommitted lines of
credit amounting to $262 million in aggregate. Average borrowings
under these lines were $14 million, in aggregate, in the first quarter
of 2022.
The double leverage ratio is the ratio of our equity investment in
subsidiaries divided by our consolidated Parent company equity,
which includes
BNY Mellon 31
our noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. In short, the double
leverage ratio measures the extent to which equity in subsidiaries is
financed by Parent company debt. As the double leverage ratio
increases, this can reflect greater demands on a company’s cash
flows in order to service interest payments and debt maturities.
BNY Mellon’s double leverage ratio is managed in a range
considering the high level of unencumbered available liquid assets
held in its principal subsidiaries (such as central bank deposit
placements and government securities), the Company’s cash
generating fee-based business model, with fee revenue representing
80% of total revenue in the first quarter of 2022, and the dividend
capacity of our banking subsidiaries. Our double leverage ratio was
119.2% at March 31, 2022 and 119.3% at Dec. 31, 2021, and
within the range targeted by management.
Uses of funds
The Parent’s major uses of funds are repurchases of common stock,
payment of dividends, principal and interest payments on its
borrowings, acquisitions and additional investments in its
subsidiaries.
In February 2022, a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per common share
was paid to common shareholders. Our common stock dividend
payout ratio was 40% for the first quarter of 2022.
In the first quarter of 2022, we repurchased 1.9 million common
shares at an average price of $61.64 per common share, for a total
cost of $118 million.
Liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”)
U.S. regulators have established an LCR that requires certain
banking organizations, including BNY Mellon, to maintain a
minimum amount of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets
(“HQLA”) sufficient to withstand the net cash outflow under a
hypothetical standardized acute liquidity stress scenario for a 30-
day time horizon.
The following table presents BNY Mellon’s consolidated HQLA at
March 31, 2022, and the average HQLA and average LCR for the
first quarter of 2022.
Consolidated HQLA and LCR March 31, 2022
(dollars in billions)
Cash (a) $ 135
Securities (b) 113
Total consolidated HQLA (c) $ 248
Total consolidated HQLA – average (c) $ 218
Average LCR 109 %
(a) Primarily includes cash on deposit with central banks.
(b) Primarily includes securities of U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, U.S.
Treasury, sovereign securities, U.S. agency and investment-grade corporate
debt.
(c) Consolidated HQLA presented before adjustments. After haircuts and the
impact of trapped liquidity, consolidated HQLA totaled $174 billion at
March 31, 2022 and averaged $149 billion for the first quarter of 2022.
BNY Mellon and each of our affected domestic bank subsidiaries
were compliant with the U.S. LCR requirements of at least 100%
throughout the first quarter of 2022.
Statement of cash flows
The following summarizes the activity reflected on the
consolidated statement of cash flows. While this information may
be helpful to highlight certain macro trends and business strategies,
the cash flow analysis may not be as relevant when analyzing
changes in our net earnings and net assets. We believe that in
addition to the traditional cash flow analysis, the discussion related
to liquidity and dividends and asset/liability management herein
may provide more useful context in evaluating our liquidity
position and related activity.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.4 billion in the
three months ended March 31, 2022, compared with net cash used
for operating activities of $3.2 billion in the three months ended
March 31, 2021. In the three months ended March 31, 2022, cash
flows provided by operations primarily resulted from changes in
trading assets and liabilities and earnings. In the three months
ended March 31, 2021, cash flows used for operations primarily
resulted from changes in trading assets and liabilities and change in
accruals and other, net, partially offset by earnings.
Net cash used for investing activities was $33.9 billion in the three
months ended March 31, 2022, compared with net cash provided
by investing activities of $4.7 billion in the three months ended
March 31, 2021. In the three months ended March 31, 2022, net
cash used for investing activities
32 BNY Mellon
primarily reflects changes in interest-bearing deposits with the
Federal Reserve and other central banks and changes in interestbearing deposits with banks, partially offset by changes in federal
funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements. In the
three months ended March 31, 2021, net cash provided by
investing activities primarily reflects changes in interest-bearing
deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks, partially
offset by changes in interest-bearing deposits with banks and net
change in loans.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $30.1 billion in the
three months ended March 31, 2022,
compared with net cash used for financing activities of $1.5 billion
in the three months ended March 31, 2021. In the three months
ended March 31, 2022, net cash provided by financing activities
primarily reflects changes in deposits, changes in payables to
customers and broker-dealers and changes in federal funds
purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements. In the
three months ended March 31, 2021, net cash used for financing
activities primarily reflects changes in deposits, repayments of
long-term debt and changes in payables to customers and brokerdealers, partially offset by changes in federal funds purchased and
securities sold under repurchase agreements.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total shareholders’
equity decreased to $41.8 billion at March 31, 2022 from $43.0
billion at Dec. 31, 2021. The decrease primarily reflects unrealized
losses on securities available-for-sale and dividend payments,
partially offset by earnings.
The unrealized loss (after-tax) on our available-for-sale securities
portfolio, net of hedges, included in accumulated other
comprehensive income was $1.1 billion at March 31, 2022,
compared with an unrealized gain (after-tax), net of hedges, of
$362 million at Dec. 31, 2021. The increase in the unrealized loss,
net of tax, was primarily driven by higher market interest rates.
In the first quarter of 2022, we repurchased 1.9 million common
shares at an average price of $61.64 per common share for a total
of $118 million.
In June 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of
up to $6.0 billion of common shares over the six quarters
beginning in the third quarter of 2021 and continuing through the
fourth quarter of 2022. This new share repurchase plan replaced all
previously authorized share repurchase plans.
Capital adequacy
Regulators establish certain levels of capital for bank holding
companies (“BHCs”) and banks, including BNY Mellon and our
bank subsidiaries, in accordance with established quantitative
BNY Mellon 33
measurements. For the Parent to maintain its status as a financial
holding company (“FHC”), our U.S. bank subsidiaries and BNY
Mellon must, among other things, qualify as “well capitalized.” As
of March 31, 2022 and Dec. 31, 2021, BNY Mellon and our U.S.
bank subsidiaries were “well capitalized.” Failure to satisfy
regulatory standards, including “well capitalized” status or capital
adequacy rules more generally, could result in limitations on our
activities and adversely affect our financial condition. See the
discussion of these matters in “Supervision and Regulation –
Regulated Entities of BNY Mellon and Ancillary Regulatory
Requirements” and “Risk Factors – Capital and Liquidity Risk –
Failure to
satisfy regulatory standards, including “well capitalized” and “well
managed” status or capital adequacy and liquidity rules more
generally, could result in limitations on our activities and adversely
affect our business and financial condition,” both of which are in
our 2021 Annual Report.
The U.S. banking agencies’ capital rules are based on the
framework adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision (“BCBS”), as amended from time to time. For
additional information on these capital requirements, see
“Supervision and Regulation” in our 2021 Annual Report.

(a) Minimum requirements for March 31, 2022 include minimum thresholds plus currently applicable buffers. The U.S. global systemically important banks (“G-SIB”)
surcharge is 1.5%. The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set to 0%. The SCB requirement is 2.5%, equal to the regulatory minimum for Standardized Approach
capital ratios.
(b) For our CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, our effective capital ratios under U.S. capital rules are the lower of the ratios as calculated under the Standardized
and Advanced Approaches. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is based on Tier 1 capital and quarterly average total assets.
(c) The Federal Reserve’s regulations do not establish well capitalized thresholds for these measures for BHCs.
(d) The SLR is based on Tier 1 capital and total leverage exposure, which includes certain off-balance sheet exposures.
Our CET1 ratio was 10.1% at March 31, 2022 and 11.2% at Dec.
31, 2021 under the Standardized Approach. The decrease was
primarily driven by unrealized losses on securities available-forsale, higher RWAs and capital deployed through dividend
payments, partially offset by capital generated through earnings.
In the first quarter of 2022, we implemented the Standardized
Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (“SA-CCR”), which
replaced the current exposure method used to measure derivative
counterparty exposure. This resulted in increases to the RWA of $4
billion for the Advanced Approaches and $6 billion for the
Standardized Approach, as well as an
34 BNY Mellon
increase of $8 billion in the total leverage exposure used for the
SLR.
Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.3% at March 31, 2022, compared with
5.5% at Dec. 31, 2021. The decrease reflects the decrease in
capital, partially offset by lower average assets.
Risk-based capital ratios vary depending on the size of the balance
sheet at period-end and the levels and types of investments in
assets, and leverage ratios vary based on the average size of the
balance sheet over the quarter. The balance sheet size fluctuates
from period to period based on levels of customer and market
activity. In general, when servicing clients are more actively
trading securities, deposit balances and the balance sheet as a
whole are higher. In addition, when markets experience significant
volatility or stress, our balance sheet size may increase
considerably as client deposit levels increase.
Our capital ratios are necessarily subject to, among other things,
anticipated compliance with all necessary enhancements to model
calibration, approval by regulators of certain models used as part of
RWA calculations, other refinements, further implementation
guidance from regulators, market practices and standards and any
changes BNY Mellon may make to its businesses. As a
consequence of these factors, our capital ratios may materially
change, and may be volatile over time and from period to period.
Under the Advanced Approaches, our operational loss risk model is

Stress capital buf er
In August 2021, the Federal Reserve announced that BNY
Mellon’s SCB requirement would be 2.5%, equal to the regulatory
floor, effective as of Oct. 1, 2021. The SCB replaced the static
2.5% capital conservation buffer for Standardized Approach capital
ratios for CCAR BHCs. The SCB does not apply to bank
subsidiaries, which remain subject to the static 2.5% capital
conservation buffer. See “Supervision and Regulation” in our 2021
Annual Report for additional information.
The SCB final rule generally eliminates the requirement for prior
approval of common stock repurchases in excess of the
distributions in a firm’s capital plan, provided that such
distributions are consistent with applicable capital requirements
and buffers, including the SCB.

of at least one year and satisfies certain other conditions. Eligible
LTD consists of the unpaid principal balance of eligible unsecured
debt securities, subject to haircuts for amounts due to be paid
within two years, that satisfy certain other conditions. Debt issued
prior to Dec. 31, 2016 has been permanently grandfathered to the
36 BNY Mellon
extent these instruments otherwise would be ineligible only due to
containing impermissible acceleration rights or being governed by
foreign law.

If BNY Mellon maintains risk-based ratio or leverage TLAC
measures above the minimum required level, but with a risk-based

face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and discretionary
executive compensation based on the amount of the shortfall and
eligible retained income.
Trading activities and risk management
Our trading activities are focused on acting as a market-maker for
our customers, facilitating customer trades and risk-mitigating
hedging in compliance with the Volcker Rule. The risk from
market-making activities for customers is managed by our traders
and limited in total exposure through a system of position limits,
value-at-risk (“VaR”) methodology and other market sensitivity
measures. VaR is the potential loss in value due to adverse market
movements over a defined time horizon with a specified
confidence level. The calculation of our VaR used by management
and presented below assumes a one-day holding period, utilizes a
99% confidence level and incorporates non-linear product
characteristics. VaR facilitates comparisons across portfolios of
different risk characteristics. VaR also captures the diversification
of aggregated risk at the firm-wide level.
VaR represents a key risk management measure and it is important
to note the inherent limitations to VaR, which include:
• VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer time
horizons where moves may be extreme;
• VaR does not take account of potential variability of market
liquidity; and
• Previous moves in market risk factors may not produce accurate
predictions of all future market moves.
See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information on the VaR methodology.
The following tables indicate the calculated VaR amounts for the
trading portfolio for the designated periods using the historical
simulation VaR model.

The interest rate component of VaR represents instruments whose
values are predominantly driven by interest rate levels. These
instruments include, but are not limited to, U.S. Treasury
securities, swaps, swaptions, forward rate agreements, exchangetraded futures and options, and other interest rate derivative
products.
The foreign exchange component of VaR represents instruments
whose values predominantly vary with the level or volatility of
currency exchange rates or interest rates. These instruments
include, but are not limited to, currency balances, spot and forward
transactions, currency options and other currency derivative
products.
The equity component of VaR consists of instruments that
represent an ownership interest in the form of domestic and foreign
common stock or other equity-linked instruments. These
instruments include, but are not limited to, common stock,
exchange-traded funds, preferred stock, listed equity options (puts
and calls), OTC equity options, equity total return swaps, equity
index futures and other equity derivative products.
The credit component of VaR represents instruments whose values
are predominantly driven by credit spread levels, i.e., idiosyncratic
default risk. These instruments include, but are not limited to,
single issuer credit default swaps, securities with exposures from
corporate and municipal credit spreads.
The diversification component of VaR is the risk reduction benefit
that occurs when combining portfolios and offsetting positions, and
from the correlated behavior of risk factor movements.
During the first quarter of 2022, interest rate risk generated 38% of
average gross VaR, foreign exchange risk generated 36% of
average gross VaR, equity risk generated 2% of average gross VaR
and credit risk generated 24% of average gross VaR. During the
first quarter of 2022, our daily trading loss exceeded our calculated
VaR amount of the overall portfolio on one occasion.
The following table of total daily trading revenue or loss illustrates
the number of trading days in which our trading revenue or loss fell
within particular ranges during the past five quarters.

(a) Trading revenue (loss) includes realized and unrealized gains and losses primarily
related to spot and forward foreign exchange transactions, derivatives and securities
trades for our customers and excludes any associated commissions, underwriting fees
and net interest revenue.
Trading assets include debt and equity instruments and derivative
assets, primarily interest rate and foreign exchange contracts, not
designated as hedging instruments. Trading assets were $14.7
billion at March 31, 2022 and $16.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2021.
Trading liabilities include debt and equity instruments and
derivative liabilities, primarily interest rate and foreign exchange
contracts, not designated as hedging instruments. Trading liabilities
were $5.6 billion at March 31, 2022 and $5.5 billion at Dec. 31,
2021.
Under our fair value methodology for derivative contracts, an
initial “risk-neutral” valuation is performed on each position
assuming time-discounting based on a AA credit curve. In addition,
we consider credit risk in arriving at the fair value of our
derivatives.
We reflect external credit ratings as well as observable credit
default swap spreads for both ourselves and our counterparties
when measuring the fair value of our derivative positions.
Accordingly, the valuation of our derivative positions is sensitive
to the current changes in our own credit spreads, as well as those of
our counterparties.
At March 31, 2022, our OTC derivative assets, including those in
hedging relationships, of $2.4 billion included a credit valuation
adjustment (“CVA”) deduction of $25 million. Our OTC derivative
liabilities, including those in hedging relationships, of $3.3 billion
included a debit valuation adjustment (“DVA”) of $2 million
related to our own credit spread. Net of hedges, the CVA increased
by less than $1 million and the DVA was unchanged in the first
quarter of 2022, which decreased investment and other revenue -
other trading revenue by less than $1 million. The net
38 BNY Mellon
impact decreased investment and other revenue - other trading
revenue by $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 and first quarter
of 2021.
The table below summarizes the distribution of credit ratings for
our foreign exchange and interest rate derivative counterparties
over the past five quarters, which indicates the level of
counterparty credit associated with these trading activities.
Significant changes in counterparty credit ratings could alter the
level of credit risk faced by BNY Mellon. Exposure to foreign
exchange and interest rate derivative counterparties with an A+ to
A- rating, and in the aggregate, increased at March 31, 2022
compared with March 31, 2021 and Dec. 31, 2021.

Asset/liability management
Our diversified business activities include processing securities,
accepting deposits, investing in securities, lending, raising money
as needed to fund assets and other transactions. The market risks
from these activities include interest rate risk and foreign exchange
risk. Our primary market risk is exposure to movements in U.S.
dollar interest rates and certain foreign currency interest rates. We
actively manage interest rate sensitivity and use earnings
simulation and discounted cash flow models to identify interest
rate exposures.
An earnings simulation model is the primary tool used to assess
changes in pre-tax net interest revenue between a baseline scenario
and hypothetical interest rate scenarios. Interest rate sensitivity is
quantified by calculating the change in pre-tax net interest revenue
between the scenarios over a 12-month measurement period.
The baseline scenario incorporates the market’s forward rate
expectations and management’s assumptions regarding client
deposit rates, credit spreads, changes in the prepayment behavior
of loans and securities and the impact of derivative financial
instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes as of
March 31, 2022. These assumptions have been developed through
a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing
behavior and are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ
materially from projected results due to timing, magnitude and
frequency of interest rate changes, and changes in market
conditions and management’s strategies, among other factors.
Client deposit levels and mix are key assumptions impacting net
interest revenue in the baseline as well as the hypothetical interest
rate scenarios. The earnings simulation model assumes static
deposit levels and mix and it also assumes that no management
actions will be taken to mitigate the effects of interest rate changes.
Typically, the baseline scenario uses the average deposit balances
of the quarter.
In the table below, we use the earnings simulation model to assess
the impact of various hypothetical interest rate scenarios compared
to the baseline scenario. Beginning in the third quarter of 2021, we
have refined our scenario analysis by replacing gradual rate ramp
scenarios with scenarios that reflect the impact of instantaneous
interest rate shock movements. In each of the scenarios, all
currencies’ interest rates are instantaneously shifted higher or
lower. The scenarios assume instantaneous rate changes at the start
of the forecast. Long-term interest rates are defined as all tenors
equal to or greater than three years and short-term interest rates are
defined as all tenors equal to or less than three months. Interim
term points are interpolated where applicable. The refined
scenarios are intended to provide information on a basis that is
consistent with industry practice.
The following table shows net interest revenue sensitivity for BNY
Mellon. The sensitivity for March 31, 2021 has been updated to
reflect the impact of instantaneous interest rate shock movements.

Long-term down 50 bps, short-term
unchanged (20) (98) (103)
Down 100 bps rate shock vs.
baseline (315) 392 652
The decreases in the rate sensitivities compared with Dec. 31, 2021
are driven by the forecasted difference in asset yield changes
versus deposit rate changes given the anticipated interest rate
increases and higher net interest revenue in the baseline scenario.
While the net interest revenue sensitivity scenario calculations
assume static deposit balances to facilitate consistent period-overperiod comparisons, it is likely that a portion of the recent
monetary policy-driven deposit inflows would run off in a rising
short-term rate environment. Noninterest-bearing deposits are
particularly sensitive to changes in short-term rates.
To illustrate the net interest revenue sensitivity to deposit run-off,
we note that a $5 billion instantaneous reduction of U.S. dollar
denominated noninterest-bearing deposits would reduce the net
interest revenue sensitivity results in the up 100 basis point
scenario in the table above by approximately $140 million. The
impact would be smaller if the run-off was assumed to be a mixture
of interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits.
Additionally, given the continued low short-term interest rates,
money market mutual fund fees and other similar fees are being
waived to protect investors from negative returns. See “Fee and
other revenue” beginning on page 6 for additional details on the
impact of money market fee waivers on fee revenues.
For a discussion of factors impacting the growth or contraction of
deposits, see “Risk Factors – Our business, financial condition and
results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not
effectively manage our liquidity” in our 2021 Annual Report.

Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP and
Non-GAAP financial measures
BNY Mellon has included in this Form 10-Q certain Non-GAAP
financial measures on a tangible basis as a supplement to GAAP
information, which exclude goodwill and intangible assets, net of
deferred tax liabilities. We believe that the return on tangible
common equity – Non-GAAP is additional useful information for
investors because it presents a measure of those assets that can
generate income, and the tangible book value per common share –
Non-GAAP is additional useful information because it presents the
level of tangible assets in relation to shares of common stock
outstanding.
The presentation of the growth rates of investment management
and performance fees on a constant currency basis permits
investors to assess the significance of changes in foreign currency
exchange
rates. Growth rates on a constant currency basis were determined
by applying the current period foreign currency exchange rates to
the prior period revenue. We believe that this presentation, as a
supplement to GAAP information, gives investors a clearer picture
of the related revenue results without the variability caused by
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
BNY Mellon has also included the adjusted pre-tax operating
margin – Non-GAAP, which is the pre-tax operating margin for the
Investment and Wealth Management business segment, net of
distribution and servicing expense that was passed to third parties
who distribute or service our managed funds. We believe that this
measure is useful when evaluating the performance of the
Investment and Wealth Management business segment relative to
industry competitors.

Recent accounting and regulatory developments
Recent accounting developments
The following accounting guidance issued by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) staff has not yet been adopted as
of March 31, 2022.
Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2022-01, Derivatives and
Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging – Portfolio Layer
Method
In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-01, Derivatives and
Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging – Portfolio Layer
Method, which provides guidance that expands the ability to hedge
interest rate risk by permitting the use of multiple hedged layers of
a single closed portfolio of assets and will (1) Allow multiple layer
hedging within the same closed portfolio, (2) Expand the scope of
the portfolio layer method to include non-prepayable assets, (3)
Expand the eligible hedging instruments to be utilized in a singlelayer hedge, and (4) Permit held-to-maturity debt securities to be
transferred to available-for-sale at the date of adoption, provided
such transferred securities are designated in a portfolio layer
method hedge within 30 days of the adoption date.
The standard also provides further guidance and disclosure
requirements with respect to hedge basis adjustments related to
portfolio layer method hedges.
BNY Mellon is currently evaluating this guidance. This ASU is
effective Jan. 1, 2023 with early adoption permitted.
ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326):
Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures
In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial
Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt
Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures, which provides postimplementation guidance related to the adoption of ASU 2016-13,
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit
Losses on Financial Instruments, which was effective Jan. 1, 2020.
This ASU amends the guidance related to two issues: Troubled
Debt Restructurings (“TDRs”) and disclosure requirements for the
credit profile of the loan portfolio.
This ASU eliminates the accounting guidance for TDRs by
creditors, while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan
refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is
experiencing financial difficulty. An entity must apply the loan
refinancing and restructuring guidance to determine whether a
modification results in a new loan or a continuation of an existing
loan.
This ASU also requires that an entity disclose current-period gross
write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net
investments in leases within the scope of Subtopic 326-20,
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses – Measured at Amortized

We are currently evaluating this guidance. The ASU is effective
Jan. 1, 2023 with early adoption permitted.
Staf Accounting Bulletin No. 121
In March 2022, the SEC staff released Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 121 (“SAB 121”). SAB 121 expresses the staff’s views
regarding the accounting for entities that have obligations to
safeguard “crypto-assets” held for their platform users. SAB 121
provides that these entities should present a liability and
corresponding asset in respect of the crypto-assets safeguarded for
their platform users, with the liability and asset measured at the fair
value of the crypto-assets. This differs from the accounting
treatment of non-crypto-assets held in custody, which are not
recorded on a custodian’s balance sheet. This guidance is effective
for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2022 with
retrospective application as of the beginning of the fiscal year to
which the interim or annual period relates. Currently, BNY Mellon
does not hold in custody any assets that would be impacted by the
standards of SAB 121. We will evaluate the applicability and
impact of SAB 121 to our digital asset custody initiatives.

Recent regulatory developments
For a summary of additional regulatory matters relevant to our
operations, see “Supervision and Regulation” in our 2021 Annual
Report. The following discussions summarize certain regulatory
legislative and other developments that may affect BNY Mellon.
Proposed Climate-Related Disclosure Rules
On March 21, 2022, the SEC proposed climate related-disclosure
requirements that would, among other things, require disclosure of
direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, with certain
emissions disclosures subject to third-party attestation
requirements; climate-related scenario analysis (if the issuer
conducts scenario analysis), together with qualitative and
quantitative information about the hypothetical future climate
scenarios used in its analysis; climate transition plans or climaterelated targets or goals, along with disclosure of progress against
any such plans, targets or goals; climate-related risks over the
short-, medium- and long-term; qualitative and quantitative
information regarding climate-related risks and historical impacts
in audited financial statements; corporate governance of climaterelated risks; and climate-related risk-management processes. We
are assessing the potential impacts of this proposal.
Proposed Cybersecurity Disclosure Rules
On March 9, 2022, the SEC published proposed disclosure rules
and amendments regarding cybersecurity risk management,
governance and incident reporting by public companies. Under the
proposal, public companies, including The Bank of New York
Mellon Corporation, would be required to file an 8-K within 4
business days of determining that it had suffered a material
cybersecurity incident. The proposal also includes disclosure
requirements regarding policies and procedures for the
identification and management of cybersecurity risks, oversight by
the Board and management over cybersecurity risks, and Board
member expertise in cybersecurity matters. We are currently
evaluating the potential impact of the proposal.
Proposed Rule to Shorten the Settlement Cycle for Certain
Transactions
On Feb. 9, 2022, the SEC proposed rule amendments to shorten the
standard settlement cycle for certain broker-dealer securities
transactions to T+1. The proposal includes additional amendments
designed to accelerate the confirmation of such trades. We are
conducting an initial evaluation of the proposal’s potential impacts.
Other matters
Replacement of Interbank Of ered Rates (“IBORs”), including
LIBOR
The UK Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) and the
administrator for LIBOR have announced that the publication of
the most commonly used U.S. dollar LIBOR settings will cease to
be published or cease to be representative after June 30, 2023. The
publication of all other LIBOR settings ceased to be published or
to be representative as of Dec. 31, 2021. In addition, the U.S. bank
regulators had also issued guidance strongly encouraging banking
organizations to cease using U.S. dollar LIBOR as a reference rate
in new contracts by Dec. 31, 2021. As a result, financial market
participants have begun to transition away from LIBOR and other
IBORs to alternative reference rates. The transition event on Dec.
31, 2021 had minimal impact across BNY Mellon’s businesses,
however the remaining USD LIBOR transition will impact assets
and liabilities on our balance sheet that reference IBORs,
investments that we manage linked to IBORs in our Investment
Management business and the operational servicing of products
that reference IBORs in our Market and Wealth Services and
Securities Services business segments.
In March 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the
“LIBOR Act”) was enacted. The LIBOR Act provides a statutory
framework to replace USD LIBOR with a benchmark rate based on
the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) for contracts
governed by U.S. law that have no fallbacks or fallbacks that
would require the use of a poll or LIBOR-based rate. Under the
LIBOR Act, the Federal Reserve must adopt rules to identify the
SOFR-based replacement rate and conforming changes for legacy
LIBOR-linked contracts by Sept. 11, 2022.
44 BNY Mellon
We are working to facilitate an orderly transition from IBORs to
alternative reference rates for us and our clients. Accordingly, we
have created a global transition program with senior management
oversight that focuses on, among other things, evaluating and
monitoring the impacts of the discontinuance of reference IBORs
and the transition to replacement benchmarks on our business
operations and financial condition; identifying and evaluating the
scope of impacted financial instruments and contracts and the
attendant risks; and implementing technology systems, models and
analytics to support the transition. In addition, we continue to
actively engage with our regulators and clients and participate in
central bank and sector working groups.
Despite the proximity of the June 30, 2023 cessation date, there
remain, however, a number of unknown factors regarding the
transition from the IBORs and/or interest rate benchmark reforms
that could impact our business. For a further discussion of the
various risks, see “Risk Factors – Market Risk – Transitions away
from and the replacement of LIBOR and other IBORs could
adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of
operations” in our 2021 Annual Report.
