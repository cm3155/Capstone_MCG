Key second quarter 2023 and subsequent events

Increase in cash dividend on common stock

In July, our Board of Directors approved a 14% increase in
the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock, from
$0.37 to $0.42 per share.

Highlights of second quarter 2023 results

Net income applicable to common shareholders was $1.0
billion, or $1.30 per diluted common share, in the second
quarter of 2023, compared with $835 million, or $1.03 per
diluted common share, in the second quarter of 2022.

The highlights below are based on the second quarter of
2023 compared with the second quarter of 2022, unless
otherwise noted.

• Total revenue of $4.5 billion increased 5%, primarily

reflecting:

• Fee revenue decreased 2%, primarily reflecting

lower foreign exchange revenue, the impact of the
Alcentra divestiture and the mix of cumulative AUM
net inflows, partially offset by the abatement of
money market fee waivers.

(See “Fee and other revenue” beginning on page 6.)

Capital and liquidity

• Net interest revenue increased 33%, primarily

reflecting higher interest rates, partially offset by
changes in balance sheet size and mix. (See “Net
interest revenue” on page 9.)

• Provision for credit losses was $5 million, primarily
reflecting changes in the macroeconomic forecast
driving increased reserves related to commercial real
estate, which were partially offset by a reduction in
reserves related to financial institutions. (See
“Consolidated balance sheet review – Allowance for
credit losses” beginning on page 29.)

• Noninterest expense was flat, or increased 1%,

excluding notable items (Non-GAAP), related to
litigation reserves and severance. The increase reflects
higher investments and revenue-related expenses, as
well as the impact of inflation, partially offset by the
favorable impact of efficiency savings and the impact of
the Alcentra divestiture. (See “Noninterest expense” on
page 12.)

• Effective tax rate of 20.2%. (See “Income taxes” on

page 12.)

• Return on common equity (“ROE”) was 11.6% for the

second quarter of 2023.

• Return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) was
22.6% (Non-GAAP) for the second quarter of 2023.

See “Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP
and Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on page 43
for a reconciliation of the Non-GAAP measure.

Metrics

• AUC/A of $46.9 trillion increased 9%, primarily

reflecting higher market values, client inflows and net
new business.

• AUM of $1.9 trillion decreased 2%, primarily reflecting

lower market values driven by the year-over-year
decrease in UK fixed income markets and the
divestiture of Alcentra, partially offset by net inflows
and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar.

Fee and other revenue

• Our CET1 ratio calculated under the Advanced

Approaches was 11.1% at June 30, 2023 and 11.0% at
March 31, 2023. The increase primarily reflects capital
generated through earnings, partially offset by common
stock repurchase activity, capital deployed through
dividends and higher risk-weighted assets (“RWAs”).
(See “Capital” beginning on page 35.)

• Tier 1 leverage was 5.7% at June 30, 2023 and 5.8% at
March 31, 2023, as an increase in capital was more than
offset by an increase in average assets. (See “Capital”
beginning on page 35.)

• Returned $745 million to common shareholders,

including $448 million of common share repurchases.

Highlights of our principal business segments

Securities Services

• Total revenue increased 12%.
•

Income before income taxes increased 91% or increased
52% excluding notable items (Non-GAAP), primarily
litigation reserves.

• Pre-tax operating margin of 29%.

Market and Wealth Services

• Total revenue increased 10%.

Income before income taxes increased 8%.

•
• Pre-tax operating margin of 46%.

and Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on page 43
for a reconciliation of the Non-GAAP measure. See

(a)    Excludes seed capital gains (losses) related to consolidated investment management funds.

March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022.

(c)    Excludes assets managed outside of the Investment and Wealth Management business segment.
N/M – Not meaningful.

Fee revenue decreased 2% compared with the second
quarter of 2022 and increased 3% compared with the first
quarter of 2023. The decrease compared with the second
quarter of 2022 primarily reflects lower investment
management and performance fees and foreign exchange
revenue, partially offset by higher investment services fees.
The increase compared with the first quarter of 2023
primarily reflects higher investment services fees, partially
offset by lower foreign exchange revenue and investment
management and performance fees.

Investment and other revenue increased $6 million
compared with the second quarter of 2022 and $18 million
compared with the first quarter of 2023. The increase
compared with the second quarter of 2022 primarily
reflects higher fixed income trading and improved seed
capital results, partially offset by strategic equity
investment gains recorded in the second quarter of 2022.
The increase compared with the first quarter of 2023
primarily reflects a strategic equity investment loss
recorded in the first quarter of 2023 and higher other
trading revenue, partially offset by higher losses on
renewable energy investments.

Investment services fees

Investment services fees increased 2% compared with the
second quarter of 2022 and 6% compared with the first
quarter of 2023. The increase compared with the second
quarter of 2022 primarily reflects the

6 BNY Mellon

abatement of money market fee waivers, higher U.S.
government clearance volumes and U.S. collateral
management balances and higher Depositary Receipts
revenue. The increase compared with the first quarter of
2023 primarily reflects higher Depositary Receipts revenue
and client activity.

AUC/A totaled $46.9 trillion at June 30, 2023, an increase
of 9% compared with June 30, 2022, primarily reflecting
higher market values, client inflows and net new business.
AUC/A consisted of 34% equity securities and 66% fixed
income securities at June 30, 2023, and 33% equity
securities and 67% fixed income securities at June 30,
2022.

See “Securities Services business segment” and “Market
and Wealth Services business segment” in “Review of
business segments” for additional details.

Investment management and performance fees

Investment management and performance fees decreased
9% compared with the second quarter of 2022 and 2%
compared with the first quarter of 2023. The decrease
compared with the second quarter of 2022 primarily
reflects the impact of the Alcentra divestiture and the mix
of cumulative net inflows, partially offset by the abatement
of money market fee waivers. The decrease compared with
the first quarter of 2023 primarily reflects the timing of
performance fees. Performance fees were $10

million in the second quarter of 2023, $5 million in the
second quarter of 2022 and $22 million in the first quarter
of 2023. On a constant currency basis (Non-GAAP),
investment management and performance fees decreased
8% compared with the second quarter of 2022. See
“Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP and
Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on page 43 for
the reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures.

AUM was $1.9 trillion at June 30, 2023, a decrease of 2%
compared with June 30, 2022, primarily reflecting lower
market values driven by the year-over-year decrease in UK
fixed income markets and the divestiture of Alcentra,
partially offset by net inflows and the favorable impact of a
weaker U.S. dollar.

See “Investment and Wealth Management business
segment” in “Review of business segments” for additional
details regarding the drivers of investment management
and performance fees, AUM and AUM flows.

Foreign exchange revenue

Foreign exchange revenue is primarily driven by the
volume of client transactions and the spread realized on
these transactions, both of which are impacted by market
volatility, the impact of foreign currency hedging activities
and foreign currency remeasurement gain (loss). Foreign
exchange revenue decreased 29% compared with the
second quarter of 2022 and 10% compared with the first
quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting lower volumes and
volatility. Foreign exchange revenue is primarily reported
in the Securities Services business segment and, to a lesser
extent, in the Market and Wealth Services and Investment
and Wealth Management business segments and the Other
segment.

Financing-related fees

Financing-related fees, which are primarily reported in the
Market and Wealth Services and Securities

Services business segments, include capital market fees,
loan commitment fees and credit-related fees. Financing-
related fees increased 14% compared with the second
quarter of 2022 and decreased 4% compared with the first
quarter of 2023. The increase compared with the second
quarter of 2022 primarily reflects higher loan commitment
fees.

Investment and other revenue

Investment and other revenue includes income or loss from
consolidated investment management funds, seed capital
gains or losses, other trading revenue or loss, renewable
energy investments losses, income from corporate and
bank-owned life insurance contracts, other investment
gains or losses, gains or losses from disposals, expense
reimbursements from our CIBC Mellon joint venture, other
income or loss and net securities gains or losses. The
income or loss from consolidated investment management
funds should be considered together with the net income or
loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, which reflects
the portion of the consolidated funds for which we do not
have an economic interest and is reflected below net
income as a separate line item on the consolidated income
statement. Other trading revenue or loss primarily includes
the impact of market-risk hedging activity related to our
seed capital investments in investment management funds,
non-foreign currency derivative and fixed income trading,
and other hedging activity. Investments in renewable
energy generate losses in investment and other revenue that
are more than offset by benefits and credits recorded to the
provision for income taxes. Other investment gains or
losses includes fair value changes of non-readily
marketable strategic equity, private equity and other
investments. Expense reimbursements from our CIBC
Mellon joint venture relate to expenses incurred by BNY
Mellon on behalf of the CIBC Mellon joint venture. Other
income includes various miscellaneous revenues.

(a)    Includes gains (losses) on investments in BNY Mellon funds which hedge deferred incentive awards.
(b)    Includes strategic equity, private equity and other investments.

The increase in total investment and other revenue
compared with the second quarter of 2022 primarily
reflects higher fixed income trading and improved seed
capital results, partially offset by strategic equity
investment gains recorded in the second quarter of 2022.
The increase compared with the first quarter of 2023
primarily reflects a strategic equity investment loss
recorded in the first quarter of 2023 and higher other
trading revenue, partially offset by higher losses on
renewable energy investments.

Year-to-date 2023 compared with year-to-date 2022

Fee revenue decreased 1% compared with the first six
months of 2022, primarily reflecting lower investment
management and performance fees and foreign exchange
revenue, partially offset by higher investment services fees.
The 10% decrease in investment management and
performance fees primarily reflects the impact of the
Alcentra divestiture, the mix of cumulative net inflows,
lower

market values and the unfavorable impact of a stronger
U.S. dollar, partially offset by the abatement of money
market fee waivers. The 4% increase in investment
services fees primarily reflects the abatement of money
market fee waivers, the accelerated amortization of
deferred costs for depositary receipts services related to
Russia recorded in the first quarter of 2022, higher U.S.
government clearance volumes and U.S. collateral
management balances and higher fees on sweep balances,
partially offset by lower market values and client activity.
The 22% decrease in foreign exchange revenue primarily
reflects lower volumes.

Investment and other revenue increased $15 million
compared with the first six months of 2022, primarily
reflecting higher other trading revenue and improved seed
capital results, partially offset by strategic equity
investment gains recorded in the first six months of 2022.

Net interest revenue increased 33% compared with the
second quarter of 2022 and decreased 2% compared with
the first quarter of 2023. The increase compared with the
second quarter of 2022 primarily reflects higher interest
rates, partially offset by changes in balance sheet size and
mix. The decrease compared with the first quarter of 2023
primarily reflects a change in deposit mix, partially offset
by higher interest rates.

Net interest margin increased 31 basis points compared
with the second quarter of 2022 and decreased 9 basis
points compared with the first quarter of 2023. The
changes compared with the second quarter of 2022 and the
first quarter of 2023 primarily reflect the factors mentioned
above.

Average interest-earning assets decreased 2% compared
with the second quarter of 2022 and increased 4%
compared with the first quarter of 2023. The decrease
compared with the second quarter of 2022 primarily
reflects lower securities and loan balances and interest-
bearing deposits with banks. The decrease was partially
offset by higher interest-bearing deposits with the Federal
Reserve and other central banks. The increase compared
with the first quarter of 2023 primarily reflects higher
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and
other central banks and federal funds sold and securities
purchased under resale agreements, partially offset by
lower securities balances and interest-bearing deposits with
banks.

Average non-U.S. dollar deposits comprised approximately
25% of our average total deposits in the second quarter of
2023. Approximately 45% of the average non-U.S. dollar
deposits in the second quarter of 2023 were euro-
denominated.

Year-to-date 2023 compared with year-to-date 2022

Net interest revenue increased 46% compared with the first
six months of 2022, primarily driven by higher interest
rates, partially offset by lower deposit volume. The
increase in the net interest margin primarily reflects the
factors mentioned above.

Average interest-earning assets decreased 5% compared
with the first six months of 2022, primarily reflecting
lower securities and loan balances and interest-bearing
deposits with banks. The decrease was partially offset by
larger interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve
and other central banks.

quarter of 2023 and $33 billion for the second quarter of 2022. On a Non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of offsetting, the yield on federal funds sold and securities

purchased under resale agreements would have been 5.10% for the second quarter of 2023, 4.62% for the first quarter of 2023 and 0.80% for the second quarter of 2022.
On a Non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of offsetting, the rate on federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements would have been 4.99%

for the second quarter of 2023, 4.49% for the first quarter of 2023 and 0.68% for the second quarter of 2022. We believe providing the rates excluding the impact of

netting is useful to investors as it is more reflective of the actual rates earned and paid.

Total noninterest expense was flat, or increased 1%
excluding notable items (Non-GAAP) related to litigation
reserves and severance, compared with the second quarter
of 2022. The increase reflects higher investments and
revenue-related expense, as well as the impact of inflation,
partially offset by the favorable impact of efficiency
savings and the impact of the Alcentra divestiture. The
investments, net of savings, are primarily included in staff,
software and equipment, and professional, legal and other
purchased services expenses. Total noninterest expense
was flat compared with the first quarter of 2023, primarily
reflecting higher investments and litigation reserves as well
as inflation, offset by lower staff expense driven by the
annual vesting of stock-based awards to retirement-eligible
employees recorded in the first quarter of 2023. See
“Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP and
Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on page 43 for
the reconciliation of this Non-GAAP measure.

Year-to-date 2023 compared with year-to-date 2022

Noninterest expense increased 2% compared with the first
six months of 2022, primarily reflecting higher revenue-
related expense and higher investments, as well as the
impact of inflation, partially offset by the favorable impact
of efficiency savings, the impact of the Alcentra divestiture
and the favorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.

Income taxes

BNY Mellon recorded an income tax provision of $270
million (20.2% effective tax rate) in the second quarter of
2023, $231 million (21.1% effective tax rate) in the second
quarter of 2022 and $260 million (21.0% effective tax rate)
in the first quarter of 2023. For additional information, see
Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Review of business segments

We have an internal information system that produces
performance data along product and service lines for our
three principal business segments: Securities Services,
Market and Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth
Management, and the Other segment.

Business segment accounting principles

Our business segment data has been determined on an
internal management basis of accounting, rather than the
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) used
for consolidated financial reporting. These measurement
principles are designed so that reported results of the
businesses will track their economic performance.

For information on the accounting principles of our
business segments, see Note 19 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. For information on the
primary products and services in each line of business, the
primary types of revenue by line of business and how our
business segments are presented and analyzed, see Note 24
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our
2022 Annual Report.

Business segment results are subject to reclassification
when organizational changes are made, or for refinements
in revenue and expense allocation methodologies.
Refinements are typically reflected on a prospective basis.
There were no reclassification or organizational changes in
the second quarter of 2023.

The results of our business segments may be influenced by
client and other activities that vary by quarter. In the first
quarter, staff expense typically increases, reflecting the
vesting of long-term stock awards for retirement-eligible
employees. In the second quarter, staff expense typically
increases, reflecting the annual employee merit increase. In
the

Securities Services business segment

third quarter, volume-related fees may decline due to
reduced client activity. In the fourth quarter, we typically
incur higher business development and marketing
expenses. In our Investment and Wealth Management
business segment, performance fees are typically higher in
the fourth and first quarters, as those quarters represent the
end of the measurement period for many of the
performance fee-eligible relationships.

The results of our business segments may also be impacted
by the translation of financial results denominated in
foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. We are primarily
impacted by activities denominated in the British pound
and the euro. On a consolidated basis and in our Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services business
segments, we typically have more foreign currency-
denominated expenses than revenues. However, our
Investment and Wealth Management business segment
typically has more foreign currency-denominated revenues
than expenses. Overall, currency fluctuations impact the
year-over-year growth rate in the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment more than the Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services business
segments. However, currency fluctuations, in isolation, are
not expected to significantly impact net income on a
consolidated basis.

Fee revenue in the Investment and Wealth Management
business segment, and, to a lesser extent, the Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services business
segments, is impacted by global market fluctuations. At
June 30, 2023, we estimated that a 5% change in global
equity markets, spread evenly throughout the year, would
impact fee revenue by less than 1% and diluted earnings
per common share by $0.04 to $0.07.

See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for the consolidating schedules, which show the
contribution of our business segments to our overall
profitability.

Business segment description

The Securities Services business segment consists of two
distinct lines of business, Asset Servicing and Issuer
Services, which provide business solutions across the
transaction life cycle to our global asset owner and asset
manager clients. We are one of the leading global
investment services providers with $33.2 trillion of AUC/A
at June 30, 2023. For

information on the drivers of the Securities Services fee
revenue, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in our 2022 Annual Report.

The Asset Servicing business provides a comprehensive
suite of solutions. We are one of the largest global custody
and front-to-back outsourcing partners. We offer services
for the safekeeping of assets in capital markets globally, as
well as fund

14 BNY Mellon

accounting services, exchange-traded funds servicing,
transfer agency, trust and depository, front-to-back
capabilities as well as data and analytics solutions for our
clients. We deliver foreign exchange, and securities lending
and financing solutions, on both an agency and principal
basis. Our agency securities lending program is one of the
largest lenders of U.S. and non-U.S. securities, servicing a
lendable asset pool of approximately $4.5 trillion in 34
separate markets. Our market-leading liquidity services
portal enables cash investments for institutional clients and
includes fund research and analytics.

The Issuer Services business includes Corporate Trust
and Depositary Receipts. Our Corporate Trust business
delivers a full range of issuer and related investor
services, including trustee, paying agency, fiduciary,
escrow and other financial services. We are a leading
provider to the debt capital markets, providing
customized and market-driven solutions to investors,
bondholders and lenders. Our Depositary Receipts
business drives global investing by providing servicing
and value-added solutions that enable, facilitate and
enhance cross-border trading, clearing, settlement and
ownership. We are one of the largest providers of
depositary receipts services in the world, partnering with
leading companies from more than 50 countries.

Issuer Services revenue of $534 million increased 13%
compared with the second quarter of 2022 and 18%
compared with the first quarter of 2023. The increase
compared with the second quarter of 2022 primarily
reflects higher net interest revenue and Depositary
Receipts revenue. The increase compared with the first
quarter of 2023 primarily reflects higher Depositary
Receipts revenue, partially offset by lower net interest
revenue.

Market and regulatory trends are driving investable
assets toward lower fee asset management products at
reduced margins for our clients. These dynamics are also
negatively impacting our investment services fees.
However, at the same time, these trends are providing
additional outsourcing opportunities as clients and other
market participants seek to comply with regulations and
reduce their operating costs.

Noninterest expense of $1.6 billion decreased 4%
compared with the second quarter of 2022 and increased
2% compared with the first quarter of 2023. The decrease
compared with the second quarter of 2022 primarily
reflects lower litigation reserves and the favorable impact
of efficiency savings, partially offset by higher
investments and the impact of inflation.

Review of financial results

Year-to-date 2023 compared with year-to-date 2022

AUC/A of $33.2 trillion increased 7% compared with
June 30, 2022, primarily reflecting higher market values
and net new business.

Total revenue of $2.2 billion increased 12% compared
with the second quarter of 2022 and 6% compared with
the first quarter of 2023. The drivers of total revenue by
line of business are indicated below.

Asset Servicing revenue of $1.7 billion increased 11%
compared with the second quarter of 2022 and 3%
compared with the first quarter of 2023. The increase
compared with the second quarter of 2022 primarily
reflects higher net interest revenue, partially offset by
lower foreign exchange revenue. The increase compared
with the first quarter of 2023 primarily reflects higher
client activity, partially offset by lower foreign exchange
revenue.

Total revenue of $4.4 billion increased 15% compared with
the first six months of 2022. Asset Servicing revenue of
$3.4 billion increased 11%, primarily reflecting higher net
interest revenue, net new business and the abatement of
money market fee waivers, partially offset by lower foreign
exchange revenue, market values and client activity. Issuer
Services revenue of $1.0 billion increased 33%, primarily
reflecting higher net interest revenue, the accelerated
amortization of deferred costs for depositary receipts
services related to Russia recorded in the first quarter of
2022 and the abatement of money market fee waivers.

Noninterest expense of $3.1 billion decreased 1%
compared with the first six months of 2022, primarily
reflecting the favorable impact of efficiency savings and
lower litigation reserves, partially offset by higher
investments as well as the impact of inflation.

Review of financial results

AUC/A of $13.4 trillion increased 14% compared with
June 30, 2022, primarily reflecting net client inflows and
higher market values.

Total revenue of $1.4 billion increased 10% compared with
the second quarter of 2022 and decreased 1% compared
with the first quarter of 2023. The drivers of total revenue
by line of business are indicated below.

Pershing revenue of $686 million increased 8% compared
with the second quarter of 2022 and decreased 1%
compared with the first quarter of 2023. The increase
compared with the second quarter of 2022 primarily
reflects the abatement of money market fee waivers, higher
net interest revenue and higher fees on sweep balances,
partially offset by lower client activity. The decrease
compared with the first quarter of 2023 primarily reflects
lower net interest revenue. Net new assets were $(34)
billion in the second quarter of 2023, reflecting the
deconversion of a regional bank client that was acquired in
May.

Treasury Services revenue of $402 million increased 8%
compared with the second quarter of 2022 and decreased
2% compared with the first quarter of 2023. The increase
compared with the second quarter of 2022 primarily
reflects higher net interest revenue. The decrease compared
with the first quarter of 2023 primarily reflects lower net
interest revenue.

Clearance and Collateral Management revenue of $357
million increased 17% compared with the second quarter
of 2022 and decreased 1% compared with the first quarter
of 2023. The increase compared with the second quarter of
2022 primarily reflects higher net interest revenue, U.S.
government clearance volumes and U.S. collateral
management balances. The decrease compared with the
first quarter of 2023 primarily reflects lower net interest
revenue.

Noninterest expense of $781 million increased 11%
compared with the second quarter of 2022. The increase
compared with the second quarter of 2022 primarily
reflects higher investments and revenue-related expense, as
well as the impact of inflation, partially offset by the
favorable impact of efficiency savings.

Year-to-date 2023 compared with year-to-date 2022

Total revenue of $2.9 billion increased 16% compared with
the first six months of 2022. Pershing revenue of $1.4
billion increased 14%, primarily reflecting the abatement
of money market fee waivers, higher net interest revenue
and higher fees on sweep balances, partially offset by
lower client activity. Treasury Services revenue of $0.8
billion increased 14%, primarily reflecting higher net
interest revenue. Clearance and Collateral Management
revenue of $719 million increased 20%, primarily

Business segment description

Our Investment and Wealth Management business segment
consists of two distinct lines of business, Investment
Management and Wealth Management. Our investment
firms deliver a highly diversified portfolio of investment
strategies independently, and through our global
distribution network, to institutional and retail clients
globally. BNY Mellon Wealth Management provides

2022 Annual Report for additional information on our
Investment and Wealth Management business segment.

Review of financial results

AUM decreased 2% compared with June 30, 2022,
primarily reflecting lower market values driven by the
year-over-year decrease in UK fixed income markets

and the divestiture of Alcentra, partially offset by net
inflows and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar.

Net long-term strategy outflows were $9 billion in the
second quarter of 2023, driven by fixed income, equity and
liability-driven investments. Short-term strategy outflows
were $9 billion in the second quarter of 2023. Market and
regulatory trends have resulted in increased demand for
lower fee asset management products and for performance-
based fees.

Total revenue of $813 million decreased 10% compared
with the second quarter of 2022 and 2% compared with the
first quarter of 2023. The drivers of total revenue by line of
business are indicated below.

Investment Management revenue of $546 million
decreased 9% compared with the second quarter of 2022
and 2% compared with the first quarter of 2023.

expenses. The decrease compared with the first quarter of
2023 primarily reflects lower staff expense driven by the
annual vesting of stock-based awards to retirement-eligible
employees recorded in the first quarter of 2023.

Year-to-date 2023 compared with year-to-date 2022

Total revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 12% compared
with the first six months of 2022. Investment Management
revenue of $1.1 billion decreased 13%, primarily reflecting
the impact of the Alcentra divestiture, the mix of
cumulative net inflows, lower market values and the
unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, partially
offset by the abatement of money market fee waivers and
improved seed capital results. Wealth Management revenue
of $537 million decreased 11%, primarily reflecting lower
net interest revenue and market values, and changes in
product mix.

Noninterest expense of $1.4 billion decreased 2%
compared with the first six months of 2022, primarily
reflecting the impact of the Alcentra divestiture and the
favorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset
by higher revenue-related expense.

improved seed capital results and the abatement of money
market fee waivers. The decrease compared with the first
quarter of 2023 primarily reflects the timing of
performance fees.

Wealth Management revenue of $267 million decreased
10% compared with the second quarter of 2022 and 1%
compared with the first quarter of 2023. The decrease
compared with the second quarter of 2022 primarily
reflects lower net interest revenue and changes in product
mix.

Revenue generated in the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment included 30% from non-
U.S. sources in the second quarter of 2023, compared with
35% in the second quarter of 2022 and 31% in the first
quarter of 2023.

Noninterest expense of $677 million decreased 2%
compared with the second quarter of 2022 and 8%
compared with the first quarter of 2023. The decrease
compared with the second quarter of 2022 primarily
reflects the impact of the Alcentra divestiture, partially
offset by higher revenue-related

Review of financial results

Total revenue includes corporate treasury and other
investment activity, including hedging activity, which has
an offsetting impact between fee and other revenue and net
interest expense.

Total revenue decreased $85 million compared with the
second quarter of 2022 and increased $2 million compared
with the first quarter of 2023. The decrease compared with
the second quarter of 2022 primarily reflects a strategic
equity investment gain recorded in the second quarter of
2022.

The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $25 million
in the second quarter of 2023, primarily

20 BNY Mellon

reflecting a reduction in reserves related to financial
institutions.

Noninterest expense increased $8 million compared with
the second quarter of 2022 and $30 million compared with
the first quarter of 2023. The increase compared with the
first quarter of 2023 primarily reflects higher litigation
reserves and severance expense.

Year-to-date 2023 compared with year-to-date 2022

Loss before income taxes increased $91 million compared
with the first six months of 2022. Total fee and other
revenue decreased $124 million, primarily reflecting
strategic equity investment gains recorded in the first six
months of 2022.

Noninterest expense increased $16 million compared with
the first six months of 2022, primarily reflecting higher
staff expense.

Critical accounting estimates

Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our
2022 Annual Report. Our critical accounting estimates are
those related to the allowance for credit losses, goodwill
and other intangibles and litigation and regulatory
contingencies, as referenced below.

Critical accounting estimates Reference

Allowance for credit losses

“Allowance for credit losses.”

Goodwill and other
intangibles

2022 Annual Report, pages 25-27.
Also see below.

Litigation and regulatory
contingencies

“Legal proceedings” in Note 18 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Goodwill and other intangibles

BNY Mellon’s business segments include six reporting
units for which goodwill impairment testing is performed
on an annual basis. An interim test is performed when
events or circumstances occur that may indicate that it is
more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting
unit may be less than its carrying value.

In the second quarter of 2023, due to the results of the first
quarter 2023 interim and annual impairment test and
macroeconomic conditions, we performed an interim
goodwill impairment test of the Investment Management
reporting unit, which had $6.1 billion of allocated
goodwill. The fair value of the Investment Management
reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by
approximately 3%. We determined the fair value of the
Investment Management reporting unit using an income
approach based on management’s projections as of June
30, 2023. The discount rate applied to these cash flows was
10.5%.

As of June 30, 2023, if the discount rate applied to the
estimated cash flows was increased or decreased by 25
basis points, the fair value of the Investment Management
reporting unit would decrease or increase by 4%,
respectively. Similarly, if the long-term growth rate was
increased or decreased by 10 basis points, the fair value of
the Investment Management reporting unit would increase
or decrease by approximately 1%, respectively.

In the second quarter of 2023, we also performed our
annual goodwill impairment test on the remaining five
reporting units using an income approach to estimate fair
values of each reporting unit. Estimated cash flows used in
the income approach were based on management’s
projections as of April 1, 2023. The discount rate applied to
these cash flows was 10%.

As a result of the annual goodwill impairment test, no
goodwill impairment was recognized. The fair values of
the Company’s remaining five reporting units were
substantially in excess of the respective reporting units’
carrying value.

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is subject to
uncertainty as it is reliant on estimates of cash flows that
extend far into the future, and, by their nature, are difficult
to estimate over such an extended time frame. In the future,
changes in the assumptions or the discount rate could
produce a material non-cash goodwill impairment. See
“Critical accounting estimates” in our 2022 Annual Report
for additional information on the annual goodwill
impairment test.

Consolidated balance sheet review

One of our key risk management objectives is to maintain a
balance sheet that remains strong throughout market cycles
to meet the expectations of our major stakeholders,
including our shareholders, clients, creditors and
regulators.

We also seek to undertake overall liquidity risk, including
intraday liquidity risk, that stays within our risk appetite.
The objective of our balance sheet management strategy is
to maintain a balance sheet that is characterized by strong
liquidity and asset quality, ready access to external funding
sources at competitive rates and a strong capital structure
that supports our risk-taking activities and is adequate to
absorb potential losses. In managing the balance sheet,
appropriate consideration is given to balancing the
competing needs of maintaining sufficient levels of
liquidity and complying with applicable regulations and
supervisory expectations while optimizing profitability.

At June 30, 2023, total assets were $430 billion, compared
with $406 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. The increase in total
assets was primarily driven by higher interest-bearing
deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks
and federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements, partially offset by lower securities and
interest-bearing deposits with banks. Deposits totaled $292
billion at June 30, 2023, compared with $279 billion at
Dec. 31, 2022. The increase reflects higher interest-bearing
deposits in U.S. offices and interest-bearing deposits in
non-U.S. offices, partially offset by lower noninterest-
bearing (principally in U.S. offices). Total interest-bearing
deposits as a percentage of total interest-earning assets was
61% at June 30, 2023 and 58% at Dec. 31, 2022.

At June 30, 2023, available funds totaled $172 billion and
included cash and due from banks, interest-

22 BNY Mellon

bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other
central banks, interest-bearing deposits with banks and
federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale
agreements. This compares with available funds of $138
billion at Dec. 31, 2022. Total available funds as a
percentage of total assets was 40% at June 30, 2023 and
34% at Dec. 31, 2022. For additional information on our
available funds, see “Liquidity and dividends.”

Securities were $134 billion, or 31% of total assets, at June
30, 2023, compared with $143 billion, or 35% of total
assets, at Dec. 31, 2022. The decrease primarily reflects
lower U.S. Treasury securities, partially offset by higher
U.S. government agencies, unrealized pre-tax gains in the
first six months of 2023, and higher supranational
securities. For additional information on our securities
portfolio, see “Securities” and Note 4 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Loans were $64 billion, or 15% of total assets, at June 30,
2023, compared with $66 billion, or 16% of total assets, at
Dec. 31, 2022. The decrease was driven by lower
overdrafts and margin loans, partially offset by higher
loans to financial institutions and other residential
mortgages. For additional information on our loan
portfolio, see “Loans” and Note 5 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Long-term debt totaled $32 billion at June 30, 2023 and
$30 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. Issuances and an increase in
the fair value of hedged long-term debt were partially
offset by maturities. For additional information on long-
term debt, see “Liquidity and dividends.”

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total
shareholders’ equity totaled $41 billion at June 30, 2023
and Dec. 31, 2022. For additional information, see
“Capital.”

Country risk exposure

The following table presents BNY Mellon’s top 10
exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of June 30,
2023, as well as certain countries with higher risk profiles.
The exposure is presented on an internal risk management
basis and has not been reduced by the allowance for credit
losses. We monitor our exposure to these and other
countries as part of our internal country risk management
process.

The country risk exposure below reflects the Company’s
risk to an immediate default of the counterparty or obligor
based on the country of residence of the entity which
incurs the liability. If there is credit risk mitigation, the
country of residence of the entity providing the risk
mitigation is the country of risk. The country of risk for
securities is generally based on the domicile of the issuer
of the security.

(d)    The top 10 country exposures comprise approximately 70% of our total non-U.S. exposure.
(e)    Represents cash balances with exposure to Russia.

Events in recent years have resulted in increased focus on
Brazil. The country risk exposure to Brazil is primarily
short-term trade finance loans extended to large financial
institutions. We also have operations in Brazil providing
investment services and investment management services.

The war in Ukraine has increased our focus on Russia. The
country risk exposure to Russia consists of cash balances
related to our securities services businesses and may
increase in the future to the

extent cash is received for the benefit of our clients that is
subject to distribution restrictions. BNY Mellon has ceased
new banking business in Russia and suspended investment
management purchases of Russian securities. At June 30,
2023, less than 0.1% of our AUC/A and less than 0.01% of
our AUM consisted of Russian securities. We will continue
to work with multinational clients that depend on our
custody and recordkeeping services to manage their
exposures.

Securities

In the discussion of our securities portfolio, we have included certain credit ratings information because the information can
indicate the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed. Significant changes in ratings classifications could indicate increased
credit risk for us and could be accompanied by an increase in the allowance for credit losses and/or a reduction in the fair value
of our securities portfolio.

2023.

(h)    At June 30, 2023, includes net unrealized losses of $3,009 million related to available-for-sale securities, net of hedges, and $5,920 million related to held-to-maturity securities. The

after-tax unrealized losses, net of hedges, related to available-for-sale securities is $2,269 million and the after-tax equivalent related to held-to-maturity securities is $4,513 million.

The fair value of our securities portfolio, including related
hedges, was $130.7 billion at June 30, 2023, compared
with $139.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. The decrease
primarily reflects lower U.S. Treasury securities, partially
offset by higher U.S. government agencies, unrealized pre-
tax gains in the first six months of 2023 and higher
supranational securities.

At June 30, 2023, the securities portfolio had a net
unrealized loss, including the impact of related hedges, of
$8.9 billion, compared with $9.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2022.
Net unrealized loss, including the impact of hedges,
decreased as securities moved closer to maturity, partially
offset by the impact of higher interest rates

The fair value of the available-for-sale securities totaled
$83.5 billion at June 30, 2023, net of hedges, or 64% of the
securities portfolio, net of hedges. The fair value of the
held-to-maturity securities totaled $47.2 billion at June 30,
2023, or 36% of the securities portfolio, net of hedges.

The unrealized loss (after-tax) on our available-for-sale
securities portfolio, net of hedges, included in accumulated
other comprehensive income was $2.3 billion at June 30,
2023, compared with $2.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. Net
unrealized loss, including the impact of hedges, decreased
as securities moved closer to maturity, partially offset by
the impact of higher interest rates.

The financial institutions portfolio exposure was $42.8
billion at June 30, 2023, an increase of 3% compared with
Dec. 31, 2022, primarily reflecting higher exposure in the
banks, securities industry and asset managers portfolios.

Financial institution exposures are high quality, with 94%
of the exposures meeting the investment grade equivalent
criteria of our internal credit rating classification at June
30, 2023. Each customer is assigned an internal credit
rating, which is mapped to an equivalent external rating
agency grade based upon a number of dimensions, which
are continually evaluated and may change over time. For
ratings of non-U.S. counterparties, our internal credit rating
is generally capped at a rating equivalent to the sovereign
rating of the country where the counterparty resides,
regardless of the internal credit rating assigned to the
counterparty or the underlying collateral.

The exposure to financial institutions is generally short
term, with 84% of the exposures expiring within one year.
At June 30, 2023 and Dec. 31, 2022, 17% of the exposure
to financial institutions had an expiration within 90 days.

In addition, 65% of the financial institutions exposure is
secured. For example, securities industry clients

and asset managers often borrow against marketable
securities held in custody.

At June 30, 2023, the secured intraday credit provided to
dealers in connection with their tri-party repo activity
totaled $16.1 billion and was included in the securities
industry portfolio. Dealers secure the outstanding intraday
credit with high-quality liquid collateral having a market
value in excess of the amount of the outstanding credit.
Secured intraday credit facilities represent approximately
38% of the exposure in the financial institutions portfolio
and are reviewed and reapproved annually.

The asset managers portfolio exposure is high quality, with
98% of the exposures meeting our investment grade
equivalent ratings criteria as of June 30, 2023. These
exposures are generally short-term liquidity facilities, with
the majority to regulated mutual funds.

Our banks portfolio exposure primarily relates to our
global trade finance. These exposures are short term in
nature, with 96% due in less than one year. The investment
grade percentage of our banks portfolio exposure was 88%
at June 30, 2023, compared with 86% at Dec. 31, 2022.
Our non-investment grade exposures are primarily trade
finance loans in Brazil.

Wealth management loans

Our wealth management loan exposure was $10.6 billion at
June 30, 2023, compared with $10.9 billion at Dec. 31,
2022. Wealth management loans

primarily consist of loans to high-net-worth individuals, a
majority of which are secured by the customers’
investment management accounts or custody accounts.

Wealth management mortgages

Our wealth management mortgage exposure was $9.4
billion at June 30, 2023, compared with $9.2 billion at Dec.
31, 2022. Wealth management mortgages primarily consist
of loans to high-net-worth individuals, which are secured
by residential property. Wealth management mortgages are
primarily interest-only, adjustable-rate mortgages with a
weighted-average loan-to-value ratio of 61% at origination.
At June 30, 2023, less than 1% of the mortgages were past
due.

At June 30, 2023, the wealth management mortgage
portfolio consisted of the following geographic
concentrations: California – 21%; New York – 15%;
Florida – 11%; Massachusetts – 8%; and other – 45%.

Our commercial real estate exposure totaled $10.2 billion
at June 30, 2023 and $10.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. Our
income-producing commercial real estate facilities are
focused on experienced owners and are structured with
moderate leverage based on existing cash flows. Our
commercial real estate lending activities also include
construction and renovation facilities. Our client base
consists of experienced developers and long-term holders
of real estate assets. Loans are approved on the basis of
existing or projected cash flows and supported by
appraisals and knowledge of local market conditions.
Development loans are structured with moderate leverage
and, in many instances, involve some level of recourse to
the developer.

At June 30, 2023, the unsecured portfolio consisted of real
estate investment trusts (“REITs”) and real estate operating
companies, which are both primarily investment grade.

At June 30, 2023, our commercial real estate portfolio
consisted of the following concentrations: New York metro
– 35%; REITs and real estate operating companies – 29%;
and other – 36%.

Lease financings

The lease financings portfolio exposure totaled $640
million at June 30, 2023 and $657 million at Dec. 31,
2022. At June 30, 2023, 100% of leasing exposure was
investment grade, or investment grade equivalent, and
consisted of exposures backed by well-diversified assets,
primarily real estate and large-ticket transportation
equipment. The largest components of our lease residual
value exposure

28 BNY Mellon

relate to freight-related rail cars and aircraft. Assets are
both domestic and foreign-based, with primary
concentrations in Germany and the U.S.

Other residential mortgages

The other residential mortgages portfolio primarily consists
of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and totaled $1.0
billion at June 30, 2023 and $345 million at Dec. 31, 2022.
Included in this portfolio at June 30, 2023 was $760
million of fixed-rate jumbo mortgage loans, purchased
primarily in the first quarter of 2023, with a weighted-
average loan-to-value ratio of 73% at origination.

Overdrafts

Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities
clearance clients and are generally repaid within two
business days.

Capital call financing

Capital call financing includes loans to private equity funds
that are secured by the fund investors’ capital commitments
and the funds’ rights to call capital.

Other loans

Other loans primarily include loans to consumers that are
fully collateralized with equities, mutual funds and fixed-
income securities.

Margin loans

Margin loan exposure of $15.6 billion at June 30, 2023 and
$16.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2022 was collateralized with
marketable securities. Borrowers are required to maintain a
daily collateral margin in

Allowance for credit losses

excess of 100% of the value of the loan. Margin loans
included $5 billion at June 30, 2023 and $6 billion at Dec.
31, 2022 related to a term loan program that offers fully
collateralized loans to broker-dealers.

Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade clients who are active users of our non-credit services. Our primary exposure
to the credit risk of a customer consists of funded loans, unfunded contractual commitments to lend, standby letters of credit
and overdrafts associated with our custody and securities clearance businesses.

(a)    Includes allowance for credit losses on federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements, available-for-sale securities, held-to-

maturity securities, accounts receivable, cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits with banks.

The provision for credit losses was $5 million in the
second quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting changes in the
macroeconomic forecast driving increased reserves related
to commercial real estate, which were partially offset by a
reduction in reserves related to financial institutions. The
reduction in reserves related to financial institutions is
reflected in the allowance for other financial instruments in
the table above.

The allowance for loan losses and the allowance for
lending-related commitments represent management’s
estimate of lifetime expected losses in our credit portfolio.
This evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates
and judgments. To the extent actual results differ from
forecasts or management’s judgment, the allowance for
credit losses may be greater or less than future charge-offs.

(a)    The allowance allocated to margin loans, overdrafts and other loans was insignificant at June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023, Dec. 31, 2022 and June 30,

2022.

The allocation of the allowance for credit losses is
inherently judgmental, and the entire allowance for credit
losses is available to absorb credit losses regardless of the
nature of the losses.

Our allowance for credit losses is sensitive to a number of
inputs, most notably the credit ratings assigned to each
borrower, as well as macroeconomic forecast assumptions
that are incorporated into our estimate of credit losses
through the expected life of the loan portfolio. Thus, as the
macroeconomic environment and related forecasts change,
the allowance for credit losses may change materially. The
following sensitivity analyses do not represent
management’s expectations of the deterioration of our
portfolios or the economic environment, but are provided
as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the
allowance for credit losses to changes in key inputs. If
commercial real estate property values were increased 10%
and all other credits were rated one grade better, the
quantitative allowance would have decreased by
$41 million, and if commercial real estate property values
were decreased 10% and all other credits were rated one
grade worse, the quantitative allowance would have
increased by $90 million. Our multi-scenario-based
macroeconomic forecast used in determining the June 30,
2023 allowance for credit losses consisted of three
scenarios. The baseline scenario reflects slightly negative
GDP growth through the third quarter of 2023 before
moderating, slightly rising unemployment and declining
commercial real estate prices through the end of 2024. The
upside scenario reflects faster GDP growth, slightly
declining unemployment and higher commercial real estate
prices compared with the baseline. The downside

30 BNY Mellon

scenario contemplates negative GDP growth through the
first quarter of 2024 with subsequent stabilization, as well
as rapidly increasing unemployment through mid-2024 and
sharply lower commercial real estate prices than the
baseline. In the second quarter of 2023, we placed the most
weight on our downside scenario, followed by the baseline
scenario, with the remaining weighting placed on the
upside scenario. From a sensitivity perspective, at June 30,
2023, if we had applied 100% weighting to the downside
scenario, the allowance for credit losses would have been
approximately $78 million higher.

Deposits

Total deposits were $292.0 billion at June 30, 2023, an
increase of 5%, compared with $279.0 billion at Dec. 31,
2022. The increase reflects higher interest-bearing deposits
in U.S. offices and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S.
offices, partially offset by lower noninterest-bearing
(principally in U.S. offices).

Noninterest-bearing deposits were $67.6 billion at June 30,
2023, compared with $78.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2022.
Interest-bearing deposits were primarily demand deposits
and totaled $224.4 billion at June 30, 2023, compared with
$201.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2022.

Short-term borrowings

We fund ourselves primarily through deposits and, to a
lesser extent, other short-term borrowings and long-term
debt. Short-term borrowings consist of federal funds
purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, payables to customers and broker-dealers,
commercial paper and other borrowed funds. Certain short-
term borrowings, for example, securities sold under
repurchase agreements, require the delivery of securities as
collateral.

Federal funds purchased and securities sold under
repurchase agreements include repurchase agreement
activity with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation
(“FICC”), where we record interest expense on a gross
basis, but the ending and average balances reflect the
impact of offsetting under enforceable netting agreements.
This activity primarily relates to government securities
collateralized resale and repurchase agreements executed
with clients that are novated to and settle with the FICC.

Payables to customers and broker-dealers represent funds
awaiting reinvestment and short sale proceeds payable on
demand. Payables to customers and broker-dealers are
driven by customer trading activity and market volatility.

The Bank of New York Mellon may issue commercial
paper that matures within 397 days from the date of issue
and is not redeemable prior to maturity or subject to
voluntary prepayment.

Other borrowed funds primarily include borrowings from
the Federal Home Loan Bank, overdrafts of sub-custodian
account balances in our Securities Services businesses,
finance lease liabilities and borrowings

under lines of credit by our Pershing subsidiaries.
Overdrafts typically relate to timing differences for
settlements.

Liquidity and dividends

BNY Mellon defines liquidity as the ability of the Parent
and its subsidiaries to access funding or convert assets to
cash quickly and efficiently, or to roll over or issue new
debt, especially during periods of market stress, at a
reasonable cost, and in order to meet its short-term (up to
one year) obligations. Funding liquidity risk is the risk that
BNY Mellon cannot meet its cash and collateral
obligations at a reasonable cost for both expected and
unexpected cash flow and collateral needs without
adversely affecting daily operations or our financial
condition. Funding liquidity risk can arise from funding
mismatches, market constraints from the inability to
convert assets into cash, the inability to hold or raise cash,
low overnight deposits, deposit run-off or contingent
liquidity events.

Changes in economic conditions or exposure to credit,
market, operational, legal and reputational risks also can
affect BNY Mellon’s liquidity risk profile and are
considered in our liquidity risk framework. For additional
information, see “Risk Management – Liquidity Risk” in
our 2022 Annual Report.

The Parent’s policy is to have access to sufficient
unencumbered cash and cash equivalents at each quarter-
end to cover maturities and other forecasted debt
redemptions, net interest payments and net tax payments
for the following 18-month period, and to provide
sufficient collateral to satisfy transactions subject to
Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. As of June 30,
2023, the Parent was in compliance with this policy.

We monitor and control liquidity exposures and funding
needs within and across significant legal entities, branches,
currencies and business lines, taking into account, among
other factors, any applicable restrictions on the transfer of
liquidity among entities.

BNY Mellon also manages potential intraday liquidity
risks. We monitor and manage intraday liquidity against
existing and expected intraday liquid resources (such as
cash balances, remaining intraday credit capacity, intraday
contingency funding and available collateral) to enable
BNY Mellon to meet

BNY Mellon 31

its intraday obligations under normal and reasonably
severe stressed conditions.

We define available funds for internal liquidity
management purposes as cash and due from banks,

interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and
other central banks, interest-bearing deposits with banks
and federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements.

Total available funds were $172.3 billion at June 30, 2023,
compared with $138.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. The
increase was primarily due to higher interest-bearing
deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks
and federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements, partially offset by lower interest-bearing
deposits with banks.

Average non-core sources of funds, such as federal funds
purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, trading liabilities, other borrowed funds and
commercial paper, were $27.5 billion for the first six
months of 2023, compared with $16.5 billion for the first
six months of 2022. The increase primarily reflects higher
federal funds purchased and securities sold under
repurchase agreements and other borrowed funds.

Average interest-bearing foreign deposits, primarily from
our European-based businesses included in the Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services segments, were
$90.3 billion for the first six months of 2023, compared
with $104.8 billion for the first six months of 2022.
Average interest-bearing domestic deposits were $119.3
billion for the first six months of 2023, compared with
$116.4 billion for the first six months of 2022. The changes
primarily reflect client activity.

Average payables to customers and broker-dealers were
$15.9 billion for the first six months of 2023 and $16.6
billion for the first six months of 2022. Payables to
customers and broker-dealers are driven by customer
trading activity and market volatility.

Average long-term debt was $31.1 billion for the first six
months of 2023 and $25.9 billion for the first six months of
2022.

Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased to $66.0
billion for the first six months of 2023 from $91.1 billion
for the first six months of 2022, primarily reflecting client
activity.

A significant reduction of client activity in our Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services business
segments would reduce our access to deposits. See
“Asset/liability management” for additional factors that
could impact our deposit balances.

Sources of liquidity

The Parent’s major sources of liquidity are access to the
debt and equity markets, dividends from its subsidiaries,
and cash on hand and cash otherwise made available in
business-as-usual circumstances to the Parent through a
committed credit facility with our intermediate holding
company (“IHC”).

and an increase in the fair value of hedged long-term debt
were partially offset by maturities of $2.5 billion. Long-
term debt of $2.8 billion will mature in the remainder of
2023.

The Bank of New York Mellon may issue notes and
certificates of deposit (“CDs”). At June 30, 2023 and Dec.
31, 2022, $1.3 billion and $780 million, respectively, of
notes were outstanding. At June 30, 2023 and Dec. 31,
2022, $395 million and $122 million, respectively, of CDs
were outstanding.

The Bank of New York Mellon also issues commercial
paper that matures within 397 days from the date of issue
and is not redeemable prior to maturity or subject to

outstanding at June 30, 2023 and Dec. 31, 2022. The
average commercial paper outstanding was $3 million for
the first six months of 2023 and $5 million for the first six
months of 2022.

Subsequent to June 30, 2023, our U.S. bank subsidiaries

$2.0 billion, without the need for a regulatory waiver. In
addition, at June 30, 2023, non-bank subsidiaries of the
Parent had liquid assets of

approximately $4.3 billion. Restrictions on our ability to
obtain funds from our subsidiaries are discussed in more
detail in “Supervision and Regulation – Capital Planning
and Stress Testing – Payment of Dividends, Stock
Repurchases and Other Capital Distributions” and in Note
19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, both
in our 2022 Annual Report.

Pershing LLC has one uncommitted line of credit in place
for funding purposes that is guaranteed by the Parent for
$300 million. There were no borrowings under this line in
the second quarter of 2023. Pershing Limited, an indirect
UK-based subsidiary of BNY Mellon, has two separate
uncommitted lines of credit amounting to $259 million in
aggregate. Average borrowings under these lines were $47
million in the second quarter of 2023.

The double leverage ratio is the ratio of our equity
investment in subsidiaries divided by our consolidated
Parent company equity, which includes our noncumulative
perpetual preferred stock. In short, the double leverage
ratio measures the extent to which equity in subsidiaries is
financed by Parent company debt. As the double leverage
ratio increases, this can reflect greater demands on a
company’s cash flows in order to service interest payments
and debt maturities. BNY Mellon’s double

  
 
BNY Mellon 33

leverage ratio is managed in a range considering the high
level of unencumbered available liquid assets held in its
principal subsidiaries (such as central bank deposit
placements and government securities), the Company’s
cash generating fee-based business model, with fee
revenue representing 73% of total revenue in the second
quarter of 2023, and the dividend capacity of our banking
subsidiaries. Our double leverage ratio was 121.0% at June
30, 2023 and 120.5% at Dec. 31, 2022, and within the
range targeted by management.

Uses of funds

The Parent’s major uses of funds are repurchases of
common stock, payment of dividends, principal and
interest payments on its borrowings, acquisitions and
additional investments in its subsidiaries.

In May 2023, a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per common
share was paid to common shareholders. Our common
stock dividend payout ratio was 29% for the second quarter
of 2023.

In July 2023, our Board of Directors approved a 14%
increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock,
from $0.37 to $0.42 per share. The increased quarterly cash
dividend is expected to be paid on Aug. 10, 2023.

In the second quarter of 2023, we repurchased 10.6 million
common shares at an average price of $42.14 per common
share, for a total cost of $448 million.

Liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”)

U.S. regulators have established an LCR that requires
certain banking organizations, including BNY Mellon, to
maintain a minimum amount of unencumbered high-
quality liquid assets (“HQLA”) sufficient to withstand the
net cash outflow under a hypothetical standardized acute
liquidity stress scenario for a 30-day time horizon.

34 BNY Mellon

The following table presents BNY Mellon’s consolidated
HQLA, and the average HQLA and average LCR.

and the impact of trapped liquidity, consolidated HQLA totaled
$151 billion at June 30, 2023 and $140 billion at March 31, 2023,
and averaged $141 billion for the second quarter of 2023 and $135
billion for the first quarter of 2023.

BNY Mellon and each of our affected domestic bank
subsidiaries were compliant with the U.S. LCR
requirements of at least 100% throughout the second
quarter of 2023.

Net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”)

The NSFR is a liquidity requirement applicable to large
U.S. banking organizations, including BNY Mellon. The
NSFR is expressed as a ratio of the available stable funding
to the required stable funding amount over a one-year
horizon. Our average consolidated NSFR was 136% for the
second quarter of 2023 and 132% for the first quarter of
2023.

BNY Mellon and each of our affected domestic bank
subsidiaries were compliant with the NSFR requirement of
at least 100% throughout the first and second quarters of
2023.

Statement of cash flows

The following summarizes the activity reflected on the
consolidated statement of cash flows. While this
information may be helpful to highlight certain macro
trends and business strategies, the cash flow analysis may
not be as relevant when analyzing changes in our net
earnings and net assets. We believe that in addition to the
traditional cash flow analysis, the discussion related to
liquidity and dividends and asset/liability management
herein may provide more useful context in evaluating our
liquidity position and related activity.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.9 billion
in the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared with $8.4
billion in the six months ended June 30, 2022. In the six
months ended June 30, 2023, cash flows provided by
operations primarily resulted from earnings. In the six
months ended June 30, 2022, cash flows provided by
operations primarily resulted from changes in trading
assets and liabilities and earnings.

Net cash used for investing activities was $25.1 billion in
the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared with $24.6
billion in the six months ended June 30, 2022. In the six
months ended June 30, 2023, net cash used for investing
activities primarily resulted from changes in interest-
bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central
banks and changes in federal funds sold and securities
purchased under resale agreements, partially offset by net
changes in securities and changes in interest-bearing

deposits with banks. In the six months ended June 30,
2022, net cash used for investing activities primarily
resulted from changes in interest-bearing deposits with the
Federal Reserve and other central banks, partially offset by
changes in federal funds sold and securities purchased
under resale agreements.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $20.0 billion
in the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared with
$15.6 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2022. In the
six months ended June 30, 2023, net cash provided by
financing activities primarily resulted from changes in
deposits and changes in federal funds purchased and
securities sold under repurchase agreements. In the six
months ended June 30, 2022, net cash provided by
financing activities primarily resulted from changes in
deposits and net proceeds from the issuance of long-term
debt, partially offset by repayments of long-term debt.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total
shareholders’ equity increased to $40.9 billion at June 30,
2023 from $40.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. The increase
primarily reflects earnings, partially offset by common
stock repurchase activity.

The unrealized loss (after-tax) on our available-for-sale
securities portfolio, net of hedges, included in accumulated
other comprehensive income was $2.3 billion at June 30,
2023, compared with $2.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. Net
unrealized loss, including the impact of hedges, decreased
as securities moved

closer to maturity, partially offset by the impact of higher
interest rates.

In the first six months of 2023, we repurchased 35.8
million common shares at an average price of $47.62 per
common share for a total of $1.7 billion.

In January 2023, we announced a share repurchase
program approved by our Board of Directors providing for
the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of common shares
beginning Jan. 1, 2023. This new

BNY Mellon 35

share repurchase plan replaced all previously authorized
share repurchase plans.

In July 2023, our Board of Directors approved a 14%
increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock,
from $0.34 to $0.42 per share. The increased quarterly cash
dividend is expected to be paid on Aug. 10, 2023.

Capital adequacy

Regulators establish certain levels of capital for bank
holding companies (“BHCs”) and banks, including BNY
Mellon and our bank subsidiaries, in accordance with
established quantitative measurements. For the Parent to
maintain its status as a financial holding company, our U.S.
bank subsidiaries and BNY Mellon must, among other
things, qualify as “well capitalized.” As of June 30, 2023
and Dec. 31, 2022, BNY Mellon and our U.S. bank
subsidiaries were “well capitalized.” Failure to

satisfy regulatory standards, including “well capitalized”
status or capital adequacy rules more generally, could
result in limitations on our activities and adversely affect
our financial condition. See the discussion of these matters
in “Supervision and Regulation – Regulated Entities of
BNY Mellon and Ancillary Regulatory Requirements” and
“Risk Factors – Capital and Liquidity Risk – Failure to
satisfy regulatory standards, including “well capitalized”
and “well managed” status or capital adequacy and
liquidity rules more generally, could result in limitations on
our activities and adversely affect our business and
financial condition,” both of which are in our 2022 Annual
Report.

The U.S. banking agencies’ capital rules are based on the
framework adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision, as amended from time to time. For additional
information on these capital requirements, see
“Supervision and Regulation” in our 2022 Annual Report.

36 BNY Mellon

Our CET1 ratio under the Advanced Approaches was
11.1% at June 30, 2023 and 11.2% at Dec. 31, 2022. The
decrease was primarily driven by capital deployed through
common stock repurchase activity and common dividends
and higher RWAs, partially offset by capital generated
through earnings.

The Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.7% at June 30, 2023 and
5.8% at Dec. 31, 2022, as an increase in capital was more
than offset by an increase in average assets.

Risk-based capital ratios vary depending on the size of the
balance sheet at period end and the levels and types of
investments in assets, and leverage ratios vary based on the
average size of the balance sheet over the quarter. The
balance sheet size fluctuates from period to period based
on levels of customer and market activity. In general, when
servicing clients are more actively trading securities,
deposit balances and the balance sheet as a whole are
higher. In addition, when markets experience significant
volatility or stress, our balance sheet size may increase
considerably as client deposit levels increase.

Our capital ratios are necessarily subject to, among other
things, anticipated compliance with all necessary
enhancements to model calibration, approval by regulators
of certain models used as part of RWA calculations, other
refinements, further implementation guidance from
regulators, market practices and standards and any changes
BNY Mellon may make to its businesses. As a
consequence of these factors, our capital ratios may
materially change, and may be volatile over time and from
period to period.

Under the Advanced Approaches, our operational loss risk
model is informed by external losses, including fines and
penalties levied against institutions in the financial services
industry, particularly those that relate to businesses in
which we operate, and as a result, external losses have
impacted and could in the future impact the amount of
capital that we are required to hold.

RWAs.

In July 2023, the Federal Reserve announced that BNY
Mellon’s SCB requirement would be 2.5%, equal to the
regulatory floor, effective as of Oct. 1, 2023. The SCB
replaced the static 2.5% capital conservation buffer for
Standardized Approach capital ratios for CCAR BHCs.
The SCB does not apply to bank subsidiaries, which
remain subject to the static 2.5% capital conservation
buffer. See “Supervision and Regulation” in our 2022
Annual Report for additional information.

The SCB final rule generally eliminates the requirement
for prior approval of common stock repurchases in excess
of the distributions in a firm’s capital plan, provided that
such distributions are consistent with applicable capital
requirements and buffers, including the SCB.

If BNY Mellon maintains risk-based ratio or leverage
TLAC measures above the minimum required level, but
with a risk-based ratio or leverage below the minimum
level with buffers, we will face constraints on dividends,
equity repurchases and discretionary executive
compensation based on the amount of the shortfall and
eligible retained income.

Trading activities and risk management

Our trading activities are focused on acting as a market-
maker for our customers, facilitating customer trades and
risk-mitigating hedging in compliance with the Volcker
Rule. The risk from market-making activities for customers
is managed by our traders and limited in total exposure
through a system of position limits, value-at-risk (“VaR”)
methodology and other market sensitivity measures. VaR is
the potential loss in value due to adverse market
movements over a defined time horizon with a specified
confidence level. The calculation of our VaR used by
management and presented below assumes a one-day
holding period, utilizes a 99% confidence level and
incorporates non-linear product characteristics. VaR
facilitates comparisons across portfolios of different risk
characteristics. VaR also captures the diversification of
aggregated risk at the firm-wide level.

(a)    VaR exposure does not include the impact of the Company’s
consolidated investment management funds and seed capital
investments.

N/M – Because the minimum and maximum may occur on different days for
different risk components, it is not meaningful to compute a minimum
and maximum portfolio diversification effect.

The interest rate component of VaR represents instruments
whose values are predominantly driven by interest rate
levels. These instruments include, but are not limited to,
U.S. Treasury securities, swaps, swaptions, forward rate
agreements, exchange-traded futures and options, and other
interest rate derivative products.

The foreign exchange component of VaR represents
instruments whose values predominantly vary with the
level or volatility of currency exchange rates or interest
rates. These instruments include, but are not limited to,
currency balances, spot and forward transactions, currency
options and other currency derivative products.

The equity component of VaR consists of instruments that
represent an ownership interest in the form of domestic and
foreign common stock or other equity-linked instruments.
These instruments include, but are not limited to, common
stock, exchange-traded funds, preferred stock, listed equity
options (puts and calls), OTC equity options, equity total
return swaps, equity index futures and other equity
derivative products.

The credit component of VaR represents instruments whose
values are predominantly driven by credit spread levels,
i.e., idiosyncratic default risk. These instruments include,
but are not limited to, single

issuer credit default swaps, and securities with exposures
from corporate and municipal credit spreads.

The diversification component of VaR is the risk reduction
benefit that occurs when combining portfolios and
offsetting positions, and from the correlated behavior of
risk factor movements.

During the second quarter of 2023, interest rate risk
generated 41% of average gross VaR, foreign exchange
risk generated 40% of average gross VaR, equity risk
generated 1% of average gross VaR and credit risk
generated 18% of average gross VaR. During the second
quarter of 2023, our daily trading loss did not exceed our
calculated VaR amount of the overall portfolio.

The following table of total daily trading revenue or loss
illustrates the number of trading days in which our trading
revenue or loss fell within particular ranges during the past
five quarters.

(a)    Trading revenue (loss) includes realized and unrealized gains and losses

primarily related to spot and forward foreign exchange transactions,
derivatives and securities trades for our customers and excludes any

associated commissions, underwriting fees and net interest revenue.

Trading assets include debt and equity instruments and
derivative assets, primarily foreign exchange and interest
rate contracts, not designated as hedging instruments.
Trading assets were $10.6 billion at June 30, 2023 and $9.9
billion at Dec. 31, 2022.

Trading liabilities include debt and equity instruments and
derivative liabilities, primarily foreign exchange and
interest rate contracts, not designated as hedging
instruments. Trading liabilities were $6.3 billion at June
30, 2023 and $5.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2022.

Under our fair value methodology for derivative contracts,
an initial “risk-neutral” valuation is performed on each
position assuming time discounting based on a AA credit
curve. In addition,

40 BNY Mellon

we consider credit risk in arriving at the fair value of our
derivatives.

Asset/liability management

We reflect external credit ratings as well as observable
credit default swap spreads for both ourselves and our
counterparties when measuring the fair value of our
derivative positions. Accordingly, the valuation of our
derivative positions is sensitive to the current changes in
our own credit spreads, as well as those of our
counterparties.

At June 30, 2023, our OTC derivative assets, including
those in hedging relationships, of $2.0 billion included a
credit valuation adjustment (“CVA”) deduction of $16
million. Our OTC derivative liabilities, including those in
hedging relationships, of $2.9 billion included a debit
valuation adjustment (“DVA”) of $4 million related to our
own credit spread. Net of hedges, the CVA increased by
less than $1 million and the DVA decreased by less than $1
million in the second quarter of 2023, which decreased
investment and other revenue – other trading revenue by
less than $1 million. The net impact increased investment
and other revenue – other trading revenue by $1 million in
the first quarter of 2023 and $2 million in the second
quarter of 2022.

The table below summarizes our exposure, net of collateral
related to our derivative counterparties, as determined on
an internal risk management basis. Significant changes in
counterparty credit ratings could alter the level of credit
risk faced by BNY Mellon.

Our diversified business activities include processing
securities, accepting deposits, investing in securities,
lending, raising money as needed to fund assets and other
transactions. The market risks from these activities include
interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. Our primary
market risk is exposure to movements in U.S. dollar
interest rates and certain foreign currency interest rates. We
actively manage interest rate sensitivity and use earnings
simulation and discounted cash flow models to identify
interest rate exposures.

An earnings simulation model is the primary tool used to
assess changes in pre-tax net interest revenue between a
baseline scenario and hypothetical interest rate scenarios.
Interest rate sensitivity is quantified by calculating the
change in pre-tax net interest revenue between the
scenarios over a 12-month measurement period.

The baseline scenario incorporates the market’s forward
rate expectations and management’s assumptions regarding
client deposit rates, credit spreads, changes in the
prepayment behavior of loans and securities and the impact
of derivative financial instruments used for interest rate
risk management purposes as of each respective quarter-
end. These assumptions have been developed through a
combination of historical analysis and future expected
pricing behavior and are inherently uncertain. Actual
results may differ materially from projected results due to
timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes,
and changes in market conditions and management’s
strategies, among other factors. Client deposit levels and
mix are key assumptions impacting net interest revenue in
the baseline as well as the hypothetical interest rate
scenarios. The earnings simulation model assumes static
deposit levels and mix, and it also assumes that no
management actions will be taken to mitigate the effects of
interest rate changes. Typically, the baseline scenario uses
the average deposit balances of the quarter.

In the table below, we use the earnings simulation model to
assess the impact of various hypothetical interest rate
scenarios compared to the baseline scenario. In each of the
scenarios, all currencies’ interest rates are instantaneously
shifted higher or lower at the start of the forecast. Long-
term interest rates are defined as all tenors equal to or
greater than three years and short-term interest rates are
defined as

BNY Mellon 41

all tenors equal to or less than three months. Interim term
points are interpolated where applicable. The impact of
interest rate shifts may not be linear. The results of this
earnings simulation should therefore not be extrapolated
for more severe interest rate scenarios than those presented
in the table below.

While the net interest revenue sensitivity scenario
calculations assume static deposit balances to facilitate
consistent period-over-period comparisons, net interest
revenue is impacted by changes in deposit balances.
Noninterest-bearing deposits are particularly sensitive to
changes in short-term rates.

To illustrate the net interest revenue sensitivity to deposit
run-off, we estimate that a $5 billion instantaneous
reduction of U.S. dollar-denominated noninterest-bearing
deposits would reduce the net interest revenue sensitivity
results in the up 100 basis point scenario in the table above
by approximately $320 million. The impact would be
smaller if the run-off was assumed to be a mixture of
interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits.

Additionally, during periods of low short-term interest
rates, money market mutual fund fees and other similar
fees are typically waived to protect investors from negative
returns. See “Fee and other revenue” in our 2022 Annual
Report for additional details on money market fee waivers.

For a discussion of factors impacting the growth or
contraction of deposits, see “Risk Factors – Capital and
Liquidity Risk – Our business, financial condition and
results of operations could be adversely affected if we do
not effectively manage our liquidity” in our 2022 Annual
Report.

At June 30, 2023, the impact of a 100 bps upward shift in
rates on net interest revenue decreased compared with
March 31, 2023. The drivers were higher expected deposit
interest expense in rising rate scenarios, driven by changes
in the forward rate curve resulting in higher deposit rate
sensitivity.

Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP
and Non-GAAP financial measures

BNY Mellon has included in this Form 10-Q certain Non-
GAAP financial measures on a tangible basis as a
supplement to GAAP information, which exclude goodwill
and intangible assets, net of deferred tax liabilities. We
believe that the return on tangible common equity – Non-
GAAP is additional useful information for investors
because it presents a measure of those assets that can
generate income, and the tangible book value per common
share – Non-GAAP is additional useful information
because it presents the level of tangible assets in relation to
shares of common stock outstanding.

BNY Mellon has presented total noninterest expense,
excluding litigation reserves and severance. Litigation
reserves represent accruals for loss contingencies that are
both probable and reasonably estimable, but exclude
standard business-related legal fees. These measures are
provided to permit investors to view financial measures on
a basis consistent with management’s view.

The presentation of the growth rates of investment
management and performance fees on a constant currency
basis permits investors to assess the

significance of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Growth rates on a constant currency basis were determined
by applying the current period foreign currency exchange
rates to the prior period revenue. We believe that this
presentation, as a supplement to GAAP information, gives
investors a clearer picture of the related revenue results
without the variability caused by fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates.

BNY Mellon has presented the pre-tax operating margin
excluding litigation reserves, severance and a disposal loss
for the Securities Services business segment. These
measures are provided to permit investor to view the
financial measures on a basis consistent with how
management views the business.

BNY Mellon has also included the adjusted pre-tax
operating margin – Non-GAAP, which is the pre-tax
operating margin for the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment, net of distribution and
servicing expense that was passed to third parties who
distribute or service our managed funds. We believe that
this measure is useful when evaluating the performance of
the Investment and Wealth Management business segment
relative to industry competitors.

Recent accounting and regulatory developments

Recent accounting developments

The following accounting guidance issued by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) has not yet been
adopted as of June 30, 2023.

Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-02,
Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic
323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures
Using the Proportional Amortization Method

In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-02,
Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using
the Proportional Amortization Method, which permits
reporting entities to elect to account for their tax equity
investments, regardless of the tax credit program from
which the income tax credits are received, using the
proportional amortization method if certain conditions are
met. Under the proportional amortization method, an entity
amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to
the income tax credits and other income tax benefits
received, and recognizes the net amortization and income
tax credits and other income tax benefits in the income
statement as a component of the provision for income
taxes.

This ASU is effective Jan. 1, 2024 with early adoption
permitted. BNY Mellon is currently evaluating this
guidance with respect to our investments in renewable
energy projects, which historically have not been eligible
to apply the proportional amortization method. These
investments currently generate losses in investment and
other revenue that are more than offset by benefits and
credits recorded to the provision for income taxes. The
impact of adopting this new guidance for our renewable
energy investments that meet the eligibility criteria would
be an increase in investment and other revenue and an
increase in the provision for income taxes on the
consolidated income statement.

Recent regulatory and other developments

For a summary of additional regulatory matters relevant to
our operations, see “Recent regulatory developments” in
our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, and
“Supervision and Regulation” in our 2022 Annual Report.
The

46 BNY Mellon

following discussion summarizes certain regulatory,
legislative and other developments that may affect BNY
Mellon.

U.S. Regulatory Capital Requirements

On July 27, 2023, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation proposed substantial revisions to the
capital requirements applicable to large banking
organizations and to banking organizations with significant
trading activity, including BNY Mellon. The proposed
revisions would implement international capital standards
issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.

Large banking organizations would be required to calculate
risk-based capital ratios under both a new Expanded Risk-
based Approach and the current Standardized Approach.
Large banking organizations would be subject to the lower
of the Expanded Risk-based Approach and the sum of the
current Standardized Approach and new market risk rule
for each risk-based capital ratio. All applicable capital
buffer requirements, including the stress capital buffer,
would apply regardless of which approach produces the
more binding ratio.

The proposal would replace existing models-based
approaches for calculating RWA for credit risk and
operational risk with new standardized approaches. Under
the proposed Expanded Risk-based Approach, RWAs
would be calculated using: (i) a new standardized approach
for credit risk; (ii) one of two non-models-based
approaches for credit valuation adjustment risk; (iii) a new
standardized approach for operational risk that is not based
on internal models; and (iv) a revised approach to market
risk. For market risk, the proposal would implement a
standardized approach, adopt a new models-based
approach and would allow use of internal models for
certain risks subject to enhanced requirements for model
approval and performance and an “output floor” limiting
the extent to which a banking organization’s internal
models may reduce total RWA under the Expanded Risk-
based Approach.

The proposal would also indirectly impact several other
regulations, including the requirements for total loss-
absorbing capacity, long-term debt requirements, and the
surcharge for global systemically important bank holding
companies (“GSIBs”). It would remove

the option of using internal models in the calculation of
derivatives exposure amounts under single-counterparty
credit limit rules.

Comments on the proposal are due on Nov. 30, 2023.
Under the proposal, the revisions would become effective
on July 1, 2025, subject to a three-year transition period for
calculating RWAs under the Expanded Risk-based
Approach. We are assessing the potential impact of the
proposal.

Risk-Based Capital Surcharges for Global Systemically
Important Bank Holding Companies

On July 27, 2023, the Federal Reserve proposed
amendments to its rule regarding risk-based capital
surcharges for GSIBs, including BNY Mellon. For certain
systemic indicators currently measured only as of year-end,
the proposal would change to measurement of average
daily or monthly values over the full year. The proposal
would also revise various aspects of the systemic indicators
and measure GSIB surcharges in 10-basis point increments
rather than 50-basis point increments.

Comments on the proposal are due on Nov. 30, 2023. The
proposal provides the amendments would become effective
two calendar quarters after adoption of a final rule. We are
assessing the potential impact of the proposal.

Cybersecurity

On July 26, 2023, the SEC adopted rules requiring public
companies to disclose cybersecurity incidents and details
regarding their cybersecurity risk management, strategy
and governance. Under the rules, public companies must
disclose material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8-K.
Disclosure of material incidents generally is due within
four business days after a public company determines that
a cybersecurity incident is material. On an annual basis,
public companies, including the Parent, must include in
their annual report on Form 10-K a description of their
processes for assessing, identifying, and managing, and
management’s role and expertise in assessing and
managing, material cybersecurity risks; a description of the
potential or reasonably likely material effects of
cybersecurity risks; and the board of directors’ oversight of
cybersecurity risks.

The final rules will become effective 30 days following
publication in the Federal Register. The Parent will be
required to file incident disclosures beginning the later of
90 days after publication in the Federal Register or Dec.
18, 2023, and annual disclosures beginning with its annual
report for fiscal year ending Dec. 31, 2023.

LIBOR transition

For a summary of developments related to the cessation of
LIBOR, see “Other Matters – Replacement of Interbank
Offered Rates (“IBORs”), including LIBOR” in our 2022
Annual Report. Despite the passage of the June 30, 2023
cessation date, a number of unknown factors remain
regarding the transition from the IBORs that could impact
our business, as the first reset date following the LIBOR
replacement date under a number of outstanding LIBOR-
linked contracts has not yet occurred. For a further
discussion of the various risks, see “Risk Factors – Market
Risk – Transitions away from and the replacement of
LIBOR and other IBORs could adversely impact our
business, financial condition and results of operations” in
our 2022 Annual Report.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) special
assessment

On May 11, 2023, the FDIC proposed a rule to impose a
special assessment on insured depository institutions
(“IDIs”) to recover losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund
(“DIF”) associated with the closures of Silicon Valley
Bank and Signature Bank. Under the proposal, the FDIC
would collect from each IDI a special assessment at an
annual rate of approximately 12.5 basis points of the IDI’s
estimated uninsured deposits (excluding the first $5 billion
of estimated uninsured deposits), as of Dec. 31, 2022. For
an IDI that is part of a holding company containing
multiple IDIs, the $5 billion deduction would be
apportioned based on the IDI’s estimated uninsured
deposits as a percentage of total estimated uninsured
deposits held by all IDI affiliates in the consolidated
banking organization. The special assessment would be
collected during an initial special assessment period of
eight quarters, with the first quarterly assessment period
beginning on Jan. 1, 2024, subject to potential extension
and a potential one-time final special assessment for any
shortfall to the DIF. If the assessment is finalized as
proposed, we expect the expense to be recorded in a single
quarter which

BNY Mellon 47

would significantly affect noninterest expense and the
results of operations for that quarter.

Share repurchase disclosure modernization

On May 3, 2023, the SEC adopted a final rule requiring
disclosures related to issuers’ repurchases of equity
securities. The rule requires corporate issuers, including the
Parent, to disclose daily share repurchase activity on a
quarterly basis. The rule also requires quarterly disclosure
regarding the adoption, modification and termination of
Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements by issuers and requires
narrative disclosure about the issuer’s repurchase programs
and practices. The Parent will be required to comply with
the new disclosure obligations starting with the fiscal
quarter that begins on Oct. 1, 2023.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1–Basis of presentation

In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, references to
“our,” “we,” “us,” “BNY Mellon,” the “Company” and
similar terms refer to The Bank of New York Mellon
Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. The term
“Parent” refers to The Bank of New York Mellon
Corporation but not to its subsidiaries.

Basis of presentation

The accounting and financial reporting policies of BNY
Mellon, a global financial services company, conform to
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)
and prevailing industry practices. For information on our
significant accounting and reporting policies, see Note 1 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31,
2022 (the “2022 Annual Report”).

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are
unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
necessary, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, for a
fair presentation of financial position, results of operations
and cash flows for the periods presented have been made.
These financial statements should be read in conjunction
with our Consolidated Financial Statements included in our
2022 Annual Report. Certain additional immaterial
reclassifications have been made to prior periods to place
them on a basis comparable with the current period
presentation.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates based
upon assumptions about future economic and market
conditions which affect reported amounts and related
disclosures in our financial statements. Although our
current estimates contemplate current conditions and how
we expect them to change in the future, it is reasonably
possible that actual conditions could be worse than
anticipated in those estimates, which could materially
affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Note 2–New accounting guidance

The following accounting guidance was adopted in the first
quarter of 2023.

Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2022-01,
Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging
– Portfolio Layer Method

In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-01,
Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging
– Portfolio Layer Method, which provides guidance that
expands the ability to hedge interest rate risk by permitting
the use of multiple hedged layers of a single closed
portfolio of assets and will (1) Allow multiple layer
hedging within the same closed portfolio, (2) Expand the
scope of the portfolio layer method to include non-
prepayable assets, (3) Expand the eligible hedging
instruments to be utilized in a single-layer hedge, and (4)
Permit held-to-maturity debt securities to be transferred to
available-for-sale at the date of adoption, provided such
transferred securities are designated in a portfolio layer
method hedge within 30 days of the adoption date.

The standard also provides further guidance and disclosure
requirements with respect to hedge basis adjustments
related to portfolio layer method hedges.

We adopted this guidance as of Jan. 1, 2023. The Company
did not choose to make the one-time election to reclassify
securities classified as held-to-maturity to available-for-
sale as of Jan. 1, 2023 and can choose to prospectively
apply portfolio layer method hedging.

ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses
(Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage
Disclosures

In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial
Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt
Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures, which provides
post-implementation guidance related to the adoption of
ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses:
Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,
which was effective Jan. 1, 2020. This ASU amends the
guidance related to two issues: Troubled Debt
Restructurings (“TDRs”) and disclosure requirements for
the credit profile of the loan portfolio. This ASU eliminates
the accounting guidance for TDRs by creditors, while
enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan
refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a
borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. An entity
must apply the loan refinancing and restructuring guidance
to determine whether a

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

BNY Mellon 57

modification results in a new loan or a continuation of an
existing loan.

This ASU also requires that an entity disclose current-
period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing
receivables and net investments in leases within the scope
of Subtopic 326-20, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses
– Measured at Amortized Cost.

We adopted the revised guidance related to loan
modifications on Jan. 1, 2023. The impact was immaterial.
The updated disclosures are included in Note 5.

Note 3–Acquisitions and dispositions

We sometimes structure our acquisitions and divestitures
with both an initial payment or receipt and later contingent
payments or receipts tied to post-closing revenue or
income growth. Contingent payments totaled $5 million in
the first six months of 2023. There were no contingent
receipts in the first six months of 2023. At June 30, 2023,
we are potentially obligated to pay additional consideration
which, using reasonable assumptions and estimates, could
range from $25 million to $40 million over the next two
years. At June 30, 2023, we could potentially receive
additional consideration which, using reasonable
assumptions and estimates, could be up to $390 million
over the next five years.

See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in our 2022 Annual Report for information
related to the 2022 transactions.

Note 4–Securities

The following tables present the amortized cost, the gross
unrealized gains and losses and the fair value of securities
at June 30, 2023 and Dec. 31, 2022.

(a)    The amortized cost of available-for-sale is net of the allowance for

credit losses of less than $1 million. The allowance for credit loss
relates to non-agency RMBS.

(b)    Includes gross unrealized gains of $297 million and gross unrealized
losses of $162 million recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income related to securities that were transferred from available-for-
sale to held-to-maturity. The unrealized gains primarily relate to
agency RMBS, U.S. Treasury securities and agency commercial MBS.
The unrealized losses primarily relate to agency RMBS and U.S.
Treasury securities. The unrealized gains and losses will be amortized
into net interest revenue over the contractual lives of the securities.

Allowance for credit losses – Securities

The allowance for credit losses related to securities was
$1 million at June 30, 2023 and $1 million at Dec. 31,
2022, and relates to non-agency RMBS and state and
political subdivision securities.

Credit quality indicators – Securities

At June 30, 2023, the gross unrealized losses on the
securities portfolio were primarily attributable to an
increase in interest rates from the date of purchase, and for
certain securities that were transferred from available-for-
sale to held-to-maturity, an increase in interest rates
through the date they were transferred. Specifically, $162
million of the unrealized losses at June 30, 2023 and $179
million at Dec. 31, 2022 reflected in the tables below relate
to certain securities that were previously transferred from
available-for-sale to held-to-maturity. The unrealized losses
will be amortized into net interest revenue over the
contractual lives of the securities. The transfer created a
new cost basis for the securities. As a result, if these
securities have experienced unrealized losses since the date
of transfer, the corresponding unrealized losses would be
reflected in the held-to-maturity securities portfolio in the
following tables. We do not intend to sell these securities,
and it is not more likely than not that we will have to sell
these securities.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

The following tables show the credit quality of the held-to-maturity securities. We have included certain credit ratings
information because the information can indicate the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed. Significant changes in
ratings classifications could indicate increased credit risk for us and could be accompanied by an increase in the allowance for
credit losses and/or a reduction in the fair value of our securities portfolio.

Pledged assets

At June 30, 2023, BNY Mellon had pledged assets of $133
billion, including $93 billion pledged as collateral for
potential borrowings at the Federal Reserve Discount
Window and $8 billion pledged as collateral for borrowing
at the Federal Home Loan Bank. The components of the
assets pledged at June 30, 2023 included $114 billion of
securities, $13 billion of loans, $5 billion of trading assets
and $1 billion of interest-bearing deposits with banks.

If there has been no borrowing at the Federal Reserve
Discount Window, the Federal Reserve generally allows
banks to freely move assets in and out of their pledged
assets account to sell or repledge the assets

for other purposes. BNY Mellon regularly moves assets in
and out of its pledged assets account at the Federal Reserve
as there has been no borrowings.

At Dec. 31, 2022, BNY Mellon had pledged assets of $138
billion, including $106 billion pledged as collateral for
potential borrowing at the Federal Reserve Discount
Window and $8 billion pledged as collateral for borrowing
at the Federal Home Loan Bank. The components of the
assets pledged at Dec. 31, 2022 included $121 billion of
securities, $12 billion of loans, $4 billion of trading assets
and $1 billion of interest-bearing deposits with banks.

At June 30, 2023 and Dec. 31, 2022, pledged assets
included $30 billion and $24 billion, respectively, for

securities purchased under resale agreements on the
consolidated balance sheet.

We also obtain securities as collateral, including receipts
under resale agreements, securities borrowed, derivative
contracts and custody agreements, on terms which permit
us to sell or repledge the securities to others. At June 30,
2023 and Dec. 31, 2022, the market value of the securities
received that can be sold or repledged was $199 billion and
$115 billion, respectively. We routinely sell or repledge
these securities through delivery to third parties. As of June
30, 2023 and Dec. 31, 2022, the market value of securities
collateral sold or repledged was $161 billion and $78
billion, respectively.

Restricted cash and securities

Cash and securities may be segregated under federal and
other regulations or requirements. At June 30, 2023 and
Dec. 31, 2022, cash segregated under federal and other
regulations or requirements was $4 billion and $7 billion,
respectively. Restricted cash is primarily included in
interest-bearing deposits with banks on the consolidated
balance sheet. Securities segregated under federal and
other regulations or requirements were $4 billion at June
30, 2023 and $3 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. Restricted
securities were sourced from securities purchased under
resale agreements and are included in federal funds sold

Loan modifications

Modified loans are evaluated to determine whether a
modification or restructuring with a borrower experiencing
financial difficulty results in principal forgiveness, an
interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment
delay, or a term extension. The modification could result in
a new loan or a continuation of the existing loan.

In the second quarter of 2023, we modified one
commercial real estate exposure, with a recorded
investment of $59 million and an unfunded lending

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

commitment of $15 million, by extending the maturity
date. We also modified two other residential mortgage
loans, with an aggregate recorded investment of less than
$1 million, by extending the maturity dates and reducing
the interest rates.

We modified one commercial real estate loan in the first
quarter of 2023, with a recorded investment of $12 million,
by extending the maturity date.

Loans modified prior to 2023 are considered a troubled
debt restructuring (“TDR”) if the debtor is experiencing
financial difficulties and the creditor

BNY Mellon 65

grants a concession to the debtor that would not otherwise
be considered. A TDR may include a transfer of real estate
or other assets from the debtor to the creditor, or a
modification of the term of the loan. Not all modified loans
are considered TDRs. There were no loans modified in the
first six months of 2022.

Credit quality indicators

Our credit strategy is to focus on investment-grade clients
that are active users of our non-credit services. Each
customer is assigned an internal credit rating, which is
mapped to an external rating agency grade equivalent, if
possible, based upon a number of dimensions, which are
continually evaluated and may change over time.

The tables below provide information about the credit profile of the loan portfolio by the period of origination.

(a)    Excludes overdrafts of $4,839 million. Overdrafts occur on a daily basis primarily in the custody and securities clearance business and are generally repaid within two

business days.

Commercial loans

The commercial loan portfolio is divided into investment
grade and non-investment grade categories based on the
assigned internal credit ratings, which are generally
consistent with those of the public rating agencies.
Customers with ratings consistent with BBB- (S&P)/Baa3
(Moody’s) or better are considered to be investment grade.
Those clients with ratings lower than this threshold are
considered to be non-investment grade.

Commercial real estate

Our income-producing commercial real estate facilities are
focused on experienced owners and are structured with
moderate leverage based on existing cash flows. Our
commercial real estate lending activities also include
construction and renovation facilities.

Financial institutions

Financial institution exposures are high quality, with 94%
of the exposures meeting the investment grade

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

equivalent criteria of our internal credit rating
classification at June 30, 2023. In addition, 65% of the
financial institutions exposure is secured. For example,
securities industry clients and asset managers often borrow
against marketable securities held in custody. The exposure
to financial institutions is generally short term, with 84%
expiring within one year.

Wealth management loans

Wealth management loans are not typically rated by
external rating agencies. A majority of the wealth
management loans are secured by the customers’
investment management accounts or custody accounts.
Eligible assets pledged for these loans are typically
investment grade fixed-income securities, equities and/or
mutual funds. Internal ratings for this portion of the wealth
management loan portfolio, therefore, would equate to
investment grade external ratings. Wealth management
loans are provided to select customers based on the pledge
of other types of assets. For the loans collateralized by
other assets, the credit quality of the obligor is carefully
analyzed,

BNY Mellon 67

but we do not consider this portion of our wealth
management loan portfolio to be investment grade.

Wealth management mortgages

Credit quality indicators for wealth management mortgages
are not correlated to external ratings. Wealth management
mortgages are typically loans to high-net-worth
individuals, which are secured primarily by residential
property. These loans are primarily interest-only,
adjustable-rate mortgages with a weighted-average loan-to-
value ratio of 61% at origination. Delinquency rate is a key
indicator of credit quality in our wealth management
portfolio. At June 30, 2023, less than 1% of the mortgages
were past due.

At June 30, 2023, the wealth management mortgage
portfolio consisted of the following geographic
concentrations: California – 21%; New York – 15%;
Florida – 11%; Massachusetts – 8%; and other – 45%.

Lease financings

At June 30, 2023, the lease financings portfolio consisted
of exposures backed by well-diversified assets, primarily
real estate and large-ticket transportation equipment. The
largest components of our lease residual value exposure
relate to freight-related rail cars and aircraft. Assets are
both domestic and foreign-based, with primary
concentrations in Germany and the U.S.

Other residential mortgages

The other residential mortgages portfolio primarily consists
of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and totaled $1.0
billion at June 30, 2023 and $345 million at Dec. 31, 2022.
Included in this portfolio at June 30, 2023 were $760
million of fixed-rate jumbo mortgage loans, purchased
primarily in the first

quarter of 2023, with a weighted-average loan-to-value
ratio of 73% at origination. These loans are not typically
correlated to external ratings.

Capital call financing

Capital call financing includes loans to private equity funds
that are secured by the fund investors’ capital commitments
and the funds’ right to call capital.

Other loans

Other loans primarily include loans to consumers that are
fully collateralized with equities, mutual funds and fixed-
income securities.

Margin loans

We had $15.6 billion of secured margin loans at June 30,
2023, compared with $16.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2022.
Margin loans are collateralized with marketable securities,
and borrowers are required to maintain a daily collateral
margin in excess of 100% of the value of the loan. We have
rarely suffered a loss on these types of loans.

Overdrafts

Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities
clearance clients and totaled $2.7 billion at June 30, 2023
and $4.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. Overdrafts occur on a
daily basis and are generally repaid within two business

Goodwill impairment testing

The goodwill impairment test is performed at least
annually at the reporting unit level. An interim test is
performed when events or circumstances occur that may
indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of
any reporting unit may be less than its carrying value.

In the second quarter of 2023, due to the results of the first
quarter 2023 interim and annual impairment test

and macroeconomic conditions, we performed an interim
goodwill impairment test of the Investment Management
reporting unit, which had $6.1 billion of allocated
goodwill. No additional goodwill impairment was
recognized.

In the second quarter of 2023, we also performed our
annual goodwill impairment test on the remaining five
reporting units. As a result of the annual goodwill
impairment test, no goodwill impairment was recognized.

Non-readily marketable equity securities

Non-readily marketable equity securities do not have
readily determinable fair values. These investments are
valued using a measurement alternative where the
investments are carried at cost, less any impairment, and
plus or minus changes resulting from observable price
changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar
investment of the same issuer. The observable price
changes are recorded in investment and other revenue on
the consolidated income statement. Our non-readily
marketable equity securities totaled $443 million at June
30, 2023 and $445 million at Dec. 31, 2022, and are
included in other equity investments in the table above.

Qualified affordable housing project investments

We invest in affordable housing projects primarily to
satisfy the Company’s requirements under the Community
Reinvestment Act. Our total investment in qualified
affordable housing projects totaled $1.2 billion at June 30,
2023 and $1.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. Commitments to
fund future investments in qualified affordable housing
projects totaled $570 million at June 30, 2023 and $614
million at Dec. 31, 2022 and are recorded in other
liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. A summary of
the commitments to fund future investments is as follows:
remainder of 2023 – $184 million; 2024 – $145 million;
2025 – $173 million; 2026 – $24 million; 2027 – $1
million; and 2028 and thereafter – $43 million.

Tax credits and other tax benefits recognized were $45
million in the second quarter of 2023, $45 million in the
first quarter of 2023, $38 million in the second quarter of
2022, $90 million in the first six months of 2023 and $76
million in the first six months of 2022.

Amortization expense included in the provision for income
taxes was $38 million in the second quarter of 2023, $38
million in the first quarter of 2023, $33 million in the
second quarter of 2022, $76 million in the first six months
of 2023 and $65 million in the first six months of 2022.

Investments valued using net asset value (“NAV”) per
share

In our Investment and Wealth Management business
segment, we make seed capital investments in certain
funds we manage. We also hold private equity investments,
primarily small business investment companies (“SBICs”),
which are compliant with the Volcker Rule, and certain
other corporate

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

investments. Seed capital, private equity and other
corporate investments are included in other assets on the
consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of

certain of these investments was estimated using the NAV
per share for our ownership interest in the funds.

Note 8–Contract revenue

Fee and other revenue in the Securities Services, Market
and Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth
Management business segments is primarily variable,
based on levels of assets under custody and/or
administration, assets under management and the level of
client-driven transactions, as specified in the fee schedules.
See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in our 2022 Annual Report for information on
the nature of our services and revenue recognition. See
Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
in our 2022 Annual Report for additional information on
our principal business segments — Securities Services,

Market and Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth
Management — and the primary services provided.

Disaggregation of contract revenue

Contract revenue is included in fee and other revenue on
the consolidated income statement. The following tables
present fee and other revenue related to contracts with
customers, disaggregated by type of fee revenue, for each
business segment. Business segment data has been
determined on an internal management basis of accounting,
rather than GAAP, which is used for consolidated financial
reporting.

management funds of $1 million in the first six months of 2023 and $(13) million in the first six months of 2022.

Contract balances

Our clients are billed based on fee schedules that are
agreed upon in each customer contract. Receivables from
customers were $2.7 billion at June 30, 2023 and $2.6
billion at Dec. 31, 2022.

Contract assets represent accrued revenues that have not
yet been billed to customers due to certain contractual
terms other than the passage of time and were $70 million
at June 30, 2023 and $48 million at Dec. 31, 2022. Accrued
revenues recorded as contract assets are usually billed on
an annual basis.

Both receivables from customers and contract assets are
included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.

Contract liabilities represent payments received in advance
of providing services under certain contracts and were
$217 million at June 30, 2023 and $164 million at Dec. 31,
2022. Contract liabilities are included in other liabilities on
the consolidated balance sheet. Revenue recognized in the
first six months of 2023 relating to contract liabilities as of
Dec. 31, 2022 was $84 million. Revenue recognized in the
second quarter of 2023 relating to contract liabilities as of
March 31, 2023 was $66 million.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

BNY Mellon 73

Changes in contract assets and liabilities primarily relate to
either party’s performance under the contracts.

Contract costs

Incremental costs for obtaining contracts that are deemed
recoverable are capitalized as contract costs. Such costs
result from the payment of sales incentives, primarily in
the Wealth Management business, and totaled $53 million
at June 30, 2023 and $58 million at Dec. 31, 2022.
Capitalized sales incentives are amortized based on the
transfer of goods or services to which the assets relate. The
amortization of capitalized sales incentives, which is
included in staff expense on the consolidated income
statement, totaled $4 million in the second quarter of 2023,
second quarter of 2022 and first quarter of 2023, $8 million
in the first six months of 2023 and $9 million in the first
six months of 2022.

Costs to fulfill a contract are capitalized when they relate
directly to an existing contract or a specific

Note 9–Net interest revenue

anticipated contract, generate or enhance resources that
will be used to fulfill performance obligations, and are
recoverable. Such costs generally represent set-up costs,
which include any direct cost incurred at the inception of a
contract which enables the fulfillment of the performance
obligation, and totaled $85 million at June 30, 2023 and
$77 million at Dec. 31, 2022. These capitalized costs are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected
contract period.

Unsatisfied performance obligations

We do not have any unsatisfied performance obligations
other than those that are subject to a practical expedient
election under ASC 606, Revenue From Contracts With
Customers. The practical expedient election applies to (i)
contracts with an original expected length of one year or
less, and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at
the amount to which we have the right to invoice for
services performed.

Note 11–Income taxes

BNY Mellon recorded an income tax provision of $270
million (20.2% effective tax rate) in the second quarter of
2023, $231 million (21.1% effective tax rate) in the second
quarter of 2022 and $260 million (21.0% effective tax rate)
in the first quarter of 2023.

Our total tax reserves as of June 30, 2023 were $107
million, compared with $106 million at Dec. 31, 2022. If
these tax reserves were unnecessary, $107 million would
affect the effective tax rate in future periods. We recognize
accrued interest and penalties, if applicable, related to
income taxes in income tax expense. Included in the
balance sheet at June 30, 2023 is accrued interest, where
applicable, of $34 million. The additional tax expense
related to interest for the six months ended June 30, 2023
was $1 million, compared with $4 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2022.

It is reasonably possible the total reserve for uncertain tax
positions could decrease within the next 12 months by
approximately $10 million as a result of adjustments
related to tax years that are still subject to examination.

Our federal income tax returns are closed to examination
through 2016. Our New York State and New York City
income tax returns are closed to examination through 2014.
Our UK income tax returns are closed to examination
through 2020.

Note 12–Variable interest entities

We have variable interests in variable interest entities
(“VIEs”), which include investments in retail, institutional
and alternative investment funds.

We earn management fees from these funds, as well as
performance fees in certain funds, and may also provide
start-up capital for new funds. The funds are primarily
financed by our customers’ investments in the funds’ equity
or debt.

Additionally, we invest in qualified affordable housing and
renewable energy projects, which are designed to generate
a return primarily through the realization of tax credits.
The projects, which are structured as limited partnerships
and limited liability companies, are also VIEs, but are not
consolidated.

of the VIE and to settle any investors’ ownership

VIEs. Additionally, creditors of any consolidated VIEs do
not have any recourse to the general credit of BNY Mellon.

Non-consolidated VIEs

As of June 30, 2023 and Dec. 31, 2022, assets and

Note 15–Fair value measurement

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to
sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. A three-level hierarchy for fair value
measurements is utilized based upon the transparency of
inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the
measurement date. BNY Mellon’s own creditworthiness is
considered when valuing liabilities. See Note 20 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2022
Annual Report for

information on how we determine fair value and the fair
value hierarchy.

The following tables present the financial instruments
carried at fair value at June 30, 2023 and Dec. 31, 2022, by
caption on the consolidated balance sheet and by the three-
level valuation hierarchy. We have included credit ratings
information in certain of the tables because the information
indicates the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed,
and significant changes in ratings classifications could
result in increased risk for us.

Note 16–Fair value option

We elected fair value as an alternative measurement for
selected financial assets and liabilities that are not
otherwise required to be measured at fair value, including
the assets and liabilities of consolidated investment
management funds and subordinated notes associated with
certain equity investments.

The following table presents the assets and liabilities of
consolidated investment management funds, at fair value.

The assets and liabilities of the consolidated investment
management funds are included in other assets and other
liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. We value the
assets and liabilities of consolidated investment
management funds using quoted prices for identical assets
or liabilities in

active markets or observable inputs such as quoted prices
for similar assets or liabilities. Quoted prices for either
identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets
may also be used. Accordingly, fair value best reflects the
interests BNY Mellon holds in the economic performance
of the consolidated investment management funds.
Changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities are
recorded as income (loss) from consolidated investment
management funds, which is included in investment and
other revenue on the consolidated income statement.

We elected the fair value option on subordinated notes
associated with certain equity investments. The fair value
of these subordinated notes was $8 million at June 30,
2023 and $10 million at Dec. 31, 2022. The subordinated
notes were valued using observable market inputs and
included in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

Note 17–Derivative instruments

We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk,
including interest rate risk, equity price risk and foreign
currency risk, as well as credit risk. Our trading activities
are focused on acting as a market-maker for our customers
and facilitating customer trades in compliance with the
Volcker Rule.

The notional amounts for derivative financial instruments
express the dollar volume of the transactions; however,
credit risk is much smaller.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

BNY Mellon 83

We perform credit reviews and enter into netting
agreements and collateral arrangements to minimize the
credit risk of derivative financial instruments. We enter
into offsetting positions to reduce exposure to foreign
currency, interest rate and equity price risk.

Use of derivative financial instruments involves reliance
on counterparties. Failure of a counterparty to honor its
obligation under a derivative contract is a risk we assume
whenever we engage in a derivative contract. There were
no counterparty default losses recorded in the second
quarter of 2023.

Hedging derivatives

We utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage our
exposure to interest rate fluctuations. We enter into fair
value hedges as an interest rate risk management strategy
to reduce fair value variability by converting certain fixed
rate interest payments associated with available-for-sale
securities and long-term debt to floating interest rates. We
also utilize interest rate swaps and forward exchange
contracts as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to
interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes.

The available-for-sale securities hedged consist of U.S.
Treasury, agency and non-agency commercial MBS,
sovereign debt/sovereign guaranteed and foreign covered
bonds. At June 30, 2023, $29.4 billion par value of
available-for-sale securities were hedged with interest rate
swaps designated as fair value hedges that had notional
values of $29.7 billion.

The fixed rate long-term debt instruments hedged generally
have original maturities of five to 30 years. In fair value
hedging relationships, fixed rate debt is hedged with
“receive fixed rate, pay variable rate” swaps. At June 30,
2023, $24.2 billion par value of debt was hedged with
interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges that had
notional values of $24.2 billion.

In addition, we utilize forward foreign exchange contracts
as hedges to mitigate foreign exchange

84 BNY Mellon

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

exposures. We use forward foreign exchange contracts as
cash flow hedges to convert certain forecasted non-U.S.
dollar revenue and expenses into U.S. dollars. We use
forward foreign exchange contracts with maturities of 15
months or less as cash flow hedges to hedge our foreign
exchange exposure to currencies such as the Indian rupee,
Polish zloty, Hong Kong dollar, Singapore dollar, British
pound and euro used in revenue and expense transactions
for entities that have the U.S. dollar as their functional
currency. As of June 30, 2023, the hedged forecasted
foreign currency transactions and designated forward
foreign exchange contract hedges were $589 million
(notional), with a net pre-tax gain of $5 million recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income (“OCI”). This
gain will be reclassified to earnings over the next 12
months.

In 2022, we utilized forward foreign exchange contracts as
fair value hedges of the foreign exchange risk associated
with available-for-sale securities. At June 30, 2023, there
were no remaining foreign exchange contracts. Forward
points are designated as an excluded component and
amortized into earnings over the hedge period.

Forward foreign exchange contracts are also used to hedge
the value of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
These forward foreign exchange contracts have maturities
of less than one year. The derivatives employed are
designated as hedges of changes in value of our foreign
investments due to exchange rates. The change in fair
market value of these forward foreign exchange contracts
is reported within foreign currency translation adjustments
in shareholders’ equity, net of tax. At June 30, 2023,
forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts
totaling $10.3 billion were designated as net investment
hedges.

From time to time, we also designate non-derivative
financial instruments as hedges of our net investments in
foreign subsidiaries. At June 30, 2023, there were no non-
derivative financial instruments hedging our net
investments in foreign subsidiaries.

The following table presents the pre-tax gains (losses) related to our fair value and cash flow hedging activities recognized in
the consolidated income statement.

(a)    The fair value of asset derivatives and liability derivatives designated as hedging instruments is recorded as other assets and other liabilities,

respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet.

(b)    For derivative transactions settled at clearing organizations, cash collateral exchanged is deemed a settlement of the derivative each day. The
settlement reduces the gross fair value of derivative assets and liabilities and results in a corresponding decrease in the effect of master netting
agreements, with no impact to the consolidated balance sheet.

(c)    The fair value of asset derivatives and liability derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is recorded as trading assets and trading liabilities,

respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet.

(d)    Fair values are on a gross basis, before consideration of master netting agreements, as required by ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging.
(e)    Effect of master netting agreements includes cash collateral received and paid of $1,468 million and $1,104 million, respectively, at June 30, 2023,

and $1,786 million and $1,823 million, respectively, at Dec. 31, 2022.

Trading activities (including trading derivatives)

Our trading activities are focused on acting as a market-
maker for our customers, facilitating customer trades and
risk-mitigating economic hedging in compliance with the
Volcker Rule. The change in the fair value of the
derivatives utilized in our trading activities is recorded in
foreign exchange revenue and investment and other
revenue on the consolidated income statement.

The following table presents our foreign exchange revenue
and other trading revenue.

Foreign exchange revenue includes income from
purchasing and selling foreign currencies, currency
forwards, futures and options as well as foreign currency
remeasurement. Other trading revenue reflects results from
trading in cash instruments, including fixed income and
equity securities, and

trading and economic hedging activity with non-foreign
exchange derivatives.

We also use derivative financial instruments as risk-
mitigating economic hedges, which are not formally
designated as accounting hedges. This includes hedging the
foreign currency, interest rate or market risks inherent in
some of our balance sheet exposures, such as seed capital
investments and deposits, as well as certain investment
management fee revenue streams. We also use total return
swaps to economically hedge obligations arising from the
Company’s deferred compensation plan whereby the
participants defer compensation and earn a return linked to
the performance of investments they select. The gains or
losses on these total return swaps are recorded in staff
expense on the consolidated income statement and were a
gain of $8 million in the second quarter of 2023, a loss of
$30 million in the second quarter of 2022, gains of $7
million in the first quarter of 2023 and $15 million in the
first six months of 2023 and a loss of $43 million in the
first six months of 2022.

We manage trading risk through a system of position
limits, a value-at-risk (“VaR”) methodology based on

 
 
86 BNY Mellon

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

historical simulation and other market sensitivity measures.
Risk is monitored and reported to senior management by a
separate unit, independent from trading, on a daily basis.
Based on certain assumptions, the VaR methodology is
designed to capture the potential overnight pre-tax dollar
loss from adverse changes in fair values of all trading
positions. The calculation assumes a one-day holding
period, utilizes a 99% confidence level and incorporates
non-linear product characteristics. The VaR model is one of
several statistical models used to develop economic capital
results, which are allocated to lines of business for
computing risk-adjusted performance.

VaR methodology does not evaluate risk attributable to
extraordinary financial, economic or other occurrences. As
a result, the risk assessment process includes a number of
stress scenarios based upon the risk factors in the portfolio
and management’s assessment of market conditions.
Additional stress scenarios based upon historical market
events are also performed. Stress tests may incorporate the
impact of reduced market liquidity and the breakdown of
historically observed correlations and extreme scenarios.
VaR and other statistical measures, stress testing and
sensitivity analysis are incorporated into other risk
management materials.

Counterparty credit risk and collateral

We assess the credit risk of our counterparties through
regular examination of their financial statements,
confidential communication with the management of those
counterparties and regular monitoring of publicly available
credit rating information. This and other information is
used to develop proprietary credit rating metrics used to
assess credit quality.

Collateral requirements are determined after a
comprehensive review of the credit quality of each
counterparty. Collateral is generally held or pledged in the
form of cash and/or highly liquid government securities.
Collateral requirements are monitored and adjusted daily.

Additional disclosures concerning derivative financial
instruments are provided in Note 15.

Disclosure of contingent features in over-the-counter
(“OTC”) derivative instruments

Certain OTC derivative contracts and/or collateral
agreements contain credit risk-contingent features
triggered upon a rating downgrade in which the
counterparty has the right to request additional collateral or
the right to terminate the contracts in a net liability
position.

The following table shows the aggregate fair value of OTC
derivative contracts in net liability positions that contained
credit risk-contingent features and the value of collateral
that has been posted.

The aggregate fair value of OTC derivative contracts

The Bank of New York Mellon, our largest banking
subsidiary, enters into the substantial majority of our OTC
derivative contracts and/or collateral agreements. As such,
the contingent features may be triggered if The Bank of
New York Mellon’s long-term issuer rating were
downgraded.

BNY Mellon’s repurchase agreements and securities
lending transactions primarily encounter risk associated
with liquidity. We are required to pledge collateral based
on predetermined terms within the agreements. If we were
to experience a decline in the fair value of the collateral
pledged for these transactions, we could be required to
provide additional collateral to the counterparty, therefore
decreasing the amount of assets available for other
liquidity needs that may arise. BNY Mellon also offers tri-
party collateral agency services in the tri-party repo market
where we are exposed to credit risk. In order to mitigate
this risk, we require dealers to fully secure intraday credit.

Note 18–Commitments and contingent liabilities

Off-balance sheet arrangements

In the normal course of business, various commitments and
contingent liabilities are outstanding that are not reflected
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Our significant trading and off-balance sheet risks are
securities, foreign currency and interest rate risk
management products, commercial lending commitments,
letters of credit and securities lending indemnifications. We
assume these risks to reduce interest rate and foreign
currency risks, to provide customers with the ability to
meet credit and liquidity needs and to hedge foreign
currency and interest rate risks. These items involve, to
varying degrees, credit, foreign currency and interest rate
risks not recognized on the balance sheet. Our off-balance
sheet risks are managed and monitored in manners similar
to those used for on-balance sheet risks.

acts as an agent on behalf of CIBC Mellon clients, which totaled
$63 billion at June 30, 2023 and $64 billion at Dec. 31, 2022.
Includes cash collateral, invested in indemnified repurchase
agreements, held by us as securities lending agent of $44 billion at
June 30, 2023 and $43 billion at Dec. 31, 2022.

(c)

The total potential loss on undrawn lending commitments,
standby and commercial letters of credit and securities
lending indemnifications is equal to the total notional
amount if drawn upon, which does not consider the value
of any collateral.

Since many of the lending commitments are expected to
expire without being drawn upon, the total amount does
not necessarily represent future cash requirements. A
summary of lending commitment maturities is as follows:
$29.5 billion in less than one year, $19.8 billion in one to
five years and $253 million over five years.

SBLCs principally support obligations of corporate clients
and were collateralized with cash and securities of $145
million at June 30, 2023 and $144 million at Dec. 31,
2022. At June 30, 2023, $1.4 billion of the SBLCs will
expire within one year, $537 million in one to five years
and $8 million over five years.

We must recognize, at the inception of an SBLC and
foreign and other guarantees, a liability for the fair value of
the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The fair
value of the liability, which was recorded with a
corresponding asset in other assets, was estimated as the
present value of contractual customer fees. The estimated
liability for losses related to SBLCs and foreign and other
guarantees, if any, is included in the allowance for lending-
related commitments.

Payment/performance risk of SBLCs is monitored using
both historical performance and internal ratings criteria.
BNY Mellon’s historical experience is that SBLCs
typically expire without being funded. SBLCs below
investment grade are monitored closely for
payment/performance risk. The table below shows SBLCs
by investment grade:

A commercial letter of credit is normally a short-term
instrument used to finance a commercial contract for the
shipment of goods from a seller to a buyer. Although the
commercial letter of credit is contingent upon the
satisfaction of specified conditions, it represents a credit
exposure if the buyer defaults on the underlying
transaction. As a result, the total contractual amounts do
not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
Commercial letters of credit totaled $46 million at June 30,
2023 and $19 million at Dec. 31, 2022.

We expect many of the lending commitments and letters of
credit to expire without the need to advance any cash. The
revenue associated with guarantees frequently depends on
the credit rating of the obligor and the structure of the
transaction, including collateral, if any. The allowance for
lending-related commitments was $91 million at June 30,
2023 and $78 million at Dec. 31, 2022.

A securities lending transaction is a fully collateralized
transaction in which the owner of a security agrees to lend
the security (typically through an agent, in our case, The
Bank of New York Mellon) to a borrower, usually a broker-
dealer or bank, on an open, overnight or term basis, under
the terms of a prearranged contract.

We typically lend securities with indemnification against
borrower default. We generally require the borrower to
provide collateral with a minimum value of 102% of the
fair value of the securities borrowed, which is monitored
on a daily basis, thus reducing credit risk. Market risk can
also arise in securities lending transactions. These risks are
controlled through policies limiting the level of risk that
can be undertaken. Securities lending transactions are
generally entered into only with highly rated
counterparties. Securities lending indemnifications

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

BNY Mellon 91

were secured by collateral of $481 billion at June 30, 2023
and $515 billion at Dec. 31, 2022.

CIBC Mellon, a joint venture between BNY Mellon and
the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (“CIBC”),
engages in securities lending activities.  CIBC Mellon,
BNY Mellon and CIBC jointly and severally indemnify
securities lenders against specific types of borrower
default. At June 30, 2023 and Dec. 31, 2022, $63 billion
and $64 billion, respectively, of borrowings at CIBC
Mellon, for which BNY Mellon acts as agent on behalf of
CIBC Mellon clients, were secured by collateral of $66
billion and $68 billion, respectively. If, upon a default, a
borrower’s collateral was not sufficient to cover its related
obligations, certain losses related to the indemnification
could be covered by the indemnitors.

Unsettled repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements

In the normal course of business, we enter into repurchase
agreements and reverse repurchase agreements that settle
at a future date. In repurchase agreements, BNY Mellon
receives cash from and provides securities as collateral to a
counterparty at settlement. In reverse repurchase
agreements, BNY Mellon advances cash to and receives
securities as collateral from the counterparty at settlement.
These transactions are recorded on the consolidated
balance sheet on the settlement date. At June 30, 2023, we
had no unsettled repurchase agreements and $53.0 billion
of unsettled reverse repurchase agreements. At Dec. 31,
2022, we had $4.0 billion of unsettled repurchase
agreements and $11.3 billion of unsettled reverse
repurchase agreements.

We have significant industry concentrations related to
credit exposure at June 30, 2023. The tables below present

Sponsored member repo program

BNY Mellon is a sponsoring member in the FICC
sponsored member program, where we submit eligible
repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions in U.S.
Treasury and agency securities (“Sponsored Member
Transactions”) between BNY Mellon and our sponsored
member clients for novation and clearing through FICC
pursuant to the FICC Government Securities Division
rulebook (the “FICC Rules”). We also guarantee to FICC
the prompt and full payment and performance of our
sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under the
FICC Rules in connection with such clients’ Sponsored
Member Transactions. We minimize our credit exposure
under this guaranty by obtaining a security interest in our
sponsored member clients’ collateral and rights under
Sponsored Member Transactions. See “Offsetting assets
and liabilities” in Note 17 for additional information on our
repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements.

Indemnification arrangements

We have provided standard representations for
underwriting agreements, acquisition and divestiture
agreements, sales of loans and commitments, and other
similar types of arrangements and customary
indemnification for claims and legal proceedings related to
providing financial services that are not otherwise included
above. Insurance has been purchased to mitigate certain of
these risks. Generally, there are no stated or notional
amounts included in these indemnifications, and the
contingencies triggering the obligation for indemnification
are not expected to occur. Furthermore, often
counterparties to these transactions provide us with
comparable indemnifications. We are unable to develop an
estimate of the maximum payout under these

92 BNY Mellon

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

indemnifications for several reasons. In addition to the lack
of a stated or notional amount in a majority of such
indemnifications, we are unable to predict the nature of
events that would trigger indemnification or the level of
indemnification for a certain event. We believe, however,
that the possibility that we will have to make any material
payments for these indemnifications is remote. At June 30,
2023 and Dec. 31, 2022, we have not recorded any
material liabilities under these arrangements.

Clearing and settlement exchanges

We are a noncontrolling equity investor in, and/or member
of, several industry clearing or settlement exchanges
through which foreign exchange, securities, derivatives or
other transactions settle. Certain of these industry clearing
and settlement exchanges require their members to
guarantee their obligations and liabilities and/or to provide
liquidity support in the event other members do not honor
their obligations. We believe the likelihood that a clearing
or settlement exchange (of which we are a member) would
become insolvent is remote. Additionally, certain
settlement exchanges have implemented loss allocation
policies that enable the exchange to allocate settlement
losses to the members of the exchange. It is not possible to
quantify such mark-to-market loss until the loss occurs.
Any ancillary costs that occur as a result of any mark-to-
market loss cannot be quantified. In addition, we also
sponsor clients as members on clearing and settlement
exchanges and guarantee their obligations. At June 30,
2023 and Dec. 31, 2022, we did not record any material
liabilities under these arrangements.

Legal proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, The Bank of New York
Mellon Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely
named as defendants in or made parties to pending and
potential legal actions. We also are subject to governmental
and regulatory examinations, information-gathering
requests, investigations and proceedings (both formal and
informal). Claims for significant monetary damages are
often asserted in many of these legal actions, while claims
for disgorgement, restitution, penalties and/or other
remedial actions or sanctions may be sought in
governmental and regulatory matters. It is inherently
difficult to predict the eventual outcomes of such matters
given their complexity and the particular facts and
circumstances at issue in each of these matters. However,
on the basis of our current knowledge and

understanding, we do not believe that judgments,
settlements or orders, if any, arising from these matters
(either individually or in the aggregate, after giving effect
to applicable reserves and insurance coverage) will have a
material adverse effect on the consolidated financial
position or liquidity of BNY Mellon, although they could
have a material effect on our results of operations in a
given period.

In view of the inherent unpredictability of outcomes in
litigation and regulatory matters, particularly where (i) the
damages sought are substantial or indeterminate, (ii) the
proceedings are in the early stages, or (iii) the matters
involve novel legal theories or a large number of parties, as
a matter of course there is considerable uncertainty
surrounding the timing or ultimate resolution of litigation
and regulatory matters, including a possible eventual loss,
fine, penalty or business impact, if any, associated with
each such matter. In accordance with applicable accounting
guidance, we establish accruals for litigation and
regulatory matters when those matters proceed to a stage
where they present loss contingencies that are both
probable and reasonably estimable. In such cases, there
may be a possible exposure to loss in excess of any
amounts accrued. We regularly monitor such matters for
developments that could affect the amount of the accrual,
and will adjust the accrual amount as appropriate. If the
loss contingency in question is not both probable and
reasonably estimable, we do not establish an accrual and
the matter continues to be monitored for any developments
that would make the loss contingency both probable and
reasonably estimable. We believe that our accruals for legal
proceedings are appropriate and, in the aggregate, are not
material to the consolidated financial position of BNY
Mellon, although future accruals could have a material
effect on the results of operations in a given period. In
addition, if we have the potential to recover a portion of an
estimated loss from a third party, we record a receivable up
to the amount of the accrual that is probable of recovery.

For certain of those matters described here for which a loss
contingency may, in the future, be reasonably possible
(whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where
there is no accrued liability), BNY Mellon is currently
unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss. For
those matters described here where BNY Mellon is able to
estimate a reasonably possible loss, the aggregate range of
such reasonably possible loss is up to $620 million in

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

BNY Mellon 93

excess of the accrued liability (if any) related to those
matters. For matters where a reasonably possible loss is
denominated in a foreign currency, our estimate is adjusted
quarterly based on prevailing exchange rates. We do not
consider potential recoveries when estimating reasonably
possible losses.

The following describes certain judicial, regulatory and
arbitration proceedings involving BNY Mellon:

Mortgage-Securitization Trusts Proceedings
BNY Mellon has been named as a defendant in a number
of legal actions brought by MBS investors alleging that the
trustee has expansive duties under the governing
agreements, including the duty to investigate and pursue
breach of representation and warranty claims against other
parties to the MBS transactions. Two actions commenced
in December 2015 and February 2017 are pending in New
York federal court. An action commenced in December
2014 in New York federal court was dismissed and the
dismissal was affirmed on appeal in April 2023. In New
York state court, six actions are pending: one case
commenced in May 2016; two related cases commenced in
September 2021 and October 2022; and three related cases
commenced in October 2021, December 2021 and
February 2022.

Matters Related to R. Allen Stanford
In late December 2005, Pershing LLC (“Pershing”)
became a clearing firm for Stanford Group Co. (“SGC”), a
registered broker-dealer that was part of a group of entities
ultimately controlled by R. Allen Stanford (“Stanford”).
Stanford International Bank, also controlled by Stanford,
issued certificates of deposit (“CDs”). Some investors
allegedly wired funds from their SGC accounts to purchase
CDs. In 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission
charged Stanford with operating a Ponzi scheme in
connection with the sale of CDs, and SGC was placed into
receivership. Alleged purchasers of CDs have filed two
putative class action proceedings against Pershing: one in
November 2009 in Texas federal court, and one in May
2016 in New Jersey federal court. On Nov. 5, 2021, the
court dismissed the class action filed in New Jersey and
that matter has concluded. Three lawsuits remain against
Pershing in Louisiana and New Jersey federal courts,
which were filed in January 2010, October 2015 and May
2016. The purchasers allege that Pershing, as SGC’s
clearing firm, assisted Stanford in a fraudulent scheme and
assert contractual, statutory and common law claims. In
March 2019, a group of investors filed

a putative class action against The Bank of New York
Mellon in New Jersey federal court, making the same
allegations as in the prior actions brought against Pershing.
On Nov. 12, 2021, the court dismissed the class action
against The Bank of New York Mellon; on Dec. 15, 2022,
an appeals court reversed the dismissal and returned the
case to the trial court for further proceedings. All the cases
that have been brought in federal court against Pershing
have been consolidated in Texas federal court for discovery
purposes. Various alleged Stanford CD purchasers asserted
similar claims in Financial Industry Regulatory Authority,
Inc. (“FINRA”) arbitration proceedings.

Brazilian Postalis Litigation
BNY Mellon Servicos Financeiros DTVM S.A.
(“DTVM”), a subsidiary that provides asset services in
Brazil, acts as administrator for certain investment funds in
which a public pension fund for postal workers called
Postalis-Instituto de Seguridade Social dos Correios e
Telégrafos (“Postalis”) invested. On Aug. 22, 2014,
Postalis sued DTVM in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for losses
related to a Postalis fund for which DTVM is
administrator. Postalis alleges that DTVM failed to
properly perform duties, including to conduct due diligence
of and exert control over the manager. On March 12, 2015,
Postalis filed a lawsuit in Rio de Janeiro against DTVM
and BNY Mellon Administração de Ativos Ltda. (“Ativos”)
alleging failure to properly perform duties relating to
another fund of which DTVM is administrator and Ativos
is manager. On Dec. 14, 2015, Associacão dos
Profissionais dos Correios (“ADCAP”), a Brazilian postal
workers association, filed a lawsuit in São Paulo against
DTVM and other defendants alleging that DTVM
improperly contributed to Postalis investment losses. On
March 20, 2017, the lawsuit was dismissed without
prejudice, and ADCAP appealed. On Aug. 4, 2021, the
appellate court overturned the dismissal and sent the
lawsuit to a state lower court. On March 2, 2023, DTVM
appealed the August 4 decision to Brazil’s Superior Court
of Justice. On Dec. 17, 2015, Postalis filed three lawsuits
in Rio de Janeiro against DTVM and Ativos alleging
failure to properly perform duties with respect to
investments in several other funds. On May 20, 2021, the
court in one of those lawsuits entered a judgment of
approximately $3 million against DTVM and Ativos. On
Aug. 23, 2021, DTVM and Ativos filed an appeal of the
May 20 decision. On June 7, 2022, the appellate court
partially granted and partially denied the appeal,

94 BNY Mellon

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

reducing the judgment to approximately $2 million. On
July 13, 2023, DTVM and Ativos filed a further appeal to
Brazil’s Superior Court of Justice. On Aug. 24, 2022, the
court dismissed one of the other lawsuits. On Nov. 24,
2022, Postalis appealed that decision. On Feb. 4, 2016,
Postalis filed a lawsuit in Brasilia against DTVM, Ativos
and BNY Mellon Alocação de Patrimônio Ltda.
(“Alocação de Patrimônio”), an investment management
subsidiary, alleging failure to properly perform duties and
liability for losses with respect to investments in various
funds of which the defendants were administrator and/or
manager. On Jan. 16, 2018, the Brazilian Federal
Prosecution Service (“MPF”) filed a civil lawsuit in São
Paulo against DTVM alleging liability for Postalis losses
based on alleged failures to properly perform certain duties
as administrator to certain funds in which Postalis invested
or as controller of Postalis’s own investment portfolio. On
April 18, 2018, the court dismissed the lawsuit without
prejudice. On Aug. 4, 2021, the appellate court overturned
the dismissal and returned the lawsuit to the lower court.
On April 11, 2022, DTVM appealed the Aug. 4 decision to
Brazil’s Superior Court of Justice. In addition, the Tribunal
de Contas da União (“TCU”), an administrative tribunal,
has initiated proceedings with the purpose of determining
liability for losses to three investment funds administered
by DTVM in which Postalis was an investor. On Sept. 9,
2020, TCU rendered a decision in one of the proceedings,
finding DTVM and two former Postalis directors jointly
and severally liable for approximately $50 million. TCU
also imposed on DTVM a fine of approximately $2
million. DTVM’s administrative appeal of the decision was
denied. On Feb. 25, 2022, DTVM filed a lawsuit in Brazil
federal court in Brasilia seeking annulment of TCU’s
decision and an injunction preventing TCU from enforcing
the judgment. On Aug. 24, 2022, the Brazilian Federal
Attorneys filed an action in Rio de Janeiro court seeking to
enforce the fine portion of the judgment. On Nov. 8, 2022,
the Brasilia federal court in the annulment action granted
DTVM’s request for an injunction, suspending the Sept. 9,
2020 TCU decision until the annulment action is decided.
On Oct. 4, 2019, Postalis and another pension fund filed a
request for arbitration in São Paulo against DTVM and
Ativos alleging liability for losses to an investment fund
for which DTVM was administrator and Ativos was
manager. On March 26, 2021, DTVM and Ativos filed a
lawsuit in São Paulo challenging the decision rendered by
the Arbitration Court with respect to its

jurisdiction over the case. On Feb. 24, 2023, the São Paulo
court annulled the Arbitration Court’s decision that it had
jurisdiction. On Oct. 25, 2019, Postalis filed a lawsuit in
Rio de Janeiro against DTVM and Alocação de
Patrimônio, alleging liability for losses in another fund for
which DTVM was administrator and Alocação de
Patrimônio and Ativos were managers. On May 9, 2022,
the court found DTVM and Alocação de Patrimônio jointly
and severally liable for approximately $20 million. On
Aug. 12, 2022, DTVM and Alocação de Patrimônio
appealed the decision. On June 19, 2020, a lawsuit was
filed in federal court in Rio de Janeiro against DTVM,
Postalis, and various other defendants alleging liability
against DTVM for certain Postalis losses in an investment
fund of which DTVM was administrator. On Feb. 10,
2021, Postalis and another pension fund served DTVM in a
lawsuit filed in Rio de Janeiro, alleging liability for losses
in another investment fund for which DTVM was
administrator and the other defendant was manager.

Brazilian Silverado Litigation
DTVM acts as administrator for the Fundo de Investimento
em Direitos Creditórios Multisetorial Silverado Maximum
(“Silverado Maximum Fund”), which invests in
commercial credit receivables. On June 2, 2016, the
Silverado Maximum Fund sued DTVM in its capacity as
administrator, along with Deutsche Bank S.A. - Banco
Alemão in its capacity as custodian and Silverado Gestão e
Investimentos Ltda. in its capacity as investment manager.
The Fund alleges that each of the defendants failed to
fulfill its respective duty, and caused losses to the Fund for
which the defendants are jointly and severally liable.

German Tax Matters
German authorities are investigating past “cum/ex”
trading, which involved the purchase of equity securities
on or shortly before the dividend date, but settled after that
date, potentially resulting in an unwarranted refund of
withholding tax. German authorities have taken the view
that past cum/ex trading may have resulted in tax
avoidance or evasion. European subsidiaries of BNY
Mellon have been informed by German authorities about
investigations into potential cum/ex trading by certain
third-party investment funds, where one of the subsidiaries
had acquired entities that served as depositary and/or fund
manager for those third-party investment funds. We have
received information requests from the authorities relating
to pre-

BNY Mellon 95

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

acquisition activity and are cooperating fully with those
requests. In August 2019, the District Court of Bonn
ordered that one of these subsidiaries be joined as a
secondary party in connection with the prosecution of
unrelated individual defendants. Trial commenced in
September 2019. In March 2020, the court stated that it
would refrain from taking action against the subsidiary in
order to expedite the conclusion of the trial. The court
convicted the unrelated individual defendants, and
determined that the cum/ex trading activities of the
relevant third-party investment funds were unlawful. In
November and December 2020 and February 2023, we
received secondary liability notices from the German tax
authorities totaling approximately $150 million (at then-
prevailing exchange rates) related to pre-acquisition
activity in various funds for which the entities we acquired
were depositary and/or fund manager. We have appealed
the notices. In connection with the acquisition of the
subject entities, we obtained an indemnity for liabilities
from the sellers that we intend to pursue as necessary.

Off-Channel Business-Related Communications
The Company has been responding to a request for
information from the SEC concerning compliance with
recordkeeping obligations relating to business
communications transmitted on unapproved electronic
communication platforms. SEC Staff has stated that it is
conducting similar inquiries into recordkeeping practices at
other financial institutions. The Company is cooperating
with the inquiry. In April 2023, the Company received a
similar request from the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission and is cooperating with that inquiry as well.

Note 19–Business segments

We have an internal information system that produces
performance data along product and service lines for our
three principal business segments and the Other segment.
The primary products and services and types of revenue for
our principal businesses and a description of the Other
segment are presented in Note 24 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2022 Annual
Report.

Business accounting principles

Our business data has been determined on an internal
management basis of accounting, rather than GAAP which
is used for consolidated financial reporting. These
measurement principles are designed so that

96 BNY Mellon

reported results of the businesses will track their economic
performance.

Business segment results are subject to reclassification
when organizational changes are made, or for refinements
in revenue and expense allocation methodologies.
Refinements are typically reflected on a prospective basis.
There were no reclassification or organization changes in
the second quarter of 2023.

The accounting policies of the businesses are the same as
those described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in our 2022 Annual Report.

The results of our business segments are presented and
analyzed on an internal management reporting basis.

• Revenue amounts reflect fee and other revenue

generated by each business and include revenue for
services provided between the segments that are also
provided to third parties. Fee and other revenue
transferred between businesses under revenue transfer
agreements is included within other fees in each
segment.

• Revenues and expenses associated with specific client
bases are included in those businesses. For example,
foreign exchange activity associated with clients using
custody products is included in the Securities Services
segment.

• Net interest revenue is allocated to businesses based on
the yields on the assets and liabilities generated by each
business. We employ a funds transfer pricing system
that matches funds with the specific assets and liabilities
of each business based on their interest sensitivity and
maturity characteristics.

•

•

•

The provision for credit losses associated with the
respective credit portfolios is reflected in each segment.

Incentives expense related to restricted stock and RSUs
is allocated to the segments.

Support and other indirect expenses, including services
provided between segments that are not provided to
third parties or not subject to a revenue transfer
agreement, are allocated to the businesses based on
internally developed methodologies and reflected in
noninterest expense.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

• Recurring FDIC expense is allocated to the businesses
based on average deposits generated within each
business.

•

•

Severance expense is recorded in the segments based on
the business or function the impacted employees reside,
with severance related to corporate staff, technology
and operations reflected in the Other segment.

Litigation expense is generally recorded in the business
in which the charge occurs.

• Management of the securities portfolio is a shared

service contained in the Other segment. As a result,
gains and losses associated with the valuation of the
securities portfolio are generally included in the Other
segment.

• Client deposits serve as the primary funding source for

our securities portfolio. We typically allocate all interest
revenue to the businesses generating the deposits.
Accordingly, accretion related to the portion of the
securities portfolio restructured in 2009 has been
included in the results of the businesses.

• Balance sheet assets and liabilities and their related
income or expense are specifically assigned to each
business. Segments with a net liability position have
been allocated assets.

• Goodwill and intangible assets are reflected within

individual businesses.

The following consolidating schedules present the contribution of our segments to our overall profitability.
