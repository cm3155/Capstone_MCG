Subsequent event

In February 2024, BNY Mellon adjusted its financial
results for the fourth quarter and full year ended Dec.
31, 2023 to include an additional $127 million pre-tax
($97 million after-tax) increase in noninterest expense
related to arevised e stimate of the FDIC special
assessment as aresult of new information published
by the FDIC in February 2024 relating to an increase
in their estimate of losses associated with the closures
of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank which are
expected to impact the FDIC special assessment. See
Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for information on the adjustment to our
previously reported 2023 financial results.

Summary of financial highlights

We reported net income applicable to common
shareholders of $3.1 billion, or $3.87 per diluted
common share, in 2023, including the negative
impact of notable items. Notable items in 2023
include the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(“FDIC”) special assessment, severance expense, the
reduction in the fair value of acontingent

BNY Mellon 3

Results of Operations (continued)

consideration receivable related to a prior year
divestiture, litigation reserves and net losses on
disposals. Excluding notable items, net income
applicable to common shareholders was $4.0 billion
(Non-GAAP), or $5.05 (Non-GAAP) per diluted
common share, in 2023. In 2022, net income
applicable to common shareholders of BNY Mellon
was $2.4 billion, or $2.90 per diluted common share,
including the negative impact of notable items.
Notable items in 2022 include goodwill impairment
in the Investment Management reporting unit, the net
loss from repositioning the securities portfolio,
severance expense, litigation reserves, the accelerated
amortization of deferred costs for depositary receipts
services related to Russia and net gains on disposals.
Excluding notable items, net income applicable to
common shareholders was $3.7 billion (Non-GAAP),
or $4.59 (Non-GAAP) per diluted common share, in
2022.

The highlights below are based on 2023 compared
with 2022, unless otherwise noted.

•

• Total revenue increased 7%, primarily reflecting:
Fee revenue decreased 1%, primarily
reflecting lower foreign exchange volatility,
the mix of AUM flows and the impact of a
prior year divestiture, partially offset by the
abatement of money market fee waivers, net
new business and the accelerated
amortization of deferred costs for depositary
receipts services related to Russia in the first
quarter of 2022. (See “Fee and other
revenue” beginning on page 5.)
Investment and other revenue increased
primarily reflecting the net loss from
repositioning the securities portfolio in the
fourth quarter of 2022, partially offset by the
reduction in the fair value of acontingent
consideration receivable related to a prior
year divestiture in the fourth quarter of 2023.
(See “Fee and other revenue” beginning on
page 5.)

•

• Net interest revenue increased 24%, primarily
reflecting higher interest rates, partially offset
by changes in balance sheet size and mix.
(See “Net interest revenue” beginning on
page 8.)

• The provision for credit losses was $119 million,
primarily driven by reserve increases related to
commercial real estate exposure and changes in
the macroeconomic forecast. (See “Consolidated

4 BNY Mellon

balance sheet review – Allowance for credit
losses” beginning on page 33.)

• Noninterest expense increased 2%, primarily
reflecting the FDIC special assessment in the
fourth quarter of 2023, higher investments and
revenue-related expenses, as well as inflation,
partially offset by the impacts of the goodwill
impairment in the Investment Management
reporting unit in the third quarter of 2022,
efficiency savings and aprior y ear divestiture.
Excluding notable items, noninterest expense
increased 3% (Non-GAAP). (See “Noninterest
expense” on page 11.)

• Effective tax rate of 19.6% in 2023. (See

“Income taxes” on page 11.)

• Return on common equity (“ROE”) was 8.5% for
2023. Excluding notable items, the adjusted ROE
was 11.1% (Non-GAAP) for 2023.

• Return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”)
was 16.6% (Non-GAAP) for 2023. Excluding
notable items, the adjusted ROTCE was 21.6%
(Non-GAAP) for 2023.

See “Supplemental Information – Explanation of
GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures”
beginning on page 111 for reconciliations of the Non-
GAAP measures.

Metrics

• AUC/A totaled $47.8 trillion at Dec. 31, 2023
compared with $44.3 trillion at Dec. 31, 2022.
The 8% increase primarily reflects higher market
values. (See “Fee and other revenue” beginning
on page 5.)

• AUM totaled $2.0 trillion at Dec. 31, 2023

compared with $1.8 trillion at Dec. 31, 2022.
The 8% increase primarily reflects higher market
values and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S.
dollar, partially offset by cumulative net
outflows. (See “Review of business segments –
Investment and Wealth Management business
segment” beginning on page 17.)

Capital and liquidity

• Our CET1 ratio calculated under the Advanced
Approaches was 11.5% at Dec. 31, 2023 and
11.2% at Dec. 31, 2022. The increase was
primarily driven by capital generated through
earnings and anet i ncrease in accumulated other
comprehensive income, partially offset by capital

increase was driven by lower average assets.

Fee revenue decreased 1% compared with 2022,
primarily reflecting lower foreign exchange volatility,
the mix of AUM flows and the impact of a prior year
divestiture, partially offset by the abatement of
money market fee waivers, net new business and the
accelerated amortization of deferred costs for
depositary receipts services related to Russia in the
first quarter of 2022.

Investment and other revenue increased $367 million
in 2023 compared with 2022, primarily reflecting the
net loss from repositioning the securities portfolio in
the fourth quarter of 2022, partially offset by the
reduction in the fair value of acontingent
consideration receivable related to a prior year
divestiture in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Investment services fees

Investment services fees increased 4% compared with
2022, primarily reflecting the abatement of money
market fee waivers, net new business, the accelerated
amortization of deferred costs for depositary receipts
services related to Russia recorded in the first quarter
of 2022, higher clearance volumes and collateral
management balances and higher fees on sweep

balances, partially offset by lower client activity, and
lost business in Pershing.

AUC/A totaled $47.8 trillion at Dec. 31, 2023, an
increase of 8% compared with Dec. 31, 2022,
primarily reflecting higher market values. AUC/A
consisted of 35% equity securities and 65% fixed-
income securities at Dec. 31, 2023 and 33% equity
securities and 67% fixed-income securities at Dec.
31, 2022.

See “Securities Services business segment” and
“Market and Wealth Services business segment” in
“Review of business segments” for additional details.

Investment management and performance fees

Investment management and performance fees
decreased 7% compared with 2022, primarily
reflecting the impact of a prior year divestiture and
the mix of AUM flows, partially offset by the
abatement of money market fee waivers.
Performance fees were $81 million in 2023 and $75
million in 2022. On a constant currency basis (Non-
GAAP), investment management and performance
fees decreased 7% compared with 2022. See

include 12b-1 fees, fluctuate with the overall level of
net sales, the relative mix of sales between share
classes, the funds’ market values and money market
fee waivers.

AUM was $2.0 trillion at Dec. 31, 2023, an increase
of 8% compared with Dec. 31, 2022, primarily
reflecting higher market values and the favorable
impact of a weaker U.S. dollar, partially offset by
cumulative net outflows.

See “Investment and Wealth Management business
segment” in “Review of business segments” for
additional details regarding the drivers of investment
management and performance fees, AUM and AUM
flows.

Foreign exchange revenue

Foreign exchange revenue is primarily driven by the
volume of client transactions and the spread realized
on these transactions, both of which are impacted by
market volatility, the impact of foreign currency
hedging activities and foreign currency
remeasurement gain (loss). In 2023, foreign
exchange revenue decreased 23% compared with
2022, primarily reflecting lower volatility and
volumes. Foreign exchange revenue is primarily
reported in the Securities Services business segment
and, to a lesser extent, the Market and Wealth
Services and Investment and Wealth Management
business segments and the Other segment.

Financing-related fees

Financing-related fees, which are primarily reported
in the Market and Wealth Services and Securities
Services business segments, include capital market
fees, loan commitment fees and credit-related fees.
Financing-related fees increased 10% in 2023
compared with 2022, primarily reflecting higher fees
on commitments and standby letters of credit,
partially offset by lower underwriting fees.

Distribution and servicing fees

Distribution and servicing fees earned from mutual
funds are primarily based on average assets in the
funds and the sales of funds that we manage or
administer, and are primarily reported in the
Investment Management business. These fees, which

6 BNY Mellon

Distribution and servicing fees were $148 million in
2023 compared with $130 million in 2022, driven by
the abatement of money market fee waivers. The
impact of distribution and servicing fees on income in
any one period is partially offset by distribution and
servicing expense paid to other financial
intermediaries to cover their costs for distribution and
servicing of mutual funds. Distribution and servicing
expense is recorded as noninterest expense on the
income statement.

Investment and other revenue

Investment and other revenue includes income or loss
from consolidated investment management funds,
seed capital gains or losses, other trading revenue or
loss, renewable energy investments losses, income
from corporate and bank-owned life insurance
contracts, other investment gains or losses, gains or
losses from disposals, expense reimbursements from
our CIBC Mellon joint venture, other income or loss
and net securities gains or losses. The income or loss
from consolidated investment management funds
should be considered together with the net income or
loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, which
reflects the portion of the consolidated funds for
which we do not have an economic interest and is
reflected below net income as a separate line item on
the consolidated income statement. Other trading
revenue or loss primarily includes the impact of
market-risk hedging activity related to our seed
capital investments in investment management funds,
non-foreign currency derivative and fixed income
trading, and other hedging activity. Investments in
renewable energy generate losses in investment and
other revenue that are more than offset by benefits
and credits recorded to the provision for income
taxes. Other investment gains or losses includes fair
value changes of non-readily marketable strategic
equity, private equity and other investments. Expense
reimbursements from our CIBC Mellon joint venture
relate to expenses incurred by BNY Mellon on behalf
of the CIBC Mellon joint venture. Other income
includes various miscellaneous revenues.

Investment and other revenue was $285 million in

related to aprior y ear divestiture in the fourth quarter
of 2023.

N/M –Not m eaningful.
bps – basis points.

Net interest revenue increased 24% compared with
2022, primarily reflecting higher interest rates,
partially offset by changes in the balance sheet size
and mix.

Net interest margin increased 28 basis points
compared with 2022. The increase primarily reflects
the factors mentioned above.

Average interest-earning assets decreased 4%
compared with 2022. The decrease primarily reflects
lower securities and loan balances and interest-
bearing deposits with banks, partially offset by higher
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve
and other central banks.

Average non-U.S. dollar deposits comprised
approximately 25% of our average total deposits in
2023 and 2022. Approximately 45% of the average
non-U.S. dollar deposits in 2023 and 40% in 2022
were euro-denominated.

Net interest revenue in 2024 will largely depend on
the level and mix of client deposits. Based on market
implied forward interest rates as of Dec. 31, 2023, we
expect net interest revenue for 2024 to decrease when
compared with 2023.

Includes the average impact of offsetting under enforceable netting agreements of approximately $111 billion in 2023 and $43 billion in 2022. On a Non-
GAAP basis, excluding the impact of offsetting, the yield on federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements would have been 5.22%
for 2023 and 1.77% for 2022, and the rate on federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements would have been 5.10% for 2023
and 1.67% for 2022. We believe providing the rates excluding the impact of netting is useful to investors as it is more reflective of the actual rates earned
and paid.
Interest income includes fees of $1 million in 2023 and $2 million in 2022. Nonaccrual loans are included in average loans; the associated income,

Includes the average impact of offsetting under enforceable netting agreements of approximately $45 billion in 2021. On a Non-GAAP basis, excluding
the impact of offsetting, the yield on federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements would have been 0.16%, and the rate on federal
funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements would have been (0.01)% for 2021. We believe providing the rates excluding the
impact of netting is useful to investors as it is more reflective of the actual rates earned and paid.
Interest income includes fees of $3 million in 2021. Nonaccrual loans are included in average loans; the associated income, which was recognized on a

Income taxes

BNY Mellon recorded an income tax provision of
$800 million (19.6% effective tax rate) in 2023. The
income tax provision was $768 million (23.1%
effective tax rate) in 2022. Excluding notable items,
the income tax provision was $930 million (19.1%
effective tax rate) (Non-GAAP) in 2022. See
“Supplemental Information – Explanation of GAAP
and Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on
page 111 for the reconciliation of the Non-GAAP
measure. For additional information on income taxes,
see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Total noninterest expense increased 2% compared
with 2022, primarily reflecting a$632 million accrual
for the FDIC special assessment, higher investments
and revenue-related expenses, as well as inflation,
partially offset by the impacts of the 2022 goodwill
impairment in the Investment Management reporting
unit, efficiency savings and aprior y ear divestiture.
Excluding notable items, noninterest expense
increased 3% (Non-GAAP). The investments in
growth, infrastructure and efficiency initiatives are
primarily included in staff, software and equipment,
and professional, legal and other purchased services
expenses. See “Supervision and Regulation –
Deposit Insurance” on page 69 for information on the
FDIC special assessment. See “Supplemental
Information – Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP
financial measures” beginning on page 111 for the
reconciliation of the Non-GAAP measure.

We expect total noninterest expense for 2024 to
decrease compared with 2023, primarily reflecting the
impact of notable expense items recorded in 2023,
including the FDIC special assessment, severance
expense and litigation reserves. Excluding the impact
of notable items, total noninterest expense is expected
to be flat in 2024 compared with 2023.

In the third quarter, volume-related fees may decline
due to reduced client activity. In the fourth quarter,
we typically incur higher business development and
marketing expenses. In our Investment and Wealth
Management business segment, performance fees are
typically higher in the fourth and first quarters, as
those quarters represent the end of the measurement
period for many of the performance fee-eligible
relationships.

The results of our business segments may also be
impacted by the translation of financial results
denominated in foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar.
We are primarily impacted by activities denominated
in the British pound and the euro. On aconsolidated
basis and in our Securities Services and Market and
Wealth Services business segments, we typically have
more foreign currency-denominated expenses than
revenues. However, our Investment and Wealth
Management business segment typically has more
foreign currency-denominated revenues than
expenses. Overall, currency fluctuations impact the
year-over-year growth rate in the Investment and
Wealth Management business segment more than the
Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services
business segments. However, currency fluctuations,
in isolation, are not expected to significantly impact
net income on aconsolidated basis.

Fee revenue in the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment, and to a lesser extent,
the Securities Services and Market and Wealth
Services business segments, is impacted by the global
market fluctuations. At Dec. 31, 2023, we estimated
that a 5% change in global equity markets, spread
evenly throughout the year, would impact fee revenue
by less than 1% and diluted earnings per common
share by $0.04 to $0.07.

See Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for the consolidating schedules which
show the contribution of our business segments to our
overall profitability.

Results of Operations (continued)

Review of business segments

We have an internal information system that produces
performance data along product and service lines for
our three principal business segments: Securities
Services, Market and Wealth Services and Investment
and Wealth Management, and the Other segment.

Business segment accounting principles

Our business segment data has been determined on an
internal management basis of accounting, rather than
the generally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”) used for consolidated financial reporting.
These measurement principles are designed so that
reported results of the business will track their
economic performance.

For information on the accounting principles of our
business segments, the primary products and services
in each line of business, the primary types of revenue
by line of business and how our business segments
are presented and analyzed, see Note 24 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Business segment results are subject to
reclassification when organizational changes are
made, or for refinements in revenue and expense
allocation methodologies. Refinements are typically
reflected on a prospective basis. There were no
reclassification or organizational changes in 2023.

The results of our business segments may be
influenced by client and other activities that vary by
quarter. In the first quarter, long-term stock awards
for retirement-eligible employees vest which
increases staff expense. The timing of our annual
employee merit increases also impacts staff expense.
In 2023, the merit increase was effective at the
beginning of the second quarter, compared with prior
years when it was effective at the beginning of the
third quarter. For 2024, the merit increase will be
effective in March, thus partially impacting the first
quarter and second quarter staff expense variances.

The Asset Servicing business provides a
comprehensive suite of solutions. We are one of the
largest global custody, fund administrator and front-
to-back outsourcing partners. We offer services for
the safekeeping of assets in capital markets globally
as well as fund accounting services, exchange-traded

front-to-back capabilities as well as data and analytics
solutions for our clients. We deliver foreign

added solutions that enable, facilitate and enhance

countries.

Review of financial results

AUC/A of $34.2 trillion increased 9% compared with
Dec. 31, 2022, primarily reflecting higher market
values.

Total revenue of $8.6 billion increased 7% compared
with 2022. The drivers of total revenue by line of
business are indicated below.

Asset Servicing revenue of $6.6 billion increased 5%
compared with 2022, primarily reflecting higher net
interest revenue, net new business and the abatement
of money market fee waivers, partially offset by
lower foreign exchange revenue and client activity.

Issuer Services revenue of $2.0 billion increased 16%
compared with 2022, primarily reflecting higher net
interest revenue, the accelerated amortization of
deferred costs for depositary receipts services related
to Russia recorded in 2022, net new business and the
abatement of money market fee waivers.

Market and regulatory trends are driving investable
assets toward lower fee asset management products at
reduced margins for our clients. These dynamics are
also negatively impacting our investment services
fees. However, at the same time, these trends are
providing additional outsourcing opportunities as
clients and other market participants seek to comply
with regulations and reduce their operating costs.

The Issuer Services business includes Corporate
Trust and Depositary Receipts. Our Corporate
Trust business delivers afull range of issuer and
related investor services, including trustee, paying

Noninterest expense of $6.4 billion increased 1%
compared with 2022, primarily reflecting higher
investments and the impact of inflation, partially
offset by efficiency savings.

endowments, public funds and government agencies.
For information on the drivers of the Market and
Wealth Services fee revenue, see Note 10 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Pershing provides execution, clearing, custody,
business and technology solutions, delivering
operational support to broker-dealers, wealth
managers and registered investment advisors
(“RIAs”) globally.

Our Treasury Services business is aleading

and trade finance services for financial institutions,
corporations and the public sector.

Our Clearance and Collateral Management
business clears and settles equity and fixed-income
transactions globally and serves as custodian for
tri-party repo collateral worldwide. We are the

the U.S. tri-party repo market at Dec. 31, 2023.

Review of financial results

AUC/A of $13.3 trillion increased 5% compared with
Dec. 31, 2022, primarily reflecting higher market
values and net client inflows.

Total revenue of $5.9 billion increased 11%
compared with 2022. The drivers of total revenue by
line of business are indicated below.

Pershing revenue of $2.8 billion increased 10%
compared with 2022, primarily reflecting the
abatement of money market fee waivers, higher net
interest revenue and higher fees on sweep balances,
partially offset by lower client activity and lost
business. Net new assets of $22 billion in 2023
reflects the deconversion of aregional bank client
that was acquired in May.

Treasury Services revenue of $1.6 billion increased
9% compared with 2022, primarily reflecting higher
net interest revenue.

Clearance and Collateral Management revenue of
$1.5 billion increased 15% compared with 2022,
primarily reflecting higher net interest revenue, U.S.
collateral management balances and U.S. government
clearance volumes.

Noninterest expense of $3.2 billion increased 9%
compared with 2022, primarily reflecting higher
investments and revenue-related expenses, as well as
the impact of inflation, partially offset by efficiency
savings.

Business segment description

Our Investment and Wealth Management business
segment consists of two distinct lines of business,
Investment Management and Wealth Management,
which have a combined AUM of $2.0 trillion as of
Dec. 31, 2023.

BNY Mellon Investment Management is a leading
global asset manager and consists of seven specialist
investment firms and a global distribution platform to
deliver a diversified range of investment capabilities
to institutional and retail clients globally.

Our Investment Management model provides
specialist expertise from seven investment firms
offering solutions across major asset classes, backed
by the strength, scale and proven stewardship of BNY

18 BNY Mellon

Mellon. Each investment firm has its own individual
culture, investment philosophy and proprietary
investment process. This approach brings our clients
clear, independent thinking from highly experienced
investment professionals.

The investment firms offer abroad r ange of actively
managed equity, fixed income, multi-asset and
liability-driven investments, along with passive
products and cash management. Our six majority-
owned investment firms are as follows: ARX,
Dreyfus, Insight Investment, Mellon, Newton
Investment Management and Walter Scott. BNY
Mellon owns anoncontrolling i nterest in Siguler
Guff.

In November 2022, BNY Mellon sold Alcentra. As
part of the sale agreement, Investment Management
will continue to offer Alcentra’s capabilities in BNY
Mellon’s sub-advised funds and in select regions via
its global distribution platform. BNY Mellon
continues to provide Alcentra with ongoing asset
servicing support. Additionally, Investment
Management exclusively distributes Alcentra
products in Japan.

Investment Management has multiple global
distribution entities, which are responsible for
distributing the investment solutions developed and
managed by the investment firms, as well as
responsibility for management and distribution of our
U.S. mutual funds, ETFs and certain offshore money
market funds.

BNY Mellon Wealth Management provides
investment management, custody, wealth and estate
planning, private banking services, investment
servicing and information management. BNY Mellon
Wealth Management has $312 billion in client assets
as of Dec. 31, 2023, and more than 30 offices in the
U.S. and internationally.

Wealth Management clients include individuals,
families and institutions. Institutions include family
offices, charitable gift programs and endowments and
foundations. We work with clients to build, manage
and sustain wealth across generations and market
cycles.

The wealth business differentiates itself with a
comprehensive wealth management framework called
Active Wealth that seeks to empower clients to build
and sustain long-term wealth.

Results of Operations (continued)

The results of the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment are driven by ablend
of daily, monthly and quarterly AUM by product
type. The overall level of AUM for agiven p eriod is
determined by:

•

•

•

the beginning level of AUM;

the net flows of new assets during the period
resulting from new business wins and existing
client inflows, reduced by the loss of clients and
existing client outflows; and

the impact of market price appreciation or
depreciation, foreign exchange rates and
investment firm acquisitions or divestitures.

The mix of AUM is a result of the historical growth
rates of equity and fixed income markets and the
cumulative net flows of our investment firms as a
result of client asset allocation decisions. Actively
managed equity, multi-asset and alternative assets
typically generate higher percentage fees than fixed-
income and liability-driven investments and cash.
Also, actively managed assets typically generate
higher management fees than indexed or passively
managed assets of the same type. Market and
regulatory trends have resulted in increased demand
for lower fee asset management products and for
performance-based fees.

Investment management fees are dependent on the
overall level and mix of AUM and the management
fees expressed in basis points (one-hundredth of one
percent) charged for managing those assets.
Management fees are typically subject to fee
schedules based on the overall level of assets
managed for a single client or by individual asset
class and style. This is most common for institutional
clients where we typically manage substantial assets
for individual accounts.

Performance fees are generally calculated as a
percentage of a portfolio’s performance in excess of a
benchmark index or apeer group’s performance.

A key driver of organic growth in investment
management and performance fees is the amount of
net new AUM flows. Overall market conditions are
also key drivers, with a significant long-term
economic driver being growth of global financial
assets.

Net interest revenue is determined by loan and
deposit volumes and the interest rate spread between
customer rates and internal funds transfer rates on
loans and deposits. Expenses in the Investment and
Wealth Management business segment are mainly
driven by staff and distribution and servicing
expenses.

Review of financial results

AUM of $2.0 trillion increased 8% compared with
Dec. 31, 2022, primarily reflecting higher market
values and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S.
dollar, partially offset by cumulative net outflows.

Net long-term strategy outflows were $25 billion in
2023, driven by outflows of equity, index and multi-
asset and alternative investments, partially offset by
inflows of liability-driven investments. Short-term
strategy inflows were $5 billion in 2023.

Total revenue of $3.1 billion decreased 11%
compared with 2022. The drivers of total revenue by
line of business are indicated below.

Investment Management revenue of $2.1 billion
decreased 13% compared with 2022, primarily
reflecting the reduction in the fair value of a
contingent consideration receivable and the impact of
the prior year divestiture, as well as the mix of AUM
flows, partially offset the abatement of money market
fee waivers and seed capital gains.

Wealth Management revenue of $1.1 billion
decreased 7% compared with 2022, primarily
reflecting changes in product mix and lower net
interest revenue.

Revenue generated in the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment included 33% from
non-U.S. sources in 2023, compared with 35% in
2022.

Noninterest expense of $2.8 billion decreased 21%
compared with 2022, primarily reflecting the
goodwill impairment in the Investment Management
reporting unit in 2022, the impact of a prior year
divestiture and efficiency savings, partially offset by
higher investments and revenue-related expenses, as
well as inflation.

International operations

Our primary international activities consist of asset
servicing in our Securities Services business segment,
global payment services in our Market and Wealth
Services business segment and investment
management in our Investment and Wealth
Management business segment.

Our clients include central banks and sovereigns,
financial institutions, asset managers, insurance
companies, corporations, local authorities and high-
net-worth individuals and family offices. Through
our global network of offices, we have developed a
deep understanding of local requirements and cultural
needs, and we pride ourselves on providing dedicated
service through our multilingual sales, marketing and
client service teams.

At Dec. 31, 2023, approximately 55% of our total
employees (full-time and part-time employees) were
based outside the U.S., with approximately 11,000
employees in EMEA, approximately 18,400
employees in APAC and approximately 800
employees in other global locations, primarily Brazil.

We are a leading global asset manager. Our
international operations managed 51% of BNY

Results of Operations (continued)

Mellon’s AUM at Dec. 31, 2023 and 53% at Dec. 31,
2022.

In Europe, we maintain capabilities to service
Undertakings for Collective Investment in
Transferable Securities and alternative investment
funds. We offer afull range of tailored solutions for
investment companies, financial institutions and
institutional investors across most European markets.

We are a provider of non-U.S. government securities,
fixed income and equities clearance, settling
securities transactions directly in European markets,
and using a high-quality and established network of
local agents in non-European markets.

We have extensive experience providing trade and
cash services to financial institutions and central
banks outside of the U.S. In addition, we offer a
broad range of servicing and fiduciary products to
financial institutions, corporations and central banks.
In emerging markets, we lead with custody, global
payments and issuer services, introducing other
products as the markets mature. For more established
markets, our focus is on global investment services.

We are also afull- service global provider of foreign
exchange services, actively trading in over 100 of the
world’s currencies. We serve clients from trading
desks located in Europe, Asia and North America.

Our financial results, as well as our levels of AUC/A
and AUM, are impacted by translation from foreign
currencies to the U.S. dollar. We are primarily
impacted by activities denominated in the British
pound and the euro. If the U.S. dollar depreciates
against these currencies, the translation impact is a
higher level of fee revenue, net interest revenue,
noninterest expense and AUC/A and AUM.
Conversely, if the U.S. dollar appreciates, the
translated levels of fee revenue, net interest revenue,
noninterest expense and AUC/A and AUM will be
lower.

International clients accounted for 36% of revenues in
2023 and 2022. Net income from international
operations was $2.0 billion in 2023, compared with
$1.7 billion in 2022.

In 2023, revenues from EMEA were $4.1 billion,
compared with $4.0 billion in 2022. The 4% increase
primarily reflects higher net interest revenue and net
new business in the Securities Services and Market
and Wealth Services business segments. The increase
was partially offset by lower revenue in the
Investment and Wealth Management business
segment. The decrease in revenue in the Investment
and Wealth Management business segment primarily
reflects the impact of the prior year divestiture, mix
of AUM flows and lower market values.

The Securities Services, Market and Wealth Services
and Investment and Wealth Management business
segments generated 60%, 21% and 19% of EMEA
revenues, respectively. Net income from EMEA was
$1.1 billion in 2023, compared with $880 million in
2022.

Revenues from APAC were $1.3 billion in 2023,
compared with $1.1 billion in 2022. The 14%
increase primarily reflects higher net interest revenue
in the Securities Services and Market and Wealth
Services business segments.

The Securities Services, Market and Wealth Services
and Investment and Wealth Management business
segments generated 56%, 32% and 12% of APAC
revenues, respectively. Net income from APAC was
$547 million in 2023, compared with $432 million in
2022.

operations, including certain key subjective
assumptions used in determining the results, see Note

Country risk exposure

The following table presents BNY Mellon’s top 10
exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of Dec.
31, 2023, as well as certain countries with higher-risk
profiles, and is presented on an internal risk
management basis. We monitor our exposure to these
and other countries as part of our internal country risk
management process.

The country risk exposure below reflects the
Company’s risk to an immediate default of the
counterparty or obligor based on the country of
residence of the entity which incurs the liability. If
there is credit risk mitigation, the country of residence
of the entity providing the risk mitigation is the
country of risk. The country of risk for securities is
generally based on the domicile of the issuer of the

Events in recent years have resulted in increased

and investment management services.

We are also monitoring our exposure to Israel as part
of our internal country risk management process. At
Dec. 31, 2023, our total exposure to Israel was $165
million and primarily consisted of investment grade
short-term interest-bearing deposits and OTC
derivatives maturing within six months.

The war in Ukraine has increased our focus on
Russia. The country risk exposure to Russia consists
of cash balances related to our securities services
businesses and may increase in the future to the
extent cash is received for the benefit of our clients
that is subject to distribution restrictions. BNY
Mellon has ceased new banking business in Russia
and suspended investment management purchases of
Russian securities. At Dec. 31, 2023, less than 0.1%
of our AUC/A and less than 0.01% of our AUM
consisted of Russian securities. We will continue to
work with multinational clients that depend on our
custody and record keeping services to manage their
exposures.

Critical accounting estimates

Our significant accounting policies are described in
Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. Certain of these policies include critical
accounting estimates which require management to
make subjective or complex judgments about the
effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and
may change in subsequent periods. Our critical
accounting estimates are those related to the
allowance for credit losses, goodwill and other
intangibles and litigation and regulatory
contingencies. Management has discussed the

Results of Operations (continued)

development and selection of the critical accounting
estimates with the Company’s Audit Committee.

Allowance for credit losses

The allowance for credit losses covers financial assets
subject to credit losses and measured at amortized
cost, including loans and lending-related
commitments, held-to-maturity securities, certain
securities financing transactions and deposits with
banks. The allowance for credit losses is intended to
adjust the carrying value of these assets by an
estimated amount of credit losses that we expect to
incur over the life of the asset. Similarly, the
allowance for credit losses on lending-related
commitments and other off-balance sheet financial
instruments is meant to capture the credit losses that
we expect to recognize in these portfolios as of the
balance sheet date.

A quantitative methodology and qualitative
framework is used to estimate the allowance for
credit losses.

The quantitative component of our estimate uses
models and methodologies that categorize financial
assets based on product type, collateral type, and
other credit trends and risk characteristics, including
relevant information about past events, current
conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts
of future economic conditions that affect the
collectability of the recorded amounts. For the
quantitative component, we segment portfolios into
various major components including commercial
loans and lease financing, commercial real estate,
financial institutions, residential mortgages, and
other. The segmentation of our debt securities
portfolios is by major asset class and is influenced by
whether the security is structured or non-structured
(i.e., direct obligation), as well as the issuer type. The
components of the credit loss calculation for each
major portfolio or asset class include a probability of
default, loss given default and exposure at default, as
applicable, and their values depend on the forecast
behavior of variables in the macroeconomic
environment. We utilize a multi-scenario
macroeconomic forecast which includes aweighting
of three scenarios: a baseline and upside and
downside scenarios and allows us to develop our
estimate using awide span of economic variables.
Our baseline scenario reflects aview on likely
performance of each global region and the other two
scenarios are designed relative to the baseline

scenario. This approach incorporates a reasonable
and supportable forecast period spanning the life of
the asset, and includes both an initial estimated
economic outlook component as well as a reversion
component for each economic input variable. The
length of each of the two components depends on the
underlying financial instrument, scenario, and
underlying economic input variable. In general, the
initial economic outlook period for each economic
input variable under each scenario ranges between
several months and two years. The speed at which
the scenario-specific forecasts revert to long-term
historical mean is based on observed historical
patterns of mean reversion at the economic variable
input level that are reflected in our model parameter
estimates. Certain macroeconomic variables such as
unemployment or home prices take longer to revert
after acontraction, though specific recovery times are
scenario-specific. Reversion will usually take longer
the further away the scenario-specific forecast is from
the historical mean. On aquarterly basis, and within
a developed governance structure, we update these
scenarios for current economic conditions and may
adjust the scenario weighting based on our economic
outlook. The Company uses judgment to assess these
economic conditions and loss data in determining the
best estimate of the allowance for credit losses and
these estimates are subject to periodic refinement
based on changes to underlying external or Company-
specific historical data.

In the quantitative component of our estimate, we
measure expected credit losses using an individual
evaluation method if the risk characteristics of the
asset is no longer consistent with the portfolio or class
of asset. For these assets, we do not employ the
macroeconomic model calculation but consider
factors such as payment status, collateral value, the
obligor’s financial condition, guarantor support, the
probability of collecting scheduled principal and
interest payments when due, and recovery
expectations if they can be reasonably estimated. For
loans, we measure the expected credit loss as the
difference between the amortized cost basis of the
loan and the present value of the expected future cash
flows from the borrower which is generally
discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, or the
fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral-
dependent. We generally individually evaluate
nonperforming loans as well as loans that have been
or are anticipated to be modified given the risk
characteristics of such loans.

BNY Mellon 23

Results of Operations (continued)

Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair
value. When an available-for-sale debt security is in
an unrealized loss position, we employ a
methodology to identify and estimate the credit loss
portion of the unrealized loss position. The
measurement of expected credit losses is performed at
the security level and is based on our best single
estimate of cash flows, on adiscounted basis;
however, we do not specifically employ the
macroeconomic forecasting models and scenarios
summarized above.

The qualitative component of our estimate for the
allowance for credit losses is intended to capture
expected losses that may not have been fully captured
in the quantitative component. Through an
established governance structure, management
determines the qualitative allowance each period
based on an evaluation of various internal and
environmental factors which include: scenario
weighting and sensitivity risk, credit concentration
risk, economic conditions and other considerations.
We have made and may continue to make
adjustments for idiosyncratic risks.

To the extent actual results differ from forecasts or
management’s judgment, the allowance for credit
losses may be greater or less than future charge-offs
and recoveries.

Our allowance for credit losses is sensitive to a
number of inputs, most notably the macroeconomic
forecast assumptions that are incorporated into our
estimate of credit losses through the expected life of
the loan portfolio, as well as credit ratings assigned to
each borrower. As the macroeconomic environment
and related forecasts change, the allowance for credit
losses may change materially. The following
sensitivity analyses do not represent management’s
expectations of the deterioration of our portfolios or
the economic environment, but are provided as
hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the
allowance for credit losses to changes in key inputs.
If commercial real estate property values were
increased 10% and all other credits were rated one
grade better, the quantitative allowance would have
decreased by $47 million, and if commercial real
estate property values were decreased 10% and all
other credits were rated one grade worse, the
quantitative allowance would have increased by $83
million. Our multi-scenario based macroeconomic
forecast used indetermining t he Dec. 31, 2023
allowance for credit losses consisted of three

24 BNY Mellon

scenarios. The baseline scenario reflects slightly
increasing GDP growth, stable unemployment and
declining commercial real estate prices through the
end of 2024. The upside scenario reflects faster GDP
growth, declining unemployment through the second
quarter of 2024 before moderating and higher
commercial real estate prices compared with the
baseline. The downside scenario contemplates
negative GDP growth through the first quarter of
2024 with subsequent stabilization through the third
quarter of 2024, as well as rapidly increasing
unemployment through 2024 and sharply lower
commercial real estate prices than the baseline. At
Dec. 31, 2023, we placed the most weight on our
downside scenario, followed by the baseline scenario,
with the remaining weighting placed on the upside
scenario. From asensitivity perspective, at Dec. 31,
2023, if we had applied 100% weighting to the
downside scenario, the quantitative allowance for
credit losses would have been approximately $88
million higher.

See Notes 1 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information
regarding the allowance for credit losses.

Goodwill and other intangibles

We initially record all assets and liabilities acquired
in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill,
indefinite-lived intangibles and other intangibles, in
accordance with Accounting Standards Codification
(“ASC”) 805, Business Combinations. Goodwill,
indefinite-lived intangibles and other intangibles are
subsequently accounted for in accordance with ASC
350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other. The initial
measurement of goodwill and intangibles requires
judgment concerning estimates of the fair value of the
acquired assets and liabilities. Goodwill ($16.3
billion at Dec. 31, 2023) and indefinite-lived
intangible assets ($2.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2023) are
not amortized but are subject to tests for impairment
annually or more often if events or circumstances
indicate it is more likely than not they may be
impaired. Other intangible assets are amortized over
their estimated useful lives and are subject to
impairment if events or circumstances indicate a
possible inability to realize the carrying value.

Goodwill

BNY Mellon’s business segments include six
reporting units for which annual goodwill impairment

Results of Operations (continued)

testing is performed. An interim goodwill
impairment test is performed when events or
circumstances occur that may indicate that it is more
likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit
may be less than its carrying value.

As a result of the annual goodwill impairment test, no
goodwill impairment was recognized. The fair values
of the Company’s remaining five reporting units were
substantially in excess of the respective reporting
units’ carrying value.

The goodwill impairment test compares the estimated
fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying
amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair
value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying
amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered
not impaired. However, if the carrying amount of the
reporting unit were to exceed its estimated fair value,
an impairment loss would be recorded for the
difference.

In each quarter of 2023, we completed an interim
goodwill impairment test of the Investment
Management reporting unit, which had $6.1 billion of
allocated goodwill as of Dec. 31, 2023. In all cases,
we determined the fair value of the Investment
Management reporting unit exceeded its carrying
value and no goodwill impairment was recorded.

For the Dec. 31, 2023 test, the fair value of the
Investment Management reporting unit exceeded its
carrying value by approximately 5%. We determined
the fair value of the Investment Management
reporting unit using an income approach based on
management’s projections as of Dec. 31, 2023. The
discount rate applied to these cash flows was 10.5%.

As of Dec. 31, 2023, if the discount rate applied to
the estimated cash flows was increased or decreased
by 25 basis points, the fair value of the Investment
Management reporting unit would decrease or
increase by 4%, respectively. Similarly, if the long-
term growth rate was increased or decreased by 10
basis points, the fair value of the Investment
Management reporting unit would increase or
decrease by approximately 1%, respectively.

In the second quarter of 2023, we performed our
annual goodwill impairment test on the remaining
five reporting units using an income approach to
estimate the fair values of each reporting unit.
Estimated cash flows used in the income approach
were based on management’s projections as of April
1, 2023. The discount rate applied to these cash
flows was 10%.

Intangible assets

Key judgments in accounting for intangible assets
include determining the useful life and classification
between goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
assets or other amortizing intangible assets.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets ($2.6 billion at Dec.
31, 2023) are evaluated for impairment at least
annually by comparing their fair values, estimated
using discounted cash flow analyses, to their carrying
values. As aresult of the annual evaluation, no
impairment was recognized, however, a $698 million
indefinite-lived intangible asset related to customer
relationships in the Investment Management business
exceeded its carrying value by approximately 7%.

Other amortizing intangible assets ($274 million at
Dec. 31, 2023) are evaluated for impairment if events
and circumstances indicate a possible impairment.
Such evaluation of other intangible assets would be
initially based on undiscounted cash flow projections.

Determining the fair value of areporting u nit or
indefinite-lived intangible assets is subject to
uncertainty as it is reliant on estimates of cash flows
that extend far into the future, and, by their nature, are
difficult to estimate over such an extended time
frame. In the future, changes in the assumptions or
the discount rate could produce a material non-cash
goodwill or intangible asset impairment.

See Notes 1 and 7 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information
regarding goodwill, intangible assets and the annual
and interim impairment testing.

Litigation and regulatory contingencies

Significant estimates and judgments are required in
establishing an accrued liability for litigation and
regulatory contingencies. For additional information
on our policy, see “Legal proceedings” in Note 22 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Consolidated balance sheet review

One of our key risk management objectives is to
maintain a balance sheet that remains strong
throughout market cycles to meet the expectations of
our major stakeholders, including our shareholders,
clients, creditors and regulators.

We also seek to undertake overall liquidity risk,
including intraday liquidity risk, that stays within our
risk appetite. The objective of our balance sheet
management strategy is to maintain a balance sheet
that is characterized by strong liquidity and asset
quality, ready access to external funding sources at
competitive rates and astrong capital structure that
supports our risk-taking activities and is adequate to
absorb potential losses. In managing the balance
sheet, appropriate consideration is given to balancing
the competing needs of maintaining sufficient levels
of liquidity and complying with applicable
regulations and supervisory expectations while
optimizing profitability.

At Dec. 31, 2023, total assets were $410 billion,
compared with $406 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. The
increase in total assets was primarily driven by higher
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve
and other central banks and federal funds sold and
securities purchased under resale agreements,
partially offset by lower securities and interest-
bearing deposits with banks. Deposits totaled $284
billion at Dec. 31, 2023, compared with $279 billion
at Dec. 31, 2022. The increase primarily reflects
higher interest-bearing deposits in U.S. offices and
non-U.S. offices, partially offset by lower non-
interest bearing deposits (principally U.S. offices).
Total interest-bearing deposit liabilities as a
percentage of total interest-earning assets were 66%
at Dec. 31, 2023 and 58% at Dec. 31, 2022.

At Dec. 31, 2023, available funds totaled $158 billion
and includes cash and due from banks, interest-
bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other
central banks, interest-bearing deposits with banks
and federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements. This compares with available
funds of $138 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. Total

26 BNY Mellon

available funds as a percentage of total assets were
38% at Dec. 31, 2023 and 34% at Dec. 31, 2022. For
additional information on our available funds, see
“Liquidity and dividends.”

Securities were $126 billion, or 31% of total assets, at
Dec. 31, 2023, compared with $143 billion, or 35%
of total assets, at Dec. 31, 2022. The decrease
primarily reflects lower U.S. Treasury and non-U.S.
government securities, partially offset by unrealized
pre-tax gains. For additional information on our
securities portfolio, see “Securities” and Note 4of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Loans were $67 billion, or 16% of total assets, at Dec.
31, 2023, compared with $66 billion, or 16% of total
assets, at Dec. 31, 2022. Increases in nearly all loan
portfolios were partially offset by lower overdrafts
and wealth management loans. For additional
information on our loan portfolio, see “Loans” and
Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Long-term debt totaled $31 billion at Dec. 31, 2023
and $30 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. The increase
primarily reflects issuances, partially offset by
maturities and repurchases. For additional
information on long-term debt, see “Liquidity and
dividends” and Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total
shareholders’ equity totaled $41 billion at Dec. 31,
2023 and Dec. 31, 2022. For additional information,
see “Capital” and Note 15 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Securities

In the discussion of our securities portfolio, we have
included certain credit ratings information because
the information can indicate the degree of credit risk
to which we are exposed. Significant changes in
ratings classifications could indicate increased credit
risk for us and could be accompanied by an increase
in the allowance for credit losses and/or a reduction in
the fair value of our securities portfolio.

Primarily consists of exposure to Canada, UK, Australia, Germany, Singapore and Norway.
Includes net unrealized gains on derivatives hedging securities available-for-sale (including terminated hedges) of $2,678 million at Dec. 31, 2022 and net
unrealized gain (including terminated hedges) of $1,767 million at Dec. 31, 2023.
At Dec. 31, 2023, includes pre-tax net unrealized losses of $2,094 million related to available-for-sale securities, net of hedges, and $4,867 related to held-to-
maturity securities. The after-tax unrealized losses, net of hedges, related to available-for-sale securities is $1,580 million and the after-tax equivalent related to
held-to-maturity securities is $3,711 million.

The fair value of our securities portfolio, including
related hedges, was $123.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2023,
compared with $139.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. The
decrease primarily reflects lower U.S. Treasury and
non-U.S. government securities, partially offset by
unrealized pre-tax gains.

At Dec. 31, 2023, the securities portfolio had anet
unrealized loss, including the impact of related
hedges, of $7.0 billion, compared with $9.4 billion at
Dec. 31, 2022. The decrease in the unrealized loss,
including the impact of related hedges, primarily
reflects securities moving closer to maturity.

The fair value of the available-for-sale securities
totaled $78.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2023, net of hedges,
or 64% of the securities portfolio, net of hedges. The
fair value of the held-to-maturity securities totaled
$44.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2023, or 36% of the
securities portfolio, net of hedges.

The unrealized loss (after-tax) on our available-for-
sale securities portfolio, net of hedges, included in
accumulated other comprehensive income was $1.6
billion at Dec. 31, 2023, compared with $2.4 billion
at Dec. 31, 2022. Net unrealized loss, including the

impact of hedges, decreased as securities moved
closer to maturity.

At Dec. 31, 2023, 99% of the securities in our
portfolio were rated AAA/AA-, unchanged compared
with Dec. 31, 2022.

See Note 4of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for the pre-tax net securities gains (losses)

The financial institutions portfolio exposure was
$39.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2023, adecrease o f 4%
compared with Dec. 31, 2022, primarily reflecting
lower exposure in the securities industry portfolio.

Financial institution exposures are high-quality, with
92% of the exposures meeting the investment grade
equivalent criteria of our internal credit rating
classification at Dec. 31, 2023. Each customer is
assigned an internal credit rating, which is mapped to
an equivalent external rating agency grade based
upon a number of dimensions, which are continually
evaluated and may change over time. For ratings of
non-U.S. counterparties, our internal credit rating is
generally capped at aratin g equivalent to the
sovereign rating of the country where the
counterparty resides, regardless of the internal credit
rating assigned to the counterparty or the underlying
collateral.

The exposure to financial institutions is generally
short-term, with 83% of the exposures expiring
within one year. At Dec. 31, 2023, 19% of the
exposure to financial institutions had an expiration
within 90 days, compared with 17% at Dec. 31, 2022.

In addition, 62% of the financial institutions exposure
is secured at Dec. 31, 2023. For example, securities

industry clients and asset managers often borrow
against marketable securities held in custody.

At Dec. 31, 2023, the secured intraday credit
provided to dealers in connection with their tri-party
repo activity totaled $13.5 billion and was included in
the securities industry portfolio. Dealers secure the
outstanding intraday credit with high-quality liquid
collateral having amarket value in excess of the
amount of the outstanding credit. Secured intraday
credit facilities represent 34% of the exposure in the
financial institutions portfolio and are reviewed and
reapproved annually.

The asset managers portfolio exposure is high-
quality, with 97% of the exposures meeting our
investment grade equivalent ratings criteria as of Dec.
31, 2023. These exposures are generally short-term
liquidity facilities, with the majority to regulated
mutual funds.

Our banks portfolio exposure primarily relates to our
global trade finance. These exposures are short-term
in nature, with 96% due in less than one year. The
investment grade percentage of our banks exposure
was 84% at Dec. 31, 2023, compared with 86% at
Dec. 31, 2022. Our non-investment grade exposures
are primarily trade finance loans in Brazil.

at Dec. 31, 2022. Wealth management loans
primarily consist of loans to high-net-worth

individuals, amajority of which are secured by the
customers’ investment management accounts or
custody accounts.

Wealth management mortgages

Our wealth management mortgage exposure was $9.4
billion at Dec. 31, 2023, compared with $9.2 billion
at Dec. 31, 2022. Wealth management mortgages
primarily consist of loans to high-net-worth
individuals, which are secured by residential
property. Wealth management mortgages are
primarily interest-only, adjustable-rate mortgages
with a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio of 61% at
origination. Less than 1% of the mortgages were past
due at Dec. 31, 2023.

At Dec. 31, 2023, the wealth management mortgage
portfolio consisted of the following geographic
concentrations: California – 21%; New York – 14%;
Florida –11%; M assachusetts – 8%; and other –
46%.

Our commercial real estate exposure totaled $10.2
billion at Dec. 31, 2023 and $10.1 billion at Dec. 31,
2022. Our income-producing commercial real estate
facilities are focused on experienced owners and are
structured with moderate leverage based on existing
cash flows. Our commercial real estate lending
activities also include construction and renovation
facilities. Our client base consists of experienced
developers and long-term holders of real estate assets.
Loans are approved on the basis of existing or
projected cash flows and supported by appraisals and
knowledge of local market conditions. Development
loans are structured with moderate leverage, and in
many instances, involve some level of recourse to the
developer.

At Dec. 31, 2023, the unsecured portfolio consisted
of real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) and real
estate operating companies, which are both primarily
investment grade.

At Dec. 31, 2023, our commercial real estate portfolio
consisted of the following concentrations: New York
metro –36%; R EITs and real estate operating
companies – 27%; and other –37%.

Lease financings

The lease financings portfolio exposure totaled $599
million at Dec. 31, 2023 and $657 million at Dec. 31,
2022. At Dec. 31, 2023, nearly all of leasing
exposure was investment grade, or investment grade
equivalent, and primarily consisted of exposures
backed by well-diversified assets, primarily real
estate and large-ticket transportation equipment.

Allowance for credit losses

Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade clients who are active users of our non-credit services. Our
primary exposure to the credit risk of a customer consists of funded loans, unfunded contractual commitments to
lend, standby letters of credit and overdrafts associated with our custody and securities clearance businesses.

(b) Average loans based on month-end balances.
N/A –Not a pplicable. There were no net charge-offs in 2022.

The provision for credit losses was $119 million in
2023, primarily driven by reserve increases related to
commercial real estate exposure and changes in the
macroeconomic forecast.

The allowance for loan losses and allowance for
lending-related commitments represent

management’s estimate of lifetime expected losses in
our credit portfolio. This evaluation process is
subject to numerous estimates and judgments. To the
extent actual results differ from forecasts or
management’s judgment, the allowance for credit
losses may be greater or less than future charge-offs.

BNY Mellon 33

Nonperforming assets increased $128 million in 2023
compared with 2022, primarily reflecting higher
nonperforming commercial real estate loans.

See “Nonperforming assets” in Note 1of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for our policy for
placing loans on nonaccrual status.

Deposits

We receive client deposits through the businesses in
the Securities Services, Market and Wealth Services
and Investment and Wealth Management segments
and we rely on those deposits as a low-cost and stable
source of funding.

Total deposits were $283.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2023,
an increase of 2%, compared with $279.0 billion at
Dec. 31, 2022. The increase primarily reflects higher
interest-bearing deposits in U.S. offices and non-U.S.
offices, partially offset by lower non-interest bearing
deposits (principally U.S. offices).

Noninterest-bearing deposits were $58.3 billion at
Dec. 31, 2023, compared with $78.0 billion at Dec.
31, 2022, reflecting client activity. Interest-bearing
deposits were primarily demand deposits and totaled
$225.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2023, compared with
$201.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2022.

The aggregate amount of deposits by foreign
customers in domestic offices was $55.1 billion at
Dec. 31, 2023 and $61.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2022.

Deposits in foreign offices totaled $96.6 billion at
Dec. 31, 2023 and $98.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2022.
These deposits were primarily overnight deposits.

Uninsured deposits are the portion of domestic
deposits accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance
limit. Uninsured deposits in domestic deposit
accounts are generally demand deposits and totaled
$168.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2023 and $156.6 billion at
Dec. 31, 2022.

Results of Operations (continued)

Based on an evaluation of the allowance for credit
losses as discussed in “Critical accounting estimates”
and Note 1of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, we have allocated our allowance for
loans and lending-related commitments as presented

loans.

The allocation of the allowance for credit losses is
inherently judgmental, and the entire allowance for
credit losses is available to absorb credit losses
regardless of the nature of the losses.

Short-term borrowings

We fund ourselves primarily through deposits and, to
a lesser extent, other short-term borrowings and long-
term debt. Short-term borrowings consist of federal
funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, payables to customers and broker-
dealers, commercial paper and other borrowed funds.
Certain short-term borrowings, for example,
securities sold under repurchase agreements, require
the delivery of securities as collateral.

Federal funds purchased and securities sold under
repurchase agreements include repurchase agreement
activity with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation
(“FICC”), where we record interest expense on a
gross basis, but the ending and average balances
reflect the impact of offsetting under enforceable
netting agreements. This activity primarily relates to
government securities collateralized resale and
repurchase agreements executed with clients that are
novated to and settle with the FICC.

Payables to customers and broker-dealers represent
funds awaiting reinvestment and short sale proceeds
payable on demand. Payables to customers and
broker-dealers are driven by customer trading activity
and market volatility.

The Bank of New York Mellon may issue
commercial paper that matures within 397 days from
the date of issue and is not redeemable prior to
maturity or subject to voluntary prepayment.

Other borrowed funds primarily include borrowings
from the Federal Home Loan Bank, overdrafts of sub-
custodian account balances in our Securities Services
businesses, finance lease liabilities and borrowings
under lines of credit by our Pershing subsidiaries.
Overdrafts typically relate to timing differences for
settlements.

Liquidity and dividends

BNY Mellon defines liquidity as the ability of the
Parent and its subsidiaries to access funding or
convert assets to cash quickly and efficiently, or to
roll over or issue new debt, especially during periods
of market stress, at a reasonable cost, and in order to
meet its short-term (up to one year) obligations.
Funding liquidity risk is the risk that BNY Mellon
cannot meet its cash and collateral obligations at a
reasonable cost for both expected and unexpected
cash flow and collateral needs without adversely
affecting daily operations or our financial condition.
Funding liquidity risk can arise from funding
mismatches, market constraints from the inability to
convert assets into cash, the inability to hold or raise
cash, low overnight deposits, deposit run-off or
contingent liquidity events.

Changes in economic conditions or exposure to
credit, market, operational, legal and reputational
risks also can affect BNY Mellon’s liquidity risk
profile and are considered in our liquidity risk
framework. For additional information, see “Risk
Management – Liquidity Risk.”

The Parent’s policy is to have access to sufficient
unencumbered cash and cash equivalents at each
quarter-end to cover maturities and other forecasted
debt redemptions, net interest payments and net tax
payments for the following 18-month period, and to
provide sufficient collateral to satisfy transactions
subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.

We monitor and control liquidity exposures and
funding needs within and across significant legal
entities, branches, currencies and business lines,
taking into account, among other factors, any
applicable restrictions on the transfer of liquidity
among entities.

BNY Mellon also manages potential intraday
liquidity risks. We monitor and manage intraday
liquidity against existing and expected intraday liquid
resources (such as cash balances, remaining intraday
credit capacity, intraday contingency funding and
available collateral) to enable BNY Mellon to meet
its intraday obligations under normal and reasonably
severe stressed conditions.

Total available funds were $157.5 billion at Dec. 31,
2023, compared with $138.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2022.
The increase was primarily due to higher interest-
bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other
central banks and federal funds sold and securities
purchased under resale agreements, partially offset by
lower interest-bearing deposits with banks.

Average non-core sources of funds, such as federal
funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, trading liabilities, other borrowed funds
and commercial paper, were $25.0 billion for 2023
and $16.9 billion for 2022. The increase primarily
reflects higher federal funds purchased and securities
sold under repurchase agreements and other borrowed
funds.

Average interest-bearing domestic deposits were
$123.5 billion for 2023 and $111.5 billion for 2022.

Average foreign deposits, primarily from our
European-based businesses included in the Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services segments,
were $88.8 billion for 2023, compared with $101.9
billion for 2022. The decrease primarily reflects
client activity.

Average payables to customers and broker-dealers
were $14.4 billion for 2023 and $17.1 billion for

2022. Payables to customers and broker-dealers are
driven by customer trading activity and market
volatility.

Average long-term debt was $31.0 billion for 2023
and $27.4 billion for 2022.

Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased to
$59.2 billion for 2023 from $85.7 billion for 2022,
primarily reflecting client activity.

A significant reduction of client activity in our
Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services
business segments would reduce our access to
deposits. See “Asset/liability management” for
additional factors that could impact our deposit
balances.

Sources of liquidity

The Parent’s major sources of liquidity are access to
the debt and equity markets, dividends from its
subsidiaries, and cash on hand and cash otherwise
made available in business-as-usual circumstances to
the Parent through a committed credit facility with
our intermediate holding company (“IHC”).

The Bank of New York Mellon also issues
commercial paper that matures within 397 days from
the date of issue and is not redeemable prior to
maturity or subject to voluntary prepayment. There
was no commercial paper outstanding at Dec. 31,
2023 and Dec. 31, 2022. The average commercial
paper outstanding was $5 million for 2023 and 2022.

Subsequent to Dec. 31, 2023, our U.S. bank
subsidiaries could declare dividends to the Parent of
approximately $1.7 billion, without the need for a
regulatory waiver. In addition, at Dec. 31, 2023, non-
bank subsidiaries of the Parent had liquid assets of
approximately $3.2 billion. Restrictions on our
ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries are
discussed in more detail in “Supervision and
Regulation – Capital Planning and Stress Testing –
Payment of Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Other
Capital Distributions” and in Note 19 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Pershing LLC has one uncommitted line of credit in
place for liquidity purposes which is guaranteed by
the Parent for $300 million. Average borrowings
under this line were less than $1 million in 2023.
Pershing Limited, an indirect UK-based subsidiary of
BNY Mellon, has two separate uncommitted lines of
credit amounting to $261 million in aggregate.
Average borrowings under these lines were $16
million, in aggregate, in 2023.

The double leverage ratio is the ratio of our equity
investment in subsidiaries divided by our
consolidated Parent company equity, which includes
our noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. In
short, the double leverage ratio measures the extent to
which equity in subsidiaries is financed by Parent
company debt. As the double leverage ratio
increases, this can reflect greater demands on a
company’s cash flows in order to service interest
payments and debt maturities. BNY Mellon’s double
leverage ratio is managed in arange considering the
high level of unencumbered available liquid assets
held in its principal subsidiaries (such as central bank
deposit placements and government securities), the
Company’s cash generating fee-based business
model, with fee revenue representing 74% of total
revenue in 2023, and the dividend capacity of our
banking subsidiaries. Our double leverage ratio was
120.5% at Dec. 31, 2023 and Dec. 31, 2022, and
within the range targeted by management.

38 BNY Mellon

Uses of funds

The Parent’s major uses of funds are repurchases of
common stock, payment of dividends, principal and
interest payments on its borrowings, acquisitions and
additional investments in its subsidiaries.

In 2023, we paid $1.5 billion in dividends on our
common and preferred stock. Our common stock
dividend payout ratio was 41% for 2023.

In 2023, we repurchased 55.8 million common shares
at an average price of $46.66 per common share for a
total cost of $2.6 billion.

Liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”)

U.S. regulators have established an LCR that requires
certain banking organizations, including BNY
Mellon, to maintain a minimum amount of
unencumbered high-quality liquid assets (“HQLA”)
sufficient to withstand the net cash outflow under a
hypothetical standardized acute liquidity stress
scenario for a30-day t ime horizon.

The following table presents BNY Mellon’s
consolidated HQLA at Dec. 31, 2023, and the average
HQLA and average LCR for the fourth quarter of
2023.

Net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”)

The NSFR is a liquidity requirement applicable to
large U.S. banking organizations, including BNY
Mellon. The NSFR is expressed as aratio of the
available stable funding to the required stable funding
amount over aone-year horizon. Our average
consolidated NSFR was 135% for the fourth quarter
of 2023 and 136% for the third quarter of 2023.

BNY Mellon and each of our affected domestic bank
subsidiaries were compliant with the NSFR
requirement of at least 100% throughout the fourth
quarter of 2023.

Statement of cash flows

The following summarizes the activity reflected on
the consolidated statement of cash flows. While this
information may be helpful to highlight certain macro
trends and business strategies, the cash flow analysis
may not be as relevant when analyzing changes in our
net earnings and net assets. We believe that in
addition to the traditional cash flow analysis, the
discussion related to liquidity and dividends and
asset/liability management herein may provide more
useful context in evaluating our liquidity position and
related activity.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.9
billion in 2023, compared with $15.1 billion in 2022.
In 2023, cash flows provided by operations primarily

Capital

resulted from earnings and changes in accruals and
other, net. In 2022, cash flows provided by
operations primarily resulted from changes in trading
assets and liabilities, changes in accruals and other,
net and earnings.

Net cash used for investing activities was $5.8 billion
in 2023, compared with net cash provided by
investing activities of $19.9 billion in 2022. In 2023,
net cash used for investing activities primarily reflects
changes in interest-bearing deposits with the Federal
Reserve and other central banks and changes in
federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements, partially offset by a decrease in the
securities portfolio. In 2022, net cash provided by
investing activities primarily reflects changes in
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve
and other central banks, anet d ecrease in the
securities portfolio and change in federal funds sold
and securities purchased under resale agreements.

Net cash used for financing activities was $3.5 billion
in 2023, compared with $33.7 billion in 2022. In
2023, net cash used for financing activities primarily
reflects repayments of long-term debt, changes in
payables to customers and broker-dealers and
common stock repurchases, partially offset by
issuances of long-term debt and changes in deposits.
In 2022, net cash used for financing activities

Results of Operations (continued)

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total
shareholders’ equity increased to $40.9 billion at Dec.
31, 2023 from $40.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. The
increase primarily reflects earnings and unrealized
gain on securities available-for-sale, partially offset
by common stock repurchase activity and dividend
payments.

The unrealized loss (after-tax) on our available-for-
sale securities portfolio, net of hedges, included in
accumulated other comprehensive income was $1.6
billion at Dec. 31, 2023, compared with $2.4 billion
at Dec. 31, 2022. Net unrealized loss, including the
impact of hedges, decreased as securities moved
closer to maturity.

We repurchased 55.8 million common shares at an
average price of $46.66 per common share for a total
of $2.6 billion in 2023.

In January 2023, we announced a share repurchase
program approved by our Board of Directors
providing for the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of
common shares beginning Jan. 1, 2023. This new
share repurchase plan replaced all previously
authorized share repurchase plans.

In July 2023, our Board of Directors approved a14%
increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common
stock, from $0.37 to $0.42 per share. We began
paying the increased quarterly cash dividend in the
third quarter of 2023.

In December 2023, the Parent redeemed all
outstanding shares of its Series D Noncumulative
Perpetual Preferred Stock. See Note 15 of the Notes

to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information on the Parent’s preferred stock.

Capital adequacy

Regulators establish certain levels of capital for bank
holding companies (“BHCs”) and banks, including
BNY Mellon and our bank subsidiaries, in
accordance with established quantitative
measurements. For the Parent to maintain its status
as a financial holding company (“FHC”), our U.S.
bank subsidiaries and BNY Mellon must, among
other things, qualify as “well capitalized.” As of Dec.
31, 2023 and Dec. 31, 2022, BNY Mellon and our
U.S. bank subsidiaries were “well capitalized.”
Failure to satisfy regulatory standards, including
“well capitalized” status or capital adequacy rules
more generally, could result in limitations on our
activities and adversely affect our financial condition.
See the discussion of these matters in “Supervision
and Regulation – Regulated Entities of BNY Mellon
and Ancillary Regulatory Requirements” and “Risk
Factors –Capital a nd Liquidity Risk – Failure to
satisfy regulatory standards, including “well
capitalized” and “well managed” status or capital
adequacy and liquidity rules more generally, could
result in limitations on our activities and adversely
affect our business and financial condition.”

The U.S. banking agencies’ capital rules are based on
the framework adopted by the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision (“BCBS”), as amended from
time to time. For additional information on these
capital requirements, see “Supervision and
Regulation.”

important banks (“G-SIB”) surcharge of 1.5% is subject to change. The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set to 0%. The stress
capital buffer (“SCB”) requirement is 2.5%, equal to the regulatory minimum for Standardized Approach capital ratios.

(b) For our CET1, Tier 1capital a nd Total capital ratios, our effective capital ratios under U.S. capital rules are the lower of the ratios as
calculated under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. The Tier 1leverage ratio is based on Tier 1 capital and quarterly
average total assets.

(c) The Federal Reserve’s regulations do not establish well capitalized thresholds for these measures for BHCs.
(d) The SLR is based on Tier 1 capital and total leverage exposure, which includes certain off-balance sheet exposures.
N/A -Not a pplicable.

Our CET1 ratio determined under the Advanced
Approaches was 11.5% at Dec. 31, 2023 and 11.2%
at Dec. 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven
by capital generated through earnings and anet
increase in accumulated other comprehensive income,
partially offset by capital deployed through common
stock repurchases and dividends.

The Tier 1leverage ratio was 6.0% at Dec. 31, 2023,
compared with 5.8% at Dec. 31, 2022. The increase
was driven by lower average assets.

Risk-based capital ratios vary depending on the size
of the balance sheet at period end and the levels and
types of investments in assets, and leverage ratios
vary based on the average size of the balance sheet
over the quarter. The balance sheet size fluctuates
from period to period based on levels of customer and
market activity. In general, when servicing clients
are more actively trading securities, deposit balances
and the balance sheet as a whole are higher. In
addition, when markets experience significant

volatility or stress, our balance sheet size may
increase considerably as client deposit levels increase.

Our capital ratios are necessarily subject to, among
other things, anticipated compliance with all
necessary enhancements to model calibration,
approval by regulators of certain models used as part
of RWA calculations, other refinements, further
implementation guidance from regulators, market
practices and standards and any changes BNY Mellon
may make to its businesses. As a consequence of
these factors, our capital ratios may materially
change, and may be volatile over time and from
period to period.

Under the Advanced Approaches, our operational loss
risk model is informed by external losses, including
fines and penalties levied against institutions in the
financial services industry, particularly those that
relate to businesses in which we operate, and as a
result external losses have impacted and could in the

Stress capital buffer

In July 2023, the Federal Reserve announced that
BNY Mellon’s SCB requirement would remain at
2.5%, equal to the regulatory floor, for the period
from Oct. 1, 2023 through Sept. 30, 2024. The SCB
replaced the static 2.5% capital conservation buffer
for Standardized Approach capital ratios for
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review
(“CCAR”) BHCs. The SCB does not apply to bank
subsidiaries, which remain subject to the static 2.5%
capital conservation buffer. See “Supervision and
Regulation” for additional information.

The SCB final rule generally eliminates the
requirement for prior approval of common stock
repurchases in excess of the distributions in a firm’s
capital plan, provided that such distributions are
consistent with applicable capital requirements and
buffers, including the SCB.

amounts due to be paid within two years, that satisfy
certain other conditions. Debt issued prior to Dec.
31, 2016 has been permanently grandfathered to the

VaR represents akey r isk management measure and
it is important to note the inherent limitations to VaR,
which include:

• VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer

time horizons where moves may be extreme;

• VaR does not take into account the potential

• Previous moves in market risk factors may not

produce accurate predictions of all future market

In January 2023, we announced a share repurchase
program approved by our Board of Directors
providing for the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of
common shares beginning Jan. 1, 2023. This new
share repurchase plan replaced all previously
authorized share repurchase plans.

Share repurchases may be executed through open
market repurchases, in privately negotiated
transactions or by other means, including through
repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule
10b5-1 and other derivative, accelerated share
repurchase and other structured transactions. The
timing and exact amount of any common stock
repurchases will depend on various factors, including
market conditions and the common stock trading
price; the Company’s capital position, liquidity and
financial performance; alternative uses of capital; and
legal and regulatory limitations and considerations.

Trading activities and risk management

Our trading activities are focused on acting as a
market-maker for our customers, facilitating customer
trades and risk-mitigating hedging in compliance with
the Volcker Rule. The risk from market-making
activities for customers is managed by our traders and
limited in total exposure through a system of position
limits, value-at-risk (“VaR”) methodology and other
market sensitivity measures. VaR is the potential loss
in value due to adverse market movements over a
defined time horizon with a specified confidence
level. The calculation of our VaR used by
management and presented below assumes aone-day
holding period, utilizes a 99% confidence level and
incorporates non-linear product characteristics. VaR
facilitates comparisons across portfolios of different
risk characteristics. VaR also captures the

The foreign exchange component of VaR represents
instruments whose values predominantly vary with
the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or
interest rates. These instruments include, but are not
limited to, currency balances, spot and forward
transactions, currency options and other currency
derivative products.

The equity component of VaR consists of instruments
that represent an ownership interest in the form of
domestic and foreign common stock or other equity-
linked instruments. These instruments include, but
are not limited to, common stock, exchange-traded
funds, preferred stock, listed equity options (puts and
calls), OTC equity options, equity total return swaps,
equity index futures and other equity derivative
products.

The credit component of VaR represents instruments
whose values are predominantly driven by credit
spread levels, i.e., idiosyncratic default risk. These
instruments include, but are not limited to, single
issuer credit default swaps, and securities with
exposures from corporate and municipal credit
spreads.

The diversification component of VaR is the risk
reduction benefit that occurs when combining
portfolios and offsetting positions, and from the
correlated behavior of risk factor movements.

(a) Trading revenue (loss) includes realized and unrealized gains and
losses primarily related to spot and forward foreign exchange
transactions, derivatives and securities trades for our customers and
excludes any associated commissions, underwriting fees and net
interest revenue.

Trading assets include debt and equity instruments
and derivative assets, primarily foreign exchange and
interest rate contracts, not designated as hedging
instruments. Trading assets were $10.1 billion at
Dec. 31, 2023 and $9.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2022.

Trading liabilities include debt and equity instruments
and derivative liabilities, primarily foreign exchange
and interest rate contracts, not designated as hedging
instruments. Trading liabilities were $6.2 billion at
Dec. 31, 2023 and $5.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2022.

Under our fair value methodology for derivative
contracts, an initial “risk-neutral” valuation is
performed on each position assuming time-
discounting based on a AA credit curve. In addition,
we consider credit risk in arriving at the fair value of
our derivatives.

We reflect external credit ratings as well as
observable credit default swap spreads for both
ourselves and our counterparties when measuring the
fair value of our derivative positions. Accordingly,
the valuation of our derivative positions is sensitive to
the current changes in our own credit spreads, as well
as those of our counterparties.

Results of Operations (continued)

At Dec. 31, 2023, our OTC derivative assets,
including those in hedging relationships, of $2.3
billion included acredit valuation adjustment
(“CVA”) deduction of $16 million. Our OTC
derivative liabilities, including those in hedging
relationships, of $3.8 billion included adebit
valuation adjustment (“DVA”) of $4 million related
to our own credit spread. Net of hedges, the CVA
increased by $1 million and the DVA increased by $1
million in 2023, which increased other trading
revenue by less than $1 million in 2023. During
2023, no realized loss was charged off against CVA
reserves.

At Dec. 31, 2022, our OTC derivative assets,
including those in hedging relationships, of $2.9
billion included aCVA d eduction of $18 million.
Our OTC derivative liabilities, including those in
hedging relationships, of $3.0 billion included aDVA
of $6 million related to our own credit spread. Net of
hedges, the CVA increased by $4 million and the
DVA increased by $7 million in 2022, which
increased other trading revenue by $3 million in
2022. During 2022, no realized loss was charged off
against CVA reserves.

The table below summarizes our exposure, net of
collateral related to our derivative counterparties, as
determined on an internal risk management basis.
Significant changes in counterparty credit ratings
could alter the level of credit risk faced by BNY
Mellon.

Asset/liability management

Our diversified business activities include processing
securities, accepting deposits, investing in securities,
lending, raising money as needed to fund assets and
other transactions. The market risks from these
activities include interest rate risk and foreign
exchange risk. Our primary market risk is exposure
to movements in U.S. dollar interest rates and certain

foreign currency interest rates. We actively manage
interest rate sensitivity and use earnings simulation
and discounted cash flow models to identify interest
rate exposures.

An earnings simulation model is the primary tool
used to assess changes in pre-tax net interest revenue
between a baseline scenario and hypothetical interest
rate scenarios. Interest rate sensitivity is quantified
by calculating the change in pre-tax net interest
revenue between the scenarios over a12-month
measurement period.

The baseline scenario incorporates the market’s
forward rate expectations and management’s
assumptions regarding client deposit rates, credit
spreads, changes in the prepayment behavior of loans
and securities and the impact of derivative financial
instruments used for interest rate risk management
purposes as of each respective quarter-end. These
assumptions have been developed through a
combination of historical analysis and future expected
pricing behavior and are inherently uncertain. Actual
results may differ materially from projected results
due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest
rate changes, and changes in market conditions and
management’s strategies, among other factors. Client
deposit levels and mix are key assumptions impacting
net interest revenue in the baseline as well as the
hypothetical interest rate scenarios. The earnings
simulation model assumes static deposit levels and
mix, and it also assumes that no management actions
will be taken to mitigate the effects of interest rate
changes. Typically, the baseline scenario uses the
average deposit balances of the quarter.

In the table below, we use the earnings simulation
model to assess the impact of various hypothetical
interest rate scenarios compared to the baseline
scenario. In each of the scenarios, all currencies’
interest rates are instantaneously shifted higher or
lower at the start of the forecast. Long-term interest
rates are defined as all tenors equal to or greater than
three years and short-term interest rates are defined as
all tenors equal to or less than three months. Interim
term points are interpolated where applicable. The
impact of interest rate shifts may not be linear. The
results of this earnings simulation should therefore
not be extrapolated for more severe interest rate
scenarios than those presented in the table below.

(a) The sensitivity for Dec. 31, 2022 has been updated to reflect
the impact of a100 basis point decrease in long-term rates
while short-term rates were unchanged.

At Dec. 31, 2023, the impact of a 100 basis point
upward shift in rates on net interest revenue increased
compared with Sept. 30, 2023 primarily due to higher
cash and deposit balances in the most recent quarter,
which increased the benefit of rising interest rates.
The impact of a 100 basis point downward shift in
rates on net interest revenue worsened compared with
Sept. 30, 2023 primarily due higher cash and deposit
balances.

While the net interest revenue sensitivity scenario
calculations assume static deposit balances to
facilitate consistent period-over-period comparisons,
net interest revenue is impacted by changes in deposit
balances. Noninterest-bearing deposits are
particularly sensitive to changes in short-term rates.

To illustrate the net interest revenue sensitivity to
deposit run-off, we estimate that a $5 billion
instantaneous reduction or increase in U.S. dollar-
denominated noninterest-bearing deposits would
reduce or increase the net interest revenue sensitivity
results in the up 100 basis point scenario in the table
above by approximately $290 million. The impact
would be smaller if the run-off was assumed to be a
mixture of interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing
deposits.

Additionally, during periods of low short-term
interest rates, money market mutual fund fees and
other similar fees are typically waived to protect
investors from negative returns.

For adiscussion of factors impacting the growth or
contraction of deposits, see “Risk Factors –Capital
and Liquidity Risk – Our business, financial
condition and results of operations could be adversely
affected if we do not effectively manage our
liquidity.”

We also project future cash flows from our assets and
liabilities over along-term horizon and then discount
these cash flows using instantaneous parallel shocks
to prevailing interest rates. This measure reflects the
structural balance sheet interest rate sensitivity by
discounting all future cash flows. The aggregation of
these discounted cash flows is the economic value of
equity (“EVE”). The following table shows how
EVE would change in response to changes in interest
rates.

The asymmetrical accounting treatment of the impact
of a change in interest rates on our balance sheet may
create a situation in which an increase in interest rates
can adversely affect reported equity and regulatory
capital, even though economically there may be no
impact on our economic capital position. For
example, an increase in rates will result in a decline in
the value of our available-for-sale securities portfolio.
In this example, there is no corresponding change on
our fixed liabilities, even though economically these
liabilities are more valuable as rates rise.

These results do not reflect strategies that
management could employ to limit the impact as
interest rate expectations change.

To manage foreign exchange risk, we fund foreign
currency-denominated assets with liability
instruments denominated in the same currency. We
utilize various foreign exchange contracts if aliability
denominated in the same currency is not available or
desired, and to minimize the earnings impact of
translation gains or losses created by investments in
foreign markets. We use forward foreign exchange
contracts to protect the value of our net investment in
foreign operations. At Dec. 31, 2023, net investments
in foreign operations totaled $14 billion and were
spread across 19 foreign currencies.
