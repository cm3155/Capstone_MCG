Human Capital Management 

Our enduring ambition is to build the best global team&#8212;one that is inclusive of varying perspectives, backgrounds and experiences, and represents the increasingly varied markets and clients we serve. Our core objective is to empower our teams to do their best work, make unique contributions and build purposeful careers in an equitable environment where they are treated with fairness, dignity and respect. 

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 

Diversity, equity and inclusion is integral to who we are as a company, what our people experience as members of our global team, and how we serve all of our stakeholders. Our diversity, equity and inclusion strategy is not separate, but embedded in our business strategy, operating model, talent experience and client value proposition. 

To increase the diversity of our talent pool, we work with professional associations, educational institutions, think tanks and nonprofits to deepen engagement with Black, Hispanic/Latino, Asian, LGBT+, neuro-diverse individuals, people with disabilities, and talent from other underrepresented backgrounds. We aim for fair inclusion by using diverse candidate slates, creating gender-neutral job descriptions and involving diverse interview panels. We embed diversity, equity and inclusion in our talent review processes, succession plans and development objectives to improve promotion readiness and advance and retain talent from all backgrounds. 

At the most senior level, our Executive Committee sets diversity, equity and inclusion goals with specific targets to improve senior leader diversity and to increase female representation globally and diverse ethnic and/or racial representation in the U.S. Executive Committee members&#8217; variable compensation is informed by performance against these goals. 

At the end of 2022, women were 40% of BNY Mellon&#8217;s global workforce and 43% of BNY Mellon&#8217;s U.S. workforce. Further, 38% of BNY Mellon&#8217;s U.S. workforce were from U.S. underrepresented ethnic and/or racial backgrounds. 

At the end of 2022, 35% of BNY Mellon&#8217;s Executive Committee were women and 20% of BNY Mellon&#8217;s 

Executive Committee were from underrepresented ethnic and/or racial backgrounds. 

Our Board of Directors is committed to fostering and maintaining its diversity. At the end of 2022, 36% of our Board of Directors were women and 36% of our Board of Directors was composed of individuals from underrepresented ethnic and/or racial backgrounds. In addition, four of BNY Mellon&#8217;s six standing committees of its Board of Directors are chaired by a diverse director based on race or gender. 

Retention, Training and Development 

We seek to attract and retain employees by providing a rewarding employee experience. We recognize that employees seek a supportive, safe and inclusive workplace, and we continually evaluate our employee engagement and wellbeing programs in an effort to meet those expectations. We offer a 401(k) plan for U.S. employees, and other defined contribution retirement plans worldwide, where consistent with market practice. We also maintain defined benefit plans for certain current and former employees, some of which are frozen (including in the U.S.). At Dec. 31, 2022, we had approximately 43,700 participants in our 401(k) plan, including former employees. In addition, our frozen U.S. defined benefit pension plan covered approximately 8,100 U.S. participants and our non-U.S. defined benefit plans (some frozen) covered approximately 15,700 non-U.S. participants. 

In December 2022, BNY Mellon announced that it would provide eligible employees an award of 10 restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;) on Feb. 13, 2023. This equity grant will allow eligible employees to become equity owners and share in the Company&#8217;s success. 

At key career transition points, from internship to executive management, we offer programs and development opportunities to help employees advance their careers and progress within our organization. Our extensive training and development opportunities are designed to enable employees to grow professionally and advance within our organization. 

We engage with employees to encourage innovation, show appreciation for their contributions, and gather feedback on how we can build a more rewarding, inclusive workplace. For example, we regularly gather feedback through an all-employee survey.

Employee Wellbeing, Health and Safety 

BNY Mellon&#8217;s holistic approach to employee wellbeing is designed to create a healthy, resilient and vibrant workforce. Our programs are designed to provide employees easy access to resources to help improve their physical health, emotional resilience, financial wellbeing and social connections. Further, we work to ensure the safety of our employees and clients in all of our facilities. 

During the coronavirus pandemic, we quickly transitioned the vast majority of our employees to working from home. We found new ways of working and collaborating to deliver on our commitments to clients and each other. Beginning in 2022, we transitioned to a new model which fosters flexibility. We endeavor to promote a collaborative and effective workplace for our people, while continuing to embrace the concept of flexibility and enhancing our culture and commercial impact. 

Employees and International Operations 

Globally, at Dec. 31, 2022, BNY Mellon and its subsidiaries had approximately 51,700 full-time employees.

Competition 

BNY Mellon is subject to competition in all aspects and areas of our business. Our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services businesses compete with domestic and international financial services firms that offer custody services, corporate trust 

services, clearing services, collateral management services, credit services, securities brokerage, foreign exchange services, derivatives, depositary receipt services and integrated cash management solutions and related products, as well as a wide range of technology service providers, such as financial services data processing firms. Our Investment and Wealth Management business competes with domestic and international investment management and wealth management firms, hedge funds, investment banking companies and other financial services companies, including trust banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies, as well as a wide range of technology service providers. 

Competition in the financial services industry continues to be intense. Competition is based on a number of factors including, among others, customer service and convenience, transaction execution, capital or access to capital, quality and range of products and services offered, performance, technological innovation and expertise, price, reputation and lending limits. Competition also varies based on the types of clients, customers, industries and geographies served. Our ability to continue to compete effectively also depends in large part on our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees, while managing compensation and other costs. Our competitive position may be affected by institutions that are not similarly subject to extensive regulation, and as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services. 

For additional discussion regarding competition, see &#8220;MD&#38;A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Strategic Risk &#8211; We are subject to competition in all aspects of our business, which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability&#8221; and &#8220;MD&#38;A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Operational Risk &#8211; Our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate employees&#8221; in the Annual Report, which are incorporated herein by reference.
