Key first quarter 2023 events

Leadership succession

Dermot McDonogh joined BNY Mellon on Nov. 1, 2022,
and, effective Feb. 1, 2023, succeeded Emily Portney as
the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”). Ms. Portney served
as the CFO since July 19, 2020, and has assumed a new
position leading the Company’s Asset Servicing business.

Highlights of first quarter 2023 results

Net income applicable to common shareholders was $905
million, or $1.12 per diluted common share, in the first
quarter of 2023, compared with $699 million, or $0.86 per
diluted common share, in the first quarter of 2022.

The highlights below are based on the first quarter of 2023
compared with the first quarter of 2022, unless otherwise
noted.

• Total revenue of $4.4 billion increased 11%, primarily

reflecting:

• Fee revenue was flat, primarily reflecting the

abatement of money market fee waivers and the $88
million reduction primarily due to accelerated
amortization of deferred costs for

depositary receipts services related to Russia
recorded in the first quarter of 2022, offset by lower
market values, the unfavorable impact of a stronger
U.S. dollar and the impact of the Alcentra
divestiture. (See “Fee and other revenue” beginning
on page 6.)

• Net interest revenue increased 62%, primarily

reflecting higher interest rates on interest-earning
assets, partially offset by higher funding expense.
(See “Net interest revenue” on page 9.)

• Provision for credit losses was $27 million, reflecting

changes in the macroeconomic forecast. (See
“Consolidated balance sheet review – Allowance for
credit losses” beginning on page 27.)

• Noninterest expense increased 3%, primarily reflecting
higher investments and revenue-related expenses, as
well as the impact of inflation, partially offset by the
favorable impact of efficiency savings, a stronger U.S.
dollar and the impact of the Alcentra divestiture. (See
“Noninterest expense” on page 11.)

• Effective tax rate of 21.0%. (See “Income taxes” on

page 11.)

• Return on common equity (“ROE”) was 10.3% for the

first quarter of 2023.

• Return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) was
20.2% (Non-GAAP) for the first quarter of 2023.

See “Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP
and Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on page 41
for a reconciliation of the Non-GAAP measure.

Metrics

• AUC/A of $46.6 trillion increased 2%, primarily

reflecting client inflows and net new business, partially
offset by lower market values and the unfavorable
impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.

• AUM of $1.9 trillion decreased 16%, primarily

reflecting lower market values, the unfavorable impact
of a stronger U.S. dollar and the divestiture of Alcentra,
partially offset by net inflows.

Capital and liquidity

• Our CET1 ratio calculated under the Advanced
Approaches was 11.0% at March 31, 2023 and

Fee and other revenue

11.2% at Dec. 31, 2022. The decrease primarily reflects
capital deployed through common stock repurchases
and common dividends and higher risk-weighted assets
(“RWAs”), partially offset by capital generated through
earnings and unrealized gains in the first quarter on
securities available-for-sale. (See “Capital” beginning
on page 33.)

• Tier 1 leverage was 5.8% at March 31, 2023 and Dec.
31, 2022 as a slight decrease in capital was offset by a
decrease in average assets. (See “Capital” beginning on
page 33.)

• Returned $1.6 billion to common shareholders,

including $1.3 billion of common share repurchases.

Highlights of our principal business segments

Securities Services

• Total revenue increased 19% and was impacted by the

accelerated amortization of deferred costs for depositary
receipts services related to Russia recorded in the first
quarter of 2022.
Income before income taxes increased 100% and was
impacted by the first quarter 2022 adjustment to
revenue related to Russia.

•

• Pre-tax operating margin of 26%.

Market and Wealth Services
• Total revenue increased 22%.

Income before income taxes increased 41%.

•
• Pre-tax operating margin of 48%.

Investment and Wealth Management

• Total revenue decreased 14%.
•

Income before income taxes decreased 56%.

• Pre-tax operating margin of 11%; adjusted pre-tax

and Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on page 41
for a reconciliation of the Non-GAAP measure. See

Fee revenue was flat compared with the first quarter of
2022 and decreased 2% compared with the fourth quarter
of 2022. Compared with the first quarter of 2022, higher
investment services fees were offset by lower investment
management and performance fees and foreign exchange
revenue. The decrease compared with the fourth quarter of
2022 primarily reflects lower investment services fees and
foreign exchange revenue.

Investment and other revenue increased $9 million
compared with the first quarter of 2022 and $439 million
compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase
compared with the first quarter of 2022 primarily reflects
higher other trading revenue and improved seed capital
results, partially offset by strategic equity investment gains
recorded in the first quarter of 2022. The increase
compared with the fourth quarter of 2022 primarily reflects
the net loss of $449 million related to repositioning the
securities portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2022.

Investment services fees

Investment services fees increased 6% compared with the
first quarter of 2022 and decreased 2% compared with the
fourth quarter of 2022. The increase compared with the
first quarter of 2022 primarily reflects the abatement of
money market fee waivers and the accelerated amortization
of deferred costs for depositary receipts services related to
Russia recorded

6 BNY Mellon

in the first quarter of 2022, partially offset by lower market
values. The decrease compared with the fourth quarter of
2022 primarily reflects lower Depositary Receipts revenue
and client activity, partially offset by higher market values.

AUC/A totaled $46.6 trillion at March 31, 2023, an
increase of 2% compared with March 31, 2022, primarily
reflecting client inflows and net new business, partially
offset by lower market values and the unfavorable impact
of a stronger U.S. dollar. AUC/A consisted of 33% equity
securities and 67% fixed income securities at March 31,
2023, and 36% equity securities and 64% fixed income
securities at March 31, 2022.

See “Securities Services business segment” and “Market
and Wealth Services business segment” in “Review of
business segments” for additional details.

Investment management and performance fees

Investment management and performance fees decreased
12% compared with the first quarter of 2022 and 1%
compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease
compared with the first quarter of 2022 primarily reflects
lower market values, the mix of cumulative net inflows,
the impact of the Alcentra divestiture and the unfavorable
impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by the
abatement of money market fee waivers. The decrease

compared with the fourth quarter of 2022 primarily reflects
the impact of the Alcentra divestiture and lower
performance fees, partially offset by higher market values.
Performance fees were $22 million in the first quarter of
2023, $34 million in the first quarter of 2022 and $26
million in the fourth quarter of 2022. On a constant
currency basis (Non-GAAP), investment management and
performance fees decreased 9% compared with the first
quarter of 2022. See “Supplemental information –
Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures”
beginning on page 41 for the reconciliation of Non-GAAP
measures.

AUM was $1.9 trillion at March 31, 2023, a decrease of
16% compared with March 31, 2022, primarily reflecting
lower market values, the unfavorable impact of a stronger
U.S. dollar and the divestiture of Alcentra, partially offset
by net inflows.

See “Investment and Wealth Management business
segment” in “Review of business segments” for additional
details regarding the drivers of investment management
and performance fees, AUM and AUM flows.

Foreign exchange revenue

Foreign exchange revenue is primarily driven by the
volume of client transactions and the spread realized on
these transactions, both of which are impacted by market
volatility, the impact of foreign currency hedging activities
and foreign currency remeasurement gain (loss). Foreign
exchange revenue decreased 15% compared with the first
quarter of 2022 and 7% compared with the fourth quarter
of 2022. The decrease compared with the first quarter of
2022 primarily reflects lower volumes, partially offset by
higher volatility. The decrease compared with the fourth
quarter of 2022 primarily reflects lower volatility. Foreign
exchange revenue is primarily reported in the Securities
Services business segment and, to a lesser extent, in the
Market and Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth
Management business segments and the Other segment.

Financing-related fees

Financing-related fees, which are primarily reported in the
Market and Wealth Services and Securities Services
business segments, include capital market fees, loan
commitment fees and credit-related fees. Financing-related
fees increased 16% compared with the first quarter of 2022
and 21% compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. The
increase compared with the first quarter of 2022 primarily
reflects higher loan commitment fees. The increase
compared with the fourth quarter of 2022 primarily reflects
higher capital markets fees, including underwriting fees.

Investment and other revenue

Investment and other revenue includes income or loss from
consolidated investment management funds, seed capital
gains or losses, other trading revenue or loss, renewable
energy investments losses, income from corporate and
bank-owned life insurance contracts, other investment
gains or losses, gains or losses from disposals, expense
reimbursements from our CIBC Mellon joint venture, other
income or loss and net securities gains or losses. The
income or loss from consolidated investment management
funds should be considered together with the net income or
loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, which reflects
the portion of the consolidated funds for which we do not
have an economic interest and is reflected below net
income as a separate line item on the consolidated income
statement. Other trading revenue or loss primarily includes
the impact of market-risk hedging activity related to our
seed capital investments in investment management funds,
non-foreign currency derivative and fixed income trading,
and other hedging activity. Investments in renewable
energy generate losses in investment and other revenue that
are more than offset by benefits and credits recorded to the
provision for income taxes. Other investment gains or
losses includes fair value changes of non-readily
marketable strategic equity, private equity and other
investments. Expense reimbursements from our CIBC
Mellon joint venture relate to expenses incurred by BNY
Mellon on behalf of the CIBC Mellon joint venture. Other
income includes various miscellaneous revenues.

results, partially offset by strategic equity investment gains
recorded in the first quarter of 2022. The increase
compared with the fourth quarter of 2022 primarily reflects
the net loss from repositioning the securities portfolio

(a)    Net interest revenue (FTE) – Non-GAAP and net interest margin (FTE) – Non-GAAP include the tax equivalent adjustments on tax-exempt income,

which allows for comparisons of amounts arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practice. The adjustment to
an FTE basis has no impact on net income.

N/M – Not meaningful.
bps – basis points.

Net interest revenue increased 62% compared with the first
quarter of 2022 and 7% compared with the fourth quarter
of 2022. The increases compared with both the first quarter
of 2022 and fourth quarter of 2022 primarily reflect higher
interest rates on interest-earning assets, partially offset by
higher funding expense.

Net interest margin increased 54 basis points compared
with the first quarter of 2022 and 10 basis points compared
with the fourth quarter of 2022. The changes compared
with the first quarter of 2022 and the fourth quarter of 2022
primarily reflect the factors mentioned above.

Average interest-earning assets decreased 7% compared
with the first quarter of 2022 and 1% compared with the
fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease compared with the
first quarter of 2022 primarily reflects lower securities,
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and
other central banks and loan balances. The decrease
compared with the fourth quarter of 2022 primarily reflects
lower loan balances.

Average non-U.S. dollar deposits comprised approximately
25% of our average total deposits in the first quarter of
2023. Approximately 45% of the average non-U.S. dollar
deposits in the first quarter of 2023 were euro-
denominated.

(a)    Includes the average impact of offsetting under enforceable netting agreements of approximately $62 billion for the first quarter of 2023, $51 billion for the fourth quarter

of 2022 and $53 billion for the first quarter of 2022. On a Non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of offsetting, the yield on federal funds sold and securities purchased
under resale agreements would have been 4.62% for the first quarter of 2023, 3.76% for the fourth quarter of 2022 and 0.19% for the first quarter of 2022. On a Non-

GAAP basis, excluding the impact of offsetting, the rate on federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements would have been 4.49% for the first

quarter of 2023, 3.63% for the fourth quarter of 2022 and 0.07% for the first quarter of 2022. We believe providing the rates excluding the impact of netting is useful to

investors as it is more reflective of the actual rates earned and paid.

(b)    Average rates were calculated on an FTE basis, at tax rates of approximately 21%.

Total noninterest expense increased 3% compared with the
first quarter of 2022 and decreased 4% compared with the
fourth quarter of 2022. The increase compared with the
first quarter of 2022 primarily reflects higher investments
and revenue-related expenses, as well as the impact of
inflation, partially offset by the favorable impact of
efficiency savings, a stronger U.S. dollar and the impact of
the Alcentra divestiture. The investments, net of savings,
are primarily included in staff, software and equipment,
and professional, legal and other purchased services
expenses. The decrease compared with the fourth quarter
of 2022 primarily reflects lower severance and litigation
expenses, partially offset by higher staff expense primarily
driven by the annual vesting of stock-based awards to
retirement-eligible employees.

Income taxes

BNY Mellon recorded an income tax provision of $260
million (21.0% effective tax rate) in the first quarter of
2023. The income tax provision was $153 million (16.7%
effective tax rate) in the first quarter of 2022 and $142
million (20.7% effective tax rate) in the fourth quarter of
2022. For additional information, see Note 11 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.

third quarter, volume-related fees may decline due to
reduced client activity. In the fourth quarter, we typically
incur higher business development and marketing
expenses. In our Investment and Wealth Management
business segment, performance fees are typically higher in
the fourth and first quarters, as those quarters represent the
end of the measurement period for many of the
performance fee-eligible relationships.

The results of our business segments may also be impacted
by the translation of financial results denominated in
foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. We are primarily
impacted by activities denominated in the British pound
and the euro. On a consolidated basis and in our Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services business
segments, we typically have more foreign currency-
denominated expenses than revenues. However, our
Investment and Wealth Management business segment
typically has more foreign currency-denominated revenues
than expenses. Overall, currency fluctuations impact the
year-over-year growth rate in the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment more than the Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services business
segments. However, currency fluctuations, in isolation, are
not expected to significantly impact net income on a
consolidated basis.

Fee revenue in the Investment and Wealth Management
business segment, and, to a lesser extent, the Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services business
segments, is impacted by global market fluctuations. At
March 31, 2023, we estimated that a 5% change in global
equity markets, spread evenly throughout the year, would
impact fee revenue by less than 1% and diluted earnings
per common share by $0.04 to $0.07.

See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for the consolidating schedules, which show the
contribution of our business segments to our overall
profitability.

Review of business segments

We have an internal information system that produces
performance data along product and service lines for our
three principal business segments: Securities Services,
Market and Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth
Management, and the Other segment.

Business segment accounting principles

Our business segment data has been determined on an
internal management basis of accounting, rather than the
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) used
for consolidated financial reporting. These measurement
principles are designed so that reported results of the
businesses will track their economic performance.

For information on the accounting principles of our
business segments, see Note 19 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. For information on the
primary products and services in each line of business, the
primary types of revenue by line of business and how our
business segments are presented and analyzed, see Note 24
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our
2022 Annual Report.

Business segment results are subject to reclassification
when organizational changes are made, or for refinements
in revenue and expense allocation methodologies.
Refinements are typically reflected on a prospective basis.
There were no reclassification or organizational changes in
the first quarter of 2023.

The results of our business segments may be influenced by
client and other activities that vary by quarter. In the first
quarter, staff expense typically increases, reflecting the
vesting of long-term stock awards for retirement-eligible
employees. In the second quarter, staff expense typically
increases, reflecting the annual employee merit increase. In

Business segment description

The Securities Services business segment consists of two
distinct lines of business, Asset Servicing and Issuer
Services, which provide business solutions across the
transaction life cycle to our global asset owner and asset
manager clients. We are one of the leading global
investment services providers with $32.6 trillion of AUC/A
at March 31, 2023. For information on the drivers of the
Securities Services fee revenue, see Note 10 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2022 Annual
Report.

The Asset Servicing business provides a comprehensive
suite of solutions. We are one of the largest global custody
and front-to-back outsourcing partners. We offer services
for the safekeeping of assets in capital markets globally, as
well as fund accounting services, exchange-traded funds
servicing, transfer agency, trust and depository, front-to-
back capabilities and data and analytics solutions for our
clients. We deliver foreign exchange, and securities lending
and financing solutions, on both an agency and principal
basis. Our agency securities lending program is one of the
largest lenders of U.S. and non-

revenue and the abatement of money market fee waivers,
partially offset by lower market values, the unfavorable
impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and lower foreign
exchange revenue. The decrease compared with the
fourth quarter of 2022 primarily reflects lower foreign
exchange revenue and client activity, partially offset by
higher net interest revenue and market values.

Issuer Services revenue of $452 million increased 69%
compared with the first quarter of 2022 and decreased
8% compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. The
increase compared with the first quarter of 2022
primarily reflects the accelerated amortization of
deferred costs for depositary receipts services related to
Russia recorded in the first quarter of 2022, higher net
interest revenue and the abatement of money market fee
waivers. The decrease compared with the fourth quarter
of 2022 primarily reflects lower Depositary Receipts
revenue.

Market and regulatory trends are driving investable
assets toward lower fee asset management products at
reduced margins for our clients. These dynamics are also
negatively impacting our investment services fees.
However, at the same time, these trends are providing
additional outsourcing opportunities as clients and other
market participants seek to comply with regulations and
reduce their operating costs.

Noninterest expense of $1.6 billion increased 3%
compared with the first quarter of 2022 and decreased
1% compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. The
increase compared with the first quarter of 2022
primarily reflects higher investments, as well as the
impact of inflation, partially offset by the favorable
impact of efficiency savings and a stronger U.S. dollar.
The decrease compared with the fourth quarter of 2022
primarily reflects lower severance expense and litigation
reserves.

U.S. securities, servicing a lendable asset pool of
approximately $4.6 trillion in 34 separate markets. Our
market-leading liquidity services portal enables cash
investments for institutional clients and includes fund
research and analytics.

The Issuer Services business includes Corporate Trust
and Depositary Receipts. Our Corporate Trust business
delivers a full range of issuer and related investor
services, including trustee, paying agency, fiduciary,
escrow and other financial services. We are a leading
provider to the debt capital markets, providing
customized and market-driven solutions to investors,
bondholders and lenders. Our Depositary Receipts
business drives global investing by providing servicing
and value-added solutions that enable, facilitate and
enhance cross-border trading, clearing, settlement and
ownership. We are one of the largest providers of
depositary receipts services in the world, partnering with
leading companies from more than 50 countries.

Review of financial results

AUC/A of $32.6 trillion decreased 3% compared with
March 31, 2022, primarily reflecting lower market values
and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar,
partially offset by client inflows and net new business.

Total revenue of $2.1 billion increased 19% compared
with the first quarter of 2022 and decreased 3%
compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. The drivers of
total revenue by line of business are indicated below.

Asset Servicing revenue of $1.7 billion increased 10%
compared with the first quarter of 2022 and decreased
1% compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. The

primarily reflects higher net interest

Business segment description

Our Investment and Wealth Management business segment
consists of two distinct lines of business, Investment
Management and Wealth Management. Our investment
firms deliver a highly diversified portfolio of investment
strategies independently, and through our global
distribution network, to institutional and retail clients
globally. BNY Mellon Wealth Management provides
investment management, custody, wealth and estate
planning, private banking services, investment servicing
and information management. See pages 19 and 20 of our
2022 Annual Report for additional information on our
Investment and Wealth Management business segment.

Review of financial results

AUM decreased 16% compared with March 31, 2022,
primarily reflecting lower market values, the

unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and the
divestiture of Alcentra, partially offset by net inflows.

Net long-term strategy inflows were $5 billion in the first
quarter of 2023, driven by inflows of liability-driven
investments and fixed income, partially offset by outflows
of equity and multi-asset and alternative investments.
Market and regulatory trends have resulted in increased
demand for lower fee asset management products and for
performance-based fees.

Total revenue of $827 million decreased 14% compared
with the first quarter of 2022 and was flat compared with
the fourth quarter of 2022. The drivers of total revenue by
line of business are indicated below.

Investment Management revenue of $557 million
decreased 15% compared with the first quarter of 2022 and
increased 1% compared with the fourth quarter of 2022.
The decrease compared with the

18 BNY Mellon

first quarter of 2022 primarily reflects the impact of the
Alcentra divestiture, the mix of cumulative net inflows,
lower market values and the unfavorable impact of a
stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by the abatement of
money market fee waivers. The increase compared with the
fourth quarter of 2022 primarily reflects higher market
values.

Wealth Management revenue of $270 million decreased
12% compared with the first quarter of 2022 and 2%
compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease
compared with the first quarter of 2022 primarily reflects
lower market values and changes in product mix.

Revenue generated in the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment included 31% from

non-U.S. sources in the first quarter of 2023, compared
with 39% in the first quarter of 2022 and 34% in the fourth
quarter of 2022.

Noninterest expense of $734 million decreased 3%
compared with the first quarter of 2022 and increased 5%
compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease
compared with the first quarter of 2022 primarily reflects
the impact of the Alcentra divestiture and the favorable
impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by higher
revenue-related expenses. The increase compared with the
fourth quarter of 2022 primarily reflects higher staff
expense driven by the annual vesting of stock-based
awards to retirement-eligible employees.

Review of financial results

Total revenue includes corporate treasury and other
investment activity, including hedging activity, which has
an offsetting impact between fee and other revenue and net
interest expense.

Total revenue decreased $35 million compared with the
first quarter of 2022 and increased $431 million compared
with the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase compared
with the fourth quarter of 2022 primarily reflects the $449
million net loss from repositioning the securities portfolio
in the fourth quarter of 2022.

The provision for credit losses was $27 million in the first
quarter of 2023, reflecting changes in the macroeconomic
forecast.

Noninterest expense increased $8 million compared with
the first quarter of 2022 and decreased $112 million
compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease
compared with the fourth quarter of 2022 primarily reflects
lower severance expense.

Critical accounting estimates

Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our
2022 Annual Report. Our critical accounting estimates are
those related to the allowance for credit losses, goodwill
and other intangibles and litigation and regulatory
contingencies, as referenced below.

Allowance for credit losses

Goodwill and other

2022 Annual Report, pages 25-27.
Also see below.

Litigation and regulatory
contingencies

“Legal proceedings” in Note 18 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Goodwill and other intangibles

BNY Mellon’s business segments include six reporting
units for which goodwill impairment testing is performed
on an annual basis. An interim test is performed when
events or circumstances occur that may indicate that it is
more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting
unit may be less than its carrying value.

In the first quarter of 2023, due to the results of the fourth
quarter 2022 interim impairment test and macroeconomic
conditions, we performed an interim goodwill impairment
test of the Investment Management reporting unit, which
had $6.0 billion of allocated goodwill. The fair value of the
Investment Management reporting unit exceeded its
carrying value by approximately 1%. We determined the
fair value of the Investment Management reporting unit
using an income approach based on management’s
projections as of March 31, 2023. The discount rate applied
to these cash flows was 10.5%.

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is subject to
uncertainty as it is reliant on estimates of cash flows that
extend far into the future, and, by their nature, are difficult
to estimate over such an extended time frame. In the future,
changes in the assumptions or the discount rate could
produce a material non-cash goodwill impairment.

As of March 31, 2023, if the discount rate applied to the
estimated cash flows was increased or decreased by 25
basis points, the fair value of the Investment Management
reporting unit would decrease or increase by 4%,
respectively. Similarly, if the long-term growth rate was
increased or decreased by 10 basis points, the fair value of
the Investment Management reporting unit would increase
or decrease by approximately 1%, respectively.

Consolidated balance sheet review

One of our key risk management objectives is to maintain a
balance sheet that remains strong throughout market cycles
to meet the expectations of our major stakeholders,
including our shareholders, clients, creditors and
regulators.

We also seek to undertake overall liquidity risk, including
intraday liquidity risk, that stays within our risk appetite.
The objective of our balance sheet management strategy is
to maintain a balance sheet that is characterized by strong
liquidity and asset quality, ready access to external funding
sources at competitive rates and a strong capital structure
that supports our risk-taking activities and is adequate to
absorb potential losses. In managing the balance sheet,
appropriate consideration is given to balancing the
competing needs of maintaining sufficient levels of
liquidity and complying with applicable regulations and
supervisory expectations while optimizing profitability.

At March 31, 2023, total assets were $425 billion,
compared with $406 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. The increase
in total assets was primarily driven by higher interest-
bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central
banks, partially offset by lower securities and loans.
Deposits totaled $281 billion at March 31, 2023, compared
with $279 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. The increase reflects
higher interest-bearing deposits in U.S. offices, partially
offset by lower non-interest bearing (principally in U.S.
offices) and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices.
Total interest-bearing deposits as a percentage of total
interest-earning assets was 58% at March 31, 2023 and
Dec. 31, 2022.

At March 31, 2023, available funds totaled $165 billion
and included cash and due from banks, interest-bearing
deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks,
interest-bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold
and securities purchased under resale agreements. This
compares with available funds of $138 billion at Dec. 31,
2022. Total available funds as a percentage of total assets
was 39% at March 31, 2023 and 34% at Dec. 31, 2022. For
additional information on our available funds, see
“Liquidity and dividends.”

Securities were $139 billion, or 33% of total assets, at
March 31, 2023, compared with $143 billion, or 35% of
total assets, at Dec. 31, 2022. The decrease

primarily reflects lower U.S. Treasury securities, partially
offset by unrealized pre-tax gains in the first quarter and
higher U.S. government agencies and collateralized loan
obligation (“CLOs”) securities. For additional information
on our securities portfolio, see “Securities” and Note 4 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Loans were $62 billion, or 15% of total assets, at March
31, 2023, compared with $66 billion, or 16% of total
assets, at Dec. 31, 2022. The decrease was driven by lower
overdrafts, margin loans and loans in the financial
institutions portfolio, partially offset by higher other
residential mortgages. For additional information on our
loan portfolio, see “Loans” and Note 5 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Long-term debt totaled $30 billion at March 31, 2023 and
Dec. 31, 2022. Issuances and an increase in the fair value
of hedged long-term debt were offset by maturities. For
additional information on long-term debt, see “Liquidity
and dividends.”

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total
shareholders’ equity totaled $41 billion at March 31, 2023
and Dec. 31, 2022. For additional information, see
“Capital.”

Country risk exposure

The following table presents BNY Mellon’s top 10
exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of March 31,
2023, as well as certain countries with higher risk profiles.
The exposure is presented on an internal risk management
basis and has not been reduced by the allowance for credit
losses. We monitor our exposure to these and other
countries as part of our internal country risk management
process.

The country risk exposure below reflects the Company’s
risk to an immediate default of the counterparty or obligor
based on the country of residence of the entity which
incurs the liability. If there is credit risk mitigation, the
country of residence of the entity providing the risk
mitigation is the country of risk. The country of risk for
securities is generally based on the domicile of the issuer
of the security.

BNY Mellon 21

Events in recent years have resulted in increased focus on
Brazil. The country risk exposure to Brazil is primarily
short-term trade finance loans extended to large financial
institutions. We also have operations in Brazil providing
investment services and investment management services.

The war in Ukraine has increased our focus on Russia. The
country risk exposure to Russia consists of cash balances
related to our securities services businesses and may
increase in the future to the extent cash is received for the
benefit of our clients that is subject to distribution
restrictions. BNY Mellon has ceased new banking business
in Russia and suspended investment management
purchases of Russian securities. At March 31, 2023, less
than

0.1% of our AUC/A and less than 0.01% of our AUM
consisted of Russian securities. We will continue to work
with multinational clients that depend on our custody and
recordkeeping services to manage their exposures.

Securities

In the discussion of our securities portfolio, we have
included certain credit ratings information because the
information can indicate the degree of credit risk to which
we are exposed. Significant changes in ratings
classifications could indicate increased credit risk for us
and could be accompanied by an increase in the allowance
for credit losses and/or a reduction in the fair value of our
securities portfolio.

(h)    At March 31, 2023, includes net unrealized losses of $2,776 million related to available-for-sale securities, net of hedges, and $5,494 million related to held-to-maturity securities.

The after-tax unrealized losses, net of hedges, related to available-for-sale securities is $2,094 million and the after-tax equivalent related to held-to-maturity securities is $4,189

million.

The fair value of our securities portfolio, including related
hedges, was $135.2 billion at March 31, 2023, compared
with $139.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. The decrease
primarily reflects lower U.S. Treasury securities, partially
offset by unrealized pre-tax gains in the first quarter and
higher U.S. government agencies and CLO securities. At
March 31, 2023, the

securities portfolio had a net unrealized loss, including the
impact of related hedges, of $8.3 billion, compared with a
net unrealized loss, including the impact of related hedges,
of $9.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. The decrease in the net
unrealized loss, including the impact of hedges, was
primarily driven by lower market interest rates.

22 BNY Mellon

The fair value of the available-for-sale securities totaled
$86.1 billion at March 31, 2023, net of hedges, or 64% of
the securities portfolio, net of hedges. The fair value of the
held-to-maturity securities totaled $49.1 billion at March
31, 2023, or 36% of the securities portfolio, net of hedges.

See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for the pre-tax net securities gains (losses) by
security type. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for securities by level in the fair value
hierarchy.

The unrealized loss (after-tax) on our available-for-sale
securities portfolio, net of hedges, included in accumulated
other comprehensive income was $2.1 billion at March 31,
2023, compared with $2.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. The
decrease in the unrealized loss, net of tax, was primarily
driven by lower market interest rates.

At March 31, 2023, 99% of the securities in our portfolio
were rated AAA/AA-, unchanged compared with Dec. 31,
2022.

Our financial institutions and commercial portfolios
comprise our largest concentrated risk. These portfolios
comprised 48% of our total exposure at March 31, 2023

The financial institutions portfolio exposure was $40.7
billion at March 31, 2023, a decrease of 2% compared with
Dec. 31, 2022, primarily reflecting lower exposure in the
securities industry portfolio.

Financial institution exposures are high quality, with 95%
of the exposures meeting the investment grade equivalent
criteria of our internal credit rating classification at March
31, 2023. Each customer is assigned an internal credit
rating, which is mapped to an equivalent external rating
agency grade based upon a number of dimensions, which
are continually evaluated and may change over time. For
ratings of non-U.S. counterparties, our internal credit rating
is generally capped at a rating equivalent to the sovereign
rating of the country where the counterparty resides,
regardless of the internal credit rating assigned to the
counterparty or the underlying collateral.

The exposure to financial institutions is generally short
term, with 84% of the exposures expiring within one year.
At March 31, 2023, 19% of the exposure to financial
institutions had an expiration within 90 days, compared
with 17% at Dec. 31, 2022.

In addition, 64% of the financial institutions exposure is
secured. For example, securities industry clients

and asset managers often borrow against marketable
securities held in custody.

At March 31, 2023, the secured intraday credit provided to
dealers in connection with their tri-party repo activity
totaled $16.1 billion and was included in the securities
industry portfolio. Dealers secure the outstanding intraday
credit with high-quality liquid collateral having a market
value in excess of the amount of the outstanding credit.
Secured intraday credit facilities represent approximately
40% of the exposure in the financial institutions portfolio
and are reviewed and reapproved annually.

The asset managers portfolio exposure is high quality, with
99% of the exposures meeting our investment grade
equivalent ratings criteria as of March 31, 2023. These
exposures are generally short-term liquidity facilities, with
the majority to regulated mutual funds.

Our banks portfolio exposure primarily relates to our
global trade finance. These exposures are short term in
nature, with 98% due in less than one year. The investment
grade percentage of our banks portfolio exposure was 86%
at March 31, 2023 and Dec. 31, 2022. Our non-investment
grade exposures are primarily trade finance loans in Brazil.

producing commercial real estate facilities are focused on
experienced owners and are structured with moderate
leverage based on existing cash flows. Our commercial
real estate lending activities also include construction and
renovation facilities. Our client base consists of
experienced developers and long-term holders of real
estate assets. Loans are approved on the basis of existing or
projected cash flows and supported by appraisals and
knowledge of local market conditions. Development loans
are structured with moderate leverage and, in many
instances, involve some level of recourse to the developer.

At March 31, 2023, the unsecured portfolio consisted of
real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) and real estate
operating companies, which are both primarily investment

(a)    The allowance allocated to margin loans and overdrafts was insignificant at March 31, 2023, Dec. 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022.

The allocation of the allowance for credit losses is
inherently judgmental, and the entire allowance for credit
losses is available to absorb credit losses regardless of the
nature of the losses.

Our allowance for credit losses is sensitive to a number of
inputs, most notably the credit ratings assigned to each
borrower, as well as macroeconomic forecast assumptions
that are incorporated into our estimate of credit losses
through the expected life of the loan portfolio. Thus, as the
macroeconomic environment and related forecasts change,
the allowance for credit losses may change materially. The
following sensitivity analyses do not represent
management’s expectations of the deterioration of our
portfolios or the economic environment, but are provided
as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the
allowance for credit losses to changes in key inputs. If
commercial real estate property values were increased 10%
and all other credits were rated one grade better, the
quantitative allowance would have decreased by
$39 million, and if commercial real estate property values
were decreased 10% and all other credits were rated one
grade worse, the quantitative allowance would have
increased by $78 million. Our multi-scenario-based
macroeconomic forecast used in determining the March 31,
2023 allowance for credit losses consisted of three
scenarios. The baseline scenario reflects slow GDP growth
through the fourth quarter of 2023 before moderating,
slightly rising unemployment and moderating growth in
commercial real estate prices through the end of 2023. The
upside scenario reflects faster GDP growth, slightly
declining unemployment and higher commercial real estate
prices compared with the baseline. The downside scenario
contemplates negative GDP growth through the fourth
quarter of 2023 with subsequent stabilization as well as
increasing unemployment through mid-2024 and lower
commercial real estate prices

28 BNY Mellon

than the baseline. In the first quarter of 2023, we placed the
most weight on our downside scenario, followed by the
baseline scenario, with the remaining weighting placed on
the upside scenario. From a sensitivity perspective, at
March 31, 2023, if we had applied 100% weighting to the
downside scenario, the allowance for credit losses would
have been approximately $67 million higher.

Deposits

Total deposits were $281.3 billion at March 31, 2023, an
increase of 1%, compared with $279.0 billion at Dec. 31,
2022. The increase reflects higher interest-bearing deposits
in U.S. offices, partially offset by lower noninterest-
bearing (principally in U.S. offices) and interest-bearing
deposits in non-U.S. offices.

Noninterest-bearing deposits were $70.3 billion at March
31, 2023, compared with $78.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2022.
Interest-bearing deposits were primarily demand deposits
and totaled $211.0 billion at March 31, 2023, compared
with $201.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2022.

Short-term borrowings

We fund ourselves primarily through deposits and, to a
lesser extent, other short-term borrowings and long-term
debt. Short-term borrowings consist of federal funds
purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, payables to customers and broker-dealers,
commercial paper and other borrowed funds. Certain short-
term borrowings, for example, securities sold under
repurchase agreements, require the delivery of securities as
collateral.

Federal funds purchased and securities sold under
repurchase agreements include repurchase agreement
activity with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation
(“FICC”), where we record interest expense on a gross
basis, but the ending and average balances reflect the
impact of offsetting under enforceable netting agreements.
This activity primarily relates to government securities
collateralized resale and repurchase agreements executed
with clients that are novated to and settle with the FICC.

Payables to customers and broker-dealers represent funds
awaiting reinvestment and short sale proceeds payable on
demand. Payables to customers and broker-dealers are
driven by customer trading activity and market volatility.

The Bank of New York Mellon may issue commercial
paper that matures within 397 days from the date of issue
and is not redeemable prior to maturity or subject to
voluntary prepayment.

Other borrowed funds primarily include borrowings from
the Federal Home Loan Bank, overdrafts of sub-custodian
account balances in our Securities Services businesses,
finance lease liabilities and borrowings under lines of
credit by our Pershing subsidiaries. Overdrafts typically
relate to timing differences for settlements.

Liquidity and dividends

BNY Mellon defines liquidity as the ability of the Parent
and its subsidiaries to access funding or convert assets to
cash quickly and efficiently, or to

roll over or issue new debt, especially during periods of
market stress, at a reasonable cost, and in order to meet its
short-term (up to one year) obligations. Funding liquidity
risk is the risk that BNY Mellon cannot meet its cash and
collateral obligations at a reasonable cost for both expected
and unexpected cash flow and collateral needs without
adversely affecting daily operations or our financial
condition. Funding liquidity risk can arise from funding
mismatches, market constraints from the inability to
convert assets into cash, the inability to hold or raise cash,
low overnight deposits, deposit run-off or contingent
liquidity events.

Changes in economic conditions or exposure to credit,
market, operational, legal and reputational risks also can
affect BNY Mellon’s liquidity risk profile and are
considered in our liquidity risk framework. For additional
information, see “Risk Management – Liquidity Risk” in
our 2022 Annual Report.

The Parent’s policy is to have access to sufficient
unencumbered cash and cash equivalents at each quarter
end to cover maturities and other forecasted debt
redemptions, net interest payments and net tax payments
for the following 18-month period, and to provide
sufficient collateral to satisfy transactions subject to
Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. As of March 31,
2023, the Parent was in compliance with this policy.

We monitor and control liquidity exposures and funding
needs within and across significant legal entities, branches,
currencies and business lines, taking into account, among
other factors, any applicable restrictions on the transfer of
liquidity among entities.

BNY Mellon also manages potential intraday liquidity
risks. We monitor and manage intraday liquidity against
existing and expected intraday liquid resources (such as
cash balances, remaining intraday credit capacity, intraday
contingency funding and available collateral) to enable
BNY Mellon to meet its intraday obligations under normal
and reasonably severe stressed conditions.

We define available funds for internal liquidity
management purposes as cash and due from banks,
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and
other central banks, interest-bearing deposits with banks
and federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements.

Total available funds were $164.6 billion at March 31,
2023, compared with $138.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. The
increase was primarily due to higher interest-bearing
deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks,
federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale
agreements and cash and due from banks, partially offset
by lower interest-bearing deposits with banks.

Average non-core sources of funds, such as federal funds
purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, trading liabilities, other borrowed funds and
commercial paper, were $22.1 billion for the first three
months of 2023, compared with $16.7 billion for the first
three months of 2022. The increase primarily reflects
higher federal funds purchased and securities sold under
repurchase agreements and other borrowed funds, partially
offset by lower trading liabilities.

Average interest-bearing foreign deposits, primarily from
our European-based businesses included in the Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services segments, were
$91.3 billion for the first three months of 2023, compared
with $107.0 billion for the first three months of 2022.
Average interest-bearing domestic deposits were $112.8
billion for the first three months of 2023, compared with
$116.3 billion for the first three months of 2022. The
decreases primarily reflect client activity.

Average payables to customers and broker-dealers were
$17.0 billion for the first three months of 2023

30 BNY Mellon

and $16.7 billion for the first three months of 2022.
Payables to customers and broker-dealers are driven by
customer trading activity and market volatility.

Average long-term debt was $30.2 billion for the first three
months of 2023 and $25.6 billion for the first three months
of 2022.

Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased to $69.9
billion for the first three months of 2023 from $90.2 billion
for the first three months of 2022, primarily reflecting
client activity.

A significant reduction of client activity in our Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services business
segments would reduce our access to deposits. See
“Asset/liability management” for additional factors that
could impact our deposit balances.

Sources of liquidity

The Parent’s major sources of liquidity are access to the
debt and equity markets, dividends from its subsidiaries,
and cash on hand and cash otherwise made available in
business-as-usual circumstances to the Parent through a
committed credit facility with our intermediate holding
company (“IHC”).

Our ability to access the capital markets on favorable
terms, or at all, is partially dependent on our credit ratings,
which are as follows:

Long-term debt totaled $30.5 billion at March 31, 2023
and Dec. 31, 2022. Issuances of $1.5 billion and an
increase in the fair value of hedged long-term debt were
offset by maturities of $1.8 billion. Long-term debt of $3.5
billion will mature in the remainder of 2023.

In April 2023, the Parent issued $1.5 billion of fixed-to-
floating rate senior notes maturing in 2027. The annual
fixed interest rate is 4.947% from issuance to, but
excluding, April 26, 2026, and then an annual interest rate
of the compounded secured overnight financing rate
(“SOFR”) plus 102.6 basis points. The Parent also issued
$1.0 billion of fixed-to-floating rate senior notes maturing
in 2034. The annual fixed interest rate is 4.967% from
issuance to, but excluding, April 26, 2033, and then an
annual interest rate of the compounded SOFR plus 160.6
basis points.

The Bank of New York Mellon may issue notes and
certificates of deposit (“CDs”). At March 31, 2023 and
Dec. 31, 2022, $780 million of notes were outstanding. At
March 31, 2023, $697 million of CDs were outstanding.
There were $122 million of CDs outstanding at Dec. 31,
2022.

The Bank of New York Mellon also issues commercial
paper that matures within 397 days from the date of issue
and is not redeemable prior to maturity or subject to
voluntary prepayment. There was no commercial paper
outstanding at March 31,

2023 and Dec. 31, 2022. There was no average commercial
paper outstanding for the first three months of 2023.
Average commercial paper outstanding was $4 million for
the first three months of 2022.

Subsequent to March 31, 2023, our U.S. bank subsidiaries
could declare dividends to the Parent of approximately
$1.5 billion, without the need for a regulatory waiver. In
addition, at March 31, 2023, non-bank subsidiaries of the
Parent had liquid assets of approximately $4.5 billion.
Restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our
subsidiaries are discussed in more detail in “Supervision
and Regulation – Capital Planning and Stress Testing –
Payment of Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Other
Capital Distributions” and in Note 19 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, both in our 2022
Annual Report.

Pershing LLC has uncommitted lines of credit in place for
liquidity purposes that are guaranteed by the Parent.
Pershing LLC has two separate uncommitted lines of credit
amounting to $350 million in aggregate. There were no
average borrowings under these lines in the first quarter of
2023. Pershing Limited, an indirect UK-based subsidiary
of BNY Mellon, has two separate uncommitted lines of
credit amounting to $259 million in aggregate. Average
borrowings under these lines were $2 million in the first
quarter of 2023.

BNY Mellon 31

  
 
The double leverage ratio is the ratio of our equity
investment in subsidiaries divided by our consolidated
Parent company equity, which includes our noncumulative
perpetual preferred stock. In short, the double leverage
ratio measures the extent to which equity in subsidiaries is
financed by Parent company debt. As the double leverage
ratio increases, this can reflect greater demands on a
company’s cash flows in order to service interest payments
and debt maturities. BNY Mellon’s double leverage ratio is
managed in a range considering the high level of
unencumbered available liquid assets held in its principal
subsidiaries (such as central bank deposit placements and
government securities), the Company’s cash generating
fee-based business model, with fee revenue representing
72% of total revenue in the first quarter of 2023, and the
dividend capacity of our banking subsidiaries. Our double
leverage ratio was 119.9% at March 31, 2023 and 120.5%
at Dec. 31, 2022, and within the range targeted by
management.

Uses of funds

The Parent’s major uses of funds are repurchases of
common stock, payment of dividends, principal and
interest payments on its borrowings, acquisitions and
additional investments in its subsidiaries.

In February 2023, a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per
common share was paid to common shareholders. Our
common stock dividend payout ratio was 34% for the first
quarter of 2023.

In the first quarter of 2023, we repurchased 25.1 million
common shares at an average price of $49.94 per common
share, for a total cost of $1.3 billion.

Liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”)

U.S. regulators have established an LCR that requires
certain banking organizations, including BNY Mellon, to
maintain a minimum amount of unencumbered high-
quality liquid assets (“HQLA”) sufficient to withstand the
net cash outflow under a hypothetical standardized acute
liquidity stress scenario for a 30-day time horizon.

The following table presents BNY Mellon’s consolidated
HQLA at March 31, 2023, and the average HQLA and
average LCR for the first quarter of 2023.

BNY Mellon and each of our affected domestic bank
subsidiaries were compliant with the U.S. LCR
requirements of at least 100% throughout the first quarter
of 2023.

Statement of cash flows

The following summarizes the activity reflected on the
consolidated statement of cash flows. While this
information may be helpful to highlight certain macro
trends and business strategies, the cash flow analysis may
not be as relevant when analyzing changes in our net
earnings and net assets. We believe that in addition to the
traditional cash flow analysis, the discussion related to
liquidity and dividends and asset/liability management
herein may provide more useful context in evaluating our
liquidity position and related activity.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion
in the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared with
$3.4 billion in the three months ended March 31, 2022. In
the three months ended March 31, 2023, cash flows
provided by operations primarily resulted from changes in
trading assets and liabilities and earnings, partially offset
by changes in accruals. In the three months ended March
31, 2022, cash flows provided by operations primarily
resulted from changes in trading assets and liabilities and
earnings.

Net cash used for investing activities was $17.8 billion in
the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared with
$33.9 billion in the three months ended March 31, 2022. In
the three months ended March 31, 2023, net cash used for
investing activities primarily resulted from changes in
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and
other central

32 BNY Mellon

banks, partially offset by net changes in securities and
loans. In the three months ended March 31, 2022, net cash
used for investing activities primarily resulted from
changes in interest-bearing deposits with the Federal
Reserve and other central banks and changes in interest-
bearing deposits with banks, partially offset by changes in
federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale
agreements.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $14.4 billion
in the three months ended March 31, 2023,

compared with $30.1 billion in the three months ended
March 31, 2022. In the three months ended March 31,
2023, net cash provided by financing activities primarily
resulted from changes in federal funds purchased and
securities sold under repurchase agreements. In the three
months ended March 31, 2022, net cash provided by
financing activities primarily resulted from changes in
deposits, changes in payables to customers and broker-
dealers and changes in federal funds purchased and
securities sold under repurchase agreements.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total
shareholders’ equity decreased to $40.6 billion at March
31, 2023 from $40.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. The decrease
primarily reflects common stock repurchases and common
dividends, partially offset by earnings and unrealized gains
in the first quarter on securities available-for-sale.

The unrealized loss (after-tax) on our available-for-sale
securities portfolio, net of hedges, included in accumulated
other comprehensive income was $2.1 billion at March 31,
2023, compared with $2.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. The
decrease in the unrealized loss, net of tax, was primarily
driven by lower market interest rates.

In the first three months of 2023, we repurchased 25.1
million common shares at an average price of $49.94 per
common share for a total of $1.3 billion.

In January 2023, we announced a share repurchase
program approved by our Board of Directors providing for
the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of common shares
beginning Jan. 1, 2023. This new share repurchase plan
replaced all previously authorized share repurchase plans.

Capital adequacy

Regulators establish certain levels of capital for bank
holding companies (“BHCs”) and banks, including BNY
Mellon and our bank subsidiaries, in accordance with
established quantitative measurements. For the Parent to
maintain its status as a financial holding company, our U.S.
bank subsidiaries and BNY Mellon must, among other
things, qualify as “well capitalized.” As of March 31, 2023
and Dec. 31, 2022, BNY Mellon and our U.S. bank
subsidiaries were “well capitalized.” Failure to satisfy
regulatory standards, including “well capitalized” status or
capital adequacy rules more

BNY Mellon 33

generally, could result in limitations on our activities and
adversely affect our financial condition. See the discussion
of these matters in “Supervision and Regulation –
Regulated Entities of BNY Mellon and Ancillary
Regulatory Requirements” and “Risk Factors – Capital and
Liquidity Risk – Failure to satisfy regulatory standards,
including “well capitalized” and “well managed” status or
capital adequacy and liquidity rules more generally, could
result in limitations on our activities and adversely

affect our business and financial condition,” both of which
are in our 2022 Annual Report.

The U.S. banking agencies’ capital rules are based on the
framework adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision, as amended from time to time. For additional
information on these capital requirements, see
“Supervision and Regulation” in our 2022 Annual Report.

(a)    Minimum requirements for March 31, 2023 include minimum thresholds plus currently applicable buffers. The U.S. global systemically important

banks (“G-SIB”) surcharge is 1.5%. The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set to 0%. The stress capital buffer (“SCB”) requirement is 2.5%,
equal to the regulatory minimum for Standardized Approach capital ratios.

(b)    For our CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, our effective capital ratios under U.S. capital rules are the lower of the ratios as calculated

under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is based on Tier 1 capital and quarterly average total assets.

(c)    The Federal Reserve’s regulations do not establish well capitalized thresholds for these measures for BHCs.
(d)    The SLR is based on Tier 1 capital and total leverage exposure, which includes certain off-balance sheet exposures.

34 BNY Mellon

Our CET1 ratio under the Advanced Approaches was
11.0% at March 31, 2023 and 11.2% at Dec. 31, 2022. The
decrease was primarily driven by capital deployed through
common stock repurchases and common dividends and
higher RWAs, partially offset by capital generated through
earnings and unrealized gains in the first quarter on
securities available-for-sale.

The Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.8% at March 31, 2023 and
Dec. 31, 2022, as a slight decrease in capital was offset by
a decrease in average assets.

Risk-based capital ratios vary depending on the size of the
balance sheet at period end and the levels and types of
investments in assets, and leverage ratios vary based on the
average size of the balance sheet over the quarter. The
balance sheet size fluctuates from period to period based
on levels of customer and market activity. In general, when
servicing clients are more actively trading securities,
deposit balances and the balance sheet as a whole are
higher. In addition, when markets experience significant
volatility or stress, our balance sheet size may increase
considerably as client deposit levels increase.

Our capital ratios are necessarily subject to, among other
things, anticipated compliance with all necessary
enhancements to model calibration, approval by regulators
of certain models used as part of RWA calculations, other
refinements, further implementation guidance from
regulators, market practices and standards and any changes
BNY Mellon may make to its businesses. As a
consequence of these factors, our capital ratios may
materially change, and may be volatile over time and from
period to period.

Under the Advanced Approaches, our operational loss risk
model is informed by external losses, including fines and
penalties levied against institutions in the financial services
industry, particularly those that relate to businesses in
which we operate, and as a result, external losses have
impacted and could in the future impact the amount of
capital that we are required to hold.

RWAs.

In August 2022, the Federal Reserve announced that BNY
Mellon’s SCB requirement would be 2.5%, equal to the
regulatory floor, effective as of Oct. 1, 2022. The SCB
replaced the static 2.5% capital conservation buffer for
Standardized Approach capital ratios for CCAR BHCs.
The SCB does not apply to bank subsidiaries, which
remain subject to the static 2.5% capital conservation
buffer. See “Supervision and Regulation” in our 2022
Annual Report for additional information.

The SCB final rule generally eliminates the requirement
for prior approval of common stock repurchases in excess
of the distributions in a firm’s capital plan, provided that
such distributions are consistent with applicable capital
requirements and buffers, including the SCB.

Trading activities and risk management

Our trading activities are focused on acting as a market-
maker for our customers, facilitating customer trades and
risk-mitigating hedging in compliance with the Volcker
Rule. The risk from market-making activities for customers
is managed by our traders and limited in total exposure
through a system of position limits, value-at-risk (“VaR”)
methodology and other market sensitivity measures. VaR is
the potential loss in value due to adverse market
movements over a defined time horizon with a specified
confidence level. The calculation of our VaR used by
management and presented below assumes a one-day
holding period, utilizes a 99% confidence level and
incorporates non-linear product characteristics. VaR
facilitates comparisons across portfolios of different risk
characteristics. VaR also captures the diversification of
aggregated risk at the firm-wide level.

The interest rate component of VaR represents instruments
whose values are predominantly driven by interest rate
levels. These instruments include, but are not limited to,
U.S. Treasury securities, swaps, swaptions, forward rate
agreements, exchange-traded futures and options, and other
interest rate derivative products.

The foreign exchange component of VaR represents
instruments whose values predominantly vary with the
level or volatility of currency exchange rates or interest
rates. These instruments include, but are not limited to,
currency balances, spot and forward transactions, currency
options and other currency derivative products.

The equity component of VaR consists of instruments that
represent an ownership interest in the form of domestic and
foreign common stock or other equity-linked instruments.
These instruments include, but are not limited to, common
stock, exchange-traded funds, preferred stock, listed equity
options (puts and calls), OTC equity options, equity total
return swaps, equity index futures and other equity
derivative products.

The credit component of VaR represents instruments whose
values are predominantly driven by credit spread levels,
i.e., idiosyncratic default risk. These instruments include,
but are not limited to, single issuer credit default swaps,
and securities with exposures from corporate and
municipal credit spreads.

The diversification component of VaR is the risk reduction
benefit that occurs when combining portfolios and
offsetting positions, and from the correlated behavior of
risk factor movements.

During the first quarter of 2023, interest rate risk generated
41% of average gross VaR, foreign exchange risk
generated 39% of average gross VaR, equity risk generated
1% of average gross VaR and credit risk generated 19% of
average gross VaR. During the first quarter of 2023, our
daily trading loss did not exceed our calculated VaR
amount of the overall portfolio.

The following table of total daily trading revenue or loss

(a)    Trading revenue (loss) includes realized and unrealized gains and losses
primarily related to spot and forward foreign exchange transactions,

derivatives and securities trades for our customers and excludes any
associated commissions, underwriting fees and net interest revenue.

Trading assets include debt and equity instruments and
derivative assets, primarily foreign exchange and interest
rate contracts, not designated as hedging instruments.
Trading assets were $9.0 billion at March 31, 2023 and
$9.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2022.

Trading liabilities include debt and equity instruments and
derivative liabilities, primarily foreign exchange and
interest rate contracts, not designated as hedging
instruments. Trading liabilities were $5.7 billion at March
31, 2023 and $5.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2022.

Under our fair value methodology for derivative contracts,
an initial “risk-neutral” valuation is performed on each
position assuming time discounting based on a AA credit
curve. In addition, we consider credit risk in arriving at the
fair value of our derivatives.

We reflect external credit ratings as well as observable
credit default swap spreads for both ourselves and our
counterparties when measuring the fair value of our
derivative positions. Accordingly, the valuation of our
derivative positions is sensitive to the current changes in
our own credit spreads, as well as those of our
counterparties.

At March 31, 2023, our OTC derivative assets, including
those in hedging relationships, of $1.7 billion included a
credit valuation adjustment (“CVA”) deduction of $18
million. Our OTC derivative liabilities, including those in
hedging relationships, of $3.0 billion included a debit
valuation adjustment (“DVA”) of $4 million related to our
own credit spread. Net of hedges, the CVA was unchanged
and the DVA increased by $1 million in the first quarter of
2023, which increased investment and other revenue –
other trading revenue by $1 million. The net impact
decreased investment

and other revenue – other trading revenue by $2 million in
the fourth quarter of 2022 and by less than $1 million in
the first quarter of 2022.

The table below summarizes our exposure, net of collateral
related to our derivative counterparties, as determined on
an internal risk management basis. Significant changes in
counterparty credit ratings could alter the level of credit
risk faced by BNY Mellon.

Asset/liability management

Our diversified business activities include processing
securities, accepting deposits, investing in securities,
lending, raising money as needed to fund assets and other
transactions. The market risks from these activities include
interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. Our primary
market risk is exposure to movements in U.S. dollar
interest rates and certain foreign currency interest rates. We
actively manage interest rate sensitivity and use earnings
simulation and discounted cash flow models to identify
interest rate exposures.

An earnings simulation model is the primary tool used to
assess changes in pre-tax net interest revenue between a
baseline scenario and hypothetical interest rate scenarios.
Interest rate sensitivity is quantified by calculating the
change in pre-tax net interest revenue between the
scenarios over a 12-month measurement period.

The baseline scenario incorporates the market’s forward
rate expectations and management’s assumptions regarding
client deposit rates, credit spreads, changes in the
prepayment behavior of loans and securities and the impact
of derivative financial instruments used for interest rate
risk management purposes as of March 31, 2023. These
assumptions have been developed through a combination
of historical analysis and future expected pricing

behavior and are inherently uncertain. Actual results may
differ materially from projected results due to timing,
magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, and
changes in market conditions and management’s strategies,
among other factors. Client deposit levels and mix are key
assumptions impacting net interest revenue in the baseline
as well as the hypothetical interest rate scenarios. The
earnings simulation model assumes static deposit levels
and mix, and it also assumes that no management actions
will be taken to mitigate the effects of interest rate changes.
Typically, the baseline scenario uses the average deposit
balances of the quarter.

In the table below, we use the earnings simulation model to
assess the impact of various hypothetical interest rate
scenarios compared to the baseline scenario. In each of the
scenarios, all currencies’ interest rates are instantaneously
shifted higher or lower at the start of the forecast. Long-
term interest rates are defined as all tenors equal to or
greater than three years and short-term interest rates are
defined as all tenors equal to or less than three months.
Interim term points are interpolated where applicable. The
impact of interest rate shifts may not be linear. The results
of this earnings simulation should therefore not be
extrapolated for more severe interest rate scenarios than
those presented in the table below.

The following table shows net interest revenue sensitivity
for BNY Mellon.

At March 31, 2023, the impact of a 100 bps upward shift in
rates on net interest revenue rose compared with Dec. 31,
2022. The drivers were lower expected deposit interest
expense in rising rate scenarios, driven by changes in the
forward rate curve to be more downward sloping and lower
deposit rate sensitivity.

BNY Mellon 39

While the net interest revenue sensitivity scenario
calculations assume static deposit balances to facilitate
consistent period-over-period comparisons, net interest
revenue is impacted by changes in deposit balances.
Noninterest-bearing deposits are particularly sensitive to
changes in short-term rates.

To illustrate the net interest revenue sensitivity to deposit
run-off, we estimate that a $5 billion instantaneous
reduction of U.S. dollar-denominated noninterest-bearing
deposits would reduce the net interest revenue sensitivity
results in the up 100 basis point scenario in the table above
by approximately $290 million. The impact would be
smaller if the run-off was assumed to be a mixture of
interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits.

Additionally, during periods of low short-term interest
rates, money market mutual fund fees and other similar
fees are typically waived to protect investors from negative
returns. See “Fee and other revenue” in the 2022 Annual
Report for additional details on money market fee waivers.

For a discussion of factors impacting the growth or
contraction of deposits, see “Risk Factors – Capital and
Liquidity Risk – Our business, financial condition and
results of operations could be adversely affected if we do
not effectively manage our liquidity” in our 2022 Annual
Report.

Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP
and Non-GAAP financial measures

BNY Mellon has included in this Form 10-Q certain Non-
GAAP financial measures on a tangible basis as a
supplement to GAAP information, which exclude goodwill
and intangible assets, net of deferred tax liabilities. We
believe that the return on tangible common equity – Non-
GAAP is additional useful information for investors
because it presents a measure of those assets that can
generate income, and the tangible book value per common
share – Non-GAAP is additional useful information
because it presents the level of tangible assets in relation to
shares of common stock outstanding.

The presentation of the growth rates of investment
management and performance fees on a constant currency
basis permits investors to assess the significance of
changes in foreign currency exchange

rates. Growth rates on a constant currency basis were
determined by applying the current period foreign currency
exchange rates to the prior period revenue. We believe that
this presentation, as a supplement to GAAP information,
gives investors a clearer picture of the related revenue
results without the variability caused by fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates.

BNY Mellon has also included the adjusted pre-tax
operating margin – Non-GAAP, which is the pre-tax
operating margin for the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment, net of distribution and
servicing expense that was passed to third parties who
distribute or service our managed funds. We believe that
this measure is useful when evaluating the performance of
the Investment and Wealth Management business segment
relative to industry competitors.

Recent accounting and regulatory developments

Recent accounting developments

The following accounting guidance issued by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) has not yet been
adopted as of March 31, 2023.

Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-02,
Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic
323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures
Using the Proportional Amortization Method

In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-02,
Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using
the Proportional Amortization Method, which permits
reporting entities to elect to account for their tax equity
investments, regardless of the tax credit program from
which the income tax credits are received, using the
proportional amortization method if certain conditions are
met. Under the proportional amortization method, an entity
amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to
the income tax credits and other income tax benefits
received, and recognizes the net amortization and income
tax credits and other income tax benefits in the income
statement as a component of the provision for income
taxes.

This ASU is effective Jan. 1, 2024 with early adoption
permitted. BNY Mellon is currently evaluating this
guidance with respect to our investments in renewable
energy projects, which historically have not been eligible
to apply the proportional amortization method. These
investments currently generate losses in investment and
other revenue that are more than offset by benefits and
credits recorded to the provision for income taxes.

The impact of adopting this new guidance for our
renewable energy investments that meet the eligibility
criteria would be an increase in investment and other
revenue and an increase in the provision for income taxes
on the consolidated income statement.

Recent regulatory and other developments

For a summary of additional regulatory matters relevant to
our operations, see “Supervision and Regulation” in our
2022 Annual Report. The following discussion summarizes
certain regulatory, legislative and other developments that
may affect BNY Mellon.

Recent bank failures

On March 12 and 13, 2023, following the closures of
Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”) and Signature Bank and the
appointment of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(“FDIC”) as the receiver for those banks, the FDIC
announced that, under the systemic risk exception set forth
in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”), all insured
and uninsured deposits of those banks were transferred to
the respective bridge banks for SVB and Signature Bank.

The FDIC also announced that, as required by the FDIA,
any losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) to
support uninsured depositors would be recovered by a
special assessment. Under the FDIA, the assessment may
be on insured depository institutions, depository institution
holding companies (with the concurrence of the Treasury
Secretary), or both, as the FDIC determines to be
appropriate. In March 2023 testimony before Congress, the
Chairman of the FDIC stated that the FDIC then
preliminarily estimated the losses to the DIF of resolving
SVB and Signature Bank to be $22.5 billion in the
aggregate. The FDIA provides that the special

BNY Mellon 43

assessment will be prescribed through regulation. The
FDIC has discretion with respect to the design and time
frame for any special assessment, and, under the FDIA, the
FDIC may consider the types of entities that benefit from
the action taken, economic conditions, the effects on the
industry, and such other factors as the FDIC deems
appropriate. The timing, amount and allocation of the
special assessment that will be imposed on banking
organizations is uncertain, but the impact of the special
assessment on our noninterest expense and results of
operations may be material.

On May 1, 2023, the FDIC released a comprehensive
overview of the deposit insurance system and options for
reform to address financial stability concerns stemming
from recent bank failures. The FDIC evaluated three
primary options: limited coverage, unlimited coverage and
targeted coverage. The proposed options would require
Congressional action, though some aspects of the report lie
within the scope of the FDIC’s rulemaking authority. We
are evaluating the impact of the proposed reforms.

The closures of SVB and Signature Bank and adverse
developments affecting other banks in March 2023 resulted
in heightened levels of market activity and volatility. We
experienced increased deposit balances, which resulted in
deposits increasing slightly at March 31, 2023 compared to
Dec. 31, 2022, and we experienced elevated transaction
volumes in parts of the business in the days following the
closure of SVB and Signature Bank. On March 16, 2023,
BNY Mellon and other large U.S. financial institutions
made uninsured deposits into another U.S. financial
institution, First Republic Bank. BNY Mellon’s deposit in
First Republic Bank totaled $1 billion and had a minimum
term of 120 days. On May 1, 2023, the FDIC was
appointed as receiver for First Republic Bank. Also on
May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired the substantial
majority of assets and assumed the deposits and certain
other liabilities of First Republic Bank from the FDIC
receivership, including our deposit with First Republic
Bank. The FDIC has indicated that the estimated losses to
the DIF of resolving First Republic Bank are expected to
be $13 billion, which is expected to result in increased
FDIC assessments and increase our noninterest expense in
future periods.

These recent bank failures and other developments in the
banking industry may result in increased

regulatory activity and restrictions on banks. In addition,
these recent developments have highlighted that social
media and technology have the potential to accelerate the
speed of declines in deposit levels when there is a
reduction of confidence in a banking institution.

U.S. debt ceiling

In January 2023, the outstanding national debt of the U.S.
government reached its statutory limit. The U.S. Treasury
Department has announced that, since then, it has been
using extraordinary measures to prevent the U.S.
government’s default on its payment obligations, and to
extend the time that the U.S. government has to raise its
statutory debt limit or otherwise resolve its funding
situation. Further delays to raise the Federal debt ceiling
could have severe repercussions within the U.S. and to
global credit and financial markets and could exacerbate
concerns over the sovereign debt of other countries. If the
U.S. government does not raise the debt ceiling, it could
default on its payment obligations, or experience delays in
making payments when due, including in respect of U.S.
Treasury securities that play an integral role in financial
markets. A payment default or delay by the U.S.
government, or continued uncertainty surrounding the U.S.
debt ceiling, could result in a variety of adverse effects for
financial markets and market participants, as well as for
our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial
condition.

SEC cybersecurity proposals

On March 15, 2023, the SEC proposed a new rule
regarding cybersecurity risk management for entities
including broker-dealers, security-based swap dealers, and
transfer agents. The proposed rule would require such
entities to maintain written policies and procedures to
address their cybersecurity risk, immediately notify the
SEC of significant cybersecurity incidents, and publicly
disclose descriptions of their cybersecurity risks and
significant cybersecurity incidents.

The SEC also proposed amendments to Regulation S-P,
including a requirement for broker-dealers, investment
companies, registered investment advisers, and transfer
agents to adopt written policies and procedures for an
incident response program with respect to unauthorized
access to or use of customer information. The proposal
would require these

entities to notify individuals whose sensitive customer
information was accessed or used without authorization not
later than 30 days after becoming aware that the
information has been compromised. BNY Mellon is
evaluating the potential impact of the proposals.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1–Basis of presentation

In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, references to
“our,” “we,” “us,” “BNY Mellon,” the “Company” and
similar terms refer to The Bank of New York Mellon
Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. The term
“Parent” refers to The Bank of New York Mellon
Corporation but not to its subsidiaries.

Basis of presentation

The accounting and financial reporting policies of BNY
Mellon, a global financial services company, conform to
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)
and prevailing industry practices. For information on our
significant accounting and reporting policies, see Note 1 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31,
2022 (the “2022 Annual Report”).

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are
unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
necessary, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, for a
fair presentation of financial position, results of operations
and cash flows for the periods presented have been made.
These financial statements should be read in conjunction
with our Consolidated Financial Statements included in our
2022 Annual Report. Certain additional immaterial
reclassifications have been made to prior periods to place
them on a basis comparable with the current period
presentation.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates based
upon assumptions about future economic and market
conditions which affect reported amounts and related
disclosures in our financial statements. Although our
current estimates contemplate current conditions and how
we expect them to change in the future, it is reasonably
possible that actual conditions could be worse than
anticipated in those estimates, which could materially
affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Note 2–New accounting guidance

The following accounting guidance was adopted in the first
quarter of 2023.

Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2022-01,
Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging
– Portfolio Layer Method

In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-01,
Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging
– Portfolio Layer Method, which provides guidance that
expands the ability to hedge interest rate risk by permitting
the use of multiple hedged layers of a single closed
portfolio of assets and will (1) Allow multiple layer
hedging within the same closed portfolio, (2) Expand the
scope of the portfolio layer method to include non-
prepayable assets, (3) Expand the eligible hedging
instruments to be utilized in a single-layer hedge, and (4)
Permit held-to-maturity debt securities to be transferred to
available-for-sale at the date of adoption, provided such
transferred securities are designated in a portfolio layer
method hedge within 30 days of the adoption date.

The standard also provides further guidance and disclosure
requirements with respect to hedge basis adjustments
related to portfolio layer method hedges.

We adopted this guidance as of Jan. 1, 2023. The Company
did not choose to make the one-time election to reclassify
securities classified as held-to-maturity to available-for-
sale as of Jan. 1, 2023 and can choose to prospectively
apply portfolio layer method hedging.

ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses
(Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage
Disclosures

In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial
Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt
Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures, which provides
post-implementation guidance related to the adoption of
ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses:
Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,
which was effective Jan. 1, 2020. This ASU amends the
guidance related to two issues: Troubled Debt
Restructurings (“TDRs”) and disclosure requirements for
the credit profile of the loan portfolio. This ASU eliminates
the accounting guidance for TDRs by creditors, while
enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan
refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a
borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. An entity
must apply the loan refinancing and restructuring guidance
to determine whether a

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

BNY Mellon 53

modification results in a new loan or a continuation of an
existing loan.

This ASU also requires that an entity disclose current-
period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing
receivables and net investments in leases within the scope
of Subtopic 326-20, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses
– Measured at Amortized Cost.

We adopted the revised guidance related to loan
modifications on Jan.1, 2023. The impact was immaterial.
The updated disclosures are included in Note 5.

Note 3–Acquisitions and dispositions

We sometimes structure our acquisitions and divestitures
with both an initial payment or receipt and later contingent
payments or receipts tied to post-closing revenue or
income growth. Contingent payments totaled $5 million in
the first three months of 2023. There were no contingent
receipts in the first three months of 2023. At March 31,
2023, we are potentially obligated to pay additional
consideration which, using reasonable assumptions and
estimates, could range from $25 million to $40 million
over the next two years. At March 31, 2023, we could
potentially receive additional consideration which, using
reasonable assumptions and estimates, could be up to
$390 million over the next five years.

See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in our 2022 Annual Report for information
related to the 2022 transactions.

Note 4–Securities

The following tables present the amortized cost, the gross
unrealized gains and losses and the fair value of securities

Allowance for credit losses – Securities

The allowance for credit losses related to securities was
$1 million at March 31, 2023 and $1 million at Dec. 31,
2022, and relates to non-agency RMBS and state and
political subdivision securities.

Credit quality indicators – Securities

At March 31, 2023, the gross unrealized losses on the
securities portfolio were primarily attributable to an
increase in interest rates from the date of purchase, and for
certain securities that were transferred from available-for-
sale to held-to-maturity, an increase in interest rates
through the date they were transferred. Specifically, $171
million of the unrealized losses at March 31, 2023 and
$179 million at Dec. 31, 2022 reflected in the tables below
relate to certain securities that were previously transferred
from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity. The unrealized
losses will be amortized into net interest revenue over the
contractual lives of the securities. The transfer created a
new cost basis for the securities. As a result, if these
securities have experienced unrealized losses since the date
of transfer, the corresponding unrealized losses would be
reflected in the held-to-maturity securities portfolio in the
following tables. We do not intend to sell these securities,
and it is not more likely than not that we will have to sell
these securities.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

The following tables show the credit quality of the held-to-maturity securities. We have included certain credit ratings
information because the information can indicate the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed. Significant changes in
ratings classifications could indicate increased credit risk for us and could be accompanied by an increase in the allowance for
credit losses and/or a reduction in the fair value of our securities portfolio.

Pledged assets

At March 31, 2023, BNY Mellon had pledged assets of
$135 billion, including $87 billion pledged as collateral for
potential borrowings at the Federal Reserve Discount
Window and $8 billion pledged as collateral for borrowing
at the Federal Home Loan Bank. The components of the
assets pledged at March 31, 2023 included $117 billion of
securities, $12 billion of loans, $5 billion of trading assets
and $1 billion of interest-bearing deposits with banks.

If there has been no borrowing at the Federal Reserve
Discount Window, the Federal Reserve generally allows
banks to freely move assets in and out of their pledged
assets account to sell or repledge the assets

58 BNY Mellon

for other purposes. BNY Mellon regularly moves assets in
and out of its pledged assets account at the Federal
Reserve.

At Dec. 31, 2022, BNY Mellon had pledged assets of $138
billion, including $106 billion pledged as collateral for
potential borrowing at the Federal Reserve Discount
Window and $8 billion pledged as collateral for borrowing
at the Federal Home Loan Bank. The components of the
assets pledged at Dec. 31, 2022 included $121 billion of
securities, $12 billion of loans, $4 billion of trading assets
and $1 billion of interest-bearing deposits with banks.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

At March 31, 2023 and Dec. 31, 2022, pledged assets
included $39 billion and $24 billion, respectively, for
which the recipients were permitted to sell or repledge the
assets delivered.

We also obtain securities as collateral, including receipts
under resale agreements, securities borrowed, derivative
contracts and custody agreements, on terms which permit
us to sell or repledge the securities to others. At March 31,
2023 and Dec. 31, 2022, the market value of the securities
received that can be sold or repledged was $140 billion and
$115 billion, respectively. We routinely sell or repledge
these securities through delivery to third parties. As of
March 31, 2023 and Dec. 31, 2022, the market value of
securities collateral sold or repledged was $109 billion and
$78 billion, respectively.

Restricted cash and securities

Cash and securities may be segregated under federal and
other regulations or requirements. At March 31, 2023 and
Dec. 31, 2022, cash segregated under federal and other
regulations or requirements was $4 billion and $7 billion,
respectively. Restricted cash is primarily included in
interest-bearing deposits with banks on the consolidated
balance sheet. Securities segregated under federal and
other regulations or requirements were $6 billion at March
31, 2023 and $3 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. Restricted
securities were sourced from securities purchased under
resale

agreements and are included in federal funds sold and
securities purchased under resale agreements on the
consolidated balance sheet.

Loan modifications

Modified loans are evaluated to determine whether a
modification or restructuring with a borrower experiencing
financial difficulty results in principal forgiveness, an
interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment
delay, or a term extension. The modification could result in
a new loan or a continuation of the existing loan.

We modified one commercial real estate loan in the first
quarter of 2023, with an aggregate recorded investment of
$12 million, by extending the maturity dates.

Loans modified prior to 2023 are considered a troubled
debt restructuring (“TDR”) if the debtor is experiencing
financial difficulties and the creditor grants a concession to
the debtor that would not

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

otherwise be considered. A TDR may include a transfer of
real estate or other assets from the debtor to the creditor, or
a modification of the term of the loan. Not all modified
loans are considered TDRs. We modified two loans in the
fourth quarter of 2022 with an aggregate recorded
investment of $1 million. There were no loans modified in
the first quarter of 2022.

Credit quality indicators

Our credit strategy is to focus on investment-grade clients
that are active users of our non-credit services. Each
customer is assigned an internal credit rating, which is
mapped to an external rating agency grade equivalent, if
possible, based upon a number of dimensions, which are
continually evaluated and may change over time.

(a)    Excludes overdrafts of $4,839 million. Overdrafts occur on a daily basis primarily in the custody and securities clearance business and are generally repaid within two

business days.

Commercial loans

The commercial loan portfolio is divided into investment
grade and non-investment grade categories based on the
assigned internal credit ratings, which are generally
consistent with those of the public rating agencies.
Customers with ratings consistent with BBB- (S&P)/Baa3
(Moody’s) or better are considered to be investment grade.
Those clients with ratings lower than this threshold are
considered to be non-investment grade.

Commercial real estate

Our income-producing commercial real estate facilities are
focused on experienced owners and are structured with
moderate leverage based on existing cash flows. Our
commercial real estate lending activities also include
construction and renovation facilities.

Financial institutions

Financial institution exposures are high quality, with 95%
of the exposures meeting the investment grade

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

equivalent criteria of our internal credit rating
classification at March 31, 2023. In addition, 64% of the
financial institutions exposure is secured. For example,
securities industry clients and asset managers often borrow
against marketable securities held in custody. The exposure
to financial institutions is generally short term, with 84%
expiring within one year.

Wealth management loans

Wealth management loans are not typically rated by
external rating agencies. A majority of the wealth
management loans are secured by the customers’
investment management accounts or custody accounts.
Eligible assets pledged for these loans are typically
investment grade fixed-income securities, equities and/or
mutual funds. Internal ratings for this portion of the wealth
management loan portfolio, therefore, would equate to
investment grade external ratings. Wealth management
loans are provided to select customers based on the pledge
of other types of assets. For the loans collateralized by
other assets, the credit quality of the obligor is carefully
analyzed,

BNY Mellon 63

but we do not consider this portion of our wealth
management loan portfolio to be investment grade.

Wealth management mortgages

Credit quality indicators for wealth management mortgages
are not correlated to external ratings. Wealth management
mortgages are typically loans to high-net-worth
individuals, which are secured primarily by residential
property. These loans are primarily interest-only,
adjustable-rate mortgages with a weighted-average loan-to-
value ratio of 61% at origination. Delinquency rate is a key
indicator of credit quality in our wealth management
portfolio. At March 31, 2023, less than 1% of the
mortgages were past due.

At March 31, 2023, the wealth management mortgage
portfolio consisted of the following geographic
concentrations: California – 21%; New York – 14%;
Florida – 11%; Massachusetts – 8%; and other – 46%.

Lease financings

At March 31, 2023, the lease financings portfolio consisted
of exposures backed by well-diversified assets, primarily
real estate and large-ticket transportation equipment. The
largest components of our lease residual value exposure
relate to freight-related rail cars and aircraft. Assets are
both domestic and foreign-based, with primary
concentrations in Germany and the U.S.

Other residential mortgages

The other residential mortgages portfolio primarily consists
of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and totaled $1.0
billion at March 31, 2023 and $345 million at Dec. 31,
2022. Included in this portfolio at March 31, 2023 were
$784 million of fixed-rate jumbo mortgage loans,
purchased primarily in the

first quarter of 2023, with a weighted-average loan-to-
value ratio of 73% at origination. These loans are not
typically correlated to external ratings.

Capital call financing

Capital call financing includes loans to private equity funds
that are secured by the fund investors’ capital commitments
and the funds’ right to call capital.

Other loans

Other loans primarily include loans to consumers that are
fully collateralized with equities, mutual funds and fixed-
income securities.

Margin loans

We had $15.7 billion of secured margin loans at March 31,
2023, compared with $16.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2022.
Margin loans are collateralized with marketable securities,
and borrowers are required to maintain a daily collateral
margin in excess of 100% of the value of the loan. We have
rarely suffered a loss on these types of loans.

Overdrafts

Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities
clearance clients and totaled $2.4 billion at March 31, 2023
and $4.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. Overdrafts occur on a
daily basis and are generally repaid within two business
days.

Reverse repurchase agreements

Reverse repurchase agreements at March 31, 2023 and
Dec. 31, 2022 were fully secured with high-quality
collateral. As a result, there was no allowance for credit
losses related to these assets at March 31, 2023 and Dec.
31, 2022.

Goodwill impairment testing

The goodwill impairment test is performed at least
annually at the reporting unit level. An interim test is
performed when events or circumstances occur that may
indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of
any reporting unit may be less than its carrying value.

In the first quarter of 2023, due to the results of the fourth
quarter 2022 interim impairment test and macroeconomic
conditions, we performed an interim goodwill impairment
test of the Investment Management reporting unit, which
had $6.0 billion of allocated goodwill. No additional
goodwill impairment was recognized.

Non-readily marketable equity securities

Non-readily marketable equity securities do not have
readily determinable fair values. These investments are
valued using a measurement alternative where the
investments are carried at cost, less any impairment, and
plus or minus changes resulting from observable price
changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar
investment of the same issuer. The observable price
changes are recorded in investment and other revenue on
the consolidated income statement. Our non-readily
marketable equity securities totaled $428 million at March
31, 2023 and $445 million at Dec. 31, 2022, and are
included in other equity investments in the table above.

Qualified affordable housing project investments

We invest in affordable housing projects primarily to
satisfy the Company’s requirements under the Community
Reinvestment Act. Our total investment in qualified
affordable housing projects totaled $1.3 billion at March
31, 2023 and $1.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. Commitments
to fund future investments in qualified affordable housing
projects totaled $622

million at March 31, 2023 and $614 million at Dec. 31,
2022 and are recorded in other liabilities on the
consolidated balance sheet. A summary of the
commitments to fund future investments is as follows:
remainder of 2023 – $236 million; 2024 – $145 million;
2025 – $173 million; 2026 – $24 million; 2027 – $1
million; and 2028 and thereafter – $43 million.

Tax credits and other tax benefits recognized were $45
million in the first quarter of 2023, $31 million in the
fourth quarter of 2022 and $38 million in the first quarter
of 2022.

Amortization expense included in the provision for income
taxes was $38 million in the first quarter of 2023, $26
million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $32 million in the
first quarter of 2022.

Investments valued using net asset value (“NAV”) per
share

In our Investment and Wealth Management business
segment, we make seed capital investments in certain
funds we manage. We also hold private equity investments,
primarily small business investment companies (“SBICs”),
which are compliant with the Volcker Rule, and certain
other corporate investments. Seed capital, private equity
and other corporate investments are included in other
assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of
certain of these investments was estimated using the NAV
per share for our ownership interest in the funds.

Contract balances

Our clients are billed based on fee schedules that are
agreed upon in each customer contract. Receivables from
customers were $2.6 billion at March 31, 2023 and Dec.
31, 2022.

Contract assets represent accrued revenues that have not
yet been billed to customers due to certain contractual
terms other than the passage of time and were $50 million
at March 31, 2023 and $48 million at Dec. 31, 2022.
Accrued revenues recorded as contract assets are usually
billed on an annual basis.

Both receivables from customers and contract assets are
included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.

Contract liabilities represent payments received in advance
of providing services under certain contracts and were
$196 million at March 31, 2023 and $164 million at Dec.
31, 2022. Contract liabilities are included in other
liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Revenue
recognized in the first quarter of 2023 relating to contract
liabilities as of Dec. 31, 2022 was $53 million.

Changes in contract assets and liabilities primarily relate to
either party’s performance under the contracts.

Contract costs

Incremental costs for obtaining contracts that are deemed
recoverable are capitalized as contract costs. Such costs
result from the payment of sales

incentives, primarily in the Wealth Management business,
and totaled $57 million at March 31, 2023 and $58 million
at Dec. 31, 2022. Capitalized sales incentives are
amortized based on the transfer of goods or services to
which the assets relate. The amortization of capitalized
sales incentives, which is included in staff expense on the
consolidated income statement, totaled $4 million in the
first quarter of 2023 and $5 million in the first quarter of
2022 and fourth quarter of 2022.

Costs to fulfill a contract are capitalized when they relate
directly to an existing contract or a specific anticipated
contract, generate or enhance resources that will be used to
fulfill performance obligations, and are recoverable. Such
costs generally represent set-up costs, which include any
direct cost incurred at the inception of a contract which
enables the fulfillment of the performance obligation, and
totaled $81 million at March 31, 2023 and $77 million at
Dec. 31, 2022. These capitalized costs are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the expected contract period.

Unsatisfied performance obligations

We do not have any unsatisfied performance obligations
other than those that are subject to a practical expedient
election under ASC 606, Revenue From Contracts With
Customers. The practical expedient election applies to (i)
contracts with an original expected length of one year or
less, and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at
the amount to which we have the right to invoice for
services performed.

Our total tax reserves as of March 31, 2023 were $105
million, compared with $106 million at Dec. 31, 2022. If
these tax reserves were unnecessary, $105 million would
affect the effective tax rate in future periods. We recognize
accrued interest and penalties, if applicable, related to
income taxes in income tax expense. Included in the
balance sheet at March 31, 2023 is accrued interest, where
applicable, of $32 million. The additional tax benefit
related to interest

70 BNY Mellon

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $1 million,
compared with $2 million of tax expense for the three
months ended March 31, 2022.

It is reasonably possible the total reserve for uncertain tax
positions could decrease within the next 12 months by
approximately $11 million as a result of adjustments
related to tax years that are still subject to examination.

Our federal income tax returns are closed to examination
through 2016. Our New York State and New York City
income tax returns are closed to examination through 2014.
Our UK income tax returns are closed to examination
through 2020.

Note 12–Variable interest entities

We have variable interests in variable interest entities
(“VIEs”), which include investments in retail, institutional
and alternative investment funds.

We earn management fees from these funds, as well as
performance fees in certain funds, and may also provide
start-up capital for new funds. The funds are primarily
financed by our customers’ investments in the funds’ equity
or debt.

Additionally, we invest in qualified affordable housing and
renewable energy projects, which are designed to generate
a return primarily through the realization of tax credits.
The projects, which are structured as limited partnerships
and limited liability companies, are also VIEs, but are not
consolidated.

The following table presents the incremental assets and
liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet as of
March 31, 2023 and Dec. 31, 2022. The net assets of any
consolidated VIE are solely available to settle the liabilities
of the VIE and to settle any investors’ ownership
liquidation requests, including any seed capital we invested
in the VIE.

We have not provided financial or other support that was
not otherwise contractually required to be provided to our
VIEs. Additionally, creditors of any consolidated VIEs do
not have any recourse to the general credit of BNY Mellon.

Non-consolidated VIEs

As of March 31, 2023 and Dec. 31, 2022, assets and
liabilities related to the VIEs where we are not the primary
beneficiary were included in other assets and other

benefit cost is recorded as other expense on the consolidated income statement.

Note 15–Fair value measurement

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to
sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. A three-level hierarchy for fair value
measurements is utilized based upon the transparency of
inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the
measurement date. BNY Mellon’s own creditworthiness is
considered when valuing liabilities. See Note 20 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2022
Annual Report for

information on how we determine fair value and the fair
value hierarchy.

The following tables present the financial instruments
carried at fair value at March 31, 2023 and Dec. 31, 2022,
by caption on the consolidated balance sheet and by the
three-level valuation hierarchy. We have included credit
ratings information in certain of the tables because the
information indicates the degree of credit risk to which we
are exposed, and significant changes in ratings
classifications could result in increased risk for us.

active markets or observable inputs such as quoted prices
for similar assets or liabilities. Quoted prices for either
identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets
may also be used. Accordingly, fair value best reflects the
interests BNY Mellon holds in the economic performance
of the consolidated investment management funds.
Changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities are
recorded as income (loss) from consolidated investment
management funds, which is included in investment and
other revenue on the consolidated income statement.

We elected the fair value option on subordinated notes
associated with certain equity investments. The fair value
of these subordinated notes was $10 million at March 31,
2023 and $10 million at Dec. 31, 2022. The subordinated
notes were valued using observable market inputs and
included in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

Note 17–Derivative instruments

We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk,
including interest rate risk, equity price risk and foreign
currency risk, as well as credit risk. Our trading activities
are focused on acting as a market-maker for our customers
and facilitating customer trades in compliance with the
Volcker Rule.

The notional amounts for derivative financial instruments
express the dollar volume of the transactions; however,
credit risk is much smaller.

Note 16–Fair value option

We elected fair value as an alternative measurement for
selected financial assets and liabilities that are not
otherwise required to be measured at fair value, including
the assets and liabilities of consolidated investment
management funds and subordinated notes associated with
certain equity investments.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

We perform credit reviews and enter into netting
agreements and collateral arrangements to minimize the
credit risk of derivative financial instruments. We enter
into offsetting positions to reduce exposure to foreign
currency, interest rate and equity price risk.

Use of derivative financial instruments involves reliance
on counterparties. Failure of a counterparty to honor its
obligation under a derivative contract is a risk we assume
whenever we engage in a derivative contract. There were
no counterparty default losses recorded in the first quarter
of 2023.

Hedging derivatives

We utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage our
exposure to interest rate fluctuations. We enter into fair
value hedges as an interest rate risk management strategy
to reduce fair value variability by converting certain fixed
rate interest payments associated with available-for-sale
securities and long-term debt to floating interest rates. We
also utilize interest rate swaps and forward exchange
contracts as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to
interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes.

The available-for-sale securities hedged consist of U.S.
Treasury, agency and non-agency commercial MBS,
sovereign debt/sovereign guaranteed and foreign covered
bonds. At March 31, 2023, $29.7 billion par value of
available-for-sale securities were hedged with interest rate
swaps designated as fair value hedges that had notional
values of $29.7 billion.

The fixed rate long-term debt instruments hedged generally
have original maturities of five to 30 years. In fair value
hedging relationships, fixed rate debt is hedged with
“receive fixed rate, pay variable rate” swaps. At March 31,
2023, $24.7 billion par value of debt was hedged with
interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges that had
notional values of $24.7 billion.

In addition, we utilize forward foreign exchange contracts
as hedges to mitigate foreign exchange

exposures. We use forward foreign exchange contracts as
cash flow hedges to convert certain forecasted non-U.S.
dollar revenue and expenses into U.S. dollars. We use
forward foreign exchange contracts with maturities of 15
months or less as cash flow hedges to hedge our foreign
exchange exposure to currencies such as the Indian rupee,
Polish zloty, Hong Kong dollar, Singapore dollar, British
pound and euro used in revenue and expense transactions
for entities that have the U.S. dollar as their functional
currency. As of March 31, 2023, the hedged forecasted
foreign currency transactions and designated forward
foreign exchange contract hedges were $493 million
(notional), with a net pre-tax gain of $1 million recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income (“OCI”). This
gain will be reclassified to earnings over the next 12
months.

In 2022, we utilized forward foreign exchange contracts as
fair value hedges of the foreign exchange risk associated
with available-for-sale securities. At March 31, 2023, there
were no remaining foreign exchange contracts. Forward
points are designated as an excluded component and
amortized into earnings over the hedge period.

Forward foreign exchange contracts are also used to hedge
the value of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
These forward foreign exchange contracts have maturities
of less than one year. The derivatives employed are
designated as hedges of changes in value of our foreign
investments due to exchange rates. The change in fair
market value of these forward foreign exchange contracts
is reported within foreign currency translation adjustments
in shareholders’ equity, net of tax. At March 31, 2023,
forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts
totaling $10.1 billion were designated as net investment
hedges.

From time to time, we also designate non-derivative
financial instruments as hedges of our net investments in
foreign subsidiaries. At March 31, 2023, there were no
non-derivative financial instruments hedging our net
investments in foreign subsidiaries.

(a)    The fair value of asset derivatives and liability derivatives designated as hedging instruments is recorded as other assets and other liabilities,

respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet.

(b)    For derivative transactions settled at clearing organizations, cash collateral exchanged is deemed a settlement of the derivative each day. The
settlement reduces the gross fair value of derivative assets and liabilities and results in a corresponding decrease in the effect of master netting
agreements, with no impact to the consolidated balance sheet.

(c)    The fair value of asset derivatives and liability derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is recorded as trading assets and trading liabilities,

respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet.

(d)    Fair values are on a gross basis, before consideration of master netting agreements, as required by ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging.
(e)    Effect of master netting agreements includes cash collateral received and paid of $1,414 million and $644 million, respectively, at March 31, 2023,

and $1,786 million and $1,823 million, respectively, at Dec. 31, 2022.

Trading activities (including trading derivatives)

Our trading activities are focused on acting as a market-
maker for our customers, facilitating customer trades and
risk-mitigating economic hedging in compliance with the
Volcker Rule. The change in the fair value of the
derivatives utilized in our trading activities is recorded in
foreign exchange revenue and investment and other
revenue on the consolidated income statement.

The following table presents our foreign exchange revenue
and other trading revenue.

Foreign exchange revenue includes income from
purchasing and selling foreign currencies, currency
forwards, futures and options as well as foreign currency
remeasurement. Other trading revenue reflects results from
trading in cash instruments, including fixed income and
equity securities, and

trading and economic hedging activity with non-foreign
exchange derivatives.

We also use derivative financial instruments as risk-
mitigating economic hedges, which are not formally
designated as accounting hedges. This includes hedging the
foreign currency, interest rate or market risks inherent in
some of our balance sheet exposures, such as seed capital
investments and deposits, as well as certain investment
management fee revenue streams. We also use total return
swaps to economically hedge obligations arising from the
Company’s deferred compensation plan whereby the
participants defer compensation and earn a return linked to
the performance of investments they select. The gains or
losses on these total return swaps are recorded in staff
expense on the consolidated income statement and were a
gain of $7 million in the first quarter of 2023, a loss of $13
million in the first quarter of 2022 and a gain of $11
million in the fourth quarter of 2022.

We manage trading risk through a system of position
limits, a value-at-risk (“VaR”) methodology based on
historical simulation and other market sensitivity measures.
Risk is monitored and reported to senior

BNY Mellon 81

 
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

management by a separate unit, independent from trading,
on a daily basis. Based on certain assumptions, the VaR
methodology is designed to capture the potential overnight
pre-tax dollar loss from adverse changes in fair values of
all trading positions. The calculation assumes a one-day
holding period, utilizes a 99% confidence level and
incorporates non-linear product characteristics. The VaR
model is one of several statistical models used to develop
economic capital results, which are allocated to lines of
business for computing risk-adjusted performance.

VaR methodology does not evaluate risk attributable to
extraordinary financial, economic or other occurrences. As
a result, the risk assessment process includes a number of
stress scenarios based upon the risk factors in the portfolio
and management’s assessment of market conditions.
Additional stress scenarios based upon historical market
events are also performed. Stress tests may incorporate the
impact of reduced market liquidity and the breakdown of
historically observed correlations and extreme scenarios.
VaR and other statistical measures, stress testing and
sensitivity analysis are incorporated into other risk
management materials.

Counterparty credit risk and collateral

We assess the credit risk of our counterparties through
regular examination of their financial statements,
confidential communication with the management of those
counterparties and regular monitoring of publicly available
credit rating information. This and other information is
used to develop proprietary credit rating metrics used to
assess credit quality.

Collateral requirements are determined after a
comprehensive review of the credit quality of each
counterparty. Collateral is generally held or pledged in the
form of cash and/or highly liquid government securities.
Collateral requirements are monitored and adjusted daily.

Additional disclosures concerning derivative financial
instruments are provided in Note 15.

Disclosure of contingent features in over-the-counter
(“OTC”) derivative instruments

Certain OTC derivative contracts and/or collateral
agreements contain credit risk-contingent features

triggered upon a rating downgrade in which the
counterparty has the right to request additional collateral or
the right to terminate the contracts in a net liability
position.

derivative contracts in net liability positions that contained
credit risk-contingent features and the value of collateral
that has been posted.

The aggregate fair value of OTC derivative contracts

conditions, composition of counterparty trades, new
business or changes to the contingent features.

The Bank of New York Mellon, our largest banking
subsidiary, enters into the substantial majority of our OTC
derivative contracts and/or collateral agreements. As such,
the contingent features may be triggered if The Bank of
New York Mellon’s long-term issuer rating were
downgraded.

falling under early termination provisions that were in net
liability positions for three key ratings triggers.

us to post additional collateral of $160 million and $214

BNY Mellon’s repurchase agreements and securities
lending transactions primarily encounter risk associated
with liquidity. We are required to pledge collateral based
on predetermined terms within the agreements. If we were
to experience a decline in the fair value of the collateral
pledged for these transactions, we could be required to
provide additional collateral to the counterparty, therefore
decreasing the amount of assets available for other
liquidity needs that may arise. BNY Mellon also offers tri-
party collateral agency services in the tri-party repo market
where we are exposed to credit risk. In order to mitigate
this risk, we require dealers to fully secure intraday credit.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Note 18–Commitments and contingent liabilities

Off-balance sheet arrangements

In the normal course of business, various commitments and
contingent liabilities are outstanding that are not reflected
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Our significant trading and off-balance sheet risks are
securities, foreign currency and interest rate risk
management products, commercial lending commitments,
letters of credit and securities lending indemnifications. We
assume these risks to reduce interest rate and foreign
currency risks, to provide customers with the ability to
meet credit and liquidity needs and to hedge foreign
currency and interest rate risks. These items involve, to
varying degrees, credit, foreign currency and interest rate
risks not recognized on the balance sheet. Our off-balance
sheet risks are managed and monitored in manners similar
to those used for on-balance sheet risks.

Includes cash collateral, invested in indemnified repurchase
agreements, held by us as securities lending agent of $49 billion at
March 31, 2023 and $43 billion at Dec. 31, 2022.

(c)

The total potential loss on undrawn lending commitments,
standby and commercial letters of credit and securities
lending indemnifications is equal to the total notional
amount if drawn upon, which does not consider the value
of any collateral.

Since many of the lending commitments are expected to
expire without being drawn upon, the total amount does
not necessarily represent future cash requirements. A
summary of lending commitment maturities is as follows:
$29.0 billion in less than one year, $19.6 billion in one to
five years and $571 million over five years.

SBLCs principally support obligations of corporate clients
and were collateralized with cash and securities of $172
million at March 31, 2023 and $144 million at Dec. 31,
2022. At March 31, 2023, $1.4 billion of the SBLCs will
expire within one year, $559 million in one to five years
and none over five years.

We must recognize, at the inception of an SBLC and
foreign and other guarantees, a liability for the fair value of
the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The fair
value of the liability, which was recorded with a
corresponding asset in other assets, was estimated as the
present value of contractual customer fees. The estimated
liability for losses related to SBLCs and foreign and other
guarantees, if any, is included in the allowance for lending-
related commitments.

86 BNY Mellon

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Payment/performance risk of SBLCs is monitored using
both historical performance and internal ratings criteria.
BNY Mellon’s historical experience is that SBLCs
typically expire without being funded. SBLCs below
investment grade are monitored closely for
payment/performance risk. The table below shows SBLCs
by investment grade:

Standby letters of credit

A commercial letter of credit is normally a short-term
instrument used to finance a commercial contract for the
shipment of goods from a seller to a buyer. Although the
commercial letter of credit is contingent upon the
satisfaction of specified conditions, it represents a credit
exposure if the buyer defaults on the underlying
transaction. As a result, the total contractual amounts do
not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
Commercial letters of credit totaled $9 million at March
31, 2023 and $19 million at Dec. 31, 2022.

We expect many of the lending commitments and letters of
credit to expire without the need to advance any cash. The
revenue associated with guarantees frequently depends on
the credit rating of the obligor and the structure of the
transaction, including collateral, if any. The allowance for
lending-related commitments was $83 million at March 31,
2023 and $78 million at Dec. 31, 2022.

A securities lending transaction is a fully collateralized
transaction in which the owner of a security agrees to lend
the security (typically through an agent, in our case, The
Bank of New York Mellon) to a borrower, usually a broker-
dealer or bank, on an open, overnight or term basis, under
the terms of a prearranged contract.

We typically lend securities with indemnification against
borrower default. We generally require the borrower to
provide collateral with a minimum value of 102% of the
fair value of the securities borrowed, which is monitored
on a daily basis, thus reducing credit risk. Market risk can
also arise in securities lending transactions. These risks are
controlled through policies limiting the level of risk that
can be undertaken. Securities lending transactions are
generally entered into only with highly rated

counterparties. Securities lending indemnifications were
secured by collateral of $513 billion at March 31, 2023 and
$515 billion at Dec. 31, 2022.

CIBC Mellon, a joint venture between BNY Mellon and
the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (“CIBC”),
engages in securities lending activities.  CIBC Mellon,
BNY Mellon and CIBC jointly and severally indemnify
securities lenders against specific types of borrower
default. At both March 31, 2023 and Dec. 31, 2022, $64
billion of borrowings at CIBC Mellon, for which BNY
Mellon acts as agent on behalf of CIBC Mellon clients,
were secured by collateral of $68 billion. If, upon a default,
a borrower’s collateral was not sufficient to cover its
related obligations, certain losses related to the
indemnification could be covered by the indemnitors.

Unsettled repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements

In the normal course of business, we enter into repurchase
agreements and reverse repurchase agreements that settle
at a future date. In repurchase agreements, BNY Mellon
receives cash from and provides securities as collateral to a
counterparty at settlement. In reverse repurchase
agreements, BNY Mellon advances cash to and receives
securities as collateral from the counterparty at settlement.
These transactions are recorded on the consolidated
balance sheet on the settlement date. At March 31, 2023,
we had $1.6 billion of unsettled repurchase agreements and
$24.7 billion of unsettled reverse repurchase agreements.
At Dec. 31, 2022, we had $4.0 billion of unsettled
repurchase agreements and $11.3 billion of unsettled
reverse repurchase agreements.

Industry concentrations

We have significant industry concentrations related to
credit exposure at March 31, 2023. The tables below

Sponsored member repo program

BNY Mellon is a sponsoring member in the FICC
sponsored member program, where we submit eligible
repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions in U.S.
Treasury and agency securities (“Sponsored Member
Transactions”) between BNY Mellon and our sponsored
member clients for novation and clearing through FICC
pursuant to the FICC Government Securities Division
rulebook (the “FICC Rules”). We also guarantee to FICC
the prompt and full payment and performance of our
sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under the
FICC Rules in connection with such clients’ Sponsored
Member Transactions. We minimize our credit exposure
under this guaranty by obtaining a security interest in our
sponsored member clients’ collateral and rights under
Sponsored Member Transactions. See “Offsetting assets
and liabilities” in Note 17 for additional information on our
repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements.

Indemnification arrangements

We have provided standard representations for
underwriting agreements, acquisition and divestiture
agreements, sales of loans and commitments, and other
similar types of arrangements and customary
indemnification for claims and legal proceedings related to
providing financial services that are not otherwise included
above. Insurance has been purchased to mitigate certain of
these risks. Generally, there are no stated or notional
amounts included in these indemnifications, and the
contingencies triggering the obligation for indemnification
are not expected to occur. Furthermore, often
counterparties to these transactions provide us with
comparable indemnifications. We are unable to develop an
estimate of the maximum payout under these

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

BNY Mellon 87

indemnifications for several reasons. In addition to the lack
of a stated or notional amount in a majority of such
indemnifications, we are unable to predict the nature of
events that would trigger indemnification or the level of
indemnification for a certain event. We believe, however,
that the possibility that we will have to make any material
payments for these indemnifications is remote. At March
31, 2023 and Dec. 31, 2022, we have not recorded any
material liabilities under these arrangements.

Clearing and settlement exchanges

We are a noncontrolling equity investor in, and/or member
of, several industry clearing or settlement exchanges
through which foreign exchange, securities, derivatives or
other transactions settle. Certain of these industry clearing
and settlement exchanges require their members to
guarantee their obligations and liabilities and/or to provide
liquidity support in the event other members do not honor
their obligations. We believe the likelihood that a clearing
or settlement exchange (of which we are a member) would
become insolvent is remote. Additionally, certain
settlement exchanges have implemented loss allocation
policies that enable the exchange to allocate settlement
losses to the members of the exchange. It is not possible to
quantify such mark-to-market loss until the loss occurs.
Any ancillary costs that occur as a result of any mark-to-
market loss cannot be quantified. In addition, we also
sponsor clients as members on clearing and settlement
exchanges and guarantee their obligations. At March 31,
2023 and Dec. 31, 2022, we did not record any material
liabilities under these arrangements.

Legal proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, The Bank of New York
Mellon Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely
named as defendants in or made parties to pending and
potential legal actions. We also are subject to governmental
and regulatory examinations, information-gathering
requests, investigations and proceedings (both formal and
informal). Claims for significant monetary damages are
often asserted in many of these legal actions, while claims
for disgorgement, restitution, penalties and/or other
remedial actions or sanctions may be sought in
governmental and regulatory matters. It is inherently
difficult to predict the eventual outcomes of such matters
given their complexity and the particular facts and
circumstances at issue in each of these matters. However,
on the basis of our current knowledge and

88 BNY Mellon

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

understanding, we do not believe that judgments,
settlements or orders, if any, arising from these matters
(either individually or in the aggregate, after giving effect
to applicable reserves and insurance coverage) will have a
material adverse effect on the consolidated financial
position or liquidity of BNY Mellon, although they could
have a material effect on our results of operations in a
given period.

In view of the inherent unpredictability of outcomes in
litigation and regulatory matters, particularly where (i) the
damages sought are substantial or indeterminate, (ii) the
proceedings are in the early stages, or (iii) the matters
involve novel legal theories or a large number of parties, as
a matter of course there is considerable uncertainty
surrounding the timing or ultimate resolution of litigation
and regulatory matters, including a possible eventual loss,
fine, penalty or business impact, if any, associated with
each such matter. In accordance with applicable accounting
guidance, we establish accruals for litigation and
regulatory matters when those matters proceed to a stage
where they present loss contingencies that are both
probable and reasonably estimable. In such cases, there
may be a possible exposure to loss in excess of any
amounts accrued. We regularly monitor such matters for
developments that could affect the amount of the accrual,
and will adjust the accrual amount as appropriate. If the
loss contingency in question is not both probable and
reasonably estimable, we do not establish an accrual and
the matter continues to be monitored for any developments
that would make the loss contingency both probable and
reasonably estimable. We believe that our accruals for legal
proceedings are appropriate and, in the aggregate, are not
material to the consolidated financial position of BNY
Mellon, although future accruals could have a material
effect on the results of operations in a given period. In
addition, if we have the potential to recover a portion of an
estimated loss from a third party, we record a receivable up
to the amount of the accrual that is probable of recovery.

For certain of those matters described here for which a loss
contingency may, in the future, be reasonably possible
(whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where
there is no accrued liability), BNY Mellon is currently
unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss. For
those matters described here where BNY Mellon is able to
estimate a reasonably possible loss, the aggregate range of
such reasonably possible loss is up to $520 million in

excess of the accrued liability (if any) related to those
matters. For matters where a reasonably possible loss is
denominated in a foreign currency, our estimate is adjusted
quarterly based on prevailing exchange rates. We do not
consider potential recoveries when estimating reasonably
possible losses.

The following describes certain judicial, regulatory and
arbitration proceedings involving BNY Mellon:

Mortgage-Securitization Trusts Proceedings
BNY Mellon has been named as a defendant in a number
of legal actions brought by MBS investors alleging that the
trustee has expansive duties under the governing
agreements, including the duty to investigate and pursue
breach of representation and warranty claims against other
parties to the MBS transactions. Three actions commenced
in December 2014, December 2015 and February 2017 are
pending in New York federal court. In New York state
court, seven actions are pending: one case commenced in
May 2016; three related cases commenced in September
2021 (two cases) and October 2022; and three related cases
commenced in October 2021, December 2021 and
February 2022.

Matters Related to R. Allen Stanford
In late December 2005, Pershing LLC (“Pershing”)
became a clearing firm for Stanford Group Co. (“SGC”), a
registered broker-dealer that was part of a group of entities
ultimately controlled by R. Allen Stanford (“Stanford”).
Stanford International Bank, also controlled by Stanford,
issued certificates of deposit (“CDs”). Some investors
allegedly wired funds from their SGC accounts to purchase
CDs. In 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission
charged Stanford with operating a Ponzi scheme in
connection with the sale of CDs, and SGC was placed into
receivership. Alleged purchasers of CDs have filed two
putative class action proceedings against Pershing: one in
November 2009 in Texas federal court, and one in May
2016 in New Jersey federal court. On Nov. 5, 2021, the
court dismissed the class action filed in New Jersey and
that matter has concluded. Three lawsuits remain against
Pershing in Louisiana and New Jersey federal courts,
which were filed in January 2010, October 2015 and May
2016. The purchasers allege that Pershing, as SGC’s
clearing firm, assisted Stanford in a fraudulent scheme and
assert contractual, statutory and common law claims. In
March 2019, a group of investors filed a putative class
action against The Bank of New York Mellon in New
Jersey federal court, making the same

allegations as in the prior actions brought against Pershing.
On Nov. 12, 2021, the court dismissed the class action
against The Bank of New York Mellon; on Dec. 15, 2022,
an appeals court reversed the dismissal and returned the
case to the trial court for further proceedings. All the cases
that have been brought in federal court against Pershing
have been consolidated in Texas federal court for discovery
purposes. Various alleged Stanford CD purchasers asserted
similar claims in Financial Industry Regulatory Authority,
Inc. (“FINRA”) arbitration proceedings.

Brazilian Postalis Litigation
BNY Mellon Servicos Financeiros DTVM S.A.
(“DTVM”), a subsidiary that provides asset services in
Brazil, acts as administrator for certain investment funds in
which a public pension fund for postal workers called
Postalis-Instituto de Seguridade Social dos Correios e
Telégrafos (“Postalis”) invested. On Aug. 22, 2014,
Postalis sued DTVM in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for losses
related to a Postalis fund for which DTVM is
administrator. Postalis alleges that DTVM failed to
properly perform duties, including to conduct due diligence
of and exert control over the manager. On March 12, 2015,
Postalis filed a lawsuit in Rio de Janeiro against DTVM
and BNY Mellon Administração de Ativos Ltda. (“Ativos”)
alleging failure to properly perform duties relating to
another fund of which DTVM is administrator and Ativos
is manager. On Dec. 14, 2015, Associacão dos
Profissionais dos Correios (“ADCAP”), a Brazilian postal
workers association, filed a lawsuit in São Paulo against
DTVM and other defendants alleging that DTVM
improperly contributed to Postalis investment losses. On
March 20, 2017, the lawsuit was dismissed without
prejudice, and ADCAP appealed. On Aug. 4, 2021, the
appellate court overturned the dismissal and sent the
lawsuit to a state lower court. On March 2, 2023, DTVM
appealed the August 4 decision to Brazil’s Superior Court
of Justice. On Dec. 17, 2015, Postalis filed three lawsuits
in Rio de Janeiro against DTVM and Ativos alleging
failure to properly perform duties with respect to
investments in several other funds. On May 20, 2021, the
court in one of those lawsuits entered a judgment of
approximately $3 million against DTVM and Ativos. On
Aug. 23, 2021, DTVM and Ativos filed an appeal of the
May 20 decision. On June 7, 2022, the appellate court
partially granted and partially denied the appeal, reducing
the judgment to approximately $2 million. DTVM and
Ativos intend to file a further appeal. On

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

BNY Mellon 89

Aug. 24, 2022, the court dismissed one of the other
lawsuits. On Nov. 24, 2022, Postalis appealed that
decision. On Feb. 4, 2016, Postalis filed a lawsuit in
Brasilia against DTVM, Ativos and BNY Mellon Alocação
de Patrimônio Ltda. (“Alocação de Patrimônio”), an
investment management subsidiary, alleging failure to
properly perform duties and liability for losses with respect
to investments in various funds of which the defendants
were administrator and/or manager. On Jan. 16, 2018, the
Brazilian Federal Prosecution Service (“MPF”) filed a civil
lawsuit in São Paulo against DTVM alleging liability for
Postalis losses based on alleged failures to properly
perform certain duties as administrator to certain funds in
which Postalis invested or as controller of Postalis’s own
investment portfolio. On April 18, 2018, the court
dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice. On Aug. 4, 2021,
the appellate court overturned the dismissal and returned
the lawsuit to the lower court. On April 11, 2022, DTVM
appealed the Aug. 4 decision to Brazil’s Superior Court of
Justice. In addition, the Tribunal de Contas da União
(“TCU”), an administrative tribunal, has initiated three
proceedings with the purpose of determining liability for
losses to three investment funds administered by DTVM in
which Postalis was an investor. On Sept. 9, 2020, TCU
rendered a decision in one of the proceedings, finding
DTVM and two former Postalis directors jointly and
severally liable for approximately $50 million. TCU also
imposed on DTVM a fine of approximately $2 million.
DTVM’s administrative appeal of the decision was denied.
On Feb. 25, 2022, DTVM filed a lawsuit in Brazil federal
court in Brasilia seeking annulment of TCU’s decision and
an injunction preventing TCU from enforcing the
judgment. On Aug. 24, 2022, the Brazilian Federal
Attorneys filed an action in Rio de Janeiro court seeking to
enforce the fine portion of the judgment. On Nov. 8, 2022,
the Brasilia federal court in the annulment action granted
DTVM’s request for an injunction, suspending the Sept. 9,
2020 TCU decision until the annulment action is decided.
On Oct. 4, 2019, Postalis and another pension fund filed a
request for arbitration in São Paulo against DTVM and
Ativos alleging liability for losses to an investment fund
for which DTVM was administrator and Ativos was
manager. On March 26, 2021, DTVM and Ativos filed a
lawsuit in São Paulo challenging the decision rendered by
the Arbitration Court with respect to its jurisdiction over
the case. On Feb. 24, 2023, the São Paulo court annulled
the Arbitration Court’s decision that it had jurisdiction. On
Oct. 25, 2019, Postalis

90 BNY Mellon

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

filed a lawsuit in Rio de Janeiro against DTVM and
Alocação de Patrimônio, alleging liability for losses in
another fund for which DTVM was administrator and
Alocação de Patrimônio and Ativos were managers. On
May 9, 2022, the court found DTVM and Alocação de
Patrimônio jointly and severally liable for approximately
$20 million. On Aug. 12, 2022, DTVM and Alocação de
Patrimônio appealed the decision. On June 19, 2020, a
lawsuit was filed in federal court in Rio de Janeiro against
DTVM, Postalis, and various other defendants alleging
liability against DTVM for certain Postalis losses in an
investment fund of which DTVM was administrator. On
Feb. 10, 2021, Postalis and another pension fund served
DTVM in a lawsuit filed in Rio de Janeiro, alleging
liability for losses in another investment fund for which
DTVM was administrator and the other defendant was
manager.

Brazilian Silverado Litigation
DTVM acts as administrator for the Fundo de Investimento
em Direitos Creditórios Multisetorial Silverado Maximum
(“Silverado Maximum Fund”), which invests in
commercial credit receivables. On June 2, 2016, the
Silverado Maximum Fund sued DTVM in its capacity as
administrator, along with Deutsche Bank S.A. - Banco
Alemão in its capacity as custodian and Silverado Gestão e
Investimentos Ltda. in its capacity as investment manager.
The Fund alleges that each of the defendants failed to
fulfill its respective duty, and caused losses to the Fund for
which the defendants are jointly and severally liable.

German Tax Matters
German authorities are investigating past “cum/ex”
trading, which involved the purchase of equity securities
on or shortly before the dividend date, but settled after that
date, potentially resulting in an unwarranted refund of
withholding tax. German authorities have taken the view
that past cum/ex trading may have resulted in tax
avoidance or evasion. European subsidiaries of BNY
Mellon have been informed by German authorities about
investigations into potential cum/ex trading by certain
third-party investment funds, where one of the subsidiaries
had acquired entities that served as depositary and/or fund
manager for those third-party investment funds. We have
received information requests from the authorities relating
to pre-acquisition activity and are cooperating fully with
those requests. In August 2019, the District Court of Bonn
ordered that one of these subsidiaries be joined

as a secondary party in connection with the prosecution of
unrelated individual defendants. Trial commenced in
September 2019. In March 2020, the court stated that it
would refrain from taking action against the subsidiary in
order to expedite the conclusion of the trial. The court
convicted the unrelated individual defendants, and
determined that the cum/ex trading activities of the
relevant third-party investment funds were unlawful. In
November and December 2020 and February 2023, we
received secondary liability notices from the German tax
authorities totaling approximately $150 million (at then-
prevailing exchange rates) related to pre-acquisition
activity in various funds for which the entities we acquired
were depositary and/or fund manager. We have appealed
the notices. In connection with the acquisition of the
subject entities, we obtained an indemnity for liabilities
from the sellers that we intend to pursue as necessary.

Off-Channel Business-Related Communications
The Company has been responding to a request for
information from the SEC concerning compliance with
recordkeeping obligations relating to business
communications transmitted on unapproved electronic
communication platforms. SEC Staff has stated that it is
conducting similar inquiries into recordkeeping practices at
other financial institutions. The Company is cooperating
with the inquiry. In April 2023, the Company received a
similar request from the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission and is cooperating with that inquiry as well.

Note 19–Business segments

We have an internal information system that produces
performance data along product and service lines for our
three principal business segments and the Other segment.
The primary products and services and types of revenue for
our principal businesses and a description of the Other
segment are presented in Note 24 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2022 Annual
Report.

Business accounting principles

Our business data has been determined on an internal
management basis of accounting, rather than GAAP which
is used for consolidated financial reporting. These
measurement principles are designed so that reported
results of the businesses will track their economic
performance.

Business segment results are subject to reclassification
when organizational changes are made, or for refinements
in revenue and expense allocation methodologies.
Refinements are typically reflected on a prospective basis.
There were no reclassification or organization changes in
the first quarter of 2023.

The accounting policies of the businesses are the same as
those described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in our 2022 Annual Report.

The results of our business segments are presented and
analyzed on an internal management reporting basis.

• Revenue amounts reflect fee and other revenue

generated by each business and include revenue for
services provided between the segments that are also
provided to third parties. Fee and other revenue
transferred between businesses under revenue transfer
agreements is included within other fees in each
segment.

• Revenues and expenses associated with specific client
bases are included in those businesses. For example,
foreign exchange activity associated with clients using
custody products is included in the Securities Services
segment.

• Net interest revenue is allocated to businesses based on
the yields on the assets and liabilities generated by each
business. We employ a funds transfer pricing system
that matches funds with the specific assets and liabilities
of each business based on their interest sensitivity and
maturity characteristics.

•

•

•

The provision for credit losses associated with the
respective credit portfolios is reflected in each segment.

Incentives expense related to restricted stock and RSUs
is allocated to the segments.

Support and other indirect expenses, including services
provided between segments that are not provided to
third parties or not subject to a revenue transfer
agreement, are allocated to the businesses based on
internally developed methodologies and reflected in
noninterest expense.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

BNY Mellon 91

• Recurring FDIC expense is allocated to the businesses
based on average deposits generated within each
business.

•

•

Severance expense is recorded in the segments based on
the business or function the impacted employees reside,
with severance related to corporate staff, technology
and operations reflected in the Other segment.

Litigation expense is generally recorded in the business
in which the charge occurs.

• Management of the securities portfolio is a shared

service contained in the Other segment. As a result,
gains and losses associated with the valuation of the
securities portfolio are generally included in the Other
segment.

• Client deposits serve as the primary funding source for

our securities portfolio. We typically allocate all interest
revenue to the businesses generating the deposits.
Accordingly, accretion related to the portion of the
securities portfolio restructured in 2009 has been
included in the results of the businesses.

• Balance sheet assets and liabilities and their related
income or expense are specifically assigned to each
business. Segments with a net liability position have
been allocated assets.

• Goodwill and intangible assets are reflected within

individual businesses.

The following consolidating schedules present the contribution of our segments to our overall profitability.
