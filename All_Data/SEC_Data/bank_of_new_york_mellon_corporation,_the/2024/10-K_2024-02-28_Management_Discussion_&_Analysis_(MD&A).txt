Summary of financial highlights

We reported net income applicable to common 
shareholders of $4.3 billion, or $5.80 per diluted 
common share, in 2024, including the negative 
impact of notable items.  Notable items in 2024 
include severance expense, litigation reserves and the 
net impact of adjustments for the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) special assessment.  
Excluding notable items, net income applicable to 
common shareholders was $4.5 billion (Non-GAAP), 
or $6.03 (Non-GAAP) per diluted common share, in 
2024.  In 2023, net income applicable to common 
shareholders was $3.1 billion, or $3.89 per diluted

common share, including the negative impact of 
notable items.  Notable items in 2023 include the 
initial estimate for the FDIC special assessment, 
severance expense, the reduction in the fair value of a 
contingent consideration receivable, litigation 
reserves and net losses on disposals.  Excluding 
notable items, net income applicable to common 
shareholders was $4.0 billion (Non-GAAP), or $5.07 
(Non-GAAP) per diluted common share, in 2023.

The highlights below are based on 2024 compared 
with 2023, unless otherwise noted.

•

•

Total revenue increased 5%, primarily reflecting:
•

Fee revenue increased 6%, primarily 
reflecting higher market values, net new 
business, higher client activity and foreign 
exchange revenue, partially offset by the mix 
of AUM flows.  (See “Fee and other revenue” 
beginning on page 5.)
Investment and other revenue increased 
primarily reflecting the reduction in the fair 
value of a contingent consideration receivable 
in 2023 and higher client activity in our fixed 
income and equity trading business.  (See 
“Fee and other revenue” beginning on page 
5.)

•

• Net interest income decreased 1%, primarily 
reflecting changes in deposit mix, partially 
offset by higher investment securities 
portfolio yields and balance sheet growth.  
(See “Net interest income” beginning on page 
8.)

The provision for credit losses was $70 million, 
primarily driven by reserve increases related to 
commercial real estate exposure and changes in 
the macroeconomic forecast.  (See “Consolidated 
balance sheet review – Allowance for credit 
losses” beginning on page 33.)

• Noninterest expense decreased 4%, primarily 

reflecting the net impact of adjustments for the 
FDIC special assessment and efficiency savings, 
partially offset by higher investments, employee 
merit increases and revenue-related expenses.  
Excluding notable items, noninterest expense 
increased 1% (Non-GAAP).  (See “Noninterest 
expense” on page 11.)
Effective tax rate of 22.3% in 2024.  (See 
“Income taxes” on page 11.)

• Return on common equity (“ROE”) was 11.9% 
for 2024.  Excluding notable items, the adjusted 
ROE was 12.4% (Non-GAAP) for 2024. 

• Return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) 
was 22.8% (Non-GAAP) for 2024.  Excluding 
notable items, the adjusted ROTCE was 23.8% 
(Non-GAAP) for 2024.

See “Supplemental Information – Explanation of 
GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures” 
beginning on page 115 for reconciliations of the Non-
GAAP measures.

Metrics

• AUC/A totaled $52.1 trillion at Dec. 31, 2024 
compared with $47.8 trillion at Dec. 31, 2023.  
The 9% increase primarily reflects higher market 
values, client inflows and net new business, 
partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a 
stronger U.S. dollar.  (See “Fee and other 
revenue” beginning on page 5.)

• AUM totaled $2.03 trillion at Dec. 31, 2024 

compared with $1.97 trillion at Dec. 31, 2023.  
The 3% increase primarily reflects higher market 
values, partially offset by the unfavorable impact 
of a stronger U.S. dollar.  (See “Review of 
business segments – Investment and Wealth 
Management business segment” beginning on 
page 17.)

Capital and liquidity

• Our CET1 ratio calculated under the Standardized 
Approach was 11.2% at Dec. 31, 2024 and 11.5% 
at Dec. 31, 2023 under the Advanced 
Approaches.  The decrease was primarily driven 
by capital returned through common stock 
repurchases and dividends and higher risk-
weighted assets (“RWAs”), partially offset by 
capital generated through earnings.  (See 
“Capital” beginning on page 39.)

• Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.7% at Dec. 31, 

2024, compared with 6.0% at Dec. 31, 2023.  The 
decrease was driven by higher average assets, 
partially offset by an increase in capital.  (See 
“Capital” beginning on page 39.)

N/M – Not meaningful.

Fee revenue increased 6% compared with 2023, 
primarily reflecting higher investment services fees, 
investment management and performance fees and 
foreign exchange revenue.  

Investment and other revenue increased $207 million 
in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily reflecting the 
reduction in the fair value of a contingent 
consideration receivable in 2023 and higher client 
activity in our fixed income and equity trading 
business. 

Investment services fees

Investment services fees increased 7% compared with 
2023, primarily reflecting higher market values, net 
new business and higher client activity.  

AUC/A totaled $52.1 trillion at Dec. 31, 2024, an 
increase of 9% compared with Dec. 31, 2023, 
primarily reflecting higher market values, client 
inflows and net new business, partially offset by the 
unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.  AUC/A 
consisted of 37% equity securities and 63% fixed-
income securities at Dec. 31, 2024 and 35% equity 
securities and 65% fixed-income securities at Dec. 
31, 2023.

See “Securities Services business segment” and 
“Market and Wealth Services business segment” in 
“Review of business segments” for additional details.

Investment management and performance fees 

Investment management and performance fees 
increased 3% compared with 2023, primarily 
reflecting higher market values, partially offset by the 
mix of AUM flows and lower performance fees.  
Performance fees were $51 million in 2024 and $81 
million in 2023.  On a constant currency basis (Non-
GAAP), investment management and performance 
fees increased 2% compared with 2023.  See 
“Supplemental Information – Explanation of GAAP 
and Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on 
page 115 for the reconciliation of Non-GAAP 
measures.

AUM was $2.0 trillion at Dec. 31, 2024, an increase 
of 3% compared with Dec. 31, 2023, primarily 
reflecting higher market values, partially offset by the 
unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. 

See “Investment and Wealth Management business 
segment” in “Review of business segments” for 
additional details regarding the drivers of investment 
management and performance fees, AUM and AUM 
flows.

Results of Operations (continued)

Foreign exchange revenue

Foreign exchange revenue is primarily driven by the 
volume of client transactions and the spread realized 
on these transactions, both of which are impacted by 
market volatility, the impact of foreign currency 
hedging activities and foreign currency 
remeasurement gain (loss).  In 2024, foreign 
exchange revenue increased 9% compared with 2023, 
primarily reflecting higher volumes.  Foreign 
exchange revenue is primarily reported in the 
Securities Services business segment and, to a lesser 
extent, the Market and Wealth Services and 
Investment and Wealth Management business 
segments and the Other segment. 

Financing-related fees

Financing-related fees, which are primarily reported 
in the Market and Wealth Services and Securities 
Services business segments, include capital market 
fees, loan commitment fees and credit-related fees.  
Financing-related fees increased 13% in 2024 
compared with 2023, primarily reflecting higher 
underwriting fees.

Distribution and servicing fees

Distribution and servicing fees earned from mutual 
funds are primarily based on average assets in the 
funds and the sales of funds that we manage or 
administer, and are primarily reported in the 
Investment Management line of business.  These fees, 
which include 12b-1 fees, fluctuate with the overall 
level of net sales, the relative mix of sales between 
share classes, the funds’ market values and money 
market fee waivers. 

Distribution and servicing fees were $158 million in 
2024 compared with $148 million in 2023, driven by 

higher money market balances.  The impact of 
distribution and servicing fees on income in any one 
period is partially offset by distribution and servicing 
expense paid to other financial intermediaries to 
cover their costs for distribution and servicing of 
mutual funds.  Distribution and servicing expense is 
recorded as noninterest expense on the income 
statement.

Investment and other revenue

Investment and other revenue includes income or loss 
from consolidated investment management funds, 
seed capital gains or losses, other trading revenue or 
loss, renewable energy investments gains or losses, 
income from corporate and bank-owned life 
insurance contracts, other investment gains or losses, 
gains or losses from disposals, expense 
reimbursements from our CIBC Mellon joint venture, 
other income or loss and net securities gains or losses.  
The income or loss from consolidated investment 
management funds should be considered together 
with the net income or loss attributable to 
noncontrolling interests, which reflects the portion of 
the consolidated funds for which we do not have an 
economic interest and is reflected below net income 
as a separate line item on the consolidated income 
statement.  Other trading revenue or loss primarily 
includes the impact of market-risk hedging activity 
related to our seed capital investments in investment 
management funds, non-foreign currency derivative 
and fixed income trading, and other hedging activity.  
Other investment gains or losses includes fair value 
changes of non-readily marketable strategic equity, 
private equity and other investments.  Expense 
reimbursements from our CIBC Mellon joint venture 
relate to expenses incurred by BNY on behalf of the 
CIBC Mellon joint venture.  Other income includes 
various miscellaneous revenues.

Investment and other revenue was $687 million in

increase primarily reflects the reduction in the fair 
value of a contingent consideration receivable in 2023 
and higher client activity in our fixed income and 
equity trading business.

N/M – Not meaningful.
bps – basis points.

Net interest income decreased 1% compared with 
2023, primarily reflecting changes in deposit mix, 
partially offset by higher investment securities 
portfolio yields and balance sheet growth.  

Net interest margin decreased 3 basis points 
compared with 2023.  The decrease primarily reflects 
the factors mentioned above.

Average interest-earning assets increased 2% 
compared with 2023.  The increase primarily reflects 
higher federal funds sold and securities purchased 
under resale agreements, loan balances and securities, 
partially offset by lower interest-bearing deposits 
with the Federal Reserve and other central banks and 
interest-bearing deposits with banks.

Average non-U.S. dollar deposits comprised 
approximately 25% of our average total deposits in 
2024 and 2023.  Approximately 50% of the average 
non-U.S. dollar deposits in 2024 and 45% in 2023 
were euro-denominated.

Net interest income in 2025 will largely depend on 
the level and mix of client deposits and investment 
securities portfolio reinvestment yields.  Based on 
market implied forward interest rates as of Dec. 31, 
2024, we expect net interest income for 2025 to 
increase when compared with 2024.

Includes the average impact of offsetting under enforceable netting agreements of approximately $176 billion in 2024 and $111 billion in 2023.  On a 
Non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of offsetting, the yield on federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements would have been 
5.28% for 2024 and 5.22% for 2023, and the rate on federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements would have been 5.18% 
for 2024 and 5.10% for 2023.  We believe providing the rates excluding the impact of netting is useful to investors as it is more reflective of the actual 
rates earned and paid.
Interest income includes fees of $3 million in 2024 and $1 million in 2023.  Nonaccrual loans are included in average loans; the associated income, 
which was recognized on a cash basis, is included in interest income.

Total noninterest expense decreased 4% compared 
with 2023, primarily reflecting the net impact of 
adjustments for the FDIC special assessment and 
efficiency savings, partially offset by higher 
investments, employee merit increases and revenue-
related expenses.  Excluding notable items, 
noninterest expense increased 1% (Non-GAAP).  See 
“Supervision and Regulation – FDIC Deposit 
Insurance” beginning on page 67 for information on 
the FDIC special assessment.  See “Supplemental 
Information – Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP 
financial measures” beginning on page 115 for the 
reconciliation of the Non-GAAP measure.

We expect total noninterest expense for 2025 to 
increase slightly compared with 2024, primarily 
reflecting incremental investments and higher 
revenue-related expenses, partially offset by the 
benefit of efficiency savings.

Income taxes

BNY recorded an income tax provision of $1.3 billion 
(22.3% effective tax rate) in 2024.  The income tax 
provision was $979 million (22.9% effective tax rate) 
in 2023. 

On Jan. 1, 2024, we adopted ASU 2023-02, 
Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures 
(Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax 
Credit Structures Using the Proportional 
Amortization Method, on a retrospective basis.  See 
Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 

Statements for additional information on the new 
accounting guidance.

For additional information on income taxes, see Note 
12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Review of business segments

We have an internal information system that produces 
performance data along product and service lines for 
our three principal business segments: Securities 
Services, Market and Wealth Services and Investment 
and Wealth Management, and the Other segment. 

Business segment accounting principles

Our business segment data has been determined on an 
internal management basis of accounting, rather than 
the generally accepted accounting principles 
(“GAAP”) used for consolidated financial reporting.  
These measurement principles are designed so that 
reported results of the businesses will track their 
economic performance. 

Our business segments are consistent with the 
structure used by the President and Chief Executive 
Officer, our Chief Operating Decision Maker 
(“CODM”), to make key operating decisions and 
assess performance.  Our CODM evaluates the 
business segments’ operating performance primarily 
based on fee and other revenue, total revenue, income 
before income taxes, and pre-tax operating margin.  
The significant expense information regularly 

BNY 11

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Results of Operations (continued)

provided to and reviewed by the CODM is total 
noninterest expense.  The CODM considers this 
information when evaluating the performance of each 
business segment and making decisions about 
allocating capital and other resources to each business 
segment.  

For information on the accounting principles of our 
business segments, the primary products and services 
in each line of business, the primary types of revenue 
by line of business and how our business segments 
are presented and analyzed, see Note 24 of the Notes 
to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Business segment results are subject to 
reclassification when organizational changes are 
made, or for refinements in revenue and expense 
allocation methodologies.  Refinements are typically 
reflected on a prospective basis.  In 2024, we made 
certain realignments of similar products and services 
within our lines of business consistent with the firm’s 
ongoing transition to a platforms operating model 
uniting related capabilities and enabling streamlining 
of internal processes to drive growth, efficiency, 
resiliency, and enhanced risk management.  The 
largest change was the movement of Institutional 
Solutions from Pershing to Clearance and Collateral 
Management, both in the Market and Wealth Services 
business segment.  We made other smaller changes 
that moved activity from Asset Servicing in the 
Securities Services business segment to Treasury 
Services in the Market and Wealth Services business 
segment, and from Wealth Management in the 
Investment and Wealth Management business 
segment and Pershing in the Market and Wealth 
Services business segment to Investment 
Management in the Investment and Wealth 
Management business segment.  The Other segment 
was not impacted by the changes.  Business segment 
results for 2023 and 2022 have been revised to reflect 
these changes.  

The results of our business segments may be 
influenced by client and other activities that vary by 
quarter.  In the first quarter, staff expense typically 
increases, reflecting the vesting of long-term stock 
awards for retirement-eligible employees.  The timing 
of our annual employee merit increases also impacts 

12 BNY

staff expense.  In 2024, the merit increase was 
effective in March and in 2023, the merit increase 
was effective in April, thus partially impacting the 
full-year staff expense variances.  In the third quarter, 
volume-related fees may decline due to reduced client 
activity.  In the fourth quarter, we typically incur 
higher business development and marketing 
expenses.  In our Investment and Wealth 
Management business segment, performance fees are 
typically higher in the fourth and first quarters, as 
those quarters represent the end of the measurement 
period for many of the performance fee-eligible 
relationships.  

The results of our business segments may also be 
impacted by the translation of financial results 
denominated in foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar.  
We are primarily impacted by activities denominated 
in the British pound and the euro.  On a consolidated 
basis and in our Securities Services and Market and 
Wealth Services business segments, we typically have 
more foreign currency-denominated expenses than 
revenues.  However, our Investment and Wealth 
Management business segment typically has more 
foreign currency-denominated revenues than 
expenses.  Overall, currency fluctuations impact the 
year-over-year growth rate in the Investment and 
Wealth Management business segment more than the 
Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services 
business segments.  However, currency fluctuations, 
in isolation, are not expected to significantly impact 
net income on a consolidated basis.

Fee revenue in the Investment and Wealth 
Management business segment, and to a lesser extent, 
the Securities Services and Market and Wealth 
Services business segments, is impacted by global 
market fluctuations.  At Dec. 31, 2024, we estimated 
that a 5% change in global equity markets, spread 
evenly throughout the year, would impact fee revenue 
by less than 1% and diluted earnings per common 
share by $0.05 to $0.08. 

See Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements for the consolidating schedules which 
show the contribution of our business segments to our 
overall profitability.

Business segment description

The Securities Services business segment consists of 
two distinct lines of business, Asset Servicing and 
Issuer Services, which provide business solutions 
across the transaction lifecycle to our global asset 
owner and asset manager clients.  We are one of the 
leading global investment services providers with 
$37.7 trillion of AUC/A at Dec. 31, 2024.  For 
information on the drivers of the Securities Services 
fee revenue, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements.  

The Asset Servicing business provides a 
comprehensive suite of solutions.  We are one of the 
largest global custody, fund administrator and front-
to-back outsourcing partners.  We offer services for 
the safekeeping of assets in capital markets globally 
as well as fund accounting services, exchange-traded 
funds servicing, transfer agency, trust and depository, 
front-to-back capabilities and data and analytics 
solutions for our clients.  We deliver foreign 
exchange, and securities lending and financing 
solutions, on both an agency and principal basis.  Our 
agency securities lending program is one of the 
largest lenders of U.S. and non-U.S. securities, 
servicing a lendable asset pool of approximately $5.4 
trillion in 34 separate markets.  Our market-leading 
liquidity services portal enables cash investments for 
institutional clients and includes fund research and 
analytics.

Our Digital Asset Custody platform offers custody 
and administration services for Bitcoin and Ether for 
select U.S. institutional clients.  Our Digital Assets 
Funds Services provides accounting and 
administration, transfer agency and ETF services to 
digital asset funds.  We continue to develop our 
digital asset capabilities working closely with clients 
to address their evolving digital asset needs.  As of 
and for the year ended Dec. 31, 2024, our Digital 
Asset Custody platform and related initiatives had a 
de minimis impact on our assets, liabilities, revenues 
and expenses.

The Issuer Services business includes Corporate 
Trust and Depositary Receipts.  Our Corporate 
Trust business delivers a full range of issuer and 
related investor services, including trustee, paying 
agency, fiduciary, escrow and other financial 

14 BNY

services.  We are a leading provider to the debt 
capital markets, providing customized and market-
driven solutions to investors, bondholders and 
lenders.  Our Depositary Receipts business drives 
global investing by providing servicing and value-
added solutions that enable, facilitate and enhance 
cross-border trading, clearing, settlement and 
ownership.  We are one of the largest providers of 
depositary receipts services in the world, partnering 
with leading companies from more than 50 
countries.

Review of financial results

AUC/A of $37.7 trillion increased 10% compared 
with Dec. 31, 2023, primarily reflecting higher 
market values, client inflows and net new business, 
partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a 
stronger U.S. dollar.  

Total revenue of $8.9 billion increased 4% compared 
with 2023.  The drivers of total revenue by line of 
business are indicated below.

Asset Servicing revenue of $6.9 billion increased 4% 
compared with 2023, primarily reflecting higher 
market values, net new business, higher client 
activity, including in our fixed income and trading 
business, and higher foreign exchange revenue, 
partially offset by lower net interest income.

Issuer Services revenue of $2.0 billion increased 3% 
compared with 2023, primarily reflecting Corporate 
Trust fees driven by net new business, partially offset 
by lower Depositary Receipts revenue.

Market and regulatory trends are driving investable 
assets toward lower fee asset management products at 
reduced margins for our clients.  These dynamics are 
also negatively impacting our investment services 
fees.  However, at the same time, these trends are 
providing additional outsourcing opportunities as 
clients and other market participants seek to comply 
with regulations and reduce their operating costs. 

Noninterest expense of $6.3 billion decreased 1% 
compared with 2023, primarily reflecting efficiency 
savings, partially offset by higher investments and 
employee merit increases.

Business segment description

The Market and Wealth Services business segment 
consists of three distinct lines of business, Pershing, 
Treasury Services and Clearance and Collateral 
Management, which provide business services and 
technology solutions to entities including financial 
institutions, corporations, foundations and 
endowments, public funds and government agencies.  
For information on the drivers of the Market and 
Wealth Services fee revenue, see Note 10 of the 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Pershing provides execution, clearing, custody, 
business and technology solutions, delivering 
operational support to broker-dealers, wealth 
managers and registered investment advisors 
(“RIAs”) globally. 

Our Treasury Services business is a leading 
provider of global payments, liquidity management 
and trade finance services for financial institutions, 
corporations and the public sector.

Our Clearance and Collateral Management 
business clears and settles equity and fixed-income 
transactions globally and serves as custodian for 
tri-party repo collateral worldwide.  We are the 
primary provider of U.S. government securities 
clearance and a provider of non-U.S. government 
securities clearance.  Our collateral services 
include collateral management, administration and 
segregation.  We offer innovative solutions and 
industry expertise which help financial institutions 
and institutional investors with their financing, risk 
and balance sheet challenges.  We are a leading 
provider of tri-party collateral management 
services with an average of $5.4 trillion serviced 

globally including approximately $4.2 trillion of 
the U.S. tri-party repo market in 2024. 

Review of financial results

AUC/A of $14.1 trillion increased 6% compared with 
Dec. 31, 2023, primarily reflecting net client inflows 
in the Clearance and Collateral Management business 
and higher market values.

Total revenue of $6.3 billion increased 7% compared 
with 2023.  The drivers of total revenue by line of 
business are indicated below.

Pershing revenue of $2.7 billion increased 3% 
compared with 2023, primarily reflecting higher 
market values and client activity, partially offset by 
lost business in the prior year and lower net interest 
income.  Net new assets of $(6) billion in 2024 
reflects the deconversion of business lost in the prior 
year.

Treasury Services revenue of $1.7 billion increased 
6% compared with 2023, primarily reflecting net new 
business, higher client activity and higher net interest 
income.

Clearance and Collateral Management revenue of 
$1.8 billion increased 14% compared with 2023, 
primarily reflecting higher collateral management 
fees, clearance volumes and net interest income.

Noninterest expense of $3.4 billion increased 5% 
compared with 2023, primarily reflecting higher 
investments, employee merit increases and higher 
revenue-related expenses, partially offset by 
efficiency savings.

Business segment description

Our Investment and Wealth Management business 
segment consists of two distinct lines of business, 
Investment Management and Wealth Management, 
which have a combined AUM of $2.0 trillion as of 
Dec. 31, 2024.

Investment Management is a leading global asset 
manager and consists of seven specialist investment 
firms and a global distribution platform to deliver a 
diversified range of investment capabilities to 
institutional and retail clients globally.  

18 BNY

Our Investment Management model provides 
specialist expertise from seven investment firms 
offering solutions across major asset classes, backed 
by the strength, scale and proven stewardship of 
BNY.  Each investment firm has its own individual 
culture, investment philosophy and proprietary 
investment process.  This approach brings our clients 
clear, independent thinking from highly experienced 
investment professionals.

The investment firms offer a broad range of actively 
managed equity, fixed income, multi-asset and 
liability-driven investments, along with passive 
products and cash management.  Our six majority-
owned investment firms are: ARX, Dreyfus, Insight 
Investment, Mellon, Newton Investment Management 
and Walter Scott.  BNY owns a noncontrolling 
interest in Siguler Guff.

Investment Management has multiple global 
distribution entities, which are responsible for 
distributing the investment solutions developed and 
managed by the investment firms, as well as the 
management and distribution of our U.S. mutual 
funds, ETFs and certain offshore money market 
funds.

Wealth Management provides investment 
management, custody, wealth and estate planning, 
private banking services, investment servicing and 
information management.  Wealth Management has 
$327 billion in client assets as of Dec. 31, 2024, and 
more than 30 offices in the U.S. and internationally.  

Wealth Management clients include individuals, 
families and institutions.  Institutions include family 
offices, charitable gift programs and endowments and 
foundations.  We work with clients to build, manage 
and sustain wealth across generations and market 
cycles. 

The wealth business differentiates itself with a 
comprehensive wealth management framework called 
Active Wealth that seeks to empower clients to build 
and sustain long-term wealth.

The results of the Investment and Wealth 
Management business segment are driven by a blend 
of daily, monthly and quarterly AUM by product 
type.  The overall level of AUM for a given period is 
determined by:

•

the beginning level of AUM;

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Results of Operations (continued)

•

•

the net flows of new assets during the period 
resulting from new business wins and existing 
client inflows, reduced by the loss of clients and 
existing client outflows; and

the impact of market price appreciation or 
depreciation, foreign exchange rates and 
investment firm acquisitions or divestitures.

The mix of AUM is a result of the historical growth 
rates of equity and fixed income markets and the 
cumulative net flows of our investment firms as a 
result of client asset allocation decisions.  Actively 
managed equity, multi-asset and alternative assets 
typically generate higher percentage fees than fixed-
income and liability-driven investments and cash.  
Also, actively managed assets typically generate 
higher management fees than indexed or passively 
managed assets of the same type.  Market and 
regulatory trends have resulted in increased demand 
for lower fee asset management products and for 
performance-based fees. 

Investment management fees are dependent on the 
overall level and mix of AUM and the management 
fees expressed in basis points (one-hundredth of one 
percent) charged for managing those assets.  
Management fees are typically subject to fee 
schedules based on the overall level of assets 
managed for a single client or by individual asset 
class and style.  This is most common for institutional 
clients where we typically manage substantial assets 
for individual accounts.  

Performance fees are generally calculated as a 
percentage of a portfolio’s performance in excess of a 
benchmark index or a peer group’s performance.  

A key driver of growth in investment management 
and performance fees is the amount of net new AUM 
flows.  Overall market conditions are also key 
drivers, with a significant long-term economic driver 
being growth of global financial assets.  

Net interest income is determined by loan and deposit 
volumes and the interest rate spread between 

customer rates and internal funds transfer rates on 
loans and deposits.  Expenses in the Investment and 
Wealth Management business segment are mainly 
driven by staff and distribution and servicing 
expenses.  

Review of financial results

AUM of $2.0 trillion increased 3% compared with 
Dec. 31, 2023, primarily reflecting higher market 
values, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a 
stronger U.S. dollar. 

Net long-term strategy outflows were $52 billion in 
2024, driven by outflows of index, equity and multi-
asset and alternative investments, partially offset by 
inflows of fixed income and liability-driven 
investments.  Short-term strategy inflows were $45 
billion in 2024.  

Total revenue of $3.4 billion increased 7% compared 
with 2023.  The drivers of total revenue by line of 
business are indicated below.

Investment Management revenue of $2.3 billion 
increased 9% compared with 2023, primarily 
reflecting higher market values and the reduction in 
the fair value of a contingent consideration receivable 
in 2023, partially offset by the mix of AUM flows 
and lower performance fees.

Wealth Management revenue of $1.1 billion 
increased 5% compared with 2023, primarily 
reflecting higher market values, partially offset by 
changes in product mix.

Revenue generated in the Investment and Wealth 
Management business segment included 30% from 
non-U.S. sources in 2024, compared with 32% in 
2023.

Noninterest expense of $2.8 billion was flat compared 
with 2023, primarily reflecting employee merit 
increases and higher investments, offset by efficiency 
savings.

gains recorded in 2023 and higher net securities 
losses.

Noninterest expense decreased $702 million 
compared with 2023, primarily driven by adjustments 
for the FDIC special assessment. 

International operations

Our primary international activities consist of asset 
servicing in our Securities Services business segment, 
global payment services in our Market and Wealth 
Services business segment and investment 
management in our Investment and Wealth 
Management business segment.  

Our clients include central banks and sovereigns, 
financial institutions, asset managers, insurance 
companies, corporations, local authorities and high-
net-worth individuals and family offices.  Through 
our global network of offices, we have developed a 
deep understanding of local requirements and cultural 
needs, and we pride ourselves on providing dedicated 
service through our multilingual sales, marketing and 
client service teams.

At Dec. 31, 2024, approximately 60% of our total 
employees (full-time and part-time employees) were 
based outside the U.S., with approximately 10,900 
employees in EMEA, approximately 18,900 
employees in APAC and approximately 800 
employees in other global locations, primarily Brazil. 

We are a leading global asset manager.  Our 
international operations managed 47% of BNY’s 
AUM at Dec. 31, 2024 and 51% at Dec. 31, 2023.

 
 
 
 
 
 
Results of Operations (continued)

In Europe, we maintain capabilities to service 
Undertakings for Collective Investment in 
Transferable Securities and alternative investment 
funds.  We offer a full range of tailored solutions for 
investment companies, financial institutions and 
institutional investors across most European markets.  

We are a provider of non-U.S. government securities, 
fixed income and equities clearance, settling 
securities transactions directly in European markets, 
and using a high-quality and established network of 
local agents in non-European markets.

We have extensive experience providing trade and 
cash services to financial institutions and central 
banks outside of the U.S.  In addition, we offer a 
broad range of servicing and fiduciary products to 
financial institutions, corporations and central banks.  
In emerging markets, we lead with custody, global 
payments and issuer services, introducing other 
products as the markets mature.  For more established 
markets, our focus is on global investment services.

We are also a full-service global provider of foreign 
exchange services, actively trading in over 100 of the 
world’s currencies.  We serve clients from trading 
desks located in Europe, Asia and North America.

Our financial results, as well as our levels of AUC/A 
and AUM, are impacted by translation from foreign 
currencies to the U.S. dollar.  We are primarily 
impacted by activities denominated in the British 
pound and the euro.  If the U.S. dollar depreciates 
against these currencies, the translation impact is a 
higher level of fee revenue, net interest income, 
noninterest expense and AUC/A and AUM.  
Conversely, if the U.S. dollar appreciates, the 
translated levels of fee revenue, net interest income, 
noninterest expense and AUC/A and AUM will be 
lower.

International clients accounted for 35% of revenues in 
2024 and 36% in 2023.  Net income from 
international operations was $2.3 billion in 2024, 
compared with $2.0 billion in 2023.

Revenues from EMEA were $4.3 billion in 2024, an 
increase of 4% compared with 2023.  The increase 
was primarily driven by higher net interest income, 
collateral management fees and clearance volumes in 
the Market and Wealth Services business segment.  

The Securities Services, Market and Wealth Services 
and Investment and Wealth Management business 
segments generated 58%, 24% and 18% of EMEA 
revenues, respectively.  Net income from EMEA was 
$1.3 billion in 2024, compared with $1.1 billion in 
2023.

Revenues from APAC were $1.3 billion in 2024, a 
decrease of 1% compared with 2023.  The decrease 
primarily reflects lower revenue in the Market and 
Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth 
Management business segments, partially offset by 
higher revenue in the Securities Services business 
segment.  

The Securities Services, Market and Wealth Services 
and Investment and Wealth Management business 
segments generated 60%, 30% and 10% of APAC 
revenues, respectively.  Net income from APAC was 
$542 million in 2024, compared with $547 million in 
2023.

Country risk exposure

The following table presents BNY’s top 10 exposures 
by country (excluding the U.S.) as of Dec. 31, 2024, 
as well as certain countries with higher-risk profiles. 
The exposure is presented on an internal risk 
management basis and has not been reduced by the 
allowance for credit losses.  We monitor our exposure 
to these and other countries as part of our internal 
country risk management process.  

The country risk exposure below reflects the 
Company’s risk to an immediate default of the 
counterparty or obligor based on the country of 
residence of the entity which incurs the liability.  If 
there is credit risk mitigation, the country of residence 
of the entity providing the risk mitigation is the 
country of risk.  The country of risk for securities is 
generally based on the domicile of the issuer of the 
security.

Events in recent years have resulted in increased 
focus on Brazil.  The country risk exposure to Brazil 
is primarily short-term trade finance loans extended 
to large financial institutions.  We also have 
operations in Brazil providing investment services 
and investment management services. 

The war in Ukraine has increased our focus on 
Russia.  The country risk exposure to Russia consists 
of cash balances related to our securities services 
businesses and may increase in the future to the 
extent cash is received for the benefit of our clients 
that is subject to distribution restrictions.  BNY has 
ceased new banking business in Russia and 
suspended investment management purchases of 
Russian securities.  Russian securities included in our 
AUC/A and AUM at Dec. 31, 2024, continue to be 
insignificant as a percentage of the total AUC/A and 
AUM, respectively.  We will continue to work with 

22 BNY

multinational clients that depend on our custody and 
recordkeeping services to manage their exposures.  

We are also monitoring our exposure to Israel as part 
of our internal country risk management process.  At 
Dec. 31, 2024, our total exposure to Israel was $158 
million and primarily consisted of investment grade 
short-term interest-bearing deposits and OTC 
derivatives maturing within six months.

Critical accounting estimates

Our significant accounting policies are described in 
Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements.  Certain of these policies include critical 
accounting estimates which require management to 
make subjective or complex judgments about the 
effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and 
may change in subsequent periods.  Our critical 
accounting estimates are those related to the

allowance for credit losses, goodwill and other 
intangibles and litigation and regulatory 
contingencies.  Management has discussed the 
development and selection of the critical accounting 
estimates with the Company’s Audit Committee.

Allowance for credit losses

The allowance for credit losses covers financial assets 
subject to credit losses and measured at amortized 
cost, including loans and lending-related 
commitments, held-to-maturity securities, certain 
securities financing transactions and deposits with 
banks.  The allowance for credit losses is intended to 
adjust the carrying value of these assets by an 
estimated amount of credit losses that we expect to 
incur over the life of the asset.  Similarly, the 
allowance for credit losses on lending-related 
commitments and other off-balance sheet financial 
instruments is meant to capture the credit losses that 
we expect to recognize in these portfolios as of the 
balance sheet date.

A quantitative methodology and qualitative 
framework is used to estimate the allowance for 
credit losses.  

The quantitative component of our estimate uses 
models and methodologies that categorize financial 
assets based on product type, collateral type, and 
other credit trends and risk characteristics, including 
relevant information about past events, current 
conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts 
of future economic conditions that affect the 
collectability of the recorded amounts.  For the 
quantitative component, we segment portfolios into 
various major components including commercial 
loans and lease financing, commercial real estate, 
financial institutions, residential mortgages, and 
other.  The segmentation of our debt securities 
portfolios is by major asset class and is influenced by 
whether the security is structured or non-structured 
(i.e., direct obligation), as well as the issuer type.  The 
components of the credit loss calculation for each 
major portfolio or asset class include a probability of 
default, loss given default and exposure at default, as 
applicable, and their values depend on the forecast 
behavior of variables in the macroeconomic 
environment.  We utilize a multi-scenario 
macroeconomic forecast which includes a weighting 
of three scenarios: a baseline and upside and 
downside scenarios and allows us to develop our 
estimate using a wide span of economic variables.  

Our baseline scenario reflects a view on likely 
performance of each global region and the other two 
scenarios are designed relative to the baseline 
scenario.  This approach incorporates a reasonable 
and supportable forecast period spanning the life of 
the asset, and includes both an initial estimated 
economic outlook component as well as a reversion 
component for each economic input variable.  The 
length of each of the two components depends on the 
underlying financial instrument, scenario, and 
underlying economic input variable.  In general, the 
initial economic outlook period for each economic 
input variable under each scenario ranges between 
several months and two years.  The speed at which 
the scenario-specific forecasts revert to long-term 
historical mean is based on observed historical 
patterns of mean reversion at the economic variable 
input level that are reflected in our model parameter 
estimates.  Certain macroeconomic variables such as 
unemployment or home prices take longer to revert 
after a contraction, though specific recovery times are 
scenario-specific.  Reversion will usually take longer 
the further away the scenario-specific forecast is from 
the historical mean.  On a quarterly basis, and within 
a developed governance structure, we update these 
scenarios for current economic conditions and may 
adjust the scenario weighting based on our economic 
outlook.  The Company uses judgment to assess these 
economic conditions and loss data in determining the 
best estimate of the allowance for credit losses and 
these estimates are subject to periodic refinement 
based on changes to underlying external or Company-
specific historical data.

In the quantitative component of our estimate, we 
measure expected credit losses using an individual 
evaluation method if the risk characteristics of the 
asset is no longer consistent with the portfolio or class 
of asset.  For these assets, we do not employ the 
macroeconomic model calculation but consider 
factors such as payment status, collateral value, the 
obligor’s financial condition, guarantor support, the 
probability of collecting scheduled principal and 
interest payments when due, and recovery 
expectations if they can be reasonably estimated.  For 
loans, we measure the expected credit loss as the 
difference between the amortized cost basis of the 
loan and the present value of the expected future cash 
flows from the borrower which is generally 
discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, or the 
fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral-
dependent.  We generally individually evaluate 

BNY 23

Results of Operations (continued)

nonperforming loans as well as loans that have been 
modified given the risk characteristics of such loans. 

Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair 
value.  When an available-for-sale debt security is in 
an unrealized loss position, we employ a 
methodology to identify and estimate the credit loss 
portion of the unrealized loss position.  The 
measurement of expected credit losses is performed at 
the security level and is based on our best single 
estimate of cash flows, on a discounted basis; 
however, we do not specifically employ the 
macroeconomic forecasting models and scenarios 
summarized above. 

The qualitative component of our estimate for the 
allowance for credit losses is intended to capture 
expected losses that may not have been fully captured 
in the quantitative component.  Through an 
established governance structure, management 
determines the qualitative allowance each period 
based on an evaluation of various internal and 
environmental factors that include: scenario 
weighting and sensitivity risk, credit concentration 
risk, economic conditions and other considerations.  
We have made and may continue to make 
adjustments for idiosyncratic risks.

To the extent actual results differ from forecasts or 
management’s judgment, the allowance for credit 
losses may be greater or less than future charge-offs 
and recoveries.

Our allowance for credit losses is sensitive to a 
number of inputs, most notably the macroeconomic 
forecast assumptions that are incorporated into our 
estimate of credit losses through the expected life of 
the loan portfolio, as well as credit ratings assigned to 
each borrower.  As the macroeconomic environment 
and related forecasts change, the allowance for credit 
losses may change materially.  The following 
sensitivity analyses do not represent management’s 
expectations of the deterioration of our portfolios or 
the economic environment, but are provided as 
hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the 
allowance for credit losses to changes in key inputs.  
If commercial real estate property values were 
increased 10% and all other credits were rated one 
grade better, the quantitative allowance would have 
decreased by $47 million, and if commercial real 
estate property values were decreased 10% and all 
other credits were rated one grade worse, the 
quantitative allowance would have increased by $82 

24 BNY

million.  Our multi-scenario macroeconomic forecast 
used in determining the Dec. 31, 2024 allowance for 
credit losses consisted of three scenarios.  The 
baseline scenario reflects positive but slightly 
declining GDP growth through the first quarter of 
2025 before moderating, stable unemployment and 
slightly declining commercial real estate prices 
through the end of 2025.  The upside scenario reflects 
higher GDP growth through the first quarter of 2025 
before moderating, declining unemployment through 
the end of 2025 and increasing commercial real estate 
prices through the end of 2025 compared with the 
baseline.  The downside scenario contemplates 
negative GDP growth through the third quarter of 
2025 before moderating, rapidly increasing 
unemployment through the third quarter of 2025 and 
sharply lower commercial real estate prices through 
the end of 2025 compared with the baseline.  At Dec. 
31, 2024, we placed the most weight on our baseline 
scenario, with the remaining weighting equally placed 
on the upside and downside scenarios.  From a 
sensitivity perspective, at Dec. 31, 2024, if we had 
applied 100% weighting to the downside scenario, the 
quantitative allowance for credit losses would have 
been approximately $130 million higher.

See Notes 1 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements for additional information 
regarding the allowance for credit losses. 

Goodwill and other intangibles

We initially record all assets and liabilities acquired 
in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill, 
indefinite-lived intangibles and other intangibles, in 
accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 
(“ASC”) 805, Business Combinations.  Goodwill, 
indefinite-lived intangibles and other intangibles are 
subsequently accounted for in accordance with ASC 
350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other.  The initial 
measurement of goodwill and intangibles requires 
judgment concerning estimates of the fair value of the 
acquired assets and liabilities.  Goodwill ($16.6 
billion at Dec. 31, 2024) and indefinite-lived 
intangible assets ($2.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2024) are 
not amortized but are subject to tests for impairment 
annually or more often if events or circumstances 
indicate it is more likely than not they may be 
impaired.  Other intangible assets are amortized over 
their estimated useful lives and are subject to 
impairment if events or circumstances indicate a 
possible inability to realize the carrying value. 

Results of Operations (continued)

Goodwill

BNY’s business segments include seven reporting 
units for which goodwill impairment testing is 
performed on an annual basis.  An interim goodwill 
impairment test is performed when events or 
circumstances occur that may indicate that it is more 
likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit 
may be less than its carrying value.

The goodwill impairment test compares the estimated 
fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying 
amount, including goodwill.  If the estimated fair 
value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying 
amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered 
not impaired.  However, if the carrying amount of the 
reporting unit were to exceed its estimated fair value, 
an impairment loss would be recorded for the 
difference.  

In each quarter of 2024, we completed an interim 
goodwill impairment test of the Investment 
Management reporting unit, which had $6.0 billion of 
allocated goodwill as of Dec. 31, 2024.  In all cases, 
we determined the fair value of the Investment 
Management reporting unit exceeded its carrying 
value and no goodwill impairment was recorded.

For the Dec. 31, 2024 test, the fair value of the 
Investment Management reporting unit exceeded its 
carrying value by approximately 11%.  We 
determined the fair value of the Investment 
Management reporting unit using an income approach 
based on management’s projections as of Dec. 31, 
2024.  The discount rate applied to these cash flows 
was 10.5%.

As of Dec. 31, 2024, if the discount rate applied to 
the estimated cash flows was increased or decreased 
by 25 basis points, the fair value of the Investment 
Management reporting unit would decrease or 
increase by 4%, respectively.  Similarly, if the long-
term growth rate was increased or decreased by 10 
basis points, the fair value of the Investment 
Management reporting unit would increase or 
decrease by approximately 1%, respectively.

In the second quarter of 2024, we performed our 
annual goodwill impairment test on the remaining six 
reporting units using an income approach to estimate 
the fair values of each reporting unit.  Estimated cash 
flows used in the income approach were based on 

management’s projections as of April 1, 2024.  The 
discount rate applied to these cash flows was 10%.  

As a result of the annual goodwill impairment test, no 
goodwill impairment was recognized.  The fair values 
of the Company’s remaining six reporting units were 
substantially in excess of the respective reporting 
units’ carrying value.  

Intangible assets

Key judgments in accounting for intangible assets 
include determining the useful life and classification 
between goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible 
assets or other amortizing intangible assets. 

Indefinite-lived intangible assets ($2.6 billion at Dec. 
31, 2024) are evaluated for impairment at least 
annually by comparing their fair values, estimated 
using discounted cash flow analyses, to their carrying 
values.  As a result of the annual evaluation, no 
impairment was recognized.

Other amortizing intangible assets ($275 million at 
Dec. 31, 2024) are evaluated for impairment if events 
and circumstances indicate a possible impairment.  
Such evaluation of other intangible assets would be 
initially based on undiscounted cash flow projections. 

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or 
indefinite-lived intangible assets is subject to 
uncertainty as it is reliant on estimates of cash flows 
that extend far into the future, and, by their nature, are 
difficult to estimate over such an extended time 
frame.  In the future, changes in the assumptions or 
the discount rate could produce a material non-cash 
goodwill or intangible asset impairment. 

See Notes 1 and 7 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements for additional information 
regarding goodwill, intangible assets and the annual 
and interim impairment testing. 

Litigation and regulatory contingencies

Significant estimates and judgments are required in 
establishing an accrued liability for litigation and 
regulatory contingencies.  For additional information 
on our policy, see “Legal proceedings” in Note 22 of 
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Consolidated balance sheet review

One of our key risk management objectives is to 
maintain a balance sheet that remains strong 
throughout market cycles to meet the expectations of 
our major stakeholders, including our shareholders, 
clients, creditors and regulators. 

We also seek to undertake overall liquidity risk, 
including intraday liquidity risk, that stays within our 
risk appetite.  The objective of our balance sheet 
management strategy is to maintain a balance sheet 
that is characterized by strong liquidity and asset 
quality, ready access to external funding sources at 
competitive rates and a strong capital structure that 
supports our risk-taking activities and is adequate to 
absorb potential losses.  In managing the balance 
sheet, appropriate consideration is given to balancing 
the competing needs of maintaining sufficient levels 
of liquidity and complying with applicable 
regulations and supervisory expectations while 
optimizing profitability.  

At Dec. 31, 2024, total assets were $416 billion, 
compared with $410 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.  The 
increase in total assets was primarily driven by higher 
federal funds sold and securities purchased under 
resale agreements, securities and loans, partially 
offset by lower interest-bearing deposits with the 
Federal Reserve and other central banks.  Deposits 
totaled $290 billion at Dec. 31, 2024, compared with 
$284 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.  The increase primarily 
reflects higher interest-bearing deposits in U.S. 
offices, partially offset by lower interest-bearing 
deposits in non-U.S. offices.  Total interest-bearing 
deposit liabilities as a percentage of total interest-
earning assets were 65% at Dec. 31, 2024 and 66% at 
Dec. 31, 2023.  

At Dec. 31, 2024, available funds totaled $144 billion 
and include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing 
deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central 
banks, interest-bearing deposits with banks and 
federal funds sold and securities purchased under 
resale agreements.  This compares with available 
funds of $158 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.  Total 
available funds as a percentage of total assets were 
35% at Dec. 31, 2024 and 38% at Dec. 31, 2023.  For 
additional information on our available funds, see 
“Liquidity and dividends.”

26 BNY

Securities were $137 billion, or 33% of total assets, at 
Dec. 31, 2024, compared with $126 billion, or 31% 
of total assets, at Dec. 31, 2023.  The increase 
primarily reflects higher non-U.S. government and 
agency residential mortgage-backed securities 
(“RMBS”), partially offset by lower U.S. Treasury 
and U.S. government agency securities.  For 
additional information on our securities portfolio, see 
“Securities” and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements.

Loans were $72 billion, or 17% of total assets, at Dec. 
31, 2024, compared with $67 billion, or 16% of total 
assets, at Dec. 31, 2023.  The increase was driven by 
higher loans in the financial institutions and capital 
call financing portfolios and higher margin loans, 
partially offset by lower commercial loans.  For 
additional information on our loan portfolio, see 
“Loans” and Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements.

Long-term debt totaled $30.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2024 
and $31.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.  The decrease 
primarily reflects maturities, redemptions and a 
decrease in the fair value of hedged long-term debt, 
partially offset by issuances.  For additional 
information on long-term debt, see “Liquidity and 
dividends” and Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total 
shareholders’ equity totaled $41 billion at Dec. 31, 
2024 and Dec. 31, 2023.  For additional information, 
see “Capital” and Note 15 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Securities

In the discussion of our securities portfolio, we have 
included certain credit ratings information because 
the information can indicate the degree of credit risk 
to which we are exposed.  Significant changes in 
ratings classifications could indicate increased credit 
risk for us and could be accompanied by an increase 
in the allowance for credit losses and/or a reduction in 
the fair value of our securities portfolio.

agency RMBS, partially offset by lower U.S. 
Treasury and U.S. government agencies securities. 

At Dec. 31, 2024, the securities portfolio had a net 
unrealized loss, including the impact of related 
hedges, of $6.2 billion, compared with $7.0 billion at 
Dec. 31, 2023.  The improvement in the net 
unrealized loss, including the impact of related 
hedges, primarily reflects securities moving closer to 
maturity.

The fair value of the available-for-sale securities 
totaled $88.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2024 or 67% of the 
securities portfolio.  The fair value of the held-to-
maturity securities totaled $44.0 billion at Dec. 31, 
2024, or 33% of the securities portfolio.

The unrealized loss (after-tax) on our available-for-
sale securities portfolio, net of hedges, included in 
accumulated other comprehensive income was $1.2 
billion at Dec. 31, 2024, compared with $1.6 billion 
at Dec. 31, 2023.  The improvement in the net 
unrealized loss, including the impact of hedges, was 
primarily driven by securities moving closer to 
maturity.

At Dec. 31, 2024, 99% of the securities in our 
portfolio were rated AAA/AA-, unchanged compared 
with Dec. 31, 2023. 

See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements for the pre-tax net securities gains (losses) 
by security type.  See Note 20 of the Notes to

Tax credit investments

Tax credit investments include affordable housing 
projects and renewable energy investments.  We 
invest in affordable housing projects primarily to 
satisfy the Company’s requirements under the 
Community Reinvestment Act.  We invest in 
renewable energy projects to receive an expected 
after-tax return, which consists of allocated renewable 
energy tax credits, tax deductions and cash 
distributions based on the operations of the project.  
On Jan. 1, 2024, we adopted ASU 2023-02, 
Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures 
(Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax 
Credit Structures Using the Proportional 
Amortization Method for our renewable energy 
projects that met the eligibility criteria.  See Note 2 of

At Dec. 31, 2024, our total lending-related exposure 
was $125.8 billion, an increase of 9% compared with 
Dec. 31, 2023, primarily reflecting higher exposure in 
the financial institutions and capital call financing 
portfolios and higher margin loans.  

Our financial institutions and commercial portfolios 
comprise our largest concentrated risk.  These 
portfolios comprised 49% of our total exposure at 
Dec. 31, 2024 and 46% at Dec. 31, 2023.  
Additionally, most of our overdrafts relate to 
financial institutions.

The financial institutions portfolio exposure was 
$48.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2024, an increase of 22% 
compared with Dec. 31, 2023, primarily reflecting 
higher exposure in the securities industry and banks 
portfolios.

Financial institution exposures are high-quality, with 
96% of the exposures meeting the investment grade 
equivalent criteria of our internal credit rating 
classification at Dec. 31, 2024.  Each customer is 
assigned an internal credit rating, which is mapped to 
an equivalent external rating agency grade based 
upon a number of dimensions, which are continually 
evaluated and may change over time.  For ratings of 

non-U.S. counterparties, our internal credit rating is 
generally capped at a rating equivalent to the 
sovereign rating of the country where the 
counterparty resides, regardless of the internal credit 
rating assigned to the counterparty or the underlying 
collateral.

The exposure to financial institutions is generally 
short-term, with 84% of the exposures expiring 
within one year.  At Dec. 31, 2024, 18% of the 
exposure to financial institutions had an expiration 
within 90 days, compared with 19% at Dec. 31, 2023.

Results of Operations (continued)

In addition, 67% of the financial institutions exposure 
is secured at Dec. 31, 2024.  For example, securities 
industry clients and asset managers often borrow 
against marketable securities held in custody.

At Dec. 31, 2024, the secured intraday credit 
provided to dealers in connection with their tri-party 
repo activity totaled $13.4 billion and was included in 
the securities industry portfolio.  Dealers secure the 
outstanding intraday credit with high-quality liquid 
collateral having a market value in excess of the 
amount of the outstanding credit.  Secured intraday 
credit facilities represent 28% of the exposure in the 
financial institutions portfolio and are reviewed and 
reapproved annually.

Commercial

The commercial portfolio is presented below.

Commercial portfolio exposure

The asset managers portfolio exposure is high-
quality, with 96% of the exposures meeting our 
investment grade equivalent ratings criteria as of Dec. 
31, 2024.  These exposures are generally short-term 
liquidity facilities, with the majority to regulated 
mutual funds. 

Our banks portfolio exposure primarily relates to our 
global trade finance.  These exposures are short-term 
in nature, with 95% due in less than one year.  The 
investment grade percentage of our banks exposure 
was 85% at Dec. 31, 2024, compared with 84% at 
Dec. 31, 2023.  Our non-investment grade exposures 
are primarily trade finance loans in Brazil.

The commercial portfolio exposure was $13.3 billion

2023, primarily driven by lower exposure in the 
services and other portfolio, partially offset by higher 
exposure in the energy and utilities portfolio.

Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade 
clients that are active users of our non-credit services.

Wealth management loans 

Our wealth management loan exposure was $9.4

individuals, a majority of which are secured by the 
customers’ investment management accounts or 
custody accounts.  

Wealth management mortgages

Our wealth management mortgage exposure was $9.1 
billion at Dec. 31, 2024, compared with $9.4 billion 
at Dec. 31, 2023.  Wealth management mortgages 
primarily consist of loans to high-net-worth 
individuals, which are secured by residential 
property.  Wealth management mortgages are 
primarily interest-only, adjustable-rate mortgages 
with a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio of 61% at 
origination.  Less than 1% of the mortgages were past 
due at Dec. 31, 2024.

At Dec. 31, 2024, the wealth management mortgage 
portfolio consisted of the following geographic 
concentrations:  California – 21%; New York – 14%; 
Florida – 11%; Massachusetts – 8%; and other – 
46%.

Our commercial real estate exposure totaled $9.9 
billion at Dec. 31, 2024 and $10.2 billion at Dec. 31, 
2023.  Our income-producing commercial real estate 
facilities are focused on experienced owners and are 
structured with moderate leverage based on existing 
cash flows.  Our commercial real estate lending 
activities also include construction and renovation 
facilities.  Our client base consists of experienced 
developers and long-term holders of real estate assets.  
Loans are approved on the basis of existing or 
projected cash flows and supported by appraisals and 
knowledge of local market conditions.  Development 
loans are structured with moderate leverage, and in 
many instances, involve some level of recourse to the 
developer. 

At Dec. 31, 2024, the unsecured portfolio consisted 
of real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) and real 
estate operating companies, which are both primarily 
investment grade.

At Dec. 31, 2024, our commercial real estate portfolio 
consisted of the following concentrations: New York 
metro – 34%; REITs and real estate operating 
companies – 29%; and other – 37%.

Lease financings

The lease financings portfolio exposure totaled $603 
million at Dec. 31, 2024 and $599 million at Dec. 31, 
2023.  At Dec. 31, 2024, all of leasing exposure was 
investment grade, or investment grade equivalent, and 
consisted of exposures backed by well-diversified 
assets, primarily real estate and large-ticket 
transportation equipment.  Assets are both domestic 
and foreign-based, with primary concentrations in 
Germany and the U.S.

Capital call financing

Capital call financing includes loans to private equity 
funds that are secured by the fund investors’ capital 
commitments and the funds’ right to call capital.

Other loans

Other loans primarily include loans to consumers that 
are fully collateralized with equities, mutual funds 
and fixed-income securities.

Margin loans

Margin loan exposure of $19.1 billion at Dec. 31, 
2024 and $18.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2023 was 
collateralized with marketable securities.  Borrowers 
are required to maintain a daily collateral margin in 
excess of 100% of the value of the loan.  Margin 
loans included $8 billion at Dec. 31, 2024 and $7 
billion at Dec. 31, 2023 related to a term loan 
program that offers fully collateralized loans to 
broker-dealers.

Allowance for credit losses

Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade clients who are active users of our non-credit services.  Our 
primary exposure to the credit risk of a customer consists of funded loans, unfunded contractual commitments to 
lend, standby letters of credit and overdrafts associated with our custody and securities clearance businesses.

commercial real estate exposure and changes in the 
macroeconomic forecast.

The allowance for loan losses and allowance for 
lending-related commitments represent 
management’s estimate of lifetime expected losses in 
our credit portfolio.  This evaluation process is 
subject to numerous estimates and judgments.  To the 
extent actual results differ from forecasts or

management’s judgment, the allowance for credit 
losses may be greater or less than future charge-offs.

Based on an evaluation of the allowance for credit 
losses as discussed in “Critical accounting estimates” 
and Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements, we have allocated our allowance for 
loans and lending-related commitments as presented 
below.

(a)  The allowance allocated to margins loans, overdrafts and 

other loans was insignificant at both Dec. 31, 2024 and Dec. 
31, 2023.  We have rarely suffered a loss on these types of 
loans.

The allocation of the allowance for credit losses is 
inherently judgmental, and the entire allowance for 
credit losses is available to absorb credit losses 
regardless of the nature of the losses.

Nonperforming assets decreased $58 million 
compared with Dec. 31, 2023, primarily reflecting the 
impact of nonperforming commercial real estate loans 
that were charged off in 2024.

See “Nonperforming assets” in Note 1 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements for our policy for 
placing loans on nonaccrual status.

Deposits

We receive client deposits through the businesses in 
the Securities Services, Market and Wealth Services 
and Investment and Wealth Management segments 
and we rely on those deposits as a low-cost and stable 
source of funding.

Total deposits were $289.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2024, 
an increase of 2%, compared with $283.7 billion at 
Dec. 31, 2023.  The increase primarily reflects higher 
interest-bearing deposits in U.S. offices, partially 
offset by lower interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. 
offices.

Noninterest-bearing deposits were $58.3 billion at 
Dec. 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023.  Interest-bearing 
deposits were primarily demand deposits and totaled 
$231.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2024, compared with 
$225.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.  

The aggregate amount of deposits by foreign 
customers in domestic offices was $58.8 billion at 
Dec. 31, 2024 and $55.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.  

Deposits in non-U.S. offices totaled $95.6 billion at 
Dec. 31, 2024 and $96.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.  
These deposits were primarily overnight deposits.

Uninsured deposits are the portion of U.S. office 
deposits accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance 
limit.  Uninsured deposits in U.S. office deposit 
accounts are generally demand deposits and totaled 
$168.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2024 and $168.4 billion at 
Dec. 31, 2023.  Our uninsured U.S. office deposits 
accounts reflect the amounts disclosed in our 
regulatory reports, adjusted to exclude intercompany 
deposit balances.

Short-term borrowings

We fund ourselves primarily through deposits and, to 
a lesser extent, other short-term borrowings and long-
term debt.  Short-term borrowings consist of federal 
funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase 
agreements, payables to customers and broker-
dealers, commercial paper and other borrowed funds.  
Certain short-term borrowings, for example, 
securities sold under repurchase agreements, require 
the delivery of securities as collateral.

Federal funds purchased and securities sold under 
repurchase agreements include repurchase agreement 
activity with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation 
(“FICC”), where we record interest expense on a 
gross basis, but the ending and average balances 
reflect the impact of offsetting under enforceable 
netting agreements.  This activity primarily relates to 
government securities collateralized resale and 
repurchase agreements executed with clients that are 
novated to and settle with the FICC. 

Payables to customers and broker-dealers represent 
funds awaiting reinvestment and short sale proceeds 
payable on demand.  Payables to customers and 
broker-dealers are driven by customer trading activity 
and market volatility. 

The Bank of New York Mellon issues commercial 
paper that matures within 397 days from the date of 
issue and is not redeemable prior to maturity or 
subject to voluntary prepayment.  

Other borrowed funds primarily include borrowings 
from the Federal Home Loan Bank, overdrafts of sub-
custodian account balances in our Securities Services 
businesses, and borrowings under lines of credit by 

Liquidity and dividends

BNY defines liquidity as the ability of the Parent and 
its subsidiaries to access funding or convert assets to 
cash quickly and efficiently, or to roll over or issue 
new debt, especially during periods of market stress, 
at a reasonable cost, and in order to meet its short-
term (up to one year) obligations.  Funding liquidity 
risk is the risk that BNY cannot meet its cash and 
collateral obligations at a reasonable cost for both 
expected and unexpected cash flow and collateral 
needs without adversely affecting daily operations or 
our financial condition.  Funding liquidity risk can 
arise from funding mismatches, market constraints 
from the inability to convert assets into cash, the 
inability to hold or raise cash, low overnight deposits, 
deposit run-off or contingent liquidity events. 

Changes in economic conditions or exposure to 
credit, market, operational, legal and reputational 
risks also can affect BNY’s liquidity risk profile and 
are considered in our liquidity risk framework.  For 
additional information, see “Risk Management – 
Liquidity Risk.”

The Parent’s policy is to have access to sufficient 
unencumbered cash and cash equivalents at each 
quarter-end to cover maturities and other forecasted 
debt redemptions, net interest payments and net tax 
payments for the following 18-month period, and to 
provide sufficient collateral to satisfy transactions 
subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.  

We monitor and control liquidity exposures and 
funding needs within and across significant legal 
entities, branches, currencies and business lines, 
taking into account, among other factors, any 
applicable restrictions on the transfer of liquidity 
among entities.

BNY also manages potential intraday liquidity risks.  
We monitor and manage intraday liquidity against 
existing and expected intraday liquid resources (such 
as cash balances, remaining intraday credit capacity, 
intraday contingency funding and available collateral) 
to enable BNY to meet its intraday obligations under 
normal and reasonably severe stressed conditions.

Total available funds were $144.5 billion at Dec. 31, 
2024, compared with $157.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.  
The decrease was primarily due to lower interest-
bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other 
central banks and interest-bearing deposits with 
banks, partially offset by higher federal funds sold 
and securities purchased under resale agreements.

Average non-core sources of funds, such as federal 
funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase 
agreements, trading liabilities, other borrowed funds 
and commercial paper, were $20.4 billion for 2024 
and $25.0 billion for 2023.  The decrease primarily 
reflects lower federal funds purchased and securities 
sold under repurchase agreements and lower trading 
liabilities partially offset by higher commercial paper.

Average interest-bearing domestic deposits were 
$141.3 billion for 2024 and $123.5 billion for 2023.  
Average foreign deposits, primarily from our 
European-based businesses included in the Securities 
Services and Market and Wealth Services segments, 
were $92.9 billion for 2024, compared with $88.8 
billion for 2023.  The changes primarily reflect client 
activity.

Average payables to customers and broker-dealers 
were $12.7 billion for 2024 and $14.4 billion for 

2023.  Payables to customers and broker-dealers are 
driven by customer trading activity and market 
volatility.

Average long-term debt was $31.8 billion for 2024 
and $31.0 billion for 2023.

Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased to 
$49.5 billion for 2024 from $59.2 billion for 2023, 
primarily reflecting client activity.

A significant reduction of client activity in our 
Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services 
business segments would reduce our access to 
deposits.  See “Asset/liability management” for 
additional factors that could impact our deposit 
balances.

Sources of liquidity

The Parent’s major sources of liquidity are access to 
the debt and equity markets, dividends from its 
subsidiaries, and cash on hand and cash otherwise 
made available in business-as-usual circumstances to 
the Parent through a committed credit facility with 
our intermediate holding company (“IHC”).

In November 2024, Moody’s Ratings (“Moody’s”) 
upgraded BNY’s issuer and senior unsecured ratings 
to Aa3 from A1.  The long-term counterparty risk 
ratings were upgraded to Aa1 from Aa2 for The Bank 
of New York Mellon and for BNY Mellon, N.A.  The 
long-term issuer and senior unsecured ratings were 
upgraded to Aa1 from Aa2 for The Bank of New 
York Mellon, and the long-term issuer rating was 
upgraded to Aa1 from Aa2 for BNY Mellon, N.A.  
Moody’s affirmed all other long-term and short-term 
ratings and assessments for BNY, The Bank of New 
York Mellon and BNY Mellon N.A.  The outlooks on 
BNY’s issuer and senior unsecured ratings have been 
changed to stable from positive following the upgrade 
of these ratings. 

Long-term debt totaled $30.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2024 
and $31.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.  Maturities and 
redemptions of $6.0 billion and a decrease in the fair 
value of hedged long-term debt were partially offset 
by issuances of $5.8 billion.  The Parent has $3.3 
billion of long-term debt that will mature in 2025.

In February 2025, the Parent issued $1.25 billion of

issuance to, but excluding, Feb. 11, 2030, and then an 
annual interest rate of the compounded secured 
overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) plus 88.7 basis 
points.  

The Bank of New York Mellon may issue notes and 
CDs.  At Dec. 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, $1.0 
billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, of notes were 
outstanding.  At Dec. 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, 

BNY 37

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Results of Operations (continued)

$1.1 billion and $397 million of CDs were 
outstanding, respectively.  

The Bank of New York Mellon also issues 
commercial paper that matures within 397 days from 
the date of issue and is not redeemable prior to 
maturity or subject to voluntary prepayment.  There 
was $301 million of commercial paper outstanding at 
Dec. 31, 2024.  There was no commercial paper 
outstanding at Dec. 31, 2023.  The average 
commercial paper outstanding was $1.2 billion and 
$5 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Subsequent to Dec. 31, 2024, our U.S. bank 
subsidiaries could declare dividends to the Parent of 
approximately $82 million, without the need for a 
regulatory waiver.  In addition, at Dec. 31, 2024, non-
bank subsidiaries of the Parent had liquid assets of 
approximately $3.8 billion.  Restrictions on our 
ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries are 
discussed in more detail in “Supervision and 
Regulation – Capital Planning and Stress Testing – 
Payment of Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Other 
Capital Distributions” and in Note 19 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Pershing LLC has one uncommitted line of credit in 
place for liquidity purposes which is guaranteed by 
the Parent for $300 million.  Average borrowings 
under this line were less than $1 million in 2024.  
Pershing Limited, an indirect UK-based subsidiary of 
BNY, has two separate uncommitted lines of credit 
amounting to $247 million in aggregate.  Average 
borrowings under these lines were less than 
$1 million, in aggregate, in 2024.

The double leverage ratio is the ratio of our equity 
investment in subsidiaries divided by our 
consolidated Parent company equity, which includes 
our noncumulative perpetual preferred stock.  In 
short, the double leverage ratio measures the extent to 
which equity in subsidiaries is financed by Parent 
company debt.  As the double leverage ratio 
increases, this can reflect greater demands on a 
company’s cash flows in order to service interest 
payments and debt maturities.  BNY’s double 
leverage ratio is managed in a range considering the 
high level of unencumbered available liquid assets 
held in its principal subsidiaries (such as central bank 
deposit placements and government securities), the 
Company’s cash-generating fee-based business 
model, with fee revenue representing 73% of total 
revenue in 2024, and the dividend capacity of our 

38 BNY

banking subsidiaries.  Our double leverage ratio was 
119.7% at Dec. 31, 2024 and 120.5% at Dec. 31, 
2023, and within the range targeted by management.  

Uses of funds

The Parent’s major uses of funds are repurchases of 
common stock, payment of dividends, principal and 
interest payments on its borrowings, acquisitions and 
additional investments in its subsidiaries.

In 2024, we paid $1.5 billion in dividends on our 
common and preferred stock.  Our common stock 
dividend payout ratio was 31% for 2024. 

In 2024, we repurchased 48.9 million common shares 
at an average price of $62.70 per common share for a 
total cost of $3.1 billion.  

Liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”)

U.S. regulators have established an LCR that requires 
certain banking organizations, including BNY, to 
maintain a minimum amount of unencumbered high-
quality liquid assets (“HQLA”) sufficient to 
withstand the net cash outflow under a hypothetical 
standardized acute liquidity stress scenario for a 30-
day time horizon. 

The following table presents BNY’s consolidated 
HQLA at Dec. 31, 2024, and the average HQLA and 
average LCR for the fourth quarter of 2024.

Results of Operations (continued)

Net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”)

The NSFR is a liquidity requirement applicable to 
large U.S. banking organizations, including BNY.  
The NSFR is expressed as a ratio of the available 
stable funding to the required stable funding amount 
over a one-year horizon.  Our average consolidated 
NSFR was 132% for the fourth quarter of 2024 and 
third quarter of 2024.  

BNY and each of our affected domestic bank 
subsidiaries were compliant with the NSFR 
requirement of at least 100% throughout the fourth 
quarter of 2024. 

Statement of cash flows

The following summarizes the activity reflected on 
the consolidated statement of cash flows.  While this 
information may be helpful to highlight certain macro 
trends and business strategies, the cash flow analysis 
may not be as relevant when analyzing changes in our 
net earnings and net assets.  We believe that in 
addition to the traditional cash flow analysis, the 
discussion related to liquidity and dividends and 
asset/liability management herein may provide more 
useful context in evaluating our liquidity position and 
related activity.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $687 
million in 2024, compared with $5.9 billion in 2023.  
In 2024, net cash provided by operating activities 
primarily resulted from earnings, partially offset by 

Capital

changes in trading assets and liabilities.  In 2023, net 
cash provided by operating activities primarily 
resulted from earnings and changes in accruals and 
other, net.

Net cash used for investing activities was $9.5 billion 
in 2024, compared with $5.8 billion in 2023.  In 
2024, net cash used for investing activities primarily 
reflects changes in federal funds sold and securities 
purchased under resale agreements, a net increase in 
the securities portfolio and the net change in loans, 
partially offset by changes in interest-bearing deposits 
with the Federal Reserve and other central banks.  In 
2023, net cash used for investing activities primarily 
reflects changes in interest-bearing deposits with the 
Federal Reserve and other central banks and changes 
in federal funds sold and securities purchased under 
resale agreements, partially offset by a net decrease in 
the securities portfolio. 

Net cash provided by financing activities was $6.3 
billion in 2024, compared with net cash used for 
financing activities of $3.5 billion in 2023.  In 2024, 
net cash provided by financing activities primarily 
reflects changes in deposits and issuances of long-
term debt, partially offset by repayments of long-term 
debt and common stock repurchases.  In 2023, net 
cash used for financing activities primarily reflects 
repayments of long-term debt, changes in payables to 
customers and broker-dealers and common stock 
repurchases, partially offset by issuances of long-term 
debt and changes in deposits.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation’s total 
shareholders’ equity increased to $41.3 billion at Dec. 
31, 2024 from $40.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.  The

sale securities portfolio, net of hedges, included in 
accumulated other comprehensive income was $1.2 
billion at Dec. 31, 2024, compared with $1.6 billion 
at Dec. 31, 2023.  The improvement in the net 
unrealized loss, including the impact of related 
hedges, primarily reflects securities moving closer to 
maturity.

We repurchased 48.9 million common shares at an 
average price of $62.70 per common share for a total 
of $3.1 billion in 2024.  

In January 2023, we announced a share repurchase 
program approved by our Board of Directors 
providing for the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of 
common shares beginning Jan. 1, 2023.  This new 
share repurchase plan replaced all previously 
authorized share repurchase plans.

In April 2024, we announced a new authorization 
providing for the repurchase of $6.0 billion of 
common shares in addition to any remaining capacity 
under the existing January 2023 authorization.

In July 2024, our Board of Directors approved a 12% 
increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common 
stock, from $0.42 to $0.47 per share.  We began 

paying the increased quarterly cash dividend in the 
third quarter of 2024. 

Capital adequacy

Regulators establish certain levels of capital for bank 
holding companies (“BHCs”) and banks, including 
BNY and our bank subsidiaries, in accordance with 
established quantitative measurements.  For the 
Parent to maintain its status as a financial holding 
company (“FHC”), our U.S. bank subsidiaries and 
BNY must, among other things, qualify as “well 
capitalized.”  As of Dec. 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, 
BNY and our U.S. bank subsidiaries were “well 
capitalized.”  Failure to satisfy regulatory standards, 
including “well capitalized” status or capital 
adequacy rules more generally, could result in 
limitations on our activities and adversely affect our 
financial condition.  See the discussion of these 
matters in “Supervision and Regulation – Regulated 
Entities of BNY and Ancillary Regulatory 
Requirements” and “Risk Factors – Capital and 
Liquidity Risk – Failure to satisfy regulatory 
standards, including “well capitalized” and “well 
managed” status or capital adequacy and liquidity 
rules more generally, could result in limitations on 
our activities and adversely affect our business and 
financial condition.” 

The U.S. banking agencies’ capital rules are based on 
the framework adopted by the Basel Committee on 
Banking Supervision (“BCBS”), as amended from 
time to time.  For additional information on these 
capital requirements, see “Supervision and 
Regulation.”

important banks (“G-SIB”) surcharge of 1.5% is subject to change.  The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set to 0%.  The stress 
capital buffer (“SCB”) requirement is 2.5%, equal to the regulatory minimum for Standardized Approach capital ratios.  

(b)  For our CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, our effective capital ratios under U.S. capital rules are the lower of the ratios as 
calculated under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches.  The Tier 1 leverage ratio is based on Tier 1 capital and quarterly 
average total assets.

and the Advanced Approaches for the Total capital ratio, and for Dec. 31, 2023 was the Advanced Approaches.

N/A - Not applicable.

Our CET1 ratio determined under the Standardized 
Approach was 11.2% at Dec. 31, 2024 and 11.5% at 
Dec. 31, 2023 under the Advanced Approaches.  The 
decrease was primarily driven by capital returned 
through common stock repurchases and dividends 
and higher RWAs, partially offset by capital 
generated through earnings.  

The Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.7% at Dec. 31, 2024, 
compared with 6.0% at Dec. 31, 2023.  The decrease 
was driven by higher average assets, partially offset 
by an increase in capital.  

Risk-based capital ratios vary depending on the size 
of the balance sheet at period end and the levels and 
types of investments in assets, and leverage ratios 
vary based on the average size of the balance sheet 
over the quarter.  The balance sheet size fluctuates 
from period to period based on levels of customer and 
market activity.  In general, when servicing clients 
are more actively trading securities, deposit balances 

and the balance sheet as a whole are higher.  In 
addition, when markets experience significant 
volatility or stress, our balance sheet size may 
increase considerably as client deposit levels increase.

Our capital ratios are necessarily subject to, among 
other things, anticipated compliance with all 
necessary enhancements to model calibration, 
approval by regulators of certain models used as part 
of RWA calculations, other refinements, further 
implementation guidance from regulators, market 
practices and standards and any changes BNY may 
make to its businesses.  As a consequence of these 
factors, our capital ratios may materially change, and 
may be volatile over time and from period to period.

Under the Advanced Approaches, our operational loss 
risk model is informed by external losses, including 
fines and penalties levied against institutions in the 
financial services industry, particularly those that 
relate to businesses in which we operate, and as a

Stress capital buffer

In July 2023, the Federal Reserve announced that 
BNY’s SCB requirement would remain at 2.5%, 
equal to the regulatory floor, for the period from Oct. 
1, 2023 through Sept. 30, 2024.  The SCB replaced 
the static 2.5% capital conservation buffer for 
Standardized Approach capital ratios for 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review 
(“CCAR”) BHCs.  The SCB does not apply to bank 
subsidiaries, which remain subject to the static 2.5% 
capital conservation buffer.  In August 2024, the 
Federal Reserve announced that BNY’s SCB 
requirement would remain at 2.5%, equal to the 
regulatory floor, for the period from Oct. 1, 2024 
through Sept. 30, 2025.  See “Supervision and 
Regulation” for additional information. 

The SCB final rule generally eliminates the 
requirement for prior approval of common stock 
repurchases in excess of the distributions in a firm’s 
capital plan, provided that such distributions are 
consistent with applicable capital requirements and 
buffers, including the SCB.

satisfies certain other conditions.  Eligible LTD 
consists of the unpaid principal balance of eligible 
unsecured debt securities, subject to haircuts for 
amounts due to be paid within two years, that satisfy 
certain other conditions.  Debt issued prior to Dec. 
31, 2016 has been permanently grandfathered to the 
extent these instruments otherwise would be 
ineligible only due to containing impermissible 
acceleration rights or being governed by foreign law.

In January 2023, we announced a share repurchase

providing for the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of 
common shares beginning Jan. 1, 2023.  This new 
share repurchase plan replaced all previously 
authorized share repurchase plans.

In April 2024, we announced a new authorization 
providing for the repurchase of $6.0 billion of 
common shares in addition to any remaining capacity 
under the existing January 2023 authorization. 

Share repurchases may be executed through open 
market repurchases, in privately negotiated 
transactions or by other means, including through 
repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule 
10b5-1 and other derivative, accelerated share 
repurchase and other structured transactions.  The 
timing and exact amount of any common stock 
repurchases will depend on various factors, including 
market conditions and the common stock trading 
price; the Company’s capital position, liquidity and 
financial performance; alternative uses of capital; and 
legal and regulatory limitations and considerations.

Trading activities and risk management

Our trading activities are focused on acting as a 
market-maker for our customers, facilitating customer 
trades and risk-mitigating hedging in compliance with 
the Volcker Rule.  The risk from market-making 
activities for customers is managed by our traders and 
limited in total exposure through a system of position 
limits, value-at-risk (“VaR”) methodology and other 
market sensitivity measures.  VaR is the potential loss 
in value due to adverse market movements over a 
defined time horizon with a specified confidence 
level.  The calculation of our VaR used by 

44 BNY

management and presented below assumes a one-day 
holding period, utilizes a 99% confidence level and 
incorporates non-linear product characteristics.  VaR 
facilitates comparisons across portfolios of different 
risk characteristics.  VaR also captures the 
diversification of aggregated risk at the firm-wide 
level.

VaR represents a key risk management measure and 
it is important to note the inherent limitations to VaR, 
which include:

• VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer 

time horizons where moves may be extreme;

• VaR does not take into account the potential 

variability of market liquidity; and

• Previous moves in market risk factors may not 

produce accurate predictions of all future market 
moves.

See Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements for additional information on the VaR 
methodology.

compute a minimum and maximum portfolio diversification 
effect.

During 2024, interest rate risk generated 43% of 
average gross VaR, foreign exchange risk generated 
35% of average gross VaR, equity risk generated 1% 
of average gross VaR and credit risk generated 21% 
of average gross VaR.  During 2024, our daily trading 
loss exceeded our calculated VaR amount of the 
overall portfolio on only one occasion.

The following table of total daily trading revenue or 
loss illustrates the number of trading days in which 
our trading revenue or loss fell within particular 
ranges during the past five quarters. 

Distribution of trading revenue (loss) (a)

The interest rate component of VaR represents 
instruments whose values are predominantly driven 
by interest rate levels.  These instruments include, but 
are not limited to, U.S. Treasury securities, swaps, 
swaptions, forward rate agreements, exchange-traded 
futures and options, and other interest rate derivative 
products.

The foreign exchange component of VaR represents 
instruments whose values predominantly vary with 
the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or 
interest rates.  These instruments include, but are not 
limited to, currency balances, spot and forward 
transactions, currency options and other currency 
derivative products.

The equity component of VaR consists of instruments 
that represent an ownership interest in the form of 
domestic and foreign common stock or other equity-
linked instruments.  These instruments include, but 
are not limited to, common stock, exchange-traded 
funds, preferred stock, listed equity options (puts and 
calls), OTC equity options, equity total return swaps, 
equity index futures and other equity derivative 
products.

The credit component of VaR represents instruments 
whose values are predominantly driven by credit 
spread levels, i.e., idiosyncratic default risk.  These 
instruments include, but are not limited to, single 
issuer credit default swaps, and securities with 
exposures from corporate and municipal credit 
spreads.

The diversification component of VaR is the risk 
reduction benefit that occurs when combining 
portfolios and offsetting positions, and from the 
correlated behavior of risk factor movements.

(a)  Trading revenue (loss) includes realized and unrealized gains and 
losses primarily related to spot and forward foreign exchange 
transactions, derivatives and securities trades for our customers and 
excludes any associated commissions, underwriting fees and net 
interest income.

Trading assets include debt and equity instruments 
and derivative assets, primarily foreign exchange and 
interest rate contracts, not designated as hedging 
instruments.  Trading assets were $14.0 billion at 
Dec. 31, 2024 and $10.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. 

Trading liabilities include debt and equity instruments 
and derivative liabilities, primarily foreign exchange 
and interest rate contracts, not designated as hedging 
instruments.  Trading liabilities were $4.9 billion at 
Dec. 31, 2024 and $6.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.

Under our fair value methodology for derivative 
contracts, an initial “risk-neutral” valuation is 
performed on each position assuming time 
discounting based on a AA credit curve.  In addition, 
we consider credit risk in arriving at the fair value of 
our derivatives.  

We reflect external credit ratings as well as 
observable credit default swap spreads for both 
ourselves and our counterparties when measuring the 
fair value of our derivative positions.  Accordingly, 
the valuation of our derivative positions is sensitive to 
the current changes in our own credit spreads, as well 
as those of our counterparties.

Results of Operations (continued)

At Dec. 31, 2024, our OTC derivative assets, 
including those in hedging relationships, of $3.7 
billion included a credit valuation adjustment 
(“CVA”) deduction of $11 million.  Our OTC 
derivative liabilities, including those in hedging 
relationships, of $2.9 billion included a debit 
valuation adjustment (“DVA”) of $7 million related 
to our own credit spread.  Net of hedges, the CVA 
increased by less than $1 million and the DVA 
decreased by less than $1 million in 2024, which 
decreased other trading revenue by $1 million in 
2024.  During 2024, no realized loss was charged off 
against CVA reserves.

At Dec. 31, 2023, our OTC derivative assets, 
including those in hedging relationships, of $2.3 
billion included a CVA deduction of $16 million.  
Our OTC derivative liabilities, including those in 
hedging relationships, of $3.8 billion included a DVA 
of $4 million related to our own credit spread.  Net of 
hedges, the CVA increased by $1 million and the 
DVA increased by $1 million in 2023, which 
increased other trading revenue by less than $1 
million in 2023.  During 2023, no realized loss was 
charged off against CVA reserves.

The table below summarizes our exposure, net of 
collateral related to our derivative counterparties, as 
determined on an internal risk management basis.  
Significant changes in counterparty credit ratings 
could alter the level of credit risk faced by BNY.

Asset/liability management

Our diversified business activities include processing 
securities, accepting deposits, investing in securities, 
lending, raising money as needed to fund assets and 
other transactions.  The market risks from these 
activities include interest rate risk and foreign 
exchange risk.  Our primary market risk is exposure 
to movements in U.S. dollar interest rates and certain 
foreign currency interest rates.  We actively manage

interest rate sensitivity and use earnings simulation 
and discounted cash flow models to identify interest 
rate exposures. 

An earnings simulation model is the primary tool 
used to assess changes in pre-tax net interest income 
between a baseline scenario and hypothetical interest 
rate scenarios.  Interest rate sensitivity is quantified 
by calculating the change in pre-tax net interest 
income between the scenarios over a 12-month 
measurement period.    

The baseline scenario incorporates the market’s 
forward rate expectations and management’s 
assumptions regarding client deposit rates, credit 
spreads, changes in the prepayment behavior of loans 
and securities and the impact of derivative financial 
instruments used for interest rate risk management 
purposes as of each respective quarter-end.  These 
assumptions have been developed through a 
combination of historical analysis and future expected 
pricing behavior and are inherently uncertain.  Actual 
results may differ materially from projected results 
due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest 
rate changes, and changes in market conditions and 
management’s strategies, among other factors.  Client 
deposit levels and mix are key assumptions impacting 
net interest income in the baseline as well as the 
hypothetical interest rate scenarios.  The earnings 
simulation model assumes static deposit levels and 
mix, and it also assumes that no management actions 
will be taken to mitigate the effects of interest rate 
changes.  Typically, the baseline scenario uses the 
average deposit balances of the quarter.

In the table below, we use the earnings simulation 
model to assess the impact of various hypothetical 
interest rate scenarios compared to the baseline 
scenario.  In each of the scenarios, all currencies’ 
interest rates are instantaneously shifted higher or 
lower at the start of the forecast.  Long-term interest 
rates are defined as all tenors equal to or greater than 
three years and short-term interest rates are defined as 
all tenors equal to or less than three months.  Interim 
term points are interpolated where applicable.  The 
impact of interest rate shifts may not be linear.  The 
results of this earnings simulation should therefore 
not be extrapolated for more severe interest rate 
scenarios than those presented in the table below.

At Dec. 31, 2024, the changes in the impacts of a 100 
basis point upward or downward shift in rates on net 
interest income compared with Sept. 30, 2024 were 
primarily driven by an increase in fixed-rate assets 
and floating rate liabilities.

While the net interest income sensitivity scenario 
calculations assume static deposit balances to 
facilitate consistent period-over-period comparisons, 
net interest income is impacted by changes in deposit 
balances and interest rate trajectory.  Noninterest-
bearing deposits are particularly sensitive to changes 
in short-term rates.  

To illustrate the net interest income sensitivity to non-
interest-bearing deposits, we estimate that a $5 billion 
instantaneous reduction/increase in U.S. dollar-
denominated noninterest-bearing deposits would 
reduce/increase the net interest income sensitivity 
results in the up 100 basis point rate shock scenario in 
the table above by approximately $260 million, and in 
the down 100 basis point rate shock scenario by 
approximately $160 million.  The impact would be 
smaller if the reduction/increase was assumed to be a 
mixture of interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing 
deposits. 

Additionally, during periods of low short-term 
interest rates, money market mutual fund fees and 
other similar fees are typically waived to protect 
investors from negative returns.  

For a discussion of factors impacting the growth or 
contraction of deposits, see “Risk Factors – Capital 
and Liquidity Risk – Our business, financial 
condition and results of operations could be adversely 

We also project future cash flows from our assets and 
liabilities over a long-term horizon and then discount 
these cash flows using instantaneous parallel shocks 
to prevailing interest rates.  This measure reflects the 
structural balance sheet interest rate sensitivity by 
discounting all future cash flows.  The aggregation of 
these discounted cash flows is the economic value of 
equity (“EVE”).  The following table shows how 
EVE would change in response to changes in interest 
rates.

The asymmetrical accounting treatment of the impact 
of a change in interest rates on our balance sheet may 
create a situation in which an increase in interest rates 
can adversely affect reported equity and regulatory 
capital, even though economically there may be no 
impact on our economic capital position.  For 
example, an increase in rates will result in a decline in 
the value of our available-for-sale securities portfolio.  
In this example, there is no corresponding change on 
our fixed liabilities, even though economically these 
liabilities are more valuable as rates rise.

These results do not reflect strategies that 
management could employ to limit the impact as 
interest rate expectations change.

To manage foreign exchange risk, we fund foreign 
currency-denominated assets with liability 
instruments denominated in the same currency.  We 
utilize various foreign exchange contracts if a liability 
denominated in the same currency is not available or 
desired, and to minimize the earnings impact of 
translation gains or losses created by investments in 
foreign markets.  We use forward foreign exchange 
contracts to protect the value of our net investment in 
foreign operations.  At Dec. 31, 2024, net investments 
in foreign operations totaled $14 billion and were 
spread across 19 foreign currencies.
