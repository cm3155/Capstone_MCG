Key third quarter 2024 and subsequent events

Acquisition of Archer Holdco, LLC (“Archer”)

In September 2024, BNY announced it had entered into a
definitive agreement to acquire Archer, a leading
technology-enabled service provider of managed account
solutions to the asset and wealth management industry. The
transaction closed on Nov. 1, 2024.

Increase in cash dividend on common stock

In July 2024, our Board of Directors approved a 12%
increase in the quarterly cash dividend on our common
stock, from $0.42 to $0.47 per share. The increased
quarterly cash dividend was paid on Aug. 2, 2024.

Highlights of third quarter 2024 results

Net income applicable to common shareholders was $1.11
billion, or $1.50 per diluted common share, in the third
quarter of 2024, including the impact of notable items.
Notable items in the third quarter of 2024 include
severance expense, litigation reserves and a reduction in
the FDIC special assessment. Excluding notable items, net
income applicable to common shareholders was $1.13
billion (Non-GAAP), or $1.52 (Non-GAAP) per diluted
common share, in the third quarter of 2024. Net income
applicable to common shareholders was $958 million, or
$1.23 per diluted common share, in the third quarter of
2023, including the impact of notable items. Notable items
in the third quarter of 2023 include severance expense,
litigation reserves and a disposal gain. Excluding notable
items, net income applicable to common shareholders was
$994 million (Non-GAAP), or $1.27 (Non-GAAP) per
diluted common share, in the third quarter of 2023.

The highlights below are based on the third quarter of 2024
compared with the third quarter of 2023, unless otherwise
noted.
• Total revenue increased 5%, primarily reflecting:

• Fee revenue increased 5%, primarily reflecting

•

higher market values, net new business and higher
foreign exchange revenue. (See “Fee and other
revenue” beginning on page 6.)
Investment and other revenue increased primarily
reflecting a strategic equity investment loss recorded
in the third quarter of 2023 and improved results
from our seed capital investments. (See “Fee and
other revenue” beginning on page 6.)

• Net interest income increased 3%, primarily

reflecting improved investment securities portfolio
yields and balance sheet growth, partially offset by
changes in deposit mix.
(See “Net interest income” on page 9.)

• Provision for credit losses was $23 million, primarily

driven by increases in the allowance related to
commercial real estate exposure.

• Noninterest expense was flat, reflecting higher

investments and employee merit increases, offset by
efficiency savings and a reduction in the FDIC

Fee and other revenue

special assessment. Excluding notable items,
noninterest expense increased 1% (Non-GAAP). (See
“Noninterest expense” on page 12.)

• Effective tax rate of 22.0%. (See “Income taxes” on

page 12.)

• Return on common equity (“ROE”) was 12.0% for the

third quarter of 2024.

• Return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) was
22.8% (Non-GAAP) for the third quarter of 2024.
Excluding notable items, the adjusted ROTCE was
23.2% (Non-GAAP) for the third quarter of 2024.

See “Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP
and Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on page 43
for a reconciliation of these Non-GAAP measures.

Metrics

• AUC/A of $52.1 trillion increased 14%, primarily

reflecting higher market values, client inflows and net
new business.

• AUM of $2.1 trillion increased 18%, primarily

reflecting higher market values and the favorable
impact of a weaker U.S. dollar.

Capital and liquidity

• Our CET1 ratio was 11.9% at Sept. 30, 2024 and 11.4%
at June 30, 2024 under the Standardized Approach. The
increase reflects capital generated through earnings and
improvements in accumulated other comprehensive
income, partially offset by capital returned through
common stock repurchases and dividends, and higher
risk-weighted assets. (See “Capital” beginning on page
35.)

• Tier 1 leverage was 6.0% at Sept. 30, 2024 and 5.8% at
June 30, 2024. The increase reflects the increase in
capital, partially offset by higher average assets. (See
“Capital” beginning on page 35.)

• Returned $1.1 billion to common shareholders,

including $725 million of common share repurchases.

June 30, 2024 and $1.5 trillion at Sept. 30, 2023.

(d)    Represents assets managed in the Investment and Wealth Management business segment.
N/M – Not meaningful.

Fee revenue increased 5% compared with the third quarter
of 2023 and was flat compared with the second quarter of
2024. The increase compared with the third quarter of 2023
primarily reflects higher investment services fees, foreign
exchange revenue and investment management and
performance fees. Compared with the second quarter of
2024, higher investment management and performance
fees were offset by lower investment services fees and
foreign exchange revenue.

Investment and other revenue increased $37 million
compared with the third quarter of 2023 and $27 million
compared with the second quarter of 2024. The increase
compared with the third quarter of 2023 primarily reflects
a strategic equity investment loss recorded in the third
quarter of 2023 and improved results from our seed capital
investments. The increase compared with the second
quarter of 2024 primarily reflects improved seed capital
results and higher client activity in our fixed income and
equity trading business.

Investment services fees

Investment services fees increased 5% compared with the
third quarter of 2023 and decreased 1% compared

6 BNY

with the second quarter of 2024. The increase compared
with the third quarter of 2023 primarily reflects higher
market values, net new business and higher client activity,
partially offset by lower Depositary Receipts revenue. The
decrease compared with the second quarter of 2024
primarily reflects lower Depositary Receipts revenue,
partially offset by higher market values.

AUC/A totaled $52.1 trillion at Sept. 30, 2024, an increase
of 14% compared with Sept. 30, 2023, primarily reflecting
higher market values, client inflows and net new business.
AUC/A consisted of 37% equity securities and 63% fixed
income securities at Sept. 30, 2024, and 34% equity
securities and 66% fixed income securities at Sept. 30,
2023.

See “Securities Services business segment” and “Market
and Wealth Services business segment” in “Review of
business segments” for additional details.

Investment management and performance fees

Investment management and performance fees increased
2% compared with the third quarter of 2023 and 4%
compared with the second quarter of 2024. The increase
compared with the third quarter of 2023

primarily reflects higher market values, partially offset by
the mix of AUM flows and lower performance fees. The
increase compared with the second quarter of 2024
primarily reflects higher market values and the timing of
performance fees. Performance fees were $13 million in
the third quarter of 2024, $30 million in the third quarter of
2023 and $8 million in the second quarter of 2024. On a
constant currency basis (Non-GAAP), investment
management and performance fees increased 2% compared
with the third quarter of 2023. See “Supplemental
information – Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP
financial measures” beginning on page 43 for the
reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures.

AUM was $2.1 trillion at Sept. 30, 2024, an increase of
18% compared with Sept. 30, 2023, primarily reflecting
higher market values and the favorable impact of a weaker
U.S. dollar.

See “Investment and Wealth Management business
segment” in “Review of business segments” for additional
details regarding the drivers of investment management
and performance fees, AUM and AUM flows.

Foreign exchange revenue

Foreign exchange revenue is primarily driven by the
volume of client transactions and the spread realized on
these transactions, both of which are impacted by market
volatility, the impact of foreign currency hedging activities
and foreign currency remeasurement gain (loss). Foreign
exchange revenue increased 14% compared with the third
quarter of 2023 and decreased 5% compared with the
second quarter of 2024. The increase compared with the
third quarter of 2023 primarily reflects higher volumes.
The decrease compared with the second quarter of 2024
primarily reflects lower volumes, partially offset by higher
volatility. Foreign exchange revenue is primarily reported
in the Securities Services business segment and, to a lesser
extent, in the Market and Wealth Services and Investment
and Wealth Management business segments and the Other
segment.

Financing-related fees

Financing-related fees, which are primarily reported in the
Market and Wealth Services and Securities Services
business segments, include capital market fees, loan
commitment fees and credit-related fees. Financing-related
fees increased 18% compared with the third quarter of
2023 and were flat compared with the second quarter of
2024. The increase compared with the third quarter of 2023
primarily reflects higher underwriting fees.

Investment and other revenue

Investment and other revenue includes income or loss from
consolidated investment management funds, seed capital
gains or losses, other trading revenue or loss, renewable
energy investments gains, income from corporate and
bank-owned life insurance contracts, other investment
gains or losses, gains or losses from disposals, expense
reimbursements from our CIBC Mellon joint venture, other
income or loss and net securities gains or losses. The
income or loss from consolidated investment management
funds should be considered together with the net income or
loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, which reflects
the portion of the consolidated funds for which we do not
have an economic interest and is reflected below net
income as a separate line item on the consolidated income
statement. Other trading revenue or loss primarily includes
the impact of market-risk hedging activity related to our
seed capital investments in investment management funds,
non-foreign currency derivative and fixed income trading,
and other hedging activity. Other investment gains or
losses includes fair value changes of non-readily
marketable strategic equity, private equity and other
investments. Expense reimbursements from our CIBC
Mellon joint venture relate to expenses incurred by BNY
on behalf of the CIBC Mellon joint venture. Other income
includes various miscellaneous revenues.

N/M – Not meaningful.
bps – basis points.

Net interest income increased 3% compared with the third
quarter of 2023 and 2% compared with the second quarter
of 2024. The increase compared with the third quarter of
2023 primarily reflects improved investment securities
portfolio yields and balance sheet growth, partially offset
by changes in deposit mix. The increase compared with the
second quarter of 2024 primarily reflects higher sponsored
member cleared repo activity.

Net interest margin decreased 2 basis points compared with
the third quarter of 2023 and increased 1 basis point
compared with the second quarter of 2024. The changes
compared with the third quarter of 2023 and the second
quarter of 2024 primarily reflect the factors mentioned
above.

Average interest-earning assets increased 5% compared
with the third quarter of 2023 and 1% compared with the
second quarter of 2024. The increase compared with the
third quarter of 2023 primarily reflects higher securities
and loan balances and federal funds sold and securities
purchased under resale agreements, partially offset by
lower interest-bearing deposits with banks. The increase
compared with the second quarter of 2024 primarily
reflects higher securities balances and federal funds sold
and securities purchased under resale agreements, partially
offset by lower interest-bearing deposits with the Federal
Reserve and other central banks.

Average non-U.S. dollar deposits comprised approximately
25% of our average total deposits in the third quarter of
2024. Approximately 50% of the average non-U.S. dollar
deposits in the third quarter of 2024 were euro-
denominated.

Year-to-date 2024 compared with year-to-date 2023

Net interest income decreased 4% compared with the first
nine months of 2023, primarily driven by changes in
balance sheet mix, partially offset by higher interest rates.
The decrease in the net interest margin primarily reflects
the factors mentioned above.

Average interest-earning assets increased 1% compared
with the first nine months of 2023, primarily reflecting
higher loan balances and federal funds sold and securities
purchased under resale agreements, partially offset by
lower interest-bearing deposits with banks.

quarter of 2024 and $126 billion for the third quarter of 2023. On a Non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of offsetting, the yield on federal funds sold and securities
purchased under resale agreements would have been 5.43% for the third quarter of 2024, 5.51% for the second quarter of 2024 and 5.36% for the third quarter of 2023.

On a Non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of offsetting, the rate on federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements would have been 5.32%

for the third quarter of 2024, 5.41% for the second quarter of 2024 and 5.26% for the third quarter of 2023. We believe providing rates excluding the impact of netting is

useful to investors as it is more reflective of the actual rates earned and paid.

Total noninterest expense was flat compared with the third

We have an internal information system that produces
performance data along product and service lines for our
three principal business segments: Securities Services,
Market and Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth
Management, and the Other segment.

Business segment accounting principles

Our business segment data has been determined on an
internal management basis of accounting, rather than the
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) used
for consolidated financial reporting. These measurement
principles are designed so that reported results of the
businesses will track their economic performance.

For information on the accounting principles of our
business segments, see Note 19 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. For information on the
primary products and services in each line of business, the
primary types of revenue by line of business and how our
business segments are presented and analyzed, see Note 24
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our
2023 Annual Report.

Business segment results are subject to reclassification
when organizational changes are made, or for refinements
in revenue and expense allocation methodologies.
Refinements are typically reflected on a prospective basis.
There were no reclassifications or organizational changes
in the third quarter of 2024. In the first quarter of 2024, we
made certain realignments of similar products and services
within our lines of business consistent with the firm’s
ongoing transition to a platforms operating model uniting
related capabilities and enabling streamlining of internal
processes to drive growth, efficiency, resiliency, and
enhanced risk management. The largest change was the
movement of Institutional Solutions from Pershing to
Clearance and Collateral Management, both in the Market
and Wealth Services business segment. We made other
smaller changes that moved activity from Asset Servicing
in the Securities Services business segment to Treasury
Services in the Market and Wealth Services business
segment, and from Wealth Management in the Investment
and Wealth Management business segment and Pershing in
the Market and Wealth Services business segment to
Investment Management in the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment. The Other segment was
not impacted by the changes. Business segment results for
the three and nine months ended Sept. 30, 2023 have been
revised to reflect these changes.

The results of our business segments may be influenced by
client and other activities that vary by

Securities Services business segment

quarter. In the first quarter, staff expense typically
increases, reflecting the vesting of long-term stock awards
for retirement-eligible employees. The timing of our
annual employee merit increases also impacts staff
expense. In 2024, the merit increase was effective in
March, thus partially impacting the first quarter and second
quarter staff expense variances. For 2023, the merit
increase was effective at the beginning of the second
quarter. In the third quarter, volume-related fees may
decline due to reduced client activity. In the fourth quarter,
we typically incur higher business development and
marketing expenses. In our Investment and Wealth
Management business segment, performance fees are
typically higher in the fourth and first quarters, as those
quarters represent the end of the measurement period for
many of the performance fee-eligible relationships.

The results of our business segments may also be impacted
by the translation of financial results denominated in
foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. We are primarily
impacted by activities denominated in the British pound
and the euro. On a consolidated basis and in our Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services business
segments, we typically have more foreign currency-
denominated expenses than revenues. However, our
Investment and Wealth Management business segment
typically has more foreign currency-denominated revenues
than expenses. Overall, currency fluctuations impact the
year-over-year growth rate in the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment more than the Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services business
segments. However, currency fluctuations, in isolation, are
not expected to significantly impact net income on a
consolidated basis.

Fee revenue in the Investment and Wealth Management
business segment, and, to a lesser extent, the Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services business
segments, is impacted by global market fluctuations. At
Sept. 30, 2024, we estimated that a 5% change in global
equity markets, spread evenly throughout the year, would
impact fee revenue by less than 1% and diluted earnings
per common share by $0.04 to $0.07.

See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for the consolidating schedules, which show the
contribution of our business segments to our overall
profitability.

The Securities Services business segment consists of two
distinct lines of business, Asset Servicing and Issuer
Services, which provide business solutions across the
transaction life cycle to our global asset owner and asset
manager clients. We are one of the leading global
investment services providers with $37.5 trillion of AUC/A
at Sept. 30, 2024. For information on the drivers of the
Securities Services fee revenue, see Note 10 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Annual
Report.

The Asset Servicing business provides a comprehensive
suite of solutions. We are one of the largest global custody
and front-to-back outsourcing partners. We offer services
for the safekeeping of assets in capital markets globally, as
well as fund accounting services, exchange-traded funds
servicing, transfer agency, trust and depository, front-to-
back capabilities as well as data and analytics solutions for
our clients. We deliver foreign exchange, securities lending
and financing solutions, on both an agency and principal
basis. Our agency securities lending program is one of the
largest lenders of U.S. and non-U.S. securities, servicing a
lendable asset pool of approximately $5 trillion in 34
separate markets. Our market-leading liquidity services
portal enables cash investments for institutional clients and
includes fund research and analytics.

Our Digital Asset Custody platform offers custody and
administration services for Bitcoin and Ether for select
U.S. institutional clients. Our Digital Assets Funds
Services provides accounting and administration, transfer
agency and ETF services to digital asset funds. We expect
to continue developing our digital asset capabilities and to
work closely with clients to address their evolving digital
asset needs. As of and for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2024,
our Digital Asset Custody platform and related initiative
had a de minimis impact on our assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses.

The Issuer Services business includes Corporate Trust
and Depositary Receipts. Our Corporate Trust business
delivers a full range of issuer and related investor
services, including trustee, paying agency, fiduciary,
escrow and other financial services. We are a leading
provider to debt capital markets, providing customized
and market-driven solutions to investors, bondholders
and lenders. Our Depositary Receipts business drives
global

investing by providing servicing and value-added
solutions that enable, facilitate and enhance cross-border
trading, clearing, settlement and ownership. We are one
of the largest providers of depositary receipts services in
the world, partnering with leading companies from more
than 50 countries.

Review of financial results

AUC/A of $37.5 trillion increased 16% compared with
Sept. 30, 2023, primarily reflecting higher market values,
net new business and client inflows.

Total revenue of $2.2 billion increased 6% compared
with the third quarter of 2023 and decreased 1%
compared with the second quarter of 2024. The drivers of
total revenue by line of business are indicated below.

Asset Servicing revenue of $1.7 billion increased 9%
compared with the third quarter of 2023 and 2%
compared with the second quarter of 2024. The increase
compared with the third quarter of 2023 primarily
reflects higher market values and client activity, a
strategic equity investment loss recorded in the third
quarter of 2023, net new business and higher net interest
income. The increase compared with the second quarter
of 2024 primarily reflects higher net interest income and
market values.

Issuer Services revenue of $494 million was flat
compared with the third quarter of 2023 and decreased
11% compared with the second quarter of 2024.
Compared with the third quarter of 2023, total revenue
reflects higher Corporate Trust fees offset by lower
Depositary Receipts revenue. The decrease compared
with the second quarter of 2024 primarily reflects lower
Depositary Receipts revenue and net interest income.

Market and regulatory trends are driving investable
assets toward lower fee asset management products at
reduced margins for our clients. These dynamics are also
negatively impacting our investment services fees.
However, at the same time, these trends are providing
additional outsourcing opportunities as clients and other
market participants seek to comply with regulations and
reduce their operating costs.

Noninterest expense of $1.6 billion decreased 3%
compared with the third quarter of 2023 and was flat
compared with the second quarter of 2024. The

BNY 15

decrease compared with the third quarter of 2023
primarily reflects efficiency savings and lower severance
expense, partially offset by higher investments and
employee merit increases.

Year-to-date 2024 compared with year-to-date 2023

Total revenue of $6.6 billion increased 3% compared with
the first nine months of 2023. Asset Servicing revenue of
$5.1 billion increased 3% compared with the first nine
months of 2023, primarily reflecting higher market values,
higher client activity in our fixed income and trading
businesses, net new business and a strategic equity
investment loss recorded in the first nine months of 2023,
partially offset by lower net interest income. Issuer
Services revenue of $1.5 billion increased 2%, primarily
reflecting higher Corporate Trust fees, partially offset by
lower Depositary Receipts revenue.

Noninterest expense of $4.6 billion decreased 1%
compared with the first nine months of 2023, primarily
reflecting efficiency savings and lower severance expense,
partially offset by higher investments and employee merit
increases.

Business segment description

The Market and Wealth Services business segment consists
of three distinct lines of business, Pershing, Treasury
Services and Clearance and Collateral Management, which
provide business services and technology solutions to
entities including financial institutions, corporations,
foundations and endowments, public funds and
government agencies. For information on the drivers of the
Market and Wealth Services fee revenue, see Note 10 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023

Our Treasury Services business is a leading provider of
global payments, liquidity management and trade finance
services for financial institutions, corporations and the
public sector.

clears and settles equity and fixed income transactions
globally and serves as custodian for tri-party repo
collateral worldwide. We are the primary provider of
U.S. government securities clearance and a provider of

and segregation. We offer innovative solutions and
industry expertise, which help financial institutions and

Review of financial results

AUC/A of $14.3 trillion increased 9% compared with Sept.
30, 2023, primarily reflecting higher market values and
client inflows.

the third quarter of 2023 and 1% compared with the second
quarter of 2024. The drivers of total revenue by line of
business are indicated below.

Pershing revenue of $649 million decreased 1% compared
with the third quarter of 2023 and 2%

18 BNY

compared with the second quarter of 2024. The decrease
compared with the third quarter of 2023 primarily reflects
lost business in the prior year and lower net interest
income, partially offset by higher market values. The
decrease compared with the second quarter of 2024
primarily reflects an equity investment gain recorded in the
second quarter of 2024. Net new assets were $(22) billion
in the third quarter of 2024, reflecting the ongoing
deconversion of business lost in the prior year.

Treasury Services revenue of $424 million increased 7%
compared with the third quarter of 2023 and was flat
compared with the second quarter of 2024. The increase
compared with the third quarter of 2023 primarily reflects
net new business. Compared with the second quarter of
2024, net new business was offset by lower net interest
income.

Clearance and Collateral Management revenue of $472
million increased 19% compared with the third quarter of
2023 and 6% compared with the second quarter of 2024.
The increase compared with the third quarter of 2023
primarily reflects higher collateral management fees,
clearance volumes and net interest income. The increase
compared with the second quarter of 2024 primarily
reflects higher clearance volumes and net interest income.

Noninterest expense of $834 million increased 5%
compared with the third quarter of 2023 and was flat
compared with the second quarter of 2024. The increase
compared with the third quarter of 2023 primarily reflects
higher investments and employee merit increases, partially
offset by efficiency savings.

Year-to-date 2024 compared with year-to-date 2023

Total revenue of $4.6 billion increased 5% compared with
the first nine months of 2023. Pershing revenue of $2.0
billion increased 2%, primarily reflecting higher market
values and client activity, partially offset by lost business
in the prior year. Treasury Services revenue of $1.3 billion
increased 3%, primarily reflecting net new business and
higher client activity, partially offset by lower net interest
income. Clearance and Collateral Management revenue of
$1.3 billion increased 13%, primarily reflecting higher
collateral management fees and clearance volumes.

Noninterest expense of $2.5 billion increased 6%
compared with the first nine months of 2023, primarily

Business segment description

Our Investment and Wealth Management business segment
consists of two distinct lines of business: Investment
Management and Wealth Management. Our investment
firms deliver a highly diversified portfolio of investment
strategies independently, and through our global
distribution network, to institutional and retail clients
globally. Wealth Management provides investment
management, custody, wealth and estate planning, private
banking services, investment servicing and information
management. See pages 18 and 19 of our 2023 Annual
Report for additional information on our Investment and
Wealth Management business segment.

Review of financial results

reflecting higher market values and the favorable impact of
a weaker U.S. dollar.

Net long-term strategy outflows were $24 billion in the
third quarter of 2024, driven by index, multi-asset and
alternative, liability-driven and equity investments,
partially offset by inflows of fixed income investments.
Short-term strategy inflows were $24 billion in the third
quarter of 2024. Market and regulatory trends have
resulted in increased demand for lower fee asset
management products and for performance-based fees.

Total revenue of $849 million increased 2% compared with
the third quarter of 2023 and 3% compared with the second
quarter of 2024. The drivers of total revenue by line of
business are indicated below.

AUM of $2.1 trillion as of Sept. 30, 2024, increased 18%
compared with Sept. 30, 2023, primarily

Investment Management revenue of $569 million increased
1% compared with the third quarter of 2023

20 BNY

and 4% compared with the second quarter of 2024. The
increase compared with the third quarter of 2023 primarily
reflects higher market values and improved seed capital
results, partially offset by lower performance fees and the
mix of AUM flows. The increase compared with the
second quarter of 2024 primarily reflects higher market
values, seed capital gains and the timing of performance
fees.

Wealth Management revenue of $280 million increased 6%
compared with the third quarter of 2023 and 3% compared
with the second quarter of 2024. The increase compared
with the third quarter of 2023 primarily reflects higher
market values and net interest income, partially offset by
changes in product mix. The increase compared with the
second quarter of 2024 primarily reflects higher market
values.

Revenue generated in the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment included 31% from non-
U.S. sources in the third quarter of 2024, compared with
33% in the third quarter of 2023 and 30% in the second
quarter of 2024.

Other segment

Noninterest expense of $672 million was flat compared
with the third quarter of 2023 and increased 1% compared
with the second quarter of 2024. Compared with the third
quarter of 2023, total noninterest expense reflects
efficiency savings, offset by employee merit increases and
higher investments.

Year-to-date 2024 compared with year-to-date 2023

Total revenue of $2.5 billion increased 2% compared with
the first nine months of 2023. Investment Management
revenue of $1.7 billion increased 1%, primarily reflecting
higher market values, partially offset by the mix of AUM
flows and lower performance fees. Wealth Management
revenue of $822 million increased 4%, primarily reflecting
higher market values, partially offset by changes in product
mix.

Noninterest expense of $2.1 billion decreased 1%
compared with the first nine months of 2023, primarily
reflecting efficiency savings, partially offset by employee
merit increases and higher investments.

Review of financial results

Total revenue includes corporate treasury and other
investment activity, including hedging activity, which has
an offsetting impact between fee and other revenue and net
interest expense.

Total revenue decreased $23 million compared with the
third quarter of 2023 and increased $33 million compared
with the second quarter of 2024. The decrease compared
with the third quarter of 2023 primarily reflects debt
extinguishment gains recorded in the third quarter of 2023.
The increase compared with the second quarter of 2024
primarily reflects gains on real estate and other
investments.

Noninterest expense increased $13 million compared with
the third quarter of 2023 and $22 million

Goodwill and other intangibles

BNY’s business segments include seven reporting units for
which goodwill impairment testing is performed on an
annual basis. An interim goodwill impairment test is
performed when events or circumstances occur that may
indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of
any reporting unit may be less than its carrying value.

In the third quarter of 2024, due to the results of the second
quarter 2024 interim test and macroeconomic conditions,
we performed an interim goodwill impairment test of the
Investment Management reporting unit, which had $6.1
billion of allocated goodwill. The fair value of the
Investment Management reporting unit exceeded its
carrying value by approximately 5%. We determined the
fair value of the Investment Management reporting unit
using an income approach based on management’s
projections as of Sept. 30, 2024. The discount rate applied
to these cash flows was 10.5%.

As of Sept. 30, 2024, if the discount rate applied to the
estimated cash flows was increased or decreased by 25
basis points, the fair value of the Investment Management
reporting unit would decrease or increase by 4%,
respectively. Similarly, if the long-term growth rate was
increased or decreased by 10 basis points, the fair value of
the Investment Management reporting unit would increase
or decrease by approximately 1%, respectively.

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is subject to
uncertainty as it is reliant on estimates of cash flows that
extend far into the future, and, by their nature, are difficult
to estimate over such an extended time frame. In the future,
changes in the assumptions or the discount rate could
produce a material non-cash goodwill impairment.

compared with the second quarter of 2024. The increase
compared with the third quarter of 2023 primarily reflects
higher staff expense, partially offset by a reduction in the
FDIC special assessment. The increase compared with the
second quarter of 2024 primarily reflects the impact of the
adjustments to the FDIC special assessment recorded in the
second and third quarters of 2024.

Year-to-date 2024 compared with year-to-date 2023

Loss before income taxes increased $15 million compared
with the first nine months of 2023. Total revenue decreased
$10 million, primarily reflecting debt extinguishment gains
recorded in the third quarter of 2023 and higher net
securities losses, partially offset by improved investment
results.

Noninterest expense decreased $19 million compared with
the first nine months of 2023, primarily reflecting
reductions in the FDIC special assessment and lower
litigation reserves, partially offset by higher staff expense.

Critical accounting estimates

Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our
2023 Annual Report. Our critical accounting estimates are
those related to the allowance for credit losses, goodwill
and other intangibles and litigation and regulatory
contingencies, as referenced below.

Consolidated balance sheet review

One of our key risk management objectives is to maintain a
balance sheet that remains strong throughout market cycles
to meet the expectations of our major stakeholders,
including our shareholders, clients, creditors and
regulators.

We also seek to undertake overall liquidity risk, including
intraday liquidity risk, that stays within our risk appetite.
The objective of our balance sheet management strategy is
to maintain a balance sheet that is characterized by strong
liquidity and asset quality, ready access to external funding
sources at competitive rates and a strong capital structure
that supports our risk-taking activities and is adequate to
absorb potential losses. In managing the balance sheet,
appropriate consideration is given to balancing the
competing needs of maintaining sufficient levels of
liquidity and complying with applicable regulations and
supervisory expectations while optimizing profitability.

At Sept. 30, 2024, total assets were $427 billion, compared
with $410 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. The increase in total
assets was primarily driven by higher securities, federal
funds sold and securities purchased under resale
agreements and loans, partially offset by lower interest-
bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central
banks. Deposits totaled $296 billion at Sept. 30, 2024,
compared with $284 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. The increase
reflects higher interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing
deposits. Total interest-bearing deposits as a percentage of
total interest-earning assets were 64% at Sept. 30, 2024
and 66% at Dec. 31, 2023.

At Sept. 30, 2024, available funds totaled $154 billion and
included cash and due from banks, interest-bearing
deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks,
interest-bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold
and securities purchased under resale agreements. This
compares with available funds of $158 billion at Dec. 31,
2023. Total available funds as a percentage of total assets
was 36% at Sept. 30, 2024 and 38% at Dec. 31, 2023. For
additional information on our available funds, see
“Liquidity and dividends.”

Securities were $142 billion, or 33% of total assets, at
Sept. 30, 2024, compared with $126 billion, or 31% of
total assets, at Dec. 31, 2023. The increase

primarily reflects higher non-U.S. government, U.S.
Treasury and agency residential mortgage-backed
securities (“RMBS”) and unrealized pre-tax gains in the
first nine months of 2024, partially offset by lower U.S.
government agencies securities. For additional information
on our securities portfolio, see “Securities” and Note 4 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Loans were $69 billion, or 16% of total assets, at Sept. 30,
2024, compared with $67 billion, or 16% of total assets, at
Dec. 31, 2023. The increase was driven by higher loans in
the financial institutions portfolio and capital call
financing, partially offset by lower overdrafts and
commercial and wealth management loans. For additional
information on our loan portfolio, see “Loans” and Note 5
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Long-term debt totaled $33 billion at Sept. 30, 2024 and
$31 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Issuances and an increase in
the fair value of hedged long-term debt were partially
offset by maturities and redemptions. For additional
information on long-term debt, see “Liquidity and
dividends.”

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total
shareholders’ equity totaled $42 billion at Sept. 30, 2024
and $41 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. For additional
information, see “Capital.”

Country risk exposure

The following table presents BNY’s top 10 exposures by
country (excluding the U.S.) as of Sept. 30, 2024, as well
as certain countries with higher risk profiles. The exposure
is presented on an internal risk management basis and has
not been reduced by the allowance for credit losses. We
monitor our exposure to these and other countries as part of
our internal country risk management process.

The country risk exposure below reflects the Company’s
risk to an immediate default of the counterparty or obligor
based on the country of residence of the entity which
incurs the liability. If there is credit risk mitigation, the
country of residence of the entity providing the risk
mitigation is the country of risk. The country of risk for
securities is generally based on the domicile of the issuer
of the security.

(d)    The top 10 country exposures comprise approximately 65% of our total non-U.S. exposure.
(e)    Represents cash balances with exposure to Russia.

Events in recent years have resulted in increased focus on
Brazil. The country risk exposure to Brazil is primarily
short-term trade finance loans extended to large financial
institutions. We also have operations in Brazil providing
investment services and investment management services.

The war in Ukraine increased our focus on Russia. The
country risk exposure to Russia consists of cash balances
related to our securities services businesses and may
increase in the future to the extent cash is received for the
benefit of our clients that is subject to distribution
restrictions. BNY has ceased new banking business in
Russia and suspended investment

management purchases of Russian securities. At Sept. 30,
2024, less than 0.1% of our AUC/A and less than 0.01% of
our AUM consisted of Russian securities. We will continue
to work with multinational clients that depend on our
custody and recordkeeping services to manage their
exposures.

We are monitoring our exposure to Israel as part of our
internal country risk management process. At Sept. 30,
2024, our total exposure to Israel was $252 million and
primarily consisted of investment grade short-term interest-
bearing deposits and OTC derivatives maturing within six
months.

Securities

In the discussion of our securities portfolio, we have included certain credit ratings information because the information can
indicate the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed. Significant changes in ratings classifications could indicate increased
credit risk for us and could be accompanied by an increase in the allowance for credit losses and/or a reduction in the fair value
of our securities portfolio.

(e)    Primarily consists of exposure to Canada, UK, Germany and Australia.

(f)    Includes net unrealized gains on derivatives hedging securities available-for-sale (including discontinued hedges) of $2,163 million at June 30, 2024 and $1,141 million at Sept. 30,

2024.

(g)    At Sept. 30, 2024, includes pre-tax net unrealized losses of $1,026 million related to available-for-sale securities, net of hedges, and $3,657 million related to held-to-maturity

securities. The after-tax unrealized losses, net of hedges, related to available-for-sale securities is $774 million and the after-tax equivalent related to held-to-maturity securities is

$2,789 million.

The fair value of our securities portfolio, including related
hedges, was $139.4 billion at Sept. 30, 2024, compared
with $123.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. The increase
primarily reflects higher non-U.S. government, U.S.
Treasury and agency RMBS securities and unrealized pre-
tax gains in the first nine months of 2024, partially offset
by lower U.S. government agencies securities.

The unrealized loss (after-tax) on our available-for-sale
securities portfolio, net of hedges, included in accumulated
other comprehensive income was $774 million at Sept. 30,
2024, compared with $1.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. The
improvement in the net unrealized loss, including the
impact of hedges, primarily reflects the impact of securities
moving closer to maturity and lower market interest rates.

At Sept. 30, 2024, the securities portfolio had a net
unrealized loss, including the impact of related hedges, of
$4.7 billion, compared with $7.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.
The improvement in the unrealized loss, including the
impact of related hedges, primarily reflects the impact of
securities moving closer to maturity and lower market
interest rates.

The fair value of the available-for-sale securities totaled
$98.1 billion at Sept. 30, 2024, net of hedges, or 70% of
the securities portfolio, net of hedges. The fair value of the
held-to-maturity securities totaled $41.3 billion at Sept. 30,
2024, or 30% of the securities portfolio, net of hedges.

At Sept. 30, 2024, 98% of the securities in our portfolio
were rated AAA/AA-, compared with 99% at Dec. 31,
2023.

At Sept. 30, 2024, our total lending-related exposure of
$122.2 billion increased 6% compared with Dec. 31, 2023,
primarily reflecting higher exposure in the financial
institutions portfolio.

Our financial institutions and commercial portfolios
comprise our largest concentrated risk. These portfolios
comprised 49% of our total exposure at Sept. 30, 2024 and
46% at Dec. 31, 2023. Additionally, most of our overdrafts
relate to financial institutions.

The financial institutions portfolio exposure was $46.4
billion at Sept. 30, 2024, an increase of 17% compared
with Dec. 31, 2023, primarily reflecting higher exposure in
the securities industry and banks portfolios.

Financial institution exposures are high quality, with 96%
of the exposures meeting the investment grade equivalent
criteria of our internal credit rating classification at Sept.
30, 2024. Each customer is assigned an internal credit
rating, which is mapped to an equivalent external rating
agency grade based upon a number of dimensions, which
are continually evaluated and may change over time. For
ratings of non-U.S. counterparties, our internal credit rating
is generally capped at a rating equivalent to the sovereign
rating of the country where the counterparty resides,
regardless of the internal credit rating assigned to the
counterparty or the underlying collateral.

The exposure to financial institutions is generally short
term, with 85% of the exposures expiring within one year.
At Sept. 30, 2024, 46% of the exposure to financial
institutions had an expiration within 90 days, compared
with 19% at Dec. 31, 2023.

In addition, 65% of the financial institutions exposure is
secured. For example, securities industry clients

Commercial

and asset managers often borrow against marketable
securities held in custody.

At Sept. 30, 2024, the secured intraday credit provided to
dealers in connection with their tri-party repo activity
totaled $13.5 billion and was included in the securities
industry portfolio. Dealers secure the outstanding intraday
credit with high-quality liquid collateral having a market
value in excess of the amount of the outstanding credit.
Secured intraday credit facilities represent approximately
29% of the exposure in the financial institutions portfolio
and are reviewed and reapproved annually.

The asset managers portfolio exposure is high quality, with
96% of the exposures meeting our investment grade
equivalent ratings criteria as of Sept. 30, 2024. These
exposures are generally short-term liquidity facilities, with
the majority to regulated mutual funds.

Our banks portfolio exposure primarily relates to global
trade finance. These exposures are short term in nature,
with 94% due in less than one year. The investment grade
percentage of our banks portfolio exposure was 85% at
Sept. 30, 2024, compared with 84% at Dec. 31, 2023. Our
non-investment grade exposures are primarily trade finance
loans in Brazil.

Wealth management loans

Our wealth management loan exposure was $9.4 billion at
Sept. 30, 2024, compared with $9.6 billion at Dec. 31,
2023. Wealth management loans primarily consist of loans
to high-net-worth individuals, a majority of which are
secured by the customers’ investment management
accounts or custody accounts.

Wealth management mortgages

Our wealth management mortgage exposure was $9.2
billion at Sept. 30, 2024, compared with $9.4 billion

Commercial real estate

at Dec. 31, 2023. Wealth management mortgages primarily
consist of loans to high-net-worth individuals, which are
secured by residential property. Wealth management
mortgages are primarily interest-only, adjustable-rate
mortgages with a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio of
61% at origination. At Sept. 30, 2024, less than 1% of the
mortgages were past due.

At Sept. 30, 2024, the wealth management mortgage
portfolio consisted of the following geographic
concentrations: California – 21%; New York – 14%;
Florida – 11%; Massachusetts – 8%; and other – 46%.

Our commercial real estate exposure totaled $10.1 billion
at Sept. 30, 2024 and $10.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Our
income-producing commercial real estate facilities are
focused on experienced owners and are structured with
moderate leverage based on existing cash flows. Our
commercial real estate lending activities also include
construction and renovation facilities. Our client base
consists of experienced developers and long-term holders
of real estate assets. Loans are approved on the basis of
existing or projected cash flows and supported by
appraisals and knowledge of local market conditions.
Development loans are structured with moderate leverage
and, in many instances, involve some level of recourse to
the developer.

At Sept. 30, 2024, the unsecured portfolio consisted of real
estate investment trusts (“REITs”) and real estate operating
companies, which are both primarily investment grade.

At Sept. 30, 2024, our commercial real estate portfolio
consisted of the following concentrations: New York metro
– 34%; REITs and real estate operating companies – 29%;
and other – 37%.

Lease financings

The lease financings portfolio exposure totaled $601
million at Sept. 30, 2024 and $599 million at Dec. 31,
2023. At Sept. 30, 2024, nearly all of leasing exposure was
investment grade, or investment grade equivalent, and
consisted of exposures backed by well-diversified assets,
primarily real estate and large-ticket transportation
equipment. Assets are both domestic and foreign-based,
with primary concentrations in Germany and the U.S.

Other residential mortgages

The other residential mortgages portfolio primarily consists
of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and

28 BNY

totaled $1.1 billion at Sept. 30, 2024 and $1.2 billion at
Dec. 31, 2023.

Other loans

Overdrafts

Other loans primarily include loans to consumers that are
fully collateralized with equities, mutual funds and fixed-
income securities.

Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities
clearance clients and are generally repaid within two
business days.

Margin loans

Capital call financing

Capital call financing includes loans to private equity funds
that are secured by the fund investors’ capital commitments
and the funds’ rights to call capital.

Allowance for credit losses

Margin loan exposure of $18.5 billion at Sept. 30, 2024
and $18.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2023 was collateralized with
marketable securities. Borrowers are required to maintain a
daily collateral margin in excess of 100% of the value of
the loan. Margin loans included $8 billion at Sept. 30, 2024
and $7 billion at Dec. 31, 2023 related to a term loan
program that offers fully collateralized loans to broker-
dealers.

Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade clients who are active users of our non-credit services. Our primary exposure
to the credit risk of a customer consists of funded loans, unfunded contractual commitments to lend, standby letters of credit
and overdrafts associated with our custody and securities clearance businesses.

Provision for credit losses was $23 million, primarily
driven by increases in the allowance related to commercial
real estate exposure.

The allowance for loan losses and the allowance for
lending-related commitments represent

management’s estimate of lifetime expected losses in our
credit portfolio. This evaluation process is subject to
numerous estimates and judgments. To the extent actual
results differ from forecasts or management’s judgment,
the allowance for credit losses may be greater or less than
future charge-offs.

Based on an evaluation of the allowance for credit losses as discussed in “Critical accounting estimates” in our 2023 Annual
Report, we have allocated our allowance for loans and lending-related commitments as presented below.

(a)    The allowance allocated to margin loans, overdrafts and other loans was insignificant at Sept. 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, Dec. 31, 2023 and Sept. 30,

2023.

(b)    The methodology used to allocate the qualitative reserves was modified in the second quarter of 2024 to align certain specifically identifiable

qualitative reserves with the respective class of financing receivables. For additional information, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

The allocation of the allowance for credit losses is
inherently judgmental, and the entire allowance for credit
losses is available to absorb credit losses regardless of the
nature of the losses.

Our allowance for credit losses is sensitive to a number of
inputs, most notably the macroeconomic forecast
assumptions that are incorporated into our estimate of
credit losses through the expected life of the loan portfolio,
as well as the credit ratings assigned to each borrower. As
the macroeconomic environment and related forecasts
change, the allowance for credit losses may change
materially. The following sensitivity analyses do not
represent management’s expectations of the deterioration
of our portfolios or the economic environment, but are
provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity
of the allowance for credit losses to changes in key inputs.
If commercial real estate property values were increased
10% and all other credits were rated one grade better, the
quantitative allowance would have decreased by $51
million, and if commercial real estate property values were
decreased 10% and all other credits were rated one grade
worse, the quantitative allowance would have

30 BNY

increased by $83 million. Our multi-scenario-based
macroeconomic forecast used in determining the Sept. 30,
2024 allowance for credit losses consisted of three
scenarios. The baseline scenario reflects positive but
slightly declining GDP growth, stable unemployment and
slightly declining commercial real estate prices through the
end of 2024. The upside scenario reflects higher GDP
growth through the fourth quarter 2024 before moderating,
declining unemployment through the end of 2024 and
stable commercial real estate prices through the end of
2024 compared with the baseline. The downside scenario
contemplates negative GDP growth through the fourth
quarter of 2024 before moderating, rapidly increasing
unemployment through the third quarter of 2025 and
sharply lower commercial real estate prices than the
baseline. At Sept. 30, 2024, we placed the most weight on
our baseline scenario, with the remaining weighting placed
on the upside and downside scenarios. From a sensitivity
perspective, at Sept. 30, 2024, if we had applied 100%
weighting to the downside scenario, the allowance for
credit losses would have been approximately $123 million
higher.

(“FICC”), where we record interest expense on a gross
basis, but the ending and average balances reflect the
impact of offsetting under enforceable netting agreements.
This activity primarily relates to government securities
collateralized resale and repurchase agreements executed
with clients that are novated to and settle with the FICC.

Payables to customers and broker-dealers represent funds
awaiting reinvestment and short sale proceeds payable on
demand. Payables to customers and broker-dealers are
driven by customer trading activity and market volatility.

The Bank of New York Mellon issues commercial paper
that matures within 397 days from the date of issue and is
not redeemable prior to maturity or subject to voluntary
prepayment.

Other borrowed funds primarily include borrowings from
the Federal Home Loan Bank, overdrafts of sub-custodian
account balances in our Securities Services businesses,
finance lease liabilities and borrowings under lines of
credit by our Pershing subsidiaries. Overdrafts typically
relate to timing differences for settlements.

Liquidity and dividends

BNY defines liquidity as the ability of the Parent and its
subsidiaries to access funding or convert assets to cash
quickly and efficiently, or to roll over or issue new debt,
especially during periods of market stress, at a reasonable
cost, and in order to meet its short-term (up to one year)
obligations. Funding liquidity risk is the risk that BNY
cannot meet its cash and collateral obligations at a
reasonable cost for both expected and unexpected cash
flow and collateral needs without adversely affecting daily
operations or our financial condition. Funding liquidity risk
can arise from funding mismatches, market constraints
from the inability to convert assets into cash, the inability
to hold or raise cash, low overnight deposits, deposit run-
off or contingent liquidity events.

Changes in economic conditions or exposure to credit,
market, operational, legal and reputational risks also can
affect BNY’s liquidity risk profile and are considered in
our liquidity risk framework. For additional information,
see “Risk Management – Liquidity Risk” in our 2023
Annual Report.

Deposits

Total deposits were $296.4 billion at Sept. 30, 2024, an
increase of 5%, compared with $283.7 billion at Dec. 31,
2023. The increase reflects higher interest-bearing deposits
and noninterest-bearing deposits (principally U.S. offices).

Noninterest-bearing deposits were $61.5 billion at Sept. 30,
2024, compared with $58.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.
Interest-bearing deposits were primarily demand deposits
and totaled $234.9 billion at Sept. 30, 2024, compared with
$225.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.

Short-term borrowings

We fund ourselves primarily through deposits and, to a
lesser extent, other short-term borrowings and long-term
debt. Short-term borrowings consist of federal funds
purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, payables to customers and broker-dealers,
commercial paper and other borrowed funds. Certain short-
term borrowings, for example, securities sold under
repurchase agreements, require the delivery of securities as
collateral.

Federal funds purchased and securities sold under
repurchase agreements include repurchase agreement
activity with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation

BNY 31

The Parent’s policy is to have access to sufficient
unencumbered cash and cash equivalents at each quarter-
end to cover maturities and other forecasted debt
redemptions, net interest payments and net tax payments
for the following 18-month period, and to provide
sufficient collateral to satisfy transactions subject to
Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.

BNY also manages potential intraday liquidity risks. We
monitor and manage intraday liquidity against existing and
expected intraday liquid resources (such as cash balances,
remaining intraday credit capacity, intraday contingency
funding and available collateral) to enable BNY to meet its
intraday obligations under normal and reasonably severe
stressed conditions.

We monitor and control liquidity exposures and funding
needs within and across significant legal entities, branches,
currencies and business lines, taking into account, among
other factors, any applicable restrictions on the transfer of
liquidity among entities.

We define available funds for internal liquidity
management purposes as cash and due from banks,
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and
other central banks, interest-bearing deposits with banks
and federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements.

Total available funds were $154.0 billion at Sept. 30, 2024,
compared with $157.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. The
decrease was primarily due to lower interest-bearing
deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks
and interest-bearing deposits with banks, partially offset by
higher federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements.

Average non-core sources of funds, such as federal funds
purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, trading liabilities, commercial paper and other
borrowed funds, were $19.8 billion for the first nine
months of 2024, compared with $27.0 billion for the first
nine months of 2023. The decrease primarily reflects lower
federal funds purchased and securities sold under
repurchase agreements and lower trading liabilities.

Average interest-bearing domestic deposits were
$141.0 billion for the first nine months of 2024, compared
with $120.8 billion for the first nine months of 2023.
Average interest-bearing foreign deposits, primarily from
our European-based businesses included in the Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services segments, were
$92.8

billion for the first nine months of 2024, compared with
$88.9 billion for the first nine months of 2023. The
changes primarily reflect client activity.

Average payables to customers and broker-dealers were
$12.4 billion for the first nine months of 2024 and $15.1
billion for the first nine months of 2023. Payables to
customers and broker-dealers are driven by customer
trading activity and market volatility.

Average long-term debt was $31.9 billion for the first nine
months of 2024 and $31.1 billion for the first nine months
of 2023.

Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased to $49.0
billion for the first nine months of 2024 from $61.4 billion
for the first nine months of 2023, primarily reflecting client
activity.

A significant reduction of client activity in our Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services business
segments would reduce our access to deposits. See
“Asset/liability management” for additional factors that
could impact our deposit balances.

Sources of liquidity

The Parent’s major sources of liquidity are access to the debt and equity markets, dividends from its subsidiaries, and cash on
hand and cash otherwise made available in business-as-usual circumstances to the Parent through a committed credit facility
with our intermediate holding company (“IHC”).

Our ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms, or at all, is partially dependent on our credit ratings, which are as

Long-term debt totaled $33.2 billion at Sept. 30, 2024 and
$31.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Issuances totaling $5.0
billion and an increase in the fair value of hedged long-
term debt were partially offset by maturities and
redemptions of $3.5 billion. Long-term debt of $1.7 billion
will mature in the remainder of 2024.

The Bank of New York Mellon may issue notes and
certificates of deposit (“CDs”). At Sept. 30, 2024 and Dec.
31, 2023, $1.8 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, of
notes were outstanding. At Sept. 30, 2024 and Dec. 31,
2023, $1.3 billion and $397 million, respectively, of CDs
were outstanding.

The Bank of New York Mellon also issues commercial
paper that matures within 397 days from the date of issue
and is not redeemable prior to maturity or subject to
voluntary prepayment. There was $301 million of
commercial paper outstanding at Sept. 30, 2024. There was
no commercial paper

outstanding at Dec. 31, 2023. The average commercial
paper outstanding was $815 million for the first nine
months of 2024 and $4 million for the first nine months of
2023.

Subsequent to Sept. 30, 2024, our U.S. bank subsidiaries
could declare dividends to the Parent of approximately
$1.3 billion, without the need for a regulatory waiver. In
addition, at Sept. 30, 2024, non-bank subsidiaries of the
Parent had liquid assets of approximately $4.5 billion.
Restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our
subsidiaries are discussed in more detail in “Supervision
and Regulation – Capital Planning and Stress Testing –
Payment of Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Other
Capital Distributions” and in Note 19 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, both in our 2023
Annual Report.

Pershing LLC has one uncommitted line of credit in place
for funding purposes that is guaranteed by the

BNY 33

  
 
Parent for $300 million. There were no borrowings under
this line in the third quarter of 2024. Pershing Limited, an
indirect UK-based subsidiary of BNY, has two separate
uncommitted lines of credit amounting to $261 million in
aggregate. Average borrowings under these lines were less
than $1 million in the third quarter of 2024.

quality liquid assets (“HQLA”) sufficient to withstand the
net cash outflow under a hypothetical standardized acute
liquidity stress scenario for a 30-day time horizon.

The following table presents BNY’s consolidated HQLA,
and the average HQLA and average LCR.

The double leverage ratio is the ratio of our equity
investment in subsidiaries divided by our consolidated
Parent company equity, which includes our noncumulative
perpetual preferred stock. In short, the double leverage
ratio measures the extent to which equity in subsidiaries is
financed by Parent company debt. As the double leverage
ratio increases, this can reflect greater demands on a
company’s cash flows in order to service interest payments
and debt maturities. BNY’s double leverage ratio is
managed in a range considering the high level of
unencumbered available liquid assets held in its principal
subsidiaries (such as central bank deposit placements and
government securities), the Company’s cash generating
fee-based business model, with fee revenue representing
73% of total revenue in the third quarter of 2024, and the
dividend capacity of our banking subsidiaries. Our double
leverage ratio was 120.4% at Sept. 30, 2024 and 120.5% at
Dec. 31, 2023, and within the range targeted by
management.

Uses of funds

The Parent’s major uses of funds are repurchases of
common stock, payment of dividends, principal and
interest payments on its borrowings, acquisitions and
additional investments in its subsidiaries.

In July 2024, our Board of Directors approved a 12%
increase in the quarterly cash dividend on our common
stock, from $0.42 to $0.47 per share. The increased
quarterly cash dividend was paid on Aug. 2, 2024. Our
common stock dividend payout ratio was 32% for the third
quarter of 2024.

In the third quarter of 2024, we repurchased 11.1 million
common shares at an average price of $65.10 per common
share, for a total cost of $725 million.

Liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”)

U.S. regulators have established an LCR that requires
certain banking organizations, including BNY, to maintain
a minimum amount of unencumbered high-

BNY and each of our affected domestic bank subsidiaries
were compliant with the U.S. LCR requirements of at least
100% throughout the third quarter of 2024.

Net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”)

The NSFR is a liquidity requirement applicable to large
U.S. banking organizations, including BNY. The NSFR is
expressed as a ratio of the available stable funding to the
required stable funding amount over a one-year horizon.
Our average consolidated NSFR was 132% for the third
quarter of 2024 and second quarter of 2024.

BNY and each of our affected domestic bank subsidiaries
were compliant with the NSFR requirement of at least
100% throughout the third quarter of 2024.

Statement of cash flows

The following summarizes the activity reflected on the
consolidated statement of cash flows. While this
information may be helpful to highlight certain macro
trends and business strategies, the cash flow analysis may
not be as relevant when analyzing changes in our net
earnings and net assets. We believe that in addition to the
traditional cash flow analysis, the

discussion related to liquidity and dividends and
asset/liability management herein may provide more useful
context in evaluating our liquidity position and related
activity.

Net cash used for operating activities was $863 million in
the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2024, compared with net
cash provided by operating activities of $8.0 billion in the
nine months ended Sept. 30, 2023. In the nine months
ended Sept. 30, 2024, cash flows used for operations
primarily resulted from changes in trading assets and
liabilities, partially offset by earnings. In the nine months
ended Sept. 30, 2023, cash flows provided by operations
primarily resulted from earnings and changes in accruals
and other, net.

Net cash used for investing activities was $11.1 billion in
the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2024, compared with $4.5
billion in the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2023. In the nine
months ended Sept. 30, 2024, net cash used for investing
activities primarily resulted from changes in securities,
federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale
agreements and loans, partially offset by changes in

In the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2023, net cash used for
investing activities primarily resulted from changes in
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and
other central banks and changes in federal funds sold and

net cash used for financing activities of $7.3 billion in the
nine months ended Sept. 30, 2023. In the nine months

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total
shareholders’ equity was $42.0 billion at Sept. 30, 2024
and $40.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2023, primarily reflecting
earnings and improvements in accumulated other
comprehensive income, partially offset by common stock
repurchases and divided payments.

The unrealized loss (after-tax) on our available-for-sale
securities portfolio, net of hedges, included in accumulated
other comprehensive income was $774 million at Sept. 30,
2024, compared with $1.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. The
improvement in the net unrealized loss, including the
impact of hedges,

established quantitative measurements. For the Parent to
maintain its status as a financial holding company, our U.S.
bank subsidiaries and BNY must, among other things,
qualify as “well capitalized.” As of Sept. 30, 2024 and Dec.
31, 2023, BNY and our U.S. bank subsidiaries were “well
capitalized.” Failure to satisfy regulatory standards,
including “well capitalized” status or capital adequacy
rules more generally, could result in limitations on our
activities and adversely affect our financial condition. See
the discussion of these matters in “Supervision and
Regulation – Regulated Entities of BNY Mellon and
Ancillary Regulatory Requirements” and “Risk Factors –
Capital and Liquidity Risk – Failure to satisfy regulatory
standards, including “well capitalized” and “well
managed” status or capital adequacy and liquidity rules
more generally, could result in limitations on our activities
and adversely affect our business and financial condition,”
both of which are in our 2023 Annual Report.

The U.S. banking agencies’ capital rules are based on the
framework adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision, as amended from time to time. For additional
information on these capital requirements, see
“Supervision and Regulation” in our 2023 Annual Report.

primarily reflects the impact of securities moving closer to
maturity and lower market interest rates.

In the first nine months of 2024, we repurchased 39.3
million common shares at an average price of $58.92 per
common share for a total cost of $2.3 billion.

In January 2023, we announced a share repurchase
program approved by our Board of Directors providing for
the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of common shares
beginning Jan. 1, 2023. This share repurchase plan
replaced all previously authorized share repurchase plans.

In April 2024, we announced a new authorization
providing for the repurchase of $6.0 billion of common
shares in addition to any remaining capacity under the
existing January 2023 authorization.

In July 2024, our Board of Directors approved a 12%
increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock,
from $0.42 to $0.47 per share. The increased quarterly cash
dividend was paid on Aug. 2, 2024.

(a)    Minimum requirements for Sept. 30, 2024 include minimum thresholds plus currently applicable buffers. The U.S. global systemically important banks

(“G-SIB”) surcharge of 1.5% is subject to change. The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set to 0%. The stress capital buffer (“SCB”)
requirement is 2.5%, equal to the regulatory minimum for Standardized Approach capital ratios.

(b)    For our CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, our effective capital ratios under U.S. capital rules are the lower of the ratios as calculated

under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is based on Tier 1 capital and quarterly average total assets.

(c)    The Federal Reserve’s regulations do not establish well capitalized thresholds for these measures for BHCs.
(d)    The SLR is based on Tier 1 capital and total leverage exposure, which includes certain off-balance sheet exposures.
N/A – Not applicable.

Our CET1 ratio under the Standardized Approach was
11.9% at Sept. 30, 2024 and 11.5% at Dec. 31, 2023 under
the Advanced Approaches. The increase reflects capital
generated through earnings and improvements in other
comprehensive income, partially offset by capital returned
through common stock repurchases and dividends, and
higher risk-weighted assets.

The Tier 1 leverage ratio was 6.0% at Sept. 30, 2024 and
6.0% at Dec. 31, 2023. The increase in capital was offset
by higher average assets.

Risk-based capital ratios vary depending on the size of the
balance sheet at period end and the levels and types of
investments in assets, and leverage ratios vary based on the
average size of the balance sheet over the quarter. The
balance sheet size fluctuates from period to period based
on levels of customer and market activity. In general, when
servicing clients are more actively trading securities,
deposit balances and the balance sheet as a whole are
higher. In addition, when markets experience significant

volatility or stress, our balance sheet size may increase
considerably as client deposit levels increase.

Our capital ratios are necessarily subject to, among other
things, anticipated compliance with all necessary
enhancements to model calibration, approval by regulators
of certain models used as part of RWA calculations, other
refinements, further implementation guidance from
regulators, market practices and standards and any changes
BNY may make to its businesses. As a consequence of
these factors, our capital ratios may materially change and
may be volatile over time and from period to period.

Under the Advanced Approaches, our operational loss risk
model is informed by external losses, including fines and
penalties levied against institutions in the financial services
industry, particularly those that relate to businesses in
which we operate, and as a result, external losses have
impacted and could in the future impact the amount of
capital that we are required to hold.

Stress capital buffer

In July 2023, the Federal Reserve announced that BNY’s
SCB requirement would remain at 2.5%, equal to the
regulatory floor, for the period from Oct. 1, 2023 through
Sept. 30, 2024. The SCB replaced the static 2.5% capital
conservation buffer for Standardized Approach capital
ratios for CCAR BHCs. The SCB does not apply to bank
subsidiaries, which remain subject to the static 2.5%
capital conservation buffer. In August 2024, the Federal
Reserve announced that BNY’s SCB requirement would
remain at 2.5%, equal to the regulatory floor, for the period
from Oct. 1, 2024 through Sept. 30, 2025. See
“Supervision and Regulation” in our 2023 Annual Report
for additional information.

The SCB final rule generally eliminates the requirement
for prior approval of common stock repurchases in excess
of the distributions in a firm’s capital plan, provided that
such distributions are consistent with applicable capital
requirements and buffers, including the SCB.

unsecured debt securities, subject to haircuts for amounts
due to be paid within two years, that satisfy certain other
conditions. Debt issued prior to Dec. 31, 2016 has been
permanently grandfathered to the extent these instruments
otherwise would be ineligible only due to containing
impermissible acceleration rights or being governed by
foreign law.

Trading activities and risk management

Our trading activities are focused on acting as a market-
maker for our customers, facilitating customer trades and
risk-mitigating hedging in compliance with the Volcker
Rule. The risk from market-making activities for customers
is managed by our traders and limited in total exposure
through a system of position limits, value-at-risk (“VaR”)
methodology and other market sensitivity measures. VaR is
the potential loss in value due to adverse market
movements over a defined time horizon with a specified
confidence level. The calculation of our VaR used by
management and presented below assumes a one-day
holding period, utilizes a 99% confidence level and
incorporates non-linear product characteristics. VaR
facilitates comparisons across portfolios of different risk
characteristics. VaR also captures the diversification of
aggregated risk at the firm-wide level.

BNY 39

VaR represents a key risk management measure, and it is
important to note the inherent limitations to VaR, which
include:
• VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer time

horizons where moves may be extreme;

• VaR does not take into account the potential variability

of market liquidity; and

• Previous moves in market risk factors may not produce

accurate predictions of all future market moves.

See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information on the VaR
methodology.

The following tables indicate the calculated VaR amounts
for the trading portfolio for the designated periods using
the historical simulation VaR model.

N/M – Because the minimum and maximum may occur on different days for
different risk components, it is not meaningful to compute a minimum
and maximum portfolio diversification effect.

The interest rate component of VaR represents instruments
whose values are predominantly driven by interest rate
levels. These instruments include, but are not limited to,
U.S. Treasury securities, swaps, swaptions, forward rate
agreements, exchange-traded futures and options, and other
interest rate derivative products.

The foreign exchange component of VaR represents
instruments whose values predominantly vary with the
level or volatility of currency exchange rates or interest
rates. These instruments include, but are not limited to,
currency balances, spot and forward transactions, currency
options and other currency derivative products.

The equity component of VaR consists of instruments that
represent an ownership interest in the form of domestic and
foreign common stock or other equity-linked instruments.
These instruments include, but are not limited to, common
stock, exchange-traded funds, preferred stock, listed equity
options (puts and calls), OTC equity options, equity total
return swaps, equity index futures and other equity
derivative products.

The credit component of VaR represents instruments whose
values are predominantly driven by credit spread levels,
i.e., idiosyncratic default risk. These instruments include,
but are not limited to, single issuer credit default swaps,
and securities with exposures from corporate and
municipal credit spreads.

The diversification component of VaR is the risk reduction
benefit that occurs when combining portfolios and
offsetting positions, and from the correlated behavior of
risk factor movements.

40 BNY

During the third quarter of 2024, interest rate risk
generated 45% of average gross VaR, foreign exchange
risk generated 35% of average gross VaR, credit risk
generated 18% of average gross VaR and equity risk
generated 2% of average gross VaR. During the third
quarter of 2024, our daily trading loss did not exceed our
calculated VaR amount of the overall portfolio.

We reflect external credit ratings as well as observable
credit default swap spreads for both ourselves and our
counterparties when measuring the fair value of our
derivative positions. Accordingly, the valuation of our
derivative positions is sensitive to the current changes in
our own credit spreads, as well as those of our
counterparties.

The following table of total daily trading revenue or loss
illustrates the number of trading days in which our trading
revenue or loss fell within particular ranges during the past
five quarters. Compared with the quarter ended June 30,
2024, the number of trading days when trading revenue
was more than $2.5 million decreased while the number of
trading days when trading revenue ranged between $0 and
$2.5 million increased, primarily due to lower foreign
exchange volumes.

(a)    Trading revenue (loss) includes realized and unrealized gains and losses
primarily related to spot and forward foreign exchange transactions,

derivatives and securities trades for our customers and excludes any
associated commissions, underwriting fees and net interest income.

Trading assets include debt and equity instruments and
derivative assets, primarily foreign exchange and interest
rate contracts, not designated as hedging instruments.
Trading assets were $12.5 billion at Sept. 30, 2024 and
$10.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.

Trading liabilities include debt and equity instruments and
derivative liabilities, primarily foreign exchange and
interest rate contracts, not designated as hedging
instruments. Trading liabilities were $4.6 billion at Sept.
30, 2024 and $6.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.

Under our fair value methodology for derivative contracts,
an initial “risk-neutral” valuation is performed on each
position assuming time discounting based on a AA credit
curve. In addition, we consider credit risk in arriving at the
fair value of our derivatives.

At Sept. 30, 2024, our OTC derivative assets, including
those in hedging relationships, of $1.5 billion included a
credit valuation adjustment (“CVA”) deduction of $13
million. Our OTC derivative liabilities, including those in
hedging relationships, of $2.9 billion included a debit
valuation adjustment (“DVA”) of $4 million related to our
own credit spread. Net of hedges, the CVA decreased by
less than $1 million and the DVA increased by less than $1
million in the third quarter of 2024, which increased
investment and other revenue – other trading revenue by
$1 million. The net impact of the CVA and DVA, net of
hedges, decreased investment and other revenue – other
trading revenue by less than $1 million in the second
quarter of 2024 and increased investment and other
revenue – other trading revenue by less than $1 million in
the third quarter of 2023.

The table below summarizes our exposure, net of collateral
related to our derivative counterparties, as determined on
an internal risk management basis. Significant changes in
counterparty credit ratings could alter the level of credit
risk faced by BNY.

Asset/liability management

Our diversified business activities include processing
securities, accepting deposits, investing in securities,
lending, raising money as needed to fund assets and other
transactions. The market risks from these activities include
interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. Our primary
market risk is exposure to movements in U.S. dollar
interest rates and certain

BNY 41

foreign currency interest rates. We actively manage interest
rate sensitivity and use earnings simulation and discounted
cash flow models to identify interest rate exposures.

An earnings simulation model is the primary tool used to
assess changes in pre-tax net interest income between a
baseline scenario and hypothetical interest rate scenarios.
Interest rate sensitivity is quantified by calculating the
change in pre-tax net interest income between the scenarios
over a 12-month measurement period.

The baseline scenario incorporates the market’s forward
rate expectations and management’s assumptions regarding
client deposit rates, credit spreads, changes in the
prepayment behavior of loans and securities and the impact
of derivative financial instruments used for interest rate
risk management purposes as of each respective quarter-
end. These assumptions have been developed through a
combination of historical analysis and future expected
pricing behavior and are inherently uncertain. Actual
results may differ materially from projected results due to
timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes,
and changes in market conditions and management’s
strategies, among other factors. Client deposit levels and
mix are key assumptions impacting net interest income in
the baseline as well as the hypothetical interest rate
scenarios. The earnings simulation model assumes static
deposit levels and mix, and it also assumes that no
management actions will be taken to mitigate the effects of
interest rate changes. Typically, the baseline scenario uses
the average deposit balances of the quarter.

In the table below, we use the earnings simulation model to
assess the impact of various hypothetical interest rate
scenarios compared to the baseline scenario. In each of the
scenarios, all currencies’ interest rates are instantaneously
shifted higher or lower at the start of the forecast. Long-
term interest rates are defined as all tenors equal to or
greater than three years and short-term interest rates are
defined as all tenors equal to or less than three months.
Interim term points are interpolated where applicable. The
impact of interest rate shifts may not be linear. The results
of this earnings simulation should therefore not be
extrapolated for more severe interest rate scenarios than
those presented in the table below.

The following table shows net interest income sensitivity
for BNY.

At Sept. 30, 2024, the changes in the impacts of a 100
basis points upward or downward shift in rates on net
interest income compared with June 30, 2024 were
primarily driven by an increase in fixed-rate assets and
slightly lower deposit rate sensitivities.

While the net interest income sensitivity scenario
calculations assume static deposit balances to facilitate
consistent period-over-period comparisons, net interest
income is impacted by changes in deposit balances and
interest rate trajectory. Noninterest-bearing deposits are
particularly sensitive to changes in short-term rates.

To illustrate the net interest income sensitivity to
noninterest-bearing deposits, we estimate that a $5 billion
instantaneous reduction/increase in U.S. dollar-
denominated noninterest-bearing deposits would
reduce/increase the net interest income sensitivity results in
the up 100 basis point rate shock scenario in the table
above by approximately $240 million, and in the down 100
basis point rate shock scenario by approximately $140
million. The impact would be smaller if the
reduction/increase was assumed to be a mixture of interest-
bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits.

Additionally, during periods of low short-term interest
rates, money market mutual fund fees and other similar
fees are typically waived to protect investors from negative
returns.

For a discussion of factors impacting the growth or
contraction of deposits, see “Risk Factors – Capital and
Liquidity Risk – Our business, financial condition and
results of operations could be adversely affected if we do
not effectively manage our liquidity” in our 2023 Annual
Report.

Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP
and Non-GAAP financial measures

BNY has included in this Form 10-Q certain Non-GAAP
financial measures on a tangible basis as a supplement to
GAAP information, which exclude goodwill and intangible
assets, net of deferred tax liabilities. We believe that the
return on tangible common equity – Non-GAAP is
additional useful information for investors because it
presents a measure of those assets that can generate
income, and the tangible book value per common share –
Non-GAAP is additional useful information because it
presents the level of tangible assets in relation to shares of
common stock outstanding.

BNY has also included revenue measures excluding
notable items, including the reduction in the fair value of a
contingent consideration receivable related to a prior year
divestiture and a disposal gain. Expense measures,
excluding notable items, including severance expense,
litigation reserves and the FDIC special assessment, are
also presented. Litigation reserves represent accruals for
loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably
estimable, but exclude standard business-related legal fees.
Net income applicable to common shareholders of The
Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, diluted earnings
per share, return on common equity, return on tangible
common equity and pre-tax operating

margin, excluding the notable items mentioned above, are
also provided. These measures are provided to permit
investors to view the financial measures on a basis
consistent with how management views the businesses.

The presentation of the growth rates of investment
management and performance fees on a constant currency
basis permits investors to assess the significance of
changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Growth rates
on a constant currency basis were determined by applying
the current period foreign currency exchange rates to the
prior period revenue. We believe that this presentation, as a
supplement to GAAP information, gives investors a clearer
picture of the related revenue results without the variability
caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

BNY has also included the adjusted pre-tax operating
margin – Non-GAAP, which is the pre-tax operating
margin for the Investment and Wealth Management
business segment, net of distribution and servicing expense
that was passed to third parties who distribute or service
our managed funds. We believe that this measure is useful
when evaluating the performance of the Investment and
Wealth Management business segment relative to industry
competitors.

Recent accounting and regulatory developments

Recent regulatory and other developments

Recent accounting developments

The following accounting guidance issued by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) has not yet been
adopted as of Sept. 30, 2024.

ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280):
Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07,
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to
Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires a public
entity to disclose, on an annual and interim basis,
significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to
the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and
included within each reported measure of segment profit or
loss (collectively referred to as the “significant expense
principle”). In addition, disclosure will be required of the
title and position of CODM, and how the CODM uses the
reported measure of segment profit or loss in assessing
segment performance and deciding how to allocate
resources.

This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after
Dec. 15, 2023 and interim periods beginning in 2025, with
early adoption permitted. BNY is currently evaluating this
guidance and the impact on the business segment
disclosures.

ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to
Income Tax Disclosures

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income
Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax
Disclosures, which requires a company to disclose, on an
annual basis, additional disaggregated information related
to the existing disclosures for the effective income tax rate
reconciliation and income taxes paid.

This ASU is effective on a prospective basis, with a
retrospective option, for annual periods beginning after
Dec. 15, 2024, and interim periods within fiscal years
beginning after Dec. 15, 2025. BNY is currently evaluating
this guidance and the impact on the income tax disclosures.

For a summary of additional regulatory matters relevant to
our operations, see “Recent regulatory developments” in
our Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and
June 30, 2024, and “Supervision and Regulation” in our
2023 Annual Report. The following discussion summarizes
certain regulatory, legislative and other developments that
may affect BNY.

Bank Secrecy Act Extended to Investment Advisers

On Aug. 28, 2024, the Financial Crimes Enforcement
Network (“FinCEN”), a bureau of the U.S. Department of
the Treasury, adopted a final rule requiring certain
investment advisers to establish anti-money
laundering/countering the financing of terrorism
(“AML/CFT”) programs pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act
(“BSA”) and to monitor for, and report, suspicious activity
and currency transactions to FinCEN. Investment advisers
will be required to apply their AML/CFT programs to all
advisory services provided to all customers, except that
they will be permitted to exclude mutual funds, certain
bank- and trust company-sponsored collective investment
funds, and other investment advisers subject to the rule.
Among other requirements, the AML/CFT program must
(i) be risk-based, (ii) be reasonably designed to prevent the
investment adviser from being used for money laundering,
terrorist financing, or other illicit finance activities and to
achieve compliance with applicable provisions of the BSA
and regulations thereunder, (iii) provide for independent
compliance testing, and (iv) designate responsible persons
and ongoing training. Investment advisers must comply
with the Rule by Jan. 1, 2026. BNY is evaluating the final
rule.

EU Artificial Intelligence Act

On July 12, 2024, the EU’s Regulation on Artificial
Intelligence (“AI Act”) was published in the Official
Journal of the EU and came into force on Aug. 1, 2024.
The AI Act will apply extraterritorially, impacting both EU
and non-EU entities, and will impact BNY. The AI Act
creates a pan-EU regulatory framework to manage the risks
associated with the use of artificial intelligence, including
with respect to financial services. Under the AI Act, AI
systems are categorized into four risk levels depending on
their potential to harm individuals or society: unacceptable
risk, high risk, limited risk, and

BNY 47

minimal risk, and imposes obligations depending on the
risk categorization, which may include data governance,
documentation and recordkeeping, human oversight,
testing, cybersecurity, disclosure, regulatory notification or
reporting, or training. In addition, the AI Act prohibits AI
that pose unacceptable risk that are abusive or contradict
EU values, including AI that may be manipulative,
exploitive, or discriminatory. The individual provisions of
the AI Act apply on a rolling basis from Feb. 2, 2025 to
Aug. 2, 2027. BNY has evaluated the impact of the AI Act
and has established an implementation program designed
to operationalize the regulatory requirements applicable to
BNY within required time frames.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1–Basis of presentation

In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, references to
“our,” “we,” “us,” “BNY,” the “Company” and similar
terms refer to The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation
and its consolidated subsidiaries. The term “Parent” refers
to The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation but not to its
subsidiaries.

Basis of presentation

The accounting and financial reporting policies of BNY, a
global financial services company, conform to U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and
prevailing industry practices. For information on our
significant accounting and reporting policies, see Note 1 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31,
2023 (the “2023 Annual Report”).

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are
unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
necessary, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, for a
fair presentation of financial position, results of operations
and cash flows for the periods presented have been made.
These financial statements should be read in conjunction
with our Consolidated Financial Statements included in our
2023 Annual Report.

On Jan. 1, 2024, we adopted Accounting Standards Update
(“ASU”) 2023-02, Investments—Equity Method and Joint
Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax
Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization
Method on a retrospective basis for our investments in
renewable energy projects that have met the eligibility
criteria, and restated prior period financial statements. See
Note 2 for additional information.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates based
upon assumptions about future economic and market
conditions which affect reported amounts and related
disclosures in our

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

financial statements. Although our current estimates
contemplate current conditions and how we expect them to
change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual
conditions could be worse than anticipated in those
estimates, which could materially affect our results of
operations and financial condition.

Note 2–New accounting guidance

The following accounting guidance was adopted on Jan. 1,
2024.

ASU 2023-02, Investments—Equity Method and Joint
Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax
Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization
Method

In March 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued ASU 2023-02, Investments—Equity
Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for
Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the
Proportional Amortization Method, which permits
reporting entities to elect to account for their tax equity
investments, regardless of the tax credit program from
which the income tax credits are received, using the
proportional amortization method if certain conditions are
met. Under the proportional amortization method, an entity
amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to
the income tax credits and other income tax benefits
received, and recognizes the net amortization and income
tax credits and other income tax benefits in the income
statement as a component of the provision for income
taxes.

We adopted this guidance on Jan.1, 2024. The impact of
adopting this new guidance for our renewable energy
investments that met the eligibility criteria was an increase
in investment and other revenue and an increase in the
provision for income taxes on the consolidated income
statement. Renewable energy investments are recorded in
other assets on the balance sheet. In the first quarter of
2024, we restated the prior period financial statements to
reflect the impact of the retrospective application of the
new accounting guidance. The required disclosures are
included in Note 7.

Allowance for credit losses – Securities

The allowance for credit losses related to securities was
less than $1 million at Sept. 30, 2024 and related to other
debt securities. The allowance for credit losses related to
securities was $1 million at Dec. 31, 2023 and related to
non-agency RMBS and other debt securities.

At Sept. 30, 2024, the gross unrealized losses on the
securities portfolio were primarily attributable to an
increase in interest rates from the date of purchase, and for
certain securities that were transferred from available-for-
sale to held-to-maturity, an increase in interest rates
through the date they were transferred. Specifically, $122
million of the unrealized losses at Sept. 30, 2024 and $146
million at Dec. 31, 2023 reflected in the tables below relate
to certain securities that were previously transferred from
available-for-sale to held-to-maturity. As the transfers
created a new cost basis for the securities, if these
securities have experienced unrealized losses since the date
of transfer, the corresponding unrealized losses would be
reflected in the held-to-maturity securities portfolio in the
following tables.

The following tables show the aggregate fair value of available-for-sale securities with a continuous unrealized loss position for
less than 12 months and those that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or more without an
allowance for credit losses.

Pledged assets

Restricted cash and securities

At Sept. 30, 2024, BNY had pledged assets of $146 billion,
including $93 billion pledged as collateral for potential
borrowings at the Federal Reserve Discount Window and
$10 billion pledged as collateral for borrowing at the
Federal Home Loan Bank. The components of the assets
pledged at Sept. 30, 2024 included $125 billion of
securities, $16 billion of loans, $4 billion of trading assets
and $1 billion of interest-bearing deposits with banks.

If there has been no borrowing at the Federal Reserve
Discount Window, the Federal Reserve generally allows
banks to freely move assets in and out of their pledged
assets account to sell or repledge the assets for other
purposes. BNY regularly moves assets in and out of its
pledged assets account at the Federal Reserve as there have
been no borrowings.

At Dec. 31, 2023, BNY had pledged assets of $134 billion,
including $93 billion pledged as collateral for potential
borrowing at the Federal Reserve Discount Window and $9
billion pledged as collateral for borrowing at the Federal
Home Loan Bank. The components of the assets pledged at
Dec. 31, 2023 included $116 billion of securities, $13
billion of loans, $4 billion of trading assets and $1 billion
of interest-bearing deposits with banks.

At Sept. 30, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, pledged assets
included $25 billion and $24 billion, respectively, for
which the recipients were permitted to sell or repledge the
assets delivered.

We also obtain securities as collateral, including receipts
under resale agreements, securities borrowed, derivative
contracts and custody agreements, on terms which permit
us to sell or repledge the securities to others. At Sept. 30,
2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, the market value of the securities
received that can be sold or repledged was $306 billion and
$212 billion, respectively. We routinely sell or repledge
these securities through delivery to third parties. As of
Sept. 30, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, the market value of
securities collateral sold or repledged was $278 billion and
$180 billion, respectively.

Cash and securities may be segregated under federal and
other regulations or requirements. At Sept. 30, 2024 and
Dec. 31, 2023, cash segregated under federal and other
regulations or requirements was $2 billion and $3 billion,
respectively. Restricted cash is primarily included in
interest-bearing deposits with banks on the consolidated
balance sheet. Securities segregated under federal and
other regulations or requirements were $3 billion at Sept.
30, 2024 and $3 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Restricted
securities were sourced from securities purchased under
resale agreements and are included in federal funds sold
and securities purchased under resale agreements on the
consolidated balance sheet.

Loan modifications

Modified loans are evaluated to determine whether a
modification or restructuring with a borrower experiencing
financial difficulty results in principal forgiveness, an
interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment
delay, or a term extension. The modification could result in
a new loan or a continuation of the existing loan.

In the third quarter of 2024, we modified one commercial
real estate exposure, with a recorded investment of $42
million, by extending the maturity date. We also modified
one residential mortgage loan, with a recorded investment
of less than $1 million, by providing payment
modifications.

66 BNY

At Sept. 30, 2024, other residential mortgage loans that
were modified in the previous 12 months and that are now
past due by more than 90 days totaled $1 million.

In the second quarter of 2024, we modified one
commercial real estate exposure, with a recorded
investment of $59 million and an unfunded lending
commitment of $1 million, by extending the maturity
dates.

In the third quarter of 2023, we modified one residential
mortgage loan, with a recorded investment of less than $1
million, by providing payment modifications.

Credit quality indicators

Our credit strategy is to focus on investment-grade clients that are active users of our non-credit services. Each customer is
assigned an internal credit rating, which is mapped to an external rating agency grade equivalent, if possible, based upon a
number of dimensions, which are continually evaluated and may change over time. The tables below provide information about
the credit profile of the loan portfolio by the period of origination.

(b)    The gross write-offs related to other residential mortgage loans were $3 million in 2023.

Commercial loans

Financial institutions

The commercial loan portfolio is divided into investment
grade and non-investment grade categories based on the
assigned internal credit ratings, which are generally
consistent with those of the public rating agencies.
Customers with ratings consistent with BBB- (S&P)/Baa3
(Moody’s) or better are considered to be investment grade.
Those clients with ratings lower than this threshold are
considered to be non-investment grade.

Commercial real estate

Our income-producing commercial real estate facilities are
focused on experienced owners and are structured with
moderate leverage based on existing cash flows. Our
commercial real estate lending activities also include
construction and renovation facilities.

Financial institution exposures are high quality, with 96%
of the exposures meeting the investment grade equivalent
criteria of our internal credit rating classification at Sept.
30, 2024. In addition, 65% of the financial institutions
exposure is secured. For example, securities industry
clients and asset managers often borrow against marketable
securities held in custody. The exposure to financial
institutions is generally short term, with 85% expiring
within one year.

Wealth management loans

Wealth management loans are not typically rated by
external rating agencies. A majority of the wealth
management loans are secured by the customers’
investment management accounts or custody accounts.
Eligible assets pledged for these loans are typically
investment grade fixed-income securities, equities and/or
mutual funds. Internal ratings for this portion of the wealth
management loan portfolio, therefore, would equate to
investment grade external

68 BNY

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

ratings. Wealth management loans are provided to select
customers based on the pledge of other types of assets. For
the loans collateralized by other assets, the credit quality of
the obligor is carefully analyzed, but we do not consider
this portion of our wealth management loan portfolio to be
investment grade.

Wealth management mortgages

Credit quality indicators for wealth management mortgages
are not correlated to external ratings. Wealth management
mortgages are typically loans to high-net-worth
individuals, which are secured primarily by residential
property. These loans are primarily interest-only,
adjustable-rate mortgages with a weighted-average loan-to-
value ratio of 61% at origination. The delinquency rate is a
key indicator of credit quality in our wealth management
portfolio. At Sept. 30, 2024, less than 1% of the mortgages
were past due.

At Sept. 30, 2024, the wealth management mortgage
portfolio consisted of the following geographic
concentrations: California – 21%; New York – 14%;
Florida – 11%; Massachusetts – 8%; and other – 46%.

totaled $1.1 billion at Sept. 30, 2024 and $1.2 billion at
Dec. 31, 2023. These loans are not typically correlated to
external ratings.

Capital call financing

Capital call financing includes loans to private equity funds
that are secured by the fund investors’ capital commitments
and the funds’ right to call capital.

Other loans

Other loans primarily include loans to consumers that are
fully collateralized with equities, mutual funds and fixed-
income securities.

Margin loans

We had $18.5 billion of secured margin loans at Sept. 30,
2024, compared with $18.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.
Margin loans are collateralized with marketable securities,
and borrowers are required to maintain a daily collateral
margin in excess of 100% of the value of the loan. We have
rarely suffered a loss on these types of loans.

Lease financings

Overdrafts

At Sept. 30, 2024, nearly all of the leasing exposure was
investment grade, or investment grade equivalent, and
consisted of exposures backed by well-diversified assets.
The largest components of our lease residual value
exposure relate to real estate and large-ticket transportation
equipment. Assets are both domestic and foreign-based,
with primary concentrations in Germany and the U.S.

Other residential mortgages

The other residential mortgages portfolio primarily consists
of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and

Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities
clearance clients and totaled $2.5 billion at Sept. 30, 2024
and $3.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Overdrafts occur on a
daily basis and are generally repaid within two business
days.

Reverse repurchase agreements

Reverse repurchase agreements at Sept. 30, 2024 and Dec.
31, 2023 were fully secured with high-quality collateral. As
a result, there was no allowance for credit losses related to
these assets at Sept. 30, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023.

Tax credit investments

Tax credit investments include affordable housing projects
and renewable energy investments. We invest in affordable
housing projects primarily to satisfy the Company’s
requirements under the Community Reinvestment Act. On
Jan. 1, 2024, we adopted ASU 2023-02, Investments—
Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting
for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the
Proportional Amortization Method for our renewable
energy projects that met the eligibility criteria. See Note 2
for additional information.

Our tax credit investments totaled $2.1 billion at Sept. 30,
2024 and $2.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Commitments to
fund future investments totaled $811 million at Sept. 30,
2024 and $780 million at Dec. 31, 2023 and are recorded
in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. A
summary of the commitments to fund future investments is
as follows: remainder of 2024 – $198 million; 2025 – $258
million; 2026 – $113 million; 2027 – $61 million; 2028 –
$66 million; and 2029 and thereafter – $115 million.

Tax credits and other tax benefits recognized were $114
million in the third quarter of 2024, $115 million in the
second quarter of 2024, $92 million in the third quarter of
2023, $342 million in the first nine months of 2024 and
$276 million in the first nine months of 2023.

Amortization expense included in the provision for income
taxes was $92 million in the third quarter of 2024, $92
million in the second quarter of 2024, $73 million in the
third quarter of 2023, $276 million in the first nine months

Non-readily marketable equity securities

Non-readily marketable equity securities do not have
readily determinable fair values. These investments are
valued using a measurement alternative where the
investments are carried at cost, less any impairment, and
plus or minus changes resulting from observable price
changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar
investment of the same issuer. The observable price
changes are recorded in investment and other revenue on
the consolidated income statement. Our non-readily
marketable equity securities totaled $410 million at Sept.
30, 2024 and $479 million at Dec. 31, 2023, and are
included in other equity investments in the table above.

Investments valued using net asset value (“NAV”) per
share

In our Investment and Wealth Management business
segment, we make seed capital investments in certain
funds we manage. We also hold private equity investments,
primarily small business investment companies (“SBICs”),
which are compliant with the

Volcker Rule, and certain other corporate investments.
Seed capital, private equity and other corporate
investments are included in other assets on the
consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of certain of
these investments was estimated using the NAV per share
for our ownership interest in the funds.

which have redemption notice periods of up to seven days, are liquidated.

(b)    Includes investments in funds that relate to deferred compensation arrangements with employees.
(c)    Private equity investments primarily include Volcker Rule-compliant investments in SBICs that invest in various sectors of the economy. Private equity
investments do not have redemption rights. Distributions from such investments will be received as the underlying investments in the private equity
investments, which have a life of 10 years, are liquidated.

Note 8–Contract revenue

Fee and other revenue in the Securities Services, Market
and Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth
Management business segments is primarily variable,
based on levels of assets under custody and/or
administration, assets under management and the level of
client-driven transactions, as specified in the fee schedules.
See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in our 2023 Annual Report for information on
the nature of our services and revenue recognition. See
Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
in our 2023 Annual Report for additional information on
our principal business segments — Securities Services,

Market and Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth
Management — and the primary services provided.

Disaggregation of contract revenue

Contract revenue is included in fee and other revenue on
the consolidated income statement. The following tables
present fee and other revenue related to contracts with
customers, disaggregated by type of fee revenue, for each
business segment. Business segment data has been
determined on an internal management basis of accounting,
rather than GAAP, which is used for consolidated financial
reporting.

(d)    Fee and other revenue – not in scope of ASC 606 for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2023 for the Other segment was restated to reflect the retrospective application of

adopting new accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2024 related to our investments in renewable energy projects using the proportional amortization method (ASU

2023-02). See Note 2 for additional information.

Contract balances

Our clients are billed based on fee schedules that are
agreed upon in each customer contract. Receivables from
customers were $2.6 billion at Sept. 30, 2024 and Dec. 31,
2023.

Contract assets represent accrued revenues that have not
yet been billed to customers due to certain contractual
terms other than the passage of time and were $45 million
at Sept. 30, 2024 and $27 million at Dec. 31, 2023.
Accrued revenues recorded as contract assets are usually
billed on an annual basis.

Both receivables from customers and contract assets are
included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.

Contract liabilities represent payments received in advance
of providing services under certain contracts and were
$216 million at Sept. 30, 2024 and $172 million at Dec. 31,
2023. Contract liabilities are included in other liabilities on
the consolidated balance sheet. Revenue recognized in the
first nine months of 2024 relating to contract liabilities as
of Dec. 31, 2023 was $106 million. Revenue recognized in
the third quarter of 2024 relating to contract liabilities as of
June 30, 2024 was $79 million.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

$100 million at Sept. 30, 2024 and $90 million at Dec. 31,
2023. These capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-
line basis over the expected contract period.

Unsatisfied performance obligations

We do not have any unsatisfied performance obligations
other than those that are subject to a

Note 9–Net interest income

Changes in contract assets and liabilities primarily relate to
either party’s performance under the contracts.

Contract costs

Incremental costs for obtaining contracts that are deemed
recoverable are capitalized as contract costs. Such costs
result from the payment of sales incentives, primarily in
the Wealth Management business, and totaled $47 million
at Sept. 30, 2024 and $46 million at Dec. 31, 2023.
Capitalized sales incentives are amortized based on the
transfer of goods or services to which the assets relate. The
amortization of capitalized sales incentives, which is
included in staff expense on the consolidated income
statement, totaled $4 million in the third quarter of 2024,
third quarter of 2023 and second quarter of 2024, $11
million in the first nine months of 2024 and $12 million in
the first nine months of 2023.

Costs to fulfill a contract are capitalized when they relate
directly to an existing contract or a specific anticipated
contract, generate or enhance resources that will be used to
fulfill performance obligations, and are recoverable. Such
costs generally represent set-up costs, which include any
direct cost incurred at the inception of a contract which
enables the fulfillment of the performance obligation, and

applies to (i) contracts with an original expected length of
one year or less, and (ii) contracts for which we recognize
revenue at the amount to which we have the right to
invoice for services performed.

Note 11–Income taxes

BNY recorded an income tax provision of $336 million
(22.0% effective tax rate) in the third quarter of 2024, $285
million (21.5% effective tax rate) in the third quarter of
2023 and $357 million (23.4% effective tax rate) in the
second quarter of 2024.

In accordance with ASU 2023-02, Investments—Equity
Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for
Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the
Proportional Amortization Method, we elected to account
for investments in renewable energy projects that met the
eligibility requirement using the proportional amortization
method on a retrospective basis. Prior to 2024, we used the
hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”)
methodology to determine the pre-tax loss that is
recognized in each period. This change resulted in an
increase in investment and other revenue and an increase in
the provision for income taxes on the consolidated income
statement beginning in the first quarter of 2024. For
additional information, see Note 2 and Note 7.

Our total tax reserves were $109 million at Sept. 30, 2024
and Dec. 31, 2023. If these tax reserves were unnecessary,
$109 million would affect the effective tax rate in future
periods. We recognize accrued interest and penalties, if
applicable, related to income taxes in income tax expense.
Included in the balance sheet at Sept. 30, 2024 is accrued
interest, where applicable, of $39 million. There was no tax
expense related to interest for the nine months ended Sept.
30, 2024, compared with $3 million for the nine months
ended Sept. 30, 2023.

It is reasonably possible the total reserve for uncertain tax
positions could decrease within the next 12 months by
approximately $19 million as a result of adjustments
related to tax years that are still subject to examination.

Our federal income tax returns are closed to examination
through 2016. Our New York State and New York City
income tax returns are closed to examination through 2014.
Our UK income tax returns are closed to examination
through 2020.

Note 12–Variable interest entities

We have variable interests in variable interest entities
(“VIEs”), which include investments in retail, institutional
and alternative investment funds.

We earn management fees from these funds, as well as
performance fees in certain funds, and may also provide
start-up capital for new funds. The funds are primarily
financed by our customers’ investments in the funds’ equity
or debt.

Additionally, we invest in qualified affordable housing and
renewable energy projects, which are designed to generate
a return primarily through the realization of tax credits.
The projects, which are structured as limited partnerships
and limited liability companies, are also VIEs, but are not
consolidated.

The following table presents the incremental assets and
liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet as of
Sept. 30, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023. The net assets of any
consolidated VIE are solely available to settle the liabilities
of the VIE and to settle any investors’ ownership
liquidation requests, including any seed capital we invested
in the VIE.

Note 15–Fair value measurement

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to
sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. A three-level hierarchy for fair value
measurements is utilized based upon the transparency of
inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the
measurement date. BNY’s own creditworthiness is
considered when valuing liabilities. See Note 20 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023
Annual Report for

information on how we determine fair value and the fair
value hierarchy.

The following tables present the financial instruments
carried at fair value at Sept. 30, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023,
by caption on the consolidated balance sheet and by the
three-level valuation hierarchy. We have included credit
ratings information in certain of the tables because the
information indicates the degree of credit risk to which we
are exposed, and significant changes in ratings
classifications could result in increased risk for us.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis

Under certain circumstances, we make adjustments to the fair value of our assets, liabilities and unfunded lending-related
commitments, although they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis. The following table presents the carrying value
as of Sept. 30, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023 of financial instruments for which nonrecurring adjustments to fair value have been
recorded during 2024 and/or 2023 and all non-readily marketable equity securities carried at cost with upward or downward
adjustments by balance sheet caption and level in the fair value hierarchy.

Note 16–Fair value option

Note 17–Derivative instruments

We elected fair value as an alternative measurement for
selected financial assets and liabilities that are not
otherwise required to be measured at fair value, including
the assets and liabilities of consolidated investment
management funds and subordinated notes associated with
certain equity investments.

We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk,
including interest rate risk, equity price risk and foreign
currency risk, as well as credit risk. Our trading activities
are focused on acting as a market-maker for our customers
and facilitating customer trades in compliance with the
Volcker Rule.

The following table presents the assets and liabilities of
consolidated investment management funds, at fair value.

The assets and liabilities of the consolidated investment
management funds are included in other assets and other
liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet.
We value the assets and liabilities of consolidated
investment management funds using quoted prices for
identical assets or liabilities in active markets or observable
inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities.
Quoted prices for either identical or similar assets or
liabilities in inactive markets may also be used.
Accordingly, fair value best reflects the interests BNY
holds in the economic performance of the consolidated
investment management funds. Changes in the fair value of
the assets and liabilities are recorded as income (loss) from
consolidated investment management funds, which is
included in investment and other revenue on the
consolidated income statement.

We elected the fair value option on subordinated notes
associated with certain equity investments. The fair value
of these subordinated notes was $17 million at Sept. 30,
2024 and $4 million at Dec. 31, 2023. The subordinated
notes were valued using observable market inputs and
included in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

86 BNY

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

The notional amounts for derivative financial instruments
express the dollar volume of the transactions; however,
credit risk is much smaller. We perform credit reviews and
enter into netting agreements and collateral arrangements
to minimize the credit risk of derivative financial
instruments. We enter into offsetting positions to reduce
exposure to foreign currency, interest rate and equity price
risk.

Use of derivative financial instruments involves reliance
on counterparties. Failure of a counterparty to honor its
obligation under a derivative contract is a risk we assume
whenever we engage in a derivative contract. There were
no counterparty default losses recorded in the third quarter
of 2024.

Hedging derivatives

We utilize interest rate swap agreements, including forward
starting swaps, to manage our exposure to interest rate
fluctuations. We enter into fair value hedges as an interest
rate risk management strategy to reduce fair value
variability by converting certain fixed rate interest
payments associated with available-for-sale securities,
loans and long-term debt to floating interest rates. We also
utilize interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts
as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to interest rate
and foreign exchange rate changes. In designating interest
rate swaps as hedges, we utilize both partial-term and full-
term hedge strategies.

The available-for-sale securities hedged consist of U.S.
Treasury, agency and non-agency commercial MBS, non-
U.S. government and foreign covered bonds. At Sept. 30,
2024, $40.0 billion par value of available-for-sale
securities was hedged with interest rate swaps designated
as fair value hedges that had notional values of $40.0
billion.

At Sept. 30, 2024, $1.4 billion of interest rate swaps was
designated as portfolio layer method fair value hedges of
loans against a closed portfolio of fixed rate

loans of $3.2 billion, essentially converting $1.4 billion of
such fixed rate loans to a floating rate.

The fixed rate long-term debt instruments hedged generally
have original maturities of five to 30 years. In fair value
hedging relationships, fixed rate debt is hedged with
“receive fixed rate, pay variable rate” swaps. At Sept. 30,
2024, $28.9 billion par value of debt was hedged with
interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges that had
notional values of $28.9 billion.

In addition, we utilize forward foreign exchange contracts
as hedges to mitigate foreign exchange exposures. We use
forward foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges to
convert certain forecasted non-U.S. dollar revenue and
expenses into U.S. dollars. We use forward foreign
exchange contracts with maturities of 15 months or less as
cash flow hedges to hedge our foreign exchange exposure
to currencies such as the Indian rupee, Polish zloty, Hong
Kong dollar, Singapore dollar, British pound and euro used
in revenue and expense transactions for entities that have
the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. As of Sept. 30,
2024, the hedged forecasted foreign currency transactions
and designated forward foreign exchange contract hedges
were $766 million (notional), with a net pre-tax loss of $1
million recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income (“OCI”). Over the next 12 months, a gain of less
than $1 million will be reclassified into earnings.

From time to time, we have utilized forward foreign
exchange contracts as fair value hedges of the foreign
exchange risk associated with available-for-sale securities.
Forward points are designated as an excluded component
and amortized into earnings over the hedge period. At Sept.
30, 2024, there were no remaining foreign exchange
contracts.

Forward foreign exchange contracts are also used to hedge
the value of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
These forward foreign exchange contracts have maturities
of less than one year. The derivatives employed are
designated as hedges of changes in the value of our foreign
investments due to exchange rates. The change in fair
market value of these forward foreign exchange contracts
is reported within foreign currency translation adjustments
in shareholders’ equity, net of tax. At Sept. 30, 2024,
forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts
totaling $12.0 billion were designated as net investment
hedges.

From time to time, we also designate non-derivative
financial instruments as hedges of our net investments in
foreign subsidiaries. At Sept. 30, 2024, there were no non-
derivative financial instruments hedging our net
investments in foreign subsidiaries.

Trading activities (including trading derivatives)

Our trading activities are focused on acting as a market-
maker for our customers, facilitating customer trades and
risk-mitigating economic hedging in compliance with the
Volcker Rule. The change in the fair value of the
derivatives utilized in our trading activities is recorded in
foreign exchange revenue and investment and other
revenue on the consolidated income statement.

The following table presents our foreign exchange revenue
and other trading revenue.

Foreign exchange revenue includes income from
purchasing and selling foreign currencies, currency
forwards, futures and options as well as foreign currency
remeasurement. Other trading revenue reflects results from
trading in cash instruments, including fixed income and
equity securities, and trading and economic hedging
activity with non-foreign exchange derivatives.

We also use derivative financial instruments as risk-
mitigating economic hedges, which are not formally
designated as accounting hedges. This includes hedging the
foreign currency, interest rate or market risks inherent in
some of our balance sheet exposures, such as seed capital
investments and deposits, as well as certain investment
management fee revenue streams. We also use total return
swaps to economically hedge obligations arising from the
Company’s deferred compensation plan whereby the
participants defer compensation and earn a return linked to
the performance of investments they select. The gains or
losses on these total return swaps are recorded in staff
expense on the consolidated income statement. We
recorded a gain of $11 million in the third quarter of 2024,
a loss of $11 million in the third quarter of 2023 and gains
of $22 million in the first nine months of 2024 and $4
million in the first nine months of 2023. There was no
impact in the second quarter of 2024.

We manage trading risk through a system of position
limits, a value-at-risk (“VaR”) methodology based on

historical simulation and other market sensitivity measures.
Risk is monitored and reported to senior management by a
separate unit, independent from trading, on a daily basis.
Based on certain assumptions, the VaR methodology is
designed to capture the potential overnight pre-tax dollar
loss from adverse changes in fair values of all trading
positions. The calculation assumes a one-day holding
period, utilizes a 99% confidence level and incorporates
non-linear product characteristics. The VaR model is one of
several statistical models used to develop economic capital
results, which are allocated to lines of business for
computing risk-adjusted performance.

VaR methodology does not evaluate risk attributable to
extraordinary financial, economic or other occurrences. As
a result, the risk assessment process includes a number of
stress scenarios based upon the risk factors in the portfolio
and management’s assessment of market conditions.
Additional stress scenarios based upon historical market
events are also performed. Stress tests may incorporate the
impact of reduced market liquidity and the breakdown of
historically observed correlations and extreme scenarios.
VaR and other statistical measures, stress testing and
sensitivity analysis are incorporated into other risk
management materials.

Counterparty credit risk and collateral

We assess the credit risk of our counterparties through
regular examination of their financial statements,
confidential communication with the management of those
counterparties and regular monitoring of publicly available
credit rating information. This and other information are
used to develop proprietary credit rating metrics used to
assess credit quality.

Collateral requirements are determined after a
comprehensive review of the credit quality of each
counterparty. Collateral is generally held or pledged in the
form of cash and/or highly liquid government securities.
Collateral requirements are monitored and adjusted daily.

Additional disclosures concerning derivative financial
instruments are provided in Note 15.

Disclosure of contingent features in over-the-counter
(“OTC”) derivative instruments

Certain OTC derivative contracts and/or collateral
agreements contain credit risk-contingent features
triggered upon a rating downgrade in which the
counterparty has the right to request additional collateral or
the right to terminate the contracts in a net liability
position.

The following table shows the aggregate fair value of OTC
derivative contracts in net liability positions that contained
credit risk-contingent features and the value of collateral
that has been posted.

The Bank of New York Mellon, our largest banking
subsidiary, enters into the substantial majority of our OTC
derivative contracts and/or collateral agreements. As such,
the contingent features may be triggered if The Bank of
New York Mellon’s long-term issuer rating were
downgraded.

The following table shows the fair value of contracts
falling under early termination provisions that were in net
liability positions for three key ratings triggers.

BNY’s repurchase agreements and securities lending
transactions primarily encounter risk associated with
liquidity. We are required to pledge collateral based on
predetermined terms within the agreements. If we were to
experience a decline in the fair value of the collateral
pledged for these transactions, we could be required to
provide additional collateral to the

counterparty, therefore decreasing the amount of assets
available for other liquidity needs that may arise. BNY also
offers tri-party collateral agency services in the tri-party
repo market where we are exposed to credit risk. In order
to mitigate this risk, we require dealers to fully secure
intraday credit.

Note 18–Commitments and contingent liabilities

Off-balance sheet arrangements

In the normal course of business, various commitments and
contingent liabilities are outstanding that are not reflected
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Our significant trading and off-balance sheet risks are
securities, foreign currency and interest rate risk
management products, commercial lending commitments,
letters of credit and securities lending indemnifications. We
assume these risks to reduce interest rate and foreign
currency risks, to provide customers with the ability to
meet credit and liquidity needs and to hedge foreign
currency and interest rate risks. These items involve, to
varying degrees, credit, foreign currency and interest rate
risks not recognized on the balance sheet. Our off-balance
sheet risks are managed and monitored in manners similar
to those used for on-balance sheet risks.

The following table presents a summary of our off-balance
sheet credit risks.

an agent on behalf of CIBC Mellon clients, which totaled $67
billion at Sept. 30, 2024 and $59 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.
Includes cash collateral, invested in indemnified repurchase
agreements, held by us as securities lending agent of $58 billion at
Sept. 30, 2024 and $45 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.

(c)

The total potential loss on undrawn lending commitments,
standby and commercial letters of credit and securities
lending indemnifications is equal to the total notional
amount if drawn upon, which does not consider the value
of any collateral.

Since many of the lending commitments are expected to
expire without being drawn upon, the total amount does
not necessarily represent future cash requirements. A
summary of lending commitment

maturities is as follows: $32.0 billion in less than one year,
$18.7 billion in one to five years and $352 million over
five years.

SBLCs principally support obligations of corporate clients
and were collateralized with cash and securities of $180
million at Sept. 30, 2024 and $158 million at Dec. 31,
2023. At Sept. 30, 2024, $1.3 billion of the SBLCs will
expire within one year and $357 million in one to five
years. No SBLCs expire in over five years.

We must recognize, at the inception of an SBLC and
foreign and other guarantees, a liability for the fair value of
the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The fair
value of the liability, which was recorded with a
corresponding asset in other assets, was estimated as the
present value of contractual customer fees. The estimated
liability for losses related to SBLCs and foreign and other
guarantees, if any, is included in the allowance for lending-
related commitments.

Payment/performance risk of SBLCs is monitored using
both historical performance and internal ratings criteria.
BNY’s historical experience is that SBLCs typically expire
without being funded. SBLCs below investment grade are
monitored closely for payment/performance risk. The table
below shows SBLCs by investment grade:

Standby letters of credit

A commercial letter of credit is normally a short-term
instrument used to finance a commercial contract for the
shipment of goods from a seller to a buyer. Although the
commercial letter of credit is contingent upon the
satisfaction of specified conditions, it represents a credit
exposure if the buyer defaults on the underlying
transaction. As a result, the total contractual amounts do
not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
Commercial letters of credit totaled $25 million at Sept.
30, 2024 and $41 million at Dec. 31, 2023.

We expect many of the lending commitments and letters of
credit to expire without the need to advance any cash. The
revenue associated with guarantees frequently depends on
the credit rating of the obligor and the structure of the
transaction, including

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

collateral, if any. The allowance for lending-related
commitments was $75 million at Sept. 30, 2024 and $87
million at Dec. 31, 2023.

A securities lending transaction is a fully collateralized
transaction in which the owner of a security agrees to lend
the security (typically through an agent, in our case, The
Bank of New York Mellon) to a borrower, usually a broker-
dealer or bank, on an open, overnight or term basis, under
the terms of a prearranged contract.

We typically lend securities with indemnification against
borrower default. We generally require the borrower to
provide collateral with a minimum value of 102% of the
fair value of the securities borrowed, which is monitored
on a daily basis, thus reducing credit risk. Market risk can
also arise in securities lending transactions. These risks are
controlled through policies limiting the level of risk that
can be undertaken. Securities lending transactions are
generally entered into only with highly rated
counterparties. Securities lending indemnifications were
secured by collateral of $568 billion at Sept. 30, 2024 and
$518 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.

CIBC Mellon, a joint venture between BNY and the
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (“CIBC”), engages
in securities lending activities.  CIBC Mellon, BNY and
CIBC jointly and severally indemnify securities lenders
against specific types of borrower default. At Sept. 30,
2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, $67 billion and $59 billion,
respectively, of borrowings at CIBC Mellon, for which
BNY acts as agent on behalf of CIBC Mellon clients, were
secured by collateral of $71 billion and $62 billion,
respectively. If, upon a default, a borrower’s collateral was
not sufficient to cover its related obligations, certain losses
related to the indemnification could be covered by the
indemnitors.

Unsettled repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements

In the normal course of business, we enter into repurchase
agreements and reverse repurchase agreements that settle
at a future date. In repurchase agreements, BNY receives
cash from and provides securities as collateral to a
counterparty at settlement. In reverse repurchase
agreements, BNY advances cash to and receives securities
as collateral from the counterparty at settlement. These
transactions are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet
on the

94 BNY

settlement date. At Sept. 30, 2024, we had no unsettled
repurchase agreements and $103.5 billion of unsettled
reverse repurchase agreements. At Dec. 31, 2023, we had
no unsettled repurchase agreements and $77.9 billion of
unsettled reverse repurchase agreements.

Industry concentrations

We have significant industry concentrations related to
credit exposure at Sept. 30, 2024. The tables below present

Sponsored member repo program

BNY is a sponsoring member in the FICC sponsored
member program, where we submit eligible repurchase and
reverse repurchase transactions in U.S. Treasury and
agency securities (“Sponsored Member Transactions”)
between BNY and our sponsored member clients for
novation and clearing through FICC pursuant to the FICC
Government Securities Division rulebook (the “FICC
Rules”). We also guarantee to FICC the prompt and full
payment and performance of our sponsored member
clients’ respective obligations under the FICC Rules in
connection with such clients’ Sponsored Member
Transactions. We minimize our credit exposure

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

under this guaranty by obtaining a security interest in our
sponsored member clients’ collateral and rights under
Sponsored Member Transactions. See “Offsetting assets
and liabilities” in Note 17 for additional information on our
repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements.

Indemnification arrangements

We have provided standard representations for
underwriting agreements, acquisition and divestiture
agreements, sales of loans and commitments, and other
similar types of arrangements and customary
indemnification for claims and legal proceedings related to
providing financial services that are not otherwise included
above. Insurance has been purchased to mitigate certain of
these risks. Generally, there are no stated or notional
amounts included in these indemnifications, and the
contingencies triggering the obligation for indemnification
are not expected to occur. Furthermore, often
counterparties to these transactions provide us with
comparable indemnifications. We are unable to develop an
estimate of the maximum payout under these
indemnifications for several reasons. In addition to the lack
of a stated or notional amount in a majority of such
indemnifications, we are unable to predict the nature of
events that would trigger indemnification or the level of
indemnification for a certain event. We believe, however,
that the possibility that we will have to make any material
payments for these indemnifications is remote. At Sept. 30,
2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, we have not recorded any
material liabilities under these arrangements.

Clearing and settlement exchanges

We are a noncontrolling equity investor in, and/or member
of, several industry clearing or settlement exchanges
through which foreign exchange, securities, derivatives or
other transactions settle. Certain of these industry clearing
and settlement exchanges require their members to
guarantee their obligations and liabilities and/or to provide
liquidity support in the event other members do not honor
their obligations. We believe the likelihood that a clearing
or settlement exchange (of which we are a member) would
become insolvent is remote. Additionally, certain
settlement exchanges have implemented loss allocation
policies that enable the exchange to allocate settlement
losses to the members of the exchange. It is not possible to
quantify such mark-to-

market loss until the loss occurs. Any ancillary costs that
occur as a result of any mark-to-market loss cannot be
quantified. In addition, we also sponsor clients as members
on clearing and settlement exchanges and guarantee their
obligations. At Sept. 30, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, we did
not record any material liabilities under these
arrangements.

Legal proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, The Bank of New York
Mellon Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely
named as defendants in or made parties to pending and
potential legal actions. We also are subject to governmental
and regulatory examinations, information-gathering
requests, investigations and proceedings (both formal and
informal). Claims for significant monetary damages are
often asserted in many of these legal actions, while claims
for disgorgement, restitution, penalties and/or other
remedial actions or sanctions may be sought in
governmental and regulatory matters. It is inherently
difficult to predict the eventual outcomes of such matters
given their complexity and the particular facts and
circumstances at issue in each of these matters. However,
on the basis of our current knowledge and understanding,
we do not believe that judgments, settlements or orders, if
any, arising from these matters (either individually or in the
aggregate, after giving effect to applicable reserves and
insurance coverage) will have a material adverse effect on
the consolidated financial position or liquidity of BNY,
although they could have a material effect on our results of
operations in a given period.

In view of the inherent unpredictability of outcomes in
litigation and regulatory matters, particularly where (i) the
damages sought are substantial or indeterminate, (ii) the
proceedings are in the early stages, or (iii) the matters
involve novel legal theories or a large number of parties, as
a matter of course there is considerable uncertainty
surrounding the timing or ultimate resolution of litigation
and regulatory matters, including a possible eventual loss,
fine, penalty or business impact, if any, associated with
each such matter. In accordance with applicable accounting
guidance, we establish accruals for litigation and
regulatory matters when those matters proceed to a stage
where they present loss contingencies that are both
probable and reasonably estimable. In such cases, there
may be a possible exposure to loss in excess of any
amounts accrued. We regularly monitor such matters for
developments

BNY 95

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

that could affect the amount of the accrual, and will adjust
the accrual amount as appropriate. If the loss contingency
in question is not both probable and reasonably estimable,
we do not establish an accrual and the matter continues to
be monitored for any developments that would make the
loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable.
We believe that our accruals for legal proceedings are
appropriate and, in the aggregate, are not material to the
consolidated financial position of BNY, although future
accruals could have a material effect on the results of
operations in a given period. In addition, if we have the
potential to recover a portion of an estimated loss from a
third party, we record a receivable up to the amount of the
accrual that is probable of recovery.

For certain of those matters described here for which a loss
contingency may, in the future, be reasonably possible
(whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where
there is no accrued liability), BNY is currently unable to
estimate a range of reasonably possible loss. For those
matters described here where BNY is able to estimate a
reasonably possible loss, the aggregate range of such
reasonably possible loss is up to $620 million in excess of
the accrued liability (if any) related to those matters. For
matters where a reasonably possible loss is denominated in
a foreign currency, our estimate is adjusted quarterly based
on prevailing exchange rates. We do not consider potential
recoveries when estimating reasonably possible losses.

The following describes certain judicial, regulatory and
arbitration proceedings involving BNY:

Mortgage-Securitization Trusts Proceedings
BNY has been named as a defendant in a number of legal
actions brought by MBS investors alleging that the trustee
has expansive duties under the governing agreements,
including the duty to investigate and pursue breach of
representation and warranty claims against other parties to
the MBS transactions. Two actions commenced in
December 2015 and February 2017 are pending in New
York federal court. In New York state court, five actions
are pending: two related cases commenced in September
2021 and October 2022; and three related cases
commenced in October 2021, December 2021 and
February 2022.

Matters Related to R. Allen Stanford
In late December 2005, Pershing LLC (“Pershing”)
became a clearing firm for Stanford Group Co.

96 BNY

(“SGC”), a registered broker-dealer that was part of a
group of entities ultimately controlled by R. Allen Stanford
(“Stanford”). Stanford International Bank, also controlled
by Stanford, issued certificates of deposit (“CDs”). Some
investors allegedly wired funds from their SGC accounts to
purchase CDs. In 2009, the Securities and Exchange
Commission charged Stanford with operating a Ponzi
scheme in connection with the sale of CDs, and SGC was
placed into receivership. Alleged purchasers of CDs have
filed two putative class action proceedings against
Pershing: one in November 2009 in Texas federal court,
and one in May 2016 in New Jersey federal court. On Nov.
5, 2021, the court dismissed the class action filed in New
Jersey. Both matters have concluded. Three lawsuits
remain against Pershing in Louisiana and New Jersey
federal courts, which were filed in January 2010, October
2015 and May 2016. The purchasers allege that Pershing,
as SGC’s clearing firm, assisted Stanford in a fraudulent
scheme and assert contractual, statutory and common law
claims. In March 2019, a group of investors filed a putative
class action against The Bank of New York Mellon in New
Jersey federal court, making the same allegations as in the
prior actions brought against Pershing. On Nov. 12, 2021,
the court dismissed the class action against The Bank of
New York Mellon; on Dec. 15, 2022, an appeals court
reversed the dismissal and returned the case to the trial
court for further proceedings. On June 28, 2024, an
unincorporated association that claims to represent the
interests of Stanford investors filed a lawsuit in New Jersey
federal court against The Bank of New York Mellon,
making the same allegations as prior cases. All of the cases
that have been brought in federal court have been
consolidated in Texas federal court for discovery purposes.
Various alleged Stanford CD purchasers asserted similar
claims in Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.
(“FINRA”) arbitration proceedings.

Brazilian Postalis Litigation
BNY Servicos Financeiros DTVM S.A. (“DTVM”), a
subsidiary that provides asset services in Brazil, acts as
administrator for certain investment funds in which a
public pension fund for postal workers called Postalis-
Instituto de Seguridade Social dos Correios e Telégrafos
(“Postalis”) invested. On Aug. 22, 2014, Postalis sued
DTVM in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for losses related to a
Postalis fund for which DTVM is administrator. Postalis
alleges that DTVM failed to properly perform duties,
including to conduct due diligence of and exert control
over the manager. On

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

March 12, 2015, Postalis filed a lawsuit in Rio de Janeiro
against DTVM and BNY Administração de Ativos Ltda.
(“Ativos”) alleging failure to properly perform duties
relating to another fund of which DTVM is administrator
and Ativos is manager. On Dec. 14, 2015, Associacão dos
Profissionais dos Correios (“ADCAP”), a Brazilian postal
workers association, filed a lawsuit in São Paulo against
DTVM and other defendants alleging that DTVM
improperly contributed to Postalis investment losses. On
March 20, 2017, the lawsuit was dismissed without
prejudice, and ADCAP appealed. On Aug. 4, 2021, the
appellate court overturned the dismissal and sent the
lawsuit to a state lower court. On March 2, 2023, DTVM
appealed the August 4 decision to Brazil’s Superior Court
of Justice. On Dec. 17, 2015, Postalis filed three lawsuits
in Rio de Janeiro against DTVM and Ativos alleging
failure to properly perform duties with respect to
investments in several other funds. On May 20, 2021, the
court in one of those lawsuits entered a judgment of
approximately $3 million against DTVM and Ativos. On
Aug. 23, 2021, DTVM and Ativos filed an appeal of the
May 20 decision. On June 7, 2022, the appellate court
partially granted and partially denied the appeal, reducing
the judgment to approximately $2 million. On July 13,
2023, DTVM and Ativos filed a further appeal to Brazil’s
Superior Court of Justice, which was denied on Sept. 20,
2024. On Aug. 24, 2022, the court dismissed one of the
other lawsuits. On Nov. 24, 2022, Postalis appealed that
decision. On Oct. 24, 2023, Postalis’s appeal was denied.
Postalis further appealed on June 27, 2024. On Feb. 4,
2016, Postalis filed a lawsuit in Brasilia against DTVM,
Ativos and BNY Alocação de Patrimônio Ltda. (“Alocação
de Patrimônio”), an investment management subsidiary,
alleging failure to properly perform duties and liability for
losses with respect to investments in various funds of
which the defendants were administrator and/or manager.
On Jan. 16, 2018, the Brazilian Federal Prosecution
Service filed a civil lawsuit in São Paulo against DTVM
alleging liability for Postalis losses based on alleged
failures to properly perform certain duties as administrator
to certain funds in which Postalis invested or as controller
of Postalis’s own investment portfolio. On April 18, 2018,
the court dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice. On Aug.
4, 2021, the appellate court overturned the dismissal and
returned the lawsuit to the lower court. On April 11, 2022,
DTVM appealed the Aug. 4 decision to Brazil’s Superior
Court of Justice. On Aug. 21, 2023, DTVM’s appeal was
denied. In addition, the

Tribunal de Contas da União (“TCU”), an administrative
tribunal, has initiated proceedings with the purpose of
determining liability for losses to four investment funds
administered by DTVM in which Postalis was an investor.
On Sept. 9, 2020, TCU rendered a decision in one of the
proceedings, finding DTVM and two former Postalis
directors jointly and severally liable for approximately $50
million. TCU also imposed on DTVM a fine of
approximately $2 million. DTVM’s administrative appeal
of the decision was denied. On Feb. 25, 2022, DTVM filed
a lawsuit in Brazil federal court in Brasilia seeking
annulment of TCU’s decision and an injunction preventing
TCU from enforcing the judgment. On Aug. 24, 2022, the
Brazilian Federal Attorneys filed an action in Rio de
Janeiro court seeking to enforce the fine portion of the
judgment. On Nov. 8, 2022, the Brasilia federal court in the
annulment action granted DTVM’s request for an
injunction, suspending the Sept. 9, 2020, TCU decision
until the annulment action is decided. On Oct. 4, 2019,
Postalis and another pension fund filed a request for
arbitration in São Paulo against DTVM and Ativos alleging
liability for losses to an investment fund for which DTVM
was administrator and Ativos was manager. On March 26,
2021, DTVM and Ativos filed a lawsuit in São Paulo
challenging the decision rendered by the Arbitration Court
with respect to its jurisdiction over the case. On Feb. 24,
2023, the São Paulo court annulled the Arbitration Court’s
decision that it had jurisdiction, and Postalis and the other
pension fund have appealed. On Sept. 21, 2023, the São
Paulo court issued an order suspending the arbitration; the
Arbitration Court implemented the suspension on Oct. 6,
2023. On April 8, 2024, the appellate court reversed the
São Paulo court’s decision and found that the Arbitration
Court did have jurisdiction. DTVM and Ativos have
appealed. On Oct. 25, 2019, Postalis filed a lawsuit in Rio
de Janeiro against DTVM and Alocação de Patrimônio,
alleging liability for losses in another fund for which
DTVM was administrator and Alocação de Patrimônio and
Ativos were managers. On May 9, 2022, the court found
DTVM and Alocação de Patrimônio jointly and severally
liable for approximately $20 million. On Aug. 12, 2022,
DTVM and Alocação de Patrimônio appealed the decision.
On April 30, 2024, the appeals court reversed the finding
against DTVM and Alocação de Patrimônio. Postalis
appealed that reversal and, on Oct. 3, 2024, its appeal was
denied. On June 19, 2020, a lawsuit was filed in federal
court in Rio de Janeiro against DTVM, Postalis, and
various other

BNY 97

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

defendants alleging liability against DTVM for certain
Postalis losses in an investment fund of which DTVM was
administrator. On Feb. 10, 2021, Postalis and another
pension fund served DTVM in a lawsuit filed in Rio de
Janeiro, alleging liability for losses in another investment
fund for which DTVM was administrator and the other
defendant was manager.

Brazilian Silverado Litigation
DTVM acts as administrator for the Fundo de Investimento
em Direitos Creditórios Multisetorial Silverado Maximum
(“Silverado Maximum Fund”), which invests in
commercial credit receivables. On June 2, 2016, the
Silverado Maximum Fund sued DTVM in its capacity as
administrator, along with Deutsche Bank S.A. - Banco
Alemão in its capacity as custodian and Silverado Gestão e
Investimentos Ltda. in its capacity as investment manager.
The Fund alleges that each of the defendants failed to
fulfill its respective duty, and caused losses to the Fund for
which the defendants are jointly and severally liable. On
March 21, 2024, the São Paulo court issued a decision
finding DTVM, Deutsche Bank and Silverado Gestão e
Investimentos jointly liable for losses to the Fund in an
amount to be determined during a later calculation phase.
On Sept. 12, 2024, DTVM filed an appeal.

German Tax Matters
German authorities are investigating past “cum/ex”
trading, which involved the purchase of equity securities
on or shortly before the dividend date, but settled after that
date, potentially resulting in an unwarranted refund of
withholding tax. German authorities have taken the view
that past cum/ex trading may have resulted in tax
avoidance or evasion. European subsidiaries of BNY have
been informed by German authorities about investigations
into potential cum/ex trading by certain third-party
investment funds, where one of the subsidiaries had
acquired entities that served as depositary and/or fund
manager for those third-party investment funds. We have
received information requests from the authorities relating
to pre-acquisition activity and are cooperating fully with
those requests. In August 2019, the District Court of Bonn
ordered that one of these subsidiaries be joined as a
secondary party in connection with the prosecution of
unrelated individual defendants. Trial commenced in
September 2019. In March 2020, the court stated that it
would refrain from taking action against the subsidiary in
order to expedite the conclusion of the trial. The court
convicted the unrelated individual

98 BNY

defendants, and determined that the cum/ex trading
activities of the relevant third-party investment funds were
unlawful. In November and December 2020 and February
2023, we received secondary liability notices from the
German tax authorities totaling approximately $150
million (at then-prevailing exchange rates) related to pre-
acquisition activity in various funds for which the entities
we acquired were depositary and/or fund manager. We
have appealed the notices. In connection with the
acquisition of the subject entities, we obtained an
indemnity for liabilities from the sellers that we intend to
pursue as necessary.

Off-Channel Business-Related Communications
The Company has been responding to a request for
information from the SEC concerning compliance with
recordkeeping obligations relating to business
communications transmitted on unapproved electronic
communication platforms. SEC staff has stated that it is
conducting similar inquiries into recordkeeping practices at
other financial institutions. On Aug. 14, 2024, the SEC
issued an order under which the Company agreed to pay a
$40 million penalty and to certain undertakings to resolve
the SEC matter. In April 2023, the Company received a
similar request from the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission and is cooperating with that inquiry as well.

Pershing Rule 15c3-3 Matter
The Company has been responding to investigative
requests for information and records from the SEC
concerning Pershing LLC’s compliance with its obligations
under SEC Rule 15c3-3, among other regulatory rules and
statutes. The Company continues to cooperate with the
inquiry.

Note 19–Business segments

We have an internal information system that produces
performance data along product and service lines for our
three principal business segments and the Other segment.
The primary products and services and types of revenue for
our principal businesses and a description of the Other
segment are presented in Note 24 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Annual
Report.

Business accounting principles

Our business data has been determined on an internal
management basis of accounting, rather than GAAP,

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

which is used for consolidated financial reporting. These
measurement principles are designed so that reported
results of the businesses will track their economic
performance.

Business segment results are subject to reclassification
when organizational changes are made, or for refinements
in revenue and expense allocation methodologies.
Refinements are typically reflected on a prospective basis.
There were no reclassifications or organizational changes
in the third quarter of 2024. In the first quarter of 2024, we
made certain realignments of similar products and services
within our lines of business. The largest change was the
movement of Institutional Solutions from Pershing to
Clearance and Collateral Management, both in the Market
and Wealth Services business segment. We made other
smaller changes that moved activity from Asset Servicing
in the Securities Services business segment to Treasury
Services in the Market and Wealth Services business
segment, and from Wealth Management in the Investment
and Wealth Management business segment and Pershing in
the Market and Wealth Services business segment to
Investment Management in the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment. The Other segment was
not impacted by the changes. Business segment results for
the three- and nine-months ended Sept. 30, 2023 have been
revised to reflect these changes.

The accounting policies of the businesses are the same as
those described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in our 2023 Annual Report.

The results of our business segments are presented and
analyzed on an internal management reporting basis.

• Revenue amounts reflect fee and other revenue

generated by each business and include revenue for
services provided between the segments that are also
provided to third parties. Fee and other revenue
transferred between businesses under revenue transfer
agreements is included within other fees in each
segment.

• Revenues and expenses associated with specific client
bases are included in those businesses. For example,
foreign exchange activity associated with clients using
custody products is included in the Securities Services
segment.

• Net interest income is allocated to businesses based on
the yields on the assets and liabilities generated by each
business. We employ a funds transfer pricing system
that matches funds with the specific assets and liabilities
of each business based on their interest sensitivity and
maturity characteristics.

•

•

•

The provision for credit losses associated with the
respective credit portfolios is reflected in each segment.

Incentives expense related to restricted stock and
restricted stock units is allocated to the segments.

Support and other indirect expenses, including services
provided between segments that are not provided to
third parties or not subject to a revenue transfer
agreement, are allocated to the businesses based on
internally developed methodologies and reflected in
noninterest expense.

• Recurring FDIC expense is allocated to the businesses
based on average deposits generated within each
business.

•

•

Severance expense is recorded in the segments based on
the business or function the impacted employees reside,
with severance related to corporate staff, technology
and operations reflected in the Other segment.

Litigation expense is generally recorded in the business
in which the charge occurs.

• Management of the securities portfolio is a shared

service contained in the Other segment. As a result,
gains and losses associated with the valuation of the
securities portfolio are generally included in the Other
segment.

• Client deposits serve as the primary funding source for

our securities portfolio. We typically allocate all interest
income to the businesses generating the deposits.

• Balance sheet assets and liabilities and their related
income or expense are specifically assigned to each
business. Segments with a net liability position have
been allocated assets.

• Goodwill and intangible assets are reflected within

individual businesses.
