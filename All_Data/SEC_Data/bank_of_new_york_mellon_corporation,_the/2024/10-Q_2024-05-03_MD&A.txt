Highlights of first quarter 2024 results

Net income applicable to common shareholders was $953
million, or $1.25 per diluted common share, in the first
quarter of 2024, including the impact of notable items.
Notable items in the first quarter of 2024 include severance
expense and litigation reserves. Excluding notable items,
net income applicable to common shareholders was $982
million (Non-GAAP), or $1.29 (Non-GAAP) per diluted
common share, in the first quarter of 2024. Net income
applicable to common shareholders was $911 million, or
$1.13 per diluted common share, in the first quarter of
2023, including the impact of notable items. Notable items
in the first quarter of 2023 include litigation reserves and a
disposal loss. Excluding notable items, net income
applicable to common shareholders was $915 million
(Non-GAAP), or $1.13 (Non-GAAP) per diluted common
share, in the first quarter of 2023.

The highlights below are based on the first quarter of 2024
compared with the first quarter of 2023, unless otherwise
noted.

• Total revenue increased 3%, primarily reflecting:

• Fee revenue increased 5%, primarily reflecting
higher market values and higher client activity,
partially offset by lower foreign exchange volatility,
the mix of AUM flows and lower performance fees.
(See “Fee and other revenue” beginning on page 6.)

•

Investment and other revenue increased primarily
reflecting higher other investment, other trading and
seed capital results. (See “Fee and other revenue”
beginning on page 6.)

• Net interest income decreased 8%, primarily

reflecting changes in balance sheet mix, partially
offset by higher interest rates. (See “Net interest
income” on page 9.)

• Provision for credit losses was $27 million, primarily
driven by reserve increases related to commercial real
estate exposure. (See “Consolidated balance sheet
review – Allowance for credit losses” beginning on
page 27.)

• Noninterest expense increased 2%, primarily reflecting
higher investments, severance expense and employee
merit increases, partially offset by efficiency savings.
Excluding notable items, noninterest expense increased
1% (Non-GAAP). (See “Noninterest expense” on page
11.)

• Effective tax rate of 22.4%. (See “Income taxes” on

page 11.)

• Return on common equity (“ROE”) was 10.7% for the
first quarter of 2024. Excluding notable items, the
adjusted ROE was 11.0% (Non-GAAP) for the first
quarter of 2024.

• Return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) was

20.7% (Non-GAAP) for the first quarter of

Fee and other revenue

2024. Excluding notable items, the adjusted ROTCE
was 21.3% (Non-GAAP) for the first quarter of 2024.

See “Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP
and Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on page 41
for a reconciliation of these Non-GAAP measures.

Metrics

• AUC/A of $48.8 trillion increased 5%, primarily

reflecting higher market values, partially offset by lower
collateral management balances.

• AUM of $2.0 trillion increased 6%, primarily reflecting

higher market values.

Capital and liquidity

• Our CET1 ratio calculated under the Standardized

Approach was 10.8% at March 31, 2024 and 11.5% at
Dec. 31, 2023 under the Advanced Approaches. The
decrease reflects higher period-end risk-weighted assets
and the reduction in capital. (See “Capital” beginning
on page 33.)

• Tier 1 leverage was 5.9% at March 31, 2024 and 6.0%
at Dec. 31, 2023. The decrease reflects the reduction in
capital and higher average assets. (See “Capital”
beginning on page 33.)

• Returned $1.3 billion to common shareholders,

including $988 million of common share repurchases.

N/M – Not meaningful.

Fee revenue increased 5% compared with the first quarter
of 2023 and 3% compared with the fourth quarter of 2023.
The increase compared with the first quarter of 2023
primarily reflects higher investment services fees, partially
offset by lower foreign exchange revenue. The increase
compared with the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily reflects
higher investment services fees and investment
management and performance fees.

Investment and other revenue increased $51 million
compared with the first quarter of 2023 and $139 million
compared with the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase
compared with the first quarter of 2023 primarily reflects
higher other investment, other trading and seed capital
results. The increase compared with the fourth quarter of
2023 primarily reflects the reduction in the fair value of a
contingent consideration receivable in the fourth quarter of
2023.

Investment services fees

Investment services fees increased 8% compared with the
first quarter of 2023 and 2% compared with the fourth
quarter of 2023. The increase compared with the first
quarter of 2023 primarily reflects higher market values, net
new business and higher collateral management fees and
clearance volumes. The

6 BNY Mellon

increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2023
primarily reflects higher market values and client activity,
partially offset by lower Depositary Receipts revenue.

AUC/A totaled $48.8 trillion at March 31, 2024, an
increase of 5% compared with March 31, 2023, primarily
reflecting higher market values, partially offset by lower
collateral management balances. AUC/A consisted of 37%
equity securities and 63% fixed income securities at March
31, 2024, and 33% equity securities and 67% fixed income
securities at March 31, 2023.

See “Securities Services business segment” and “Market
and Wealth Services business segment” in “Review of
business segments” for additional details.

Investment management and performance fees

Investment management and performance fees were flat
compared with the first quarter of 2023 and increased 4%
compared with the fourth quarter of 2023. Compared with
the first quarter of 2023, higher market values were offset
by the mix of AUM flows and lower performance fees. The
increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2023
primarily reflects higher market values, partially offset by
the

timing of performance fees. Performance fees were $10
million in the first quarter of 2024, $22 million in the first
quarter of 2023 and $19 million in the fourth quarter of
2023. On a constant currency basis (Non-GAAP),
investment management and performance fees decreased
1% compared with the first quarter of 2023. See
“Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP and
Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on page 41 for
the reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures.

AUM was $2.0 trillion at March 31, 2024, an increase of
6% compared with March 31, 2023, primarily reflecting
higher market values.

See “Investment and Wealth Management business
segment” in “Review of business segments” for additional
details regarding the drivers of investment management
and performance fees, AUM and AUM flows.

Foreign exchange revenue

Foreign exchange revenue is primarily driven by the
volume of client transactions and the spread realized on
these transactions, both of which are impacted by market
volatility, the impact of foreign currency hedging activities
and foreign currency remeasurement gain (loss). Foreign
exchange revenue decreased 14% compared with the first
quarter of 2023 and increased 6% compared with the
fourth quarter of 2023. The decrease compared with the
first quarter of 2023 primarily reflects lower volatility. The
increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2023
primarily reflects higher volumes. Foreign exchange
revenue is primarily reported in the Securities Services
business segment and, to a lesser extent, in the Market and
Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth Management
business segments and the Other segment.

Financing-related fees

Financing-related fees, which are primarily reported in the
Market and Wealth Services and Securities Services
business segments, include capital market fees, loan
commitment fees and credit-related fees. Financing-related
fees increased 10% compared with the first quarter of 2023
and 27% compared with the fourth quarter of 2023,
primarily reflecting higher underwriting fees.

Investment and other revenue

Investment and other revenue includes income or loss from
consolidated investment management funds, seed capital
gains or losses, other trading revenue or loss, renewable
energy investments gains, income from corporate and
bank-owned life insurance contracts, other investment
gains or losses, gains or losses from disposals, expense
reimbursements from our CIBC Mellon joint venture, other
income or loss and net securities gains or losses. The
income or loss from consolidated investment management
funds should be considered together with the net income or
loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, which reflects
the portion of the consolidated funds for which we do not
have an economic interest and is reflected below net
income as a separate line item on the consolidated income
statement. Other trading revenue or loss primarily includes
the impact of market-risk hedging activity related to our
seed capital investments in investment management funds,
non-foreign currency derivative and fixed income trading,
and other hedging activity. Other investment gains or
losses includes fair value changes of non-readily
marketable strategic equity, private equity and other
investments. Expense reimbursements from our CIBC
Mellon joint venture relate to expenses incurred by BNY
Mellon on behalf of the CIBC Mellon joint venture. Other
income includes various miscellaneous revenues.

N/M – Not meaningful.
bps – basis points.

Net interest income decreased 8% compared with the first
quarter of 2023 and 6% compared with the fourth quarter
of 2023. The decrease compared with the first quarter of
2023 primarily reflects changes in balance sheet mix,
partially offset by higher interest rates. The decrease
compared with the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily reflects
changes in balance sheet mix.

Net interest margin decreased 10 basis points compared
with the first quarter of 2023 and 7 basis points compared
with the fourth quarter of 2023. The changes compared
with the first quarter of 2023 and the fourth quarter of 2023
primarily reflect the factors mentioned above.

Average interest-earning assets decreased 1% compared
with the first quarter of 2023 and increased 1% compared
with the fourth quarter of 2023. The decrease compared
with the first quarter of 2023 primarily reflects lower
securities and interest-bearing deposits with banks,
partially offset by higher interest-bearing deposits with the
Federal Reserve and other central banks. The increase
compared with the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily reflects
higher securities balances, partially offset by lower
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and
other central banks.

Average non-U.S. dollar deposits comprised approximately
25% of our average total deposits in the first quarter of
2024. Approximately 45% of the average non-U.S. dollar
deposits in the first quarter of 2024 were euro-
denominated.

(a)    Includes the average impact of offsetting under enforceable netting agreements of approximately $151 billion for the first quarter of 2024, $141 billion for the fourth

quarter of 2023 and $62 billion for the first quarter of 2023. On a Non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of offsetting, the yield on federal funds sold and securities
purchased under resale agreements would have been 5.49% for the first quarter of 2024, 5.48% for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 4.62% for the first quarter of 2023. On

a Non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of offsetting, the rate on federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements would have been 5.38% for

the first quarter of 2024, 5.35% for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 4.49% for the first quarter of 2023. We believe providing the rates excluding the impact of netting is

useful to investors as it is more reflective of the actual rates earned and paid.

(b)    Average rates were calculated on an FTE basis, at tax rates of approximately 21%.
(c)    See “Net interest income” on page 9 for the reconciliation of this Non-GAAP measure.

Total noninterest expense increased 2% compared with the
first quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting higher
investments, severance expense and employee merit
increases, partially offset by efficiency savings. Excluding
notable items, noninterest expense increased 1% (Non-
GAAP) compared with the first quarter of 2023. The
investments in growth, infrastructure and efficiency
initiatives are primarily included in staff, software and
equipment, and professional, legal and other purchased
services expenses. Total noninterest expense decreased
21% compared with the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily
reflecting the impact of notable items recorded in 2023,
including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(“FDIC”) special assessment, severance expense and
litigation reserves, and the favorable impact of efficiency
savings, partially offset by higher revenue-related
expenses. Excluding notable items, noninterest expense
increased 1% (Non-GAAP) compared with the fourth
quarter of 2023.

See “Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP
and Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on page 41
for the reconciliation of this Non-GAAP measure.

Income taxes

BNY Mellon recorded an income tax provision of $297
million (22.4% effective tax rate) in the first quarter of
2024. The income tax provision was $306 million (23.8%
effective tax rate) in the first quarter of 2023 and $73
million (26.2% effective tax rate) in the fourth quarter of
2023.

On Jan. 1, 2024, we adopted ASU 2023-02, Investments—
Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting
for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the
Proportional Amortization Method, on a retrospective
basis. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information on the new
accounting guidance.

For additional information on income taxes, see Note 11 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Review of business segments

We have an internal information system that produces
performance data along product and service lines for our
three principal business segments: Securities Services,
Market and Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth
Management, and the Other segment.

Business segment accounting principles

Our business segment data has been determined on an
internal management basis of accounting, rather than the
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) used
for consolidated financial reporting. These measurement
principles are designed so that reported results of the
businesses will track their economic performance.

For information on the accounting principles of our
business segments, see Note 19 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. For information on the
primary products and services in each line of business, the
primary types of revenue by line of

BNY Mellon 11

volume-related fees may decline due to reduced client
activity. In the fourth quarter, we typically incur higher
business development and marketing expenses. In our
Investment and Wealth Management business segment,
performance fees are typically higher in the fourth and first
quarters, as those quarters represent the end of the
measurement period for many of the performance fee-
eligible relationships.

The results of our business segments may also be impacted
by the translation of financial results denominated in
foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. We are primarily
impacted by activities denominated in the British pound
and the euro. On a consolidated basis and in our Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services business
segments, we typically have more foreign currency-
denominated expenses than revenues. However, our
Investment and Wealth Management business segment
typically has more foreign currency-denominated revenues
than expenses. Overall, currency fluctuations impact the
year-over-year growth rate in the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment more than the Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services business
segments. However, currency fluctuations, in isolation, are
not expected to significantly impact net income on a
consolidated basis.

Fee revenue in the Investment and Wealth Management
business segment, and, to a lesser extent, the Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services business
segments, is impacted by global market fluctuations. At
March 31, 2024, we estimated that a 5% change in global
equity markets, spread evenly throughout the year, would
impact fee revenue by less than 1% and diluted earnings
per common share by $0.04 to $0.07.

See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for the consolidating schedules, which show the
contribution of our business segments to our overall
profitability.

business and how our business segments are presented and
analyzed, see Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in our 2023 Annual Report.

Business segment results are subject to reclassification
when organizational changes are made, or for refinements
in revenue and expense allocation methodologies.
Refinements are typically reflected on a prospective basis.
In the first quarter of 2024, we made certain realignments
of similar products and services within our lines of
business consistent with the firm’s ongoing transition to a
platforms operating model uniting related capabilities and
enabling streamlining of internal processes to drive growth,
efficiency, resiliency, and enhanced risk management. The
largest change was the movement of Institutional Solutions
from Pershing to Clearance and Collateral Management,
both in the Market and Wealth Services business segment.
We made other smaller changes that moved activity from
Asset Servicing in the Securities Services business
segment to Treasury Services in the Market and Wealth
Services business segment, and from Wealth Management
in the Investment and Wealth Management business
segment and Pershing in the Market and Wealth Services
business segment to Investment Management in the
Investment and Wealth Management business segment.
The Other segment was not impacted by the changes. Prior
period business segment results have been revised to
reflect these changes.

The results of our business segments may be influenced by
client and other activities that vary by quarter. In the first
quarter, staff expense typically increases, reflecting the
vesting of long-term stock awards for retirement-eligible
employees. The timing of our annual employee merit
increases also impacts staff expense. In 2024, the merit
increase was effective in March, thus partially impacting
the first quarter and second quarter staff expense variances.
For 2023, the merit increase was effective at the beginning
of the second quarter. In the third quarter,

Business segment description

The Securities Services business segment consists of two
distinct lines of business, Asset Servicing and Issuer
Services, which provide business solutions across the
transaction life cycle to our global asset owner and asset
manager clients. We are one of the leading global
investment services providers with

$35.4 trillion of AUC/A at March 31, 2024. For
information on the drivers of the Securities Services fee
revenue, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in our 2023 Annual Report.

The Asset Servicing business provides a comprehensive
suite of solutions. We are one of the largest global custody
and front-to-back outsourcing

BNY Mellon 13

Total revenue of $2.1 billion increased 1% compared
with the first quarter of 2023 and decreased 2%
compared with the fourth quarter of 2023. The drivers of
total revenue by line of business are indicated below.

Asset Servicing revenue of $1.7 billion increased 1%
compared with the first quarter of 2023 and was flat
compared with the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase
compared with the first quarter of 2023 primarily reflects
higher market values, net new business and higher client
activity, partially offset by lower net interest income and
foreign exchange revenue. Compared with the fourth
quarter of 2023, higher market values, client activity and
foreign exchange revenue were offset by lower net
interest income and a strategic equity investment gain in
the fourth quarter of 2023.

Issuer Services revenue of $471 million increased 4%
compared with the first quarter of 2023 and decreased
7% compared with the fourth quarter of 2023. The
increase compared with the first quarter of 2023
primarily reflects higher Depositary Receipts revenue,
partially offset by lower net interest income. The
decrease compared with the fourth quarter of 2023
primarily reflects lower Depositary Receipts revenue and
net interest income.

Market and regulatory trends are driving investable
assets toward lower fee asset management products at
reduced margins for our clients. These dynamics are also
negatively impacting our investment services fees.
However, at the same time, these trends are providing
additional outsourcing opportunities as clients and other
market participants seek to comply with regulations and
reduce their operating costs.

Noninterest expense of $1.5 billion was flat compared
with the first quarter of 2023 and decreased 7%
compared with the fourth quarter of 2023. Compared
with the first quarter of 2023, higher investments and
employee merit increases were offset by efficiency
savings. The decrease compared with fourth quarter of
2023 primarily reflects efficiency savings, lower
severance expense and lower revenue-related expenses.

Review of financial results

AUC/A of $13.1 trillion decreased 4% compared with
March 31, 2023, primarily reflecting lower collateral
management balances, partially offset by higher market
values.

Total revenue of $1.5 billion increased 3% compared with
the first quarter of 2023 and 1% compared with the fourth
quarter of 2023. The drivers of total revenue by line of
business are indicated below.

16 BNY Mellon

Pershing revenue of $670 million increased 3% compared
with the first quarter of 2023 and was flat compared with
the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase compared with the
first quarter of 2023 primarily reflects higher market values
and client activity, partially offset by lost business in the
prior year. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2023,
higher client activity and market values were offset by
lower net interest income and lost business in the prior
year.

Treasury Services revenue of $416 million decreased 1%
compared with the first quarter of 2023 and increased 2%
compared with the fourth quarter of 2023. The decrease
compared with the first quarter of 2023 primarily reflects
lower net interest income, partially offset by net new
business. The increase compared with the fourth quarter of
2023 primarily reflects higher client activity.

Clearance and Collateral Management revenue of $431
million increased 7% compared with the first quarter of
2023 and 3% compared with the fourth quarter of 2023.
The increase compared with the first quarter of 2023
primarily reflects higher collateral management fees and
clearance volumes, partially offset by lower net interest
income. The increase compared with the fourth quarter of
2023 primarily reflects higher collateral management fees
and clearance volumes.

Noninterest expense of $834 million increased 7%
compared with the first quarter of 2023 and was flat
compared with the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase
compared with the first quarter of 2023 primarily reflects
higher investments and revenue-related expense and
employee merit increases, partially offset by efficiency
savings.

Business segment description

Review of financial results

Our Investment and Wealth Management business segment
consists of two distinct lines of business: Investment
Management and Wealth Management. Our investment
firms deliver a highly diversified portfolio of investment
strategies independently, and through our global
distribution network, to institutional and retail clients
globally. BNY Mellon Wealth Management provides
investment management, custody, wealth and estate
planning, private banking services, investment servicing
and information management. See pages 18 and 19 of our
2023 Annual Report for additional information on our
Investment and Wealth Management business segment.

AUM of $2.0 trillion as of March 31, 2024, increased 6%
compared with March 31, 2023, primarily reflecting higher
market values.

Net long-term strategy inflows were $1 billion in the first
quarter of 2024, driven by liability-driven and fixed
income investments, partially offset by the outflows of
index, multi-asset and alternative and equity investments.
Short-term strategy inflows were $16 billion in the first
quarter of 2024. Market and regulatory trends have
resulted in increased demand for lower fee asset
management products and for performance-based fees.

Total revenue of $846 million increased 2% compared with
the first quarter of 2023 and 25% compared with the fourth
quarter of 2023. The

18 BNY Mellon

drivers of total revenue by line of business are indicated
below.

Investment Management revenue of $576 million increased
2% compared with the first quarter of 2023 and 39%
compared with the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase
compared with the first quarter of 2023 primarily reflects
higher market values, partially offset by the mix of AUM
flows and lower performance fees. The increase compared
with the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily reflects the
reduction in the fair value of a contingent consideration
receivable recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 and
higher market values, partially offset by the timing of
performance fees.

Wealth Management revenue of $270 million increased 2%
compared with the first quarter of 2023 and 2% compared
with the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase compared
with the first quarter of 2023

primarily reflects higher market values, partially offset by
changes in product mix and lower net interest income. The
increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2023
primarily reflects higher market values, partially offset by
lower net interest income.

Revenue generated in the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment included 30% from non-
U.S. sources in the first quarter of 2024, compared with
31% in the first quarter of 2023 and 36% in the fourth
quarter of 2023.

Noninterest expense of $740 million was flat compared
with the first quarter of 2023 reflecting higher investments
and employee merit increases, offset by efficiency savings.
Noninterest expense increased 8% compared with the
fourth quarter of 2023 primarily reflecting higher revenue-
related expenses.

Review of financial results

Total revenue includes corporate treasury and other
investment activity, including hedging activity, which has
an offsetting impact between fee and other revenue and net
interest expense.

Total revenue increased $18 million compared with the
first quarter of 2023 and $17 million compared with the
fourth quarter of 2023. The increase compared with the
first quarter of 2023 primarily reflects a strategic equity
investment loss recorded in

the first quarter of 2023. The increase compared with the
fourth quarter of 2023 primarily reflects net securities
losses recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023, partially
offset by strategic equity investment gains also recorded in
the fourth quarter of 2023.

The provision for credit losses was $12 million in the first
quarter of 2024, primarily reflecting increased reserves
related to cash balances with exposure to Russia.

Noninterest expense increased $24 million compared with
the first quarter of 2023 and decreased $755 million
compared with the fourth quarter of 2023. The decrease
compared with the fourth quarter of

BNY Mellon 19

2023 primarily reflects the FDIC special assessment
recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 and lower severance
expense and litigation reserves.

Critical accounting estimates

Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our
2023 Annual Report. Our critical accounting estimates are
those related to the allowance for credit losses, goodwill
and other intangibles and litigation and regulatory
contingencies, as referenced below.

Critical accounting estimates Reference

Allowance for credit losses

2023 Annual Report, pages 23-24, and
“Allowance for credit losses.”

Goodwill and other
intangibles

2023 Annual Report, pages 24-25.
Also see below.

Litigation and regulatory
contingencies

“Legal proceedings” in Note 18 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Goodwill and other intangibles

BNY Mellon’s business segments include seven reporting
units for which goodwill impairment testing is performed
on an annual basis. An interim goodwill impairment test is
performed when events or circumstances occur that may
indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of
any reporting unit may be less than its carrying value.

In the first quarter of 2024, due to the results of the fourth
quarter 2023 interim goodwill impairment test and
macroeconomic conditions, we performed an interim
goodwill impairment test of the Investment Management
reporting unit, which had $6.1 billion of allocated
goodwill. The fair value of the Investment Management
reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by
approximately 10%. We determined the fair value of the
Investment Management reporting unit using an income
approach based on management’s projections as of March
31, 2024. The discount rate applied to these cash flows was
10.5%.

As of March 31, 2024, if the discount rate applied to the
estimated cash flows was increased or decreased by 25
basis points, the fair value of the Investment Management
reporting unit would decrease or increase by 4%,
respectively. Similarly, if the long-

20 BNY Mellon

term growth rate was increased or decreased by 10 basis
points, the fair value of the Investment Management
reporting unit would increase or decrease by approximately
1%, respectively.

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is subject to
uncertainty as it is reliant on estimates of cash flows that
extend far into the future, and, by their nature, are difficult
to estimate over such an extended time frame. In the future,
changes in the assumptions or the discount rate could
produce a material non-cash goodwill impairment.

Consolidated balance sheet review

One of our key risk management objectives is to maintain a
balance sheet that remains strong throughout market cycles
to meet the expectations of our major stakeholders,
including our shareholders, clients, creditors and
regulators.

We also seek to undertake overall liquidity risk, including
intraday liquidity risk, that stays within our risk appetite.
The objective of our balance sheet management strategy is
to maintain a balance sheet that is characterized by strong
liquidity and asset quality, ready access to external funding
sources at competitive rates and a strong capital structure
that supports our risk-taking activities and is adequate to
absorb potential losses. In managing the balance sheet,
appropriate consideration is given to balancing the
competing needs of maintaining sufficient levels of
liquidity and complying with applicable regulations and
supervisory expectations while optimizing profitability.

At March 31, 2024, total assets were $435 billion,
compared with $410 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. The increase
in total assets was primarily driven by higher securities and
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and
other central banks, partially offset by lower other assets
and interest-bearing deposits with banks. Deposits totaled
$309 billion at March 31, 2024, compared with $284
billion at Dec. 31, 2023. The increase reflects higher
interest-bearing deposits in U.S. offices and noninterest-
bearing deposits (principally in U.S. offices). Total interest-
bearing deposits as a percentage of total interest-earning
assets were 66% at March 31, 2024 and 66% at Dec. 31,
2023.

At March 31, 2024, available funds totaled $165 billion
and included cash and due from banks,

interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and
other central banks, interest-bearing deposits with banks
and federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements. This compares with available funds of
$158 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Total available funds as a
percentage of total assets was 38% at March 31, 2024 and
38% at Dec. 31, 2023. For additional information on our
available funds, see “Liquidity and dividends.”

Securities were $139 billion, or 32% of total assets, at
March 31, 2024, compared with $126 billion, or 31% of
total assets, at Dec. 31, 2023. The increase primarily
reflects higher non-U.S. government, U.S. Treasury and
agency RMBS securities, partially offset by unrealized pre-
tax losses and lower U.S. government agencies securities.
For additional information on our securities portfolio, see
“Securities” and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Loans were $74 billion, or 17% of total assets, at March
31, 2024, compared with $67 billion, or 16% of total
assets, at Dec. 31, 2023. The increase was driven by higher
overdrafts and loans in the financial institutions portfolio.
For additional information on our loan portfolio, see
“Loans” and Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Long-term debt totaled $32 billion at March 31, 2024 and
$31 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Issuances were

Interest-bearing deposits

partially offset by maturities and redemptions and a
decrease in the fair value of hedged long-term debt. For
additional information on long-term debt, see “Liquidity
and dividends.”

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total
shareholders’ equity totaled $41 billion at March 31, 2024
and Dec. 31, 2023. For additional information, see
“Capital.”

Country risk exposure

The following table presents BNY Mellon’s top 10
exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of March 31,
2024, as well as certain countries with higher risk profiles.
The exposure is presented on an internal risk management
basis and has not been reduced by the allowance for credit
losses. We monitor our exposure to these and other
countries as part of our internal country risk management
process.

The country risk exposure below reflects the Company’s
risk to an immediate default of the counterparty or obligor
based on the country of residence of the entity which
incurs the liability. If there is credit risk mitigation, the
country of residence of the entity providing the risk
mitigation is the country of risk. The country of risk for
securities is generally based on the domicile of the issuer
of the security.

BNY Mellon 21

Events in recent years have resulted in increased focus on
Brazil. The country risk exposure to Brazil is primarily
short-term trade finance loans extended to large financial
institutions. We also have operations in Brazil providing
investment services and investment management services.

The war in Ukraine has increased our focus on Russia. The
country risk exposure to Russia consists of cash balances
related to our securities services businesses and may
increase in the future to the extent cash is received for the
benefit of our clients that is subject to distribution
restrictions. BNY Mellon has ceased new banking business
in Russia

and suspended investment management purchases of
Russian securities. At March 31, 2024, less than 0.1% of
our AUC/A and less than 0.01% of our AUM consisted of
Russian securities. We will continue to work with
multinational clients that depend on our custody and
recordkeeping services to manage their exposures.

We are monitoring our exposure to Israel as part of our
internal country risk management process. At March 31,
2024, our total exposure to Israel was $155 million and
primarily consisted of investment grade short-term interest-
bearing deposits and OTC derivatives maturing within six
months.

Securities

In the discussion of our securities portfolio, we have included certain credit ratings information because the information can
indicate the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed. Significant changes in ratings classifications could indicate increased
credit risk for us and could be accompanied by an increase in the allowance for credit losses and/or a reduction in the fair value
of our securities portfolio.

(a)    Amortized cost reflects historical impairments and is net of the allowance for credit losses.

(b)    Includes the impact of hedges.

(c)    Represents ratings by Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) or the equivalent.

(d)    Includes supranational securities. Primarily consists of exposure to Germany, UK, France, Canada, Belgium and the Netherlands.

(e)    Primarily consists of exposure to Canada, UK, Australia, Germany, Belgium and Singapore.

(f)    Includes net unrealized gains on derivatives hedging securities available-for-sale (including terminated hedges) of $1,767 million at Dec. 31, 2023 and $2,161 million at March 31,

2024.

(g)    At March 31, 2024, includes pre-tax net unrealized losses of $1,975 million related to available-for-sale securities, net of hedges, and $5,191 million related to held-to-maturity

securities. The after-tax unrealized losses, net of hedges, related to available-for-sale securities is $1,490 million and the after-tax equivalent related to held-to-maturity securities is

$3,958 million.

The fair value of our securities portfolio, including related
hedges, was $135.9 billion at March 31, 2024, compared
with $123.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. The increase
primarily reflects higher non-U.S. government, U.S.
Treasury and agency RMBS

securities, partially offset by unrealized pre-tax losses and
lower U.S. government agencies securities.

At March 31, 2024, the securities portfolio had a net
unrealized loss, including the impact of related

22 BNY Mellon

hedges, of $7.2 billion, compared with $7.0 billion at Dec.
31, 2023. The increase in the unrealized loss, including the
impact of related hedges, primarily reflects the impact of
higher interest rates, partially offset by securities moving
closer to maturity.

The fair value of the available-for-sale securities totaled
$92.7 billion at March 31, 2024, net of hedges, or 68% of
the securities portfolio, net of hedges. The fair value of the
held-to-maturity securities totaled $43.2 billion at March
31, 2024, or 32% of the securities portfolio, net of hedges.

The unrealized loss (after-tax) on our available-for-sale
securities portfolio, net of hedges, included in accumulated
other comprehensive income was $1.5 billion at March 31,
2024, compared with $1.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Net
unrealized loss, including the impact of hedges, decreased
as securities moved closer to maturity, partially offset by
the impact of higher interest rates.

Loans

At March 31, 2024, 98% of the securities in our portfolio
were rated AAA/AA-, compared with 99% at Dec. 31,
2023.

Statements for the pre-tax net securities gains (losses) by

$125.2 billion increased 9% compared with Dec. 31, 2023,
primarily reflecting higher overdrafts and exposure in the
financial institutions portfolio.

Our financial institutions and commercial portfolios
comprise our largest concentrated risk. These portfolios
comprised 47% of our total exposure at March 31, 2024
and 46% at Dec. 31, 2023. Additionally, most of our
overdrafts relate to financial institutions.

The financial institutions portfolio exposure was $44.4
billion at March 31, 2024, an increase of 12% compared
with Dec. 31, 2023, primarily reflecting higher exposure in
the securities industry and banks portfolios.

Financial institution exposures are high quality, with 97%
of the exposures meeting the investment grade equivalent
criteria of our internal credit rating classification at March
31, 2024. Each customer is assigned an internal credit
rating, which is mapped to an equivalent external rating
agency grade based upon a number of dimensions, which
are continually evaluated and may change over time. For
ratings of non-U.S. counterparties, our internal credit rating
is generally capped at a rating equivalent to the sovereign
rating of the country where the counterparty resides,
regardless of the internal credit rating assigned to the
counterparty or the underlying collateral.

The exposure to financial institutions is generally short
term, with 84% of the exposures expiring within one year.
At March 31, 2024, 20% of the exposure to financial
institutions had an expiration within 90 days, compared
with 19% at Dec. 31, 2023.

In addition, 66% of the financial institutions exposure is
secured. For example, securities industry clients

and asset managers often borrow against marketable
securities held in custody.

At March 31, 2024, the secured intraday credit provided to
dealers in connection with their tri-party repo activity
totaled $13.5 billion and was included in the securities
industry portfolio. Dealers secure the outstanding intraday
credit with high-quality liquid collateral having a market
value in excess of the amount of the outstanding credit.
Secured intraday credit facilities represent approximately
30% of the exposure in the financial institutions portfolio
and are reviewed and reapproved annually.

The asset managers portfolio exposure is high quality, with
96% of the exposures meeting our investment grade
equivalent ratings criteria as of March 31, 2024. These
exposures are generally short-term liquidity facilities, with
the majority to regulated mutual funds.

Our banks portfolio exposure primarily relates to global
trade finance. These exposures are short term in nature,
with 94% due in less than one year. The investment grade
percentage of our banks portfolio exposure was 90% at
March 31, 2024, compared with 84% at Dec. 31, 2023. Our
non-investment grade exposures are primarily trade finance
loans in Brazil.

Wealth management loans

Our wealth management loan exposure was $9.7 billion at
March 31, 2024, compared with $9.6 billion at Dec. 31,
2023. Wealth management loans

primarily consist of loans to high-net-worth individuals, a
majority of which are secured by the customers’
investment management accounts or custody accounts.

Wealth management mortgages

Our wealth management mortgage exposure was $9.3
billion at March 31, 2024, compared with $9.4 billion at
Dec. 31, 2023. Wealth management mortgages primarily
consist of loans to high-net-worth individuals, which are
secured by residential property. Wealth management
mortgages are primarily interest-only, adjustable-rate
mortgages with a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio of
61% at origination. At March 31, 2024, less than 1% of the
mortgages were past due.

At March 31, 2024, the wealth management mortgage
portfolio consisted of the following geographic
concentrations: California – 21%; New York – 14%;
Florida – 11%; Massachusetts – 8%; and other – 46%.

Our commercial real estate exposure totaled $10.2 billion
at March 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023. Our income-
producing commercial real estate facilities are focused on
experienced owners and are structured with moderate
leverage based on existing cash flows. Our commercial
real estate lending activities also include construction and
renovation facilities. Our client base consists of
experienced developers and long-term holders of real
estate assets. Loans are approved on the basis of existing or
projected cash flows and supported by appraisals and
knowledge of local market conditions. Development loans
are structured with moderate leverage and, in many
instances, involve some level of recourse to the developer.

At March 31, 2024, the unsecured portfolio consisted of
real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) and real estate
operating companies, which are both primarily investment
grade.

At March 31, 2024, our commercial real estate portfolio
consisted of the following concentrations: New York metro
– 35%; REITs and real estate operating companies – 28%;
and other – 37%.

Lease financings

The lease financings portfolio exposure totaled $599
million at March 31, 2024 and $599 million at Dec. 31,
2023. At March 31, 2024, nearly all of leasing exposure
was investment grade, or investment grade equivalent, and
consisted of exposures backed by well-diversified assets,
primarily real estate and large-ticket transportation
equipment. Assets are both domestic and foreign-based,
with primary concentrations in Germany and the U.S.

Other residential mortgages

The other residential mortgages portfolio primarily consists
of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and totaled $1.1
billion at March 31, 2024 and $1.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.

Overdrafts

Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities
clearance clients and are generally repaid within two
business days.

Capital call financing

Capital call financing includes loans to private equity funds
that are secured by the fund investors’ capital commitments
and the funds’ rights to call capital.

Other loans

Other loans primarily include loans to consumers that are
fully collateralized with equities, mutual funds and fixed-
income securities.

Margin loans

Margin loan exposure of $17.6 billion at March 31, 2024
and $18.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2023 was collateralized with
marketable securities. Borrowers are required to maintain a
daily collateral margin in excess of 100% of the value of
the loan. Margin loans included $8 billion at March 31,
2024 and $7 billion at Dec. 31, 2023 related to a term loan
program that offers fully collateralized loans to broker-
dealers.

Allowance for credit losses

Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade clients who are active users of our non-credit services. Our primary exposure
to the credit risk of a customer consists of funded loans, unfunded contractual commitments to lend, standby letters of credit
and overdrafts associated with our custody and securities clearance businesses.

(a)    Includes allowance for credit losses on federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements, available-for-sale securities, held-to-

maturity securities, accounts receivable, cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits with banks.

The provision for credit losses was $27 million in the first
quarter of 2024, primarily driven by reserve increases
related to commercial real estate exposure.

The allowance for loan losses and the allowance for
lending-related commitments represent

management’s estimate of lifetime expected losses in our
credit portfolio. This evaluation process is subject to
numerous estimates and judgments. To the extent actual
results differ from forecasts or management’s judgment,
the allowance for credit losses may be greater or less than
future charge-offs.

(a)    The allowance allocated to margin loans, overdrafts and other loans was insignificant at March 31, 2024, Dec. 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023.

The allocation of the allowance for credit losses is
inherently judgmental, and the entire allowance for credit
losses is available to absorb credit losses regardless of the
nature of the losses.

Our allowance for credit losses is sensitive to a number of
inputs, most notably the macroeconomic forecast
assumptions that are incorporated into our estimate of
credit losses through the expected life of the loan portfolio,
as well as the credit ratings assigned to each borrower. As
the macroeconomic environment and related forecasts
change, the allowance for credit losses may change
materially. The following sensitivity analyses do not
represent management’s expectations of the deterioration
of our portfolios or the economic environment, but are
provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity
of the allowance for credit losses to changes in key inputs.
If commercial real estate property values were increased
10% and all other credits were rated one grade better, the
quantitative allowance would have decreased by $44
million, and if commercial real estate property values were
decreased 10% and all other credits were rated one grade
worse, the quantitative allowance would have increased by
$83 million. Our multi-scenario-based macroeconomic
forecast used in determining the March 31, 2024 allowance
for credit losses consisted of three scenarios. The baseline
scenario reflects stable GDP growth, slightly increasing
unemployment and declining commercial real estate prices
through the end of 2024. The upside scenario reflects faster
GDP growth, declining unemployment through the third
quarter of 2024 before moderating and stable commercial
real estate prices through the fourth quarter of 2024
compared with the baseline.

The downside scenario contemplates negative GDP growth
and rapidly increasing unemployment through 2024 and
sharply lower commercial real estate prices than the
baseline. At March 31, 2024, we placed the most weight on
our baseline scenario, with the remaining weighting placed
on the upside and downside scenarios. From a sensitivity
perspective, at March 31, 2024, if we had applied 100%
weighting to the downside scenario, the allowance for
credit losses would have been approximately $104 million
higher.

Nonperforming assets were $278 million at March 31,
2024, an increase of $41 million, compared with $237
million at Dec. 31, 2023. The increase primarily reflects
higher nonperforming commercial real estate loans.

Deposits

Total deposits were $309.0 billion at March 31, 2024, an
increase of 9%, compared with $283.7 billion at Dec. 31,
2023. The increase primarily reflects higher interest-
bearing deposits in U.S. offices and noninterest-bearing
deposits (principally U.S. offices).

Noninterest-bearing deposits were $63.4 billion at March
31, 2024, compared with $58.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.
Interest-bearing deposits were primarily demand deposits
and totaled $245.6 billion at March 31, 2024, compared
with $225.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.

Short-term borrowings

We fund ourselves primarily through deposits and, to a
lesser extent, other short-term borrowings and long-term
debt. Short-term borrowings consist of federal funds
purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, payables to customers and broker-dealers,
commercial paper and other borrowed funds. Certain short-
term borrowings, for example, securities sold under
repurchase agreements, require the delivery of securities as
collateral.

Federal funds purchased and securities sold under
repurchase agreements include repurchase agreement
activity with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation
(“FICC”), where we record interest expense on a gross
basis, but the ending and average balances reflect the
impact of offsetting under enforceable netting agreements.
This activity primarily relates to government securities
collateralized resale and repurchase agreements executed
with clients that are novated to and settle with the FICC.

Payables to customers and broker-dealers represent funds
awaiting reinvestment and short sale proceeds payable on
demand. Payables to customers and broker-dealers are
driven by customer trading activity and market volatility.

The Bank of New York Mellon may issue commercial
paper that matures within 397 days from

the date of issue and is not redeemable prior to maturity or
subject to voluntary prepayment.

Other borrowed funds primarily include borrowings from
the Federal Home Loan Bank, overdrafts of sub-custodian
account balances in our Securities Services businesses,
finance lease liabilities and borrowings under lines of
credit by our Pershing subsidiaries. Overdrafts typically
relate to timing differences for settlements.

Liquidity and dividends

BNY Mellon defines liquidity as the ability of the Parent
and its subsidiaries to access funding or convert assets to
cash quickly and efficiently, or to roll over or issue new
debt, especially during periods of market stress, at a
reasonable cost, and in order to meet its short-term (up to
one year) obligations. Funding liquidity risk is the risk that
BNY Mellon cannot meet its cash and collateral
obligations at a reasonable cost for both expected and
unexpected cash flow and collateral needs without
adversely affecting daily operations or our financial
condition. Funding liquidity risk can arise from funding
mismatches, market constraints from the inability to
convert assets into cash, the inability to hold or raise cash,
low overnight deposits, deposit run-off or contingent
liquidity events.

Changes in economic conditions or exposure to credit,
market, operational, legal and reputational risks also can
affect BNY Mellon’s liquidity risk profile and are
considered in our liquidity risk framework. For additional
information, see “Risk Management – Liquidity Risk” in
our 2023 Annual Report.

The Parent’s policy is to have access to sufficient
unencumbered cash and cash equivalents at each quarter-
end to cover maturities and other forecasted debt
redemptions, net interest payments and net tax payments
for the following 18-month period, and to provide
sufficient collateral to satisfy transactions subject to
Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.

We monitor and control liquidity exposures and funding
needs within and across significant legal entities, branches,
currencies and business lines, taking into account, among
other factors, any applicable restrictions on the transfer of
liquidity among entities.

BNY Mellon 29

BNY Mellon also manages potential intraday liquidity
risks. We monitor and manage intraday liquidity against
existing and expected intraday liquid resources (such as
cash balances, remaining intraday credit capacity, intraday
contingency funding and available collateral) to enable
BNY Mellon to meet its intraday obligations under normal
and reasonably severe stressed conditions.

We define available funds for internal liquidity
management purposes as cash and due from banks,
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and
other central banks, interest-bearing deposits with banks
and federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements.

The following table presents our total available funds at period end and on an average basis.

Total available funds were $164.8 billion at March 31,
2024, compared with $157.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. The
increase was primarily due to higher interest-bearing
deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks.

Average non-core sources of funds, such as federal funds
purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, trading liabilities, other borrowed funds and
commercial paper, were $18.3 billion for the first three
months of 2024, compared with $22.1 billion for the first
three months of 2023. The decrease primarily reflects
lower federal funds purchased and securities sold under
repurchase agreements and trading liabilities.

Average interest-bearing domestic deposits were $138.3
billion for the first three months of 2024, compared with
$112.8 billion for the first three months of 2023. Average
interest-bearing foreign deposits, primarily from our
European-based businesses included in the Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services segments, were
$90.6 billion for the first three months of 2024, compared
with $91.3 billion for the first three months of 2023. The
changes primarily reflect client activity.

30 BNY Mellon

Average payables to customers and broker-dealers were
$12.4 billion for the first three months of 2024 and $17.0
billion for the first three months of 2023. Payables to
customers and broker-dealers are driven by customer
trading activity and market volatility.

Average long-term debt was $31.1 billion for the first three
months of 2024 and $30.2 billion for the first three months
of 2023.

Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased to $49.9
billion for the first three months of 2024 from $69.9 billion
for the first three months of 2023, primarily reflecting
client activity.

A significant reduction of client activity in our Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services business
segments would reduce our access to deposits. See
“Asset/liability management” for additional factors that
could impact our deposit balances.

Sources of liquidity

The Parent’s major sources of liquidity are access to the
debt and equity markets, dividends from its subsidiaries,
and cash on hand and cash otherwise made available in
business-as-usual circumstances to the Parent through a
committed credit facility with our intermediate holding
company (“IHC”).

Our ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms, or at all, is partially dependent on our credit ratings, which are as
follows:

Long-term debt totaled $32.4 billion at March 31, 2024
and $31.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Issuances of $2.5
billion were partially offset by maturities and redemptions
totaling $1.2 billion and a decrease in the fair value of
hedged long-term debt. Long-term debt of $3.7 billion will
mature in the remainder of 2024.

The Bank of New York Mellon may issue notes and
certificates of deposit (“CDs”). At March 31, 2024 and
Dec. 31, 2023, $1.8 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively,
of notes were outstanding. At March 31, 2024 and Dec. 31,
2023, $862 million and $397 million, respectively, of CDs
were outstanding.

The Bank of New York Mellon also issues commercial
paper that matures within 397 days from the date of issue
and is not redeemable prior to maturity or subject to
voluntary prepayment. There was no commercial paper
outstanding at March 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023. The
average commercial paper outstanding was $8 million for
the first three months of 2024. There was no average
commercial paper outstanding for the first three months of
2023.

Subsequent to March 31, 2024, our U.S. bank subsidiaries
could declare dividends to the Parent of approximately
$1.3 billion, without the need for a

regulatory waiver. In addition, at March 31, 2024, non-
bank subsidiaries of the Parent had liquid assets of
approximately $4.4 billion. Restrictions on our ability to
obtain funds from our subsidiaries are discussed in more
detail in “Supervision and Regulation – Capital Planning
and Stress Testing – Payment of Dividends, Stock
Repurchases and Other Capital Distributions” and in Note
19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, both
in our 2023 Annual Report.

Pershing LLC has one uncommitted line of credit in place
for funding purposes that is guaranteed by the Parent for
$300 million. There were no borrowings under this line in
the first quarter of 2024. Pershing Limited, an indirect UK-
based subsidiary of BNY Mellon, has two separate
uncommitted lines of credit amounting to $258 million in
aggregate. Average borrowings under these lines were less
than $1 million in the first quarter of 2024.

The double leverage ratio is the ratio of our equity
investment in subsidiaries divided by our consolidated
Parent company equity, which includes our noncumulative
perpetual preferred stock. In short, the double leverage
ratio measures the extent to which equity in subsidiaries is
financed by Parent

  
 
BNY Mellon 31

company debt. As the double leverage ratio increases, this
can reflect greater demands on a company’s cash flows in
order to service interest payments and debt maturities.
BNY Mellon’s double leverage ratio is managed in a range
considering the high level of unencumbered available
liquid assets held in its principal subsidiaries (such as
central bank deposit placements and government
securities), the Company’s cash generating fee-based
business model, with fee revenue representing 73% of total
revenue in the first quarter of 2024, and the dividend
capacity of our banking subsidiaries. Our double leverage
ratio was 121.2% at March 31, 2024 and 120.5% at Dec.
31, 2023, and within the range targeted by management.

Uses of funds

The Parent’s major uses of funds are repurchases of
common stock, payment of dividends, principal and
interest payments on its borrowings, acquisitions and
additional investments in its subsidiaries.

In February 2024, a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per
common share was paid to common shareholders. Our
common stock dividend payout ratio was 34% for the first
quarter of 2024.

In the first quarter of 2024, we repurchased 17.9 million
common shares at an average price of $55.30 per common
share, for a total cost of $988 million.

Liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”)

U.S. regulators have established an LCR that requires
certain banking organizations, including BNY Mellon, to
maintain a minimum amount of unencumbered high-
quality liquid assets (“HQLA”) sufficient to withstand the
net cash outflow under a hypothetical standardized acute
liquidity stress scenario for a 30-day time horizon.

The following table presents BNY Mellon’s consolidated
HQLA, and the average HQLA and average LCR. The
LCR for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 117%

first quarter of 2024.

BNY Mellon and each of our affected domestic bank
subsidiaries were compliant with the U.S. LCR
requirements of at least 100% throughout the first quarter
of 2024.

Net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”)

The NSFR is a liquidity requirement applicable to large
U.S. banking organizations, including BNY Mellon. The
NSFR is expressed as a ratio of the available stable funding
to the required stable funding amount over a one-year
horizon. Our average consolidated NSFR was 136% for the
first quarter of 2024 and 135% for the fourth quarter of
2023.

BNY Mellon and each of our affected domestic bank
subsidiaries were compliant with the NSFR requirement of
at least 100% throughout the first quarter of 2024.

Statement of cash flows

The following summarizes the activity reflected on the
consolidated statement of cash flows. While this
information may be helpful to highlight certain macro
trends and business strategies, the cash flow analysis may
not be as relevant when analyzing changes in our net
earnings and net assets. We believe that in addition to the
traditional cash flow analysis, the discussion related to
liquidity and dividends and asset/liability management
herein may provide more useful context in evaluating our
liquidity position and related activity.

Net cash used for operating activities was $2.7 billion in
the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared with
net cash provided by operating activities of $1.8 billion in
the three months ended March 31, 2023. In

the three months ended March 31, 2024, cash flows used
for operations primarily resulted from changes in trading
assets and liabilities and changes in accruals and other, net,
partially offset by earnings. In the three months ended
March 31, 2023, cash flows provided by operations
primarily resulted from changes in trading assets and
liabilities and earnings, partially offset by changes in
accruals and other, net.

Net cash used for investing activities was $26.7 billion in
the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared with
$17.8 billion in the three months ended March 31, 2023. In
the three months ended March 31, 2024, net cash used for
investing activities primarily resulted from changes in
securities, interest-bearing deposits with the Federal
Reserve and other central banks and loans. In the three
months ended

Capital

Capital data

March 31, 2023, net cash used for investing activities
primarily resulted from changes in interest-bearing
deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks,
partially offset by net changes in securities and loans.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $28.4 billion
in the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared with
$14.4 billion in the three months ended March 31, 2023. In
the three months ended March 31, 2024, net cash provided
by financing activities primarily resulted from changes in
deposits. In the three months ended March 31, 2023, net
cash provided by financing activities primarily resulted
from changes in federal funds purchased and securities
sold under repurchase agreements.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total
shareholders’ equity decreased to $40.6 billion at March
31, 2024 from $40.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. The decrease
primarily reflects common stock repurchase activity and
dividends, partially offset by earnings.

The unrealized loss (after-tax) on our available-for-sale
securities portfolio, net of hedges, included in accumulated
other comprehensive income was $1.5 billion at March 31,
2024, compared with $1.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Net
unrealized loss, including the

impact of hedges, decreased as securities moved closer to
maturity, partially offset by the impact of higher interest
rates.

In the first quarter of 2024, we repurchased 17.9 million
common shares at an average price of $55.30 per common
share for a total cost of $988 million.

In January 2023, we announced a share repurchase
program approved by our Board of Directors providing for
the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of common shares
beginning Jan. 1, 2023. This share

BNY Mellon 33

repurchase plan replaced all previously authorized share
repurchase plans.

In April 2024, we announced a new authorization
providing for the repurchase of $6.0 billion of common
shares in addition to any remaining capacity under the
existing January 2023 authorization.

Capital adequacy

Regulators establish certain levels of capital for bank
holding companies (“BHCs”) and banks, including BNY
Mellon and our bank subsidiaries, in accordance with
established quantitative measurements. For the Parent to
maintain its status as a financial holding company, our U.S.
bank subsidiaries and BNY Mellon must, among other
things, qualify as “well capitalized.” As of March 31, 2024
and Dec. 31, 2023, BNY Mellon and our U.S. bank
subsidiaries were “well capitalized.” Failure to satisfy
regulatory standards, including “well

capitalized” status or capital adequacy rules more
generally, could result in limitations on our activities and
adversely affect our financial condition. See the discussion
of these matters in “Supervision and Regulation –
Regulated Entities of BNY Mellon and Ancillary
Regulatory Requirements” and “Risk Factors – Capital and
Liquidity Risk – Failure to satisfy regulatory standards,
including “well capitalized” and “well managed” status or
capital adequacy and liquidity rules more generally, could
result in limitations on our activities and adversely affect
our business and financial condition,” both of which are in
our 2023 Annual Report.

The U.S. banking agencies’ capital rules are based on the
framework adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision, as amended from time to time. For additional
information on these capital requirements, see
“Supervision and Regulation” in our 2023 Annual Report.

Our CET1 ratio under the Standardized Approach was
10.8% at March 31, 2024 and 11.5% at Dec. 31, 2023
under the Advanced Approaches. The decrease was driven
by higher period-end risk-weighted assets, common stock
repurchases and dividends, partially offset by capital
generated through earnings.

The Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.9% at March 31, 2024 and
6.0% at Dec. 31, 2023. The decrease reflects common
stock repurchases and dividends and higher average assets,
partially offset by capital generated through earnings.

Risk-based capital ratios vary depending on the size of the
balance sheet at period end and the levels and types of
investments in assets, and leverage ratios vary based on the
average size of the balance sheet over the quarter. The
balance sheet size fluctuates from period to period based
on levels of customer and market activity. In general, when
servicing clients are more actively trading securities,
deposit balances and the balance sheet as a whole are
higher. In addition, when markets experience significant
volatility or stress, our balance sheet size may increase
considerably as client deposit levels increase.

Our capital ratios are necessarily subject to, among other
things, anticipated compliance with all necessary
enhancements to model calibration, approval by regulators
of certain models used as part of RWA calculations, other
refinements, further implementation guidance from
regulators, market practices and standards and any changes
BNY Mellon may make to its businesses. As a
consequence of these factors, our capital ratios may
materially change, and may be volatile over time and from
period to period.

Under the Advanced Approaches, our operational loss risk
model is informed by external losses, including fines and
penalties levied against institutions in the financial services
industry, particularly those that relate to businesses in
which we operate, and as a result, external losses have
impacted and could in the future impact the amount of
capital that we are required to hold.

RWAs.

In July 2023, the Federal Reserve announced that BNY
Mellon’s SCB requirement would remain at 2.5%, equal to
the regulatory floor, for the period from Oct. 1, 2023
through Sept. 30, 2024. The SCB replaced the static 2.5%
capital conservation buffer for Standardized Approach
capital ratios for CCAR BHCs. The SCB does not apply to
bank subsidiaries, which remain subject to the static 2.5%
capital conservation buffer. See “Supervision and
Regulation” in our 2023 Annual Report for additional
information.

The SCB final rule generally eliminates the requirement
for prior approval of common stock repurchases in excess
of the distributions in a firm’s capital plan, provided that
such distributions are consistent with applicable capital
requirements and buffers, including the SCB.

VaR represents a key risk management measure, and it is
important to note the inherent limitations to VaR, which
include:

• VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer time

horizons where moves may be extreme;

• VaR does not take into account the potential variability

of market liquidity; and

• Previous moves in market risk factors may not produce

accurate predictions of all future market moves.

See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information on the VaR
methodology.

The following tables indicate the calculated VaR amounts
for the trading portfolio for the designated periods using
the historical simulation VaR model.

If BNY Mellon maintains risk-based ratio or leverage
TLAC measures above the minimum required level, but
with a risk-based ratio or leverage below the minimum
level with buffers, we will face constraints on dividends,
equity repurchases and discretionary executive
compensation based on the amount of the shortfall and
eligible retained income.

Trading activities and risk management

Our trading activities are focused on acting as a market-
maker for our customers, facilitating customer trades and
risk-mitigating hedging in compliance with the Volcker
Rule. The risk from market-making activities for customers
is managed by our traders and limited in total exposure
through a system of position limits, value-at-risk (“VaR”)
methodology and other market sensitivity measures. VaR is
the potential loss in value due to adverse market
movements over a defined time horizon with a specified
confidence level. The calculation of our VaR used by
management and presented below assumes a one-day
holding period, utilizes a 99% confidence level and
incorporates non-linear product characteristics. VaR
facilitates comparisons across portfolios of different risk
characteristics. VaR also captures the diversification of
aggregated risk at the firm-wide level.

The interest rate component of VaR represents instruments
whose values are predominantly driven by interest rate
levels. These instruments include, but are not limited to,
U.S. Treasury securities, swaps, swaptions, forward rate
agreements, exchange-traded futures and options, and other
interest rate derivative products.

The foreign exchange component of VaR represents
instruments whose values predominantly vary with the
level or volatility of currency exchange rates or interest
rates. These instruments include, but are not limited to,
currency balances, spot and forward transactions, currency
options and other currency derivative products.

The equity component of VaR consists of instruments that
represent an ownership interest in the form of domestic and
foreign common stock or other equity-linked instruments.
These instruments include, but are not limited to, common
stock, exchange-traded funds, preferred stock, listed equity
options (puts and calls), OTC equity options, equity total
return swaps, equity index futures and other equity
derivative products.

The credit component of VaR represents instruments whose
values are predominantly driven by credit spread levels,
i.e., idiosyncratic default risk. These instruments include,
but are not limited to, single issuer credit default swaps,
and securities with exposures from corporate and
municipal credit spreads.

The diversification component of VaR is the risk reduction
benefit that occurs when combining portfolios and
offsetting positions, and from the correlated behavior of
risk factor movements.

During the first quarter of 2024, interest rate risk generated
41% of average gross VaR, foreign exchange risk
generated 36% of average gross VaR, credit risk generated
21% of average gross VaR and equity risk generated 2% of
average gross. During the first quarter of 2024, our daily
trading loss did not exceed our calculated VaR amount of
the overall portfolio.

The following table of total daily trading revenue or loss
illustrates the number of trading days in which our trading
revenue or loss fell within particular ranges during the past
five quarters.

(a)    Trading revenue (loss) includes realized and unrealized gains and losses
primarily related to spot and forward foreign exchange transactions,

derivatives and securities trades for our customers and excludes any
associated commissions, underwriting fees and net interest income.

Trading assets include debt and equity instruments and
derivative assets, primarily foreign exchange and interest
rate contracts, not designated as hedging instruments.
Trading assets were $10.1 billion at March 31, 2024 and
Dec. 31, 2023.

Trading liabilities include debt and equity instruments and
derivative liabilities, primarily foreign exchange and
interest rate contracts, not designated as hedging
instruments. Trading liabilities were $3.1 billion at March
31, 2024 and $6.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.

Under our fair value methodology for derivative contracts,
an initial “risk-neutral” valuation is performed on each
position assuming time discounting based on a AA credit
curve. In addition, we consider credit risk in arriving at the
fair value of our derivatives.

We reflect external credit ratings as well as observable
credit default swap spreads for both ourselves and our
counterparties when measuring the fair value of our
derivative positions. Accordingly, the valuation of our
derivative positions is sensitive to the current changes in
our own credit spreads, as well as those of our
counterparties.

At March 31, 2024, our OTC derivative assets, including
those in hedging relationships, of $1.7 billion included a
credit valuation adjustment (“CVA”) deduction of $13
million. Our OTC derivative liabilities, including those in
hedging relationships, of $1.7 billion included a debit
valuation adjustment (“DVA”) of $5 million related to our
own credit spread. Net of hedges, the CVA and DVA were
unchanged in the first quarter of 2024, which resulted in no
impact to investment and other revenue – other trading
revenue. The net impact decreased investment and other
revenue – other

trading revenue by $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023
and increased investment and other revenue – other trading
revenue by $1 million in the first quarter of 2023.

The table below summarizes our exposure, net of collateral
related to our derivative counterparties, as determined on
an internal risk management basis. Significant changes in
counterparty credit ratings could alter the level of credit
risk faced by BNY Mellon.

Asset/liability management

Our diversified business activities include processing
securities, accepting deposits, investing in securities,
lending, raising money as needed to fund assets and other
transactions. The market risks from these activities include
interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. Our primary
market risk is exposure to movements in U.S. dollar
interest rates and certain foreign currency interest rates. We
actively manage interest rate sensitivity and use earnings
simulation and discounted cash flow models to identify
interest rate exposures.

An earnings simulation model is the primary tool used to
assess changes in pre-tax net interest income between a
baseline scenario and hypothetical interest rate scenarios.
Interest rate sensitivity is quantified by calculating the
change in pre-tax net interest income between the scenarios
over a 12-month measurement period.

The baseline scenario incorporates the market’s forward
rate expectations and management’s assumptions regarding
client deposit rates, credit spreads, changes in the
prepayment behavior of loans and securities and the impact
of derivative financial instruments used for interest rate
risk management purposes as of each respective quarter-
end. These assumptions have been developed through a

combination of historical analysis and future expected
pricing behavior and are inherently uncertain. Actual
results may differ materially from projected results due to
timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes,
and changes in market conditions and management’s
strategies, among other factors. Client deposit levels and
mix are key assumptions impacting net interest income in
the baseline as well as the hypothetical interest rate
scenarios. The earnings simulation model assumes static
deposit levels and mix, and it also assumes that no
management actions will be taken to mitigate the effects of
interest rate changes. Typically, the baseline scenario uses
the average deposit balances of the quarter.

In the table below, we use the earnings simulation model to
assess the impact of various hypothetical interest rate
scenarios compared to the baseline scenario. In each of the
scenarios, all currencies’ interest rates are instantaneously
shifted higher or lower at the start of the forecast. Long-
term interest rates are defined as all tenors equal to or
greater than three years and short-term interest rates are
defined as all tenors equal to or less than three months.
Interim term points are interpolated where applicable. The
impact of interest rate shifts may not be linear. The results
of this earnings simulation should therefore not be
extrapolated for more severe interest rate scenarios than
those presented in the table below.

for BNY Mellon.

At March 31, 2024, the change in impact of a 100 bps
upward or downward shift in rates on net interest income
compared with Dec. 31, 2023 was primarily driven by a
slight increase in fixed-rate assets, lower noninterest-
bearing deposits and more rate sensitive deposit balances.

BNY Mellon 39

While the net interest income sensitivity scenario
calculations assume static deposit balances to facilitate
consistent period-over-period comparisons, net interest
income is impacted by changes in deposit balances.
Noninterest-bearing deposits are particularly sensitive to
changes in short-term rates.

To illustrate the net interest income sensitivity to deposit
run-off, we estimate that a $5 billion instantaneous
reduction/increase in U.S. dollar-denominated noninterest-
bearing deposits would reduce/increase the net interest
income sensitivity results in the up 100 basis point scenario
in the table above by approximately $300 million. The
impact would be smaller if the run-off was assumed to be a
mixture of interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing
deposits.

Additionally, during periods of low short-term interest
rates, money market mutual fund fees and other similar
fees are typically waived to protect investors from negative
returns.

For a discussion of factors impacting the growth or
contraction of deposits, see “Risk Factors – Capital and
Liquidity Risk – Our business, financial condition and
results of operations could be adversely affected if we do
not effectively manage our liquidity” in our 2023 Annual
Report.

Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP
and Non-GAAP financial measures

BNY Mellon has included in this Form 10-Q certain Non-
GAAP financial measures on a tangible basis as a
supplement to GAAP information, which exclude goodwill
and intangible assets, net of deferred tax liabilities. We
believe that the return on tangible common equity – Non-
GAAP is additional useful information for investors
because it presents a measure of those assets that can
generate income, and the tangible book value per common
share – Non-GAAP is additional useful information
because it presents the level of tangible assets in relation to
shares of common stock outstanding.

BNY Mellon has also included revenue measures
excluding notable items, including the reduction in the fair
value of a contingent consideration receivable related to a
prior year divestiture and disposal losses. Expense
measures, excluding notable items, including the FDIC
special assessment, severance expense and litigation
reserves, are also presented. Litigation reserves represent
accruals for loss contingencies that are both probable and
reasonably estimable, but exclude standard business-
related legal fees. Net income applicable to common
shareholders of The Bank of New York Mellon
Corporation, diluted earnings per share, return on common
equity, return on tangible common equity and pre-tax
operating

margin, excluding the notable items mentioned above, are
also provided. These measures are provided to permit
investors to view the financial measures on a basis
consistent with how management views the businesses.

The presentation of the growth rates of investment
management and performance fees on a constant currency
basis permits investors to assess the significance of
changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Growth rates
on a constant currency basis were determined by applying
the current period foreign currency exchange rates to the
prior period revenue. We believe that this presentation, as a
supplement to GAAP information, gives investors a clearer
picture of the related revenue results without the variability
caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

BNY Mellon has also included the adjusted pre-tax
operating margin – Non-GAAP, which is the pre-tax
operating margin for the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment, net of distribution and
servicing expense that was passed to third parties who
distribute or service our managed funds. We believe that
this measure is useful when evaluating the performance of
the Investment and Wealth Management business segment
relative to industry competitors.

Recent accounting and regulatory developments

Recent regulatory and other developments

Recent accounting developments

The following accounting guidance issued by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) has not yet been
adopted as of March 31, 2024.

For a summary of additional regulatory matters relevant to
our operations, see “Supervision and Regulation” in our
2023 Annual Report. The following discussion summarizes
certain regulatory, legislative and other developments that
may affect BNY Mellon.

ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280):
Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures

SEC Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related
Disclosures for Investors Rule

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07,
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to
Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires a public
entity to disclose, on an annual and interim basis,
significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to
the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and
included within each reported measure of segment profit or
loss (collectively referred to as the “significant expense
principle”). In addition, disclosure will be required of the
title and position of CODM, and how the CODM uses the
reported measure of segment profit or loss in assessing
segment performance and deciding how to allocate
resources.

This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after
Dec. 15, 2023 with early adoption permitted. BNY Mellon
is currently evaluating this guidance and the impact on the
business segment disclosures.

ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to
Income Tax Disclosures

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income
Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax
Disclosures, which requires a company to disclose, on an
annual basis, additional disaggregated information related
to the existing disclosures for the effective income tax rate
reconciliation and income taxes paid.

This ASU is effective on a prospective basis, with a
retrospective option, for annual periods beginning after
Dec. 15, 2024, and interim periods within fiscal years
beginning after Dec. 15, 2025. BNY Mellon is currently
evaluating this guidance and the impact on the income tax
disclosures.

On March 6, 2024, the SEC adopted its final climate-risk
disclosure rule, which it first proposed in March 2022. The
final rule is currently subject to multiple legal challenges
and, on April 4, 2024, the SEC voluntarily issued an order
staying the final rule pending the completion of judicial
review of the legal challenges. If effective, the final rule
would require registrants to disclose material climate-
related information in registration statements and periodic
reports, with a phased-in compliance period that varies
based on disclosure content and for BNY Mellon would
begin for the year-ended Dec. 31, 2025. We are assessing
the developments and the potential impact of the final rule.

European and UK Financial Markets and Market
Infrastructure

The EU and the UK have embarked on changes to their
financial markets and market infrastructure regulations. In
the EU, this is being effected by amendments to Markets in
Financial Instruments Directive II and Markets in Financial
Instruments Regulation, the amending instruments for
which entered into force on March 28, 2024 (with
secondary legislation to follow). In the UK, this is being
undertaken by the UK Financial Conduct Authority
pursuant to the UK Government’s Edinburgh Reforms (a
series of measures to promote stability and competitive
growth in the UK financial markets post-Brexit), and
pursuant to the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023.
These changes will in particular affect transaction reporting
and market transparency obligations, as well as laying the
ground for the establishment of consolidated tape providers
to collate market data and provide a standardized electronic
data feed in the equity and debt secondary markets. BNY
Mellon will continue to monitor the practical impacts of
these rules as further details emerge.

EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive

Website information

On March 15, 2024, EU lawmakers approved an amended
version of the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence
Directive (as amended, “CSDDD”), which the European
Parliament approved on April 24, 2024. The final rules are
subject to adoption by the European Council, with
publication of the approved CSDDD in the Official Journal
of the EU and entry into force expected in or around the
third quarter of 2024. CSDDD is likely to impact BNYM
given that under the CSDDD, large EU companies and
non-EU companies with significant EU activity, will be
required to comply with due diligence obligations
(including preventing and mitigating potential adverse
human rights and environmental impacts as well as ending,
and minimizing the extent of, actual adverse impacts) for
their operations and for their upstream chains of activities
(a regulated financial undertaking’s chain of activities with
downstream business partners that are receiving services
and products are not in scope of CSDDD). Companies are
also required to adopt a transition plan for climate change
mitigation which aims to ensure, through best efforts,
compatibility of the business model and strategy of the
company with the transition to a sustainable economy and
with the limiting of global warming to 1.5°C. CSDDD will
be implemented on a phased-in basis starting three years
after CSDDD’s entry into force, dependent on a company’s
number of employees and net worldwide or EU turnover,
with first reporting expected for financial years starting on
or after Jan. 1, 2028. We are assessing the potential impact
of the regulation.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1–Basis of presentation

In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, references to
“our,” “we,” “us,” “BNY Mellon,” the “Company” and
similar terms refer to The Bank of New York Mellon
Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. The term
“Parent” refers to The Bank of New York Mellon
Corporation but not to its subsidiaries.

Basis of presentation

The accounting and financial reporting policies of BNY
Mellon, a global financial services company, conform to
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)
and prevailing industry practices. For information on our
significant accounting and reporting policies, see Note 1 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31,
2023 (the “2023 Annual Report”).

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are
unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
necessary, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, for a
fair presentation of financial position, results of operations
and cash flows for the periods presented have been made.
These financial statements should be read in conjunction
with our Consolidated Financial Statements included in our
2023 Annual Report.

On Jan. 1, 2024, we adopted Accounting Standards Update
(“ASU”) 2023-02, Investments—Equity Method and Joint
Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax
Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization
Method on a retrospective basis for our investments in
renewable energy projects that have met the eligibility
criteria, and restated prior period financial statements. See
Note 2 for additional information.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates based
upon assumptions about future economic and market
conditions which affect reported amounts and related
disclosures in our

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

financial statements. Although our current estimates
contemplate current conditions and how we expect them to
change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual
conditions could be worse than anticipated in those
estimates, which could materially affect our results of
operations and financial condition.

Note 2–New accounting guidance

The following accounting guidance was adopted on Jan. 1,
2024.

ASU 2023-02, Investments—Equity Method and Joint
Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax
Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization
Method

In March 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued ASU 2023-02, Investments—Equity
Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for
Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the
Proportional Amortization Method, which permits
reporting entities to elect to account for their tax equity
investments, regardless of the tax credit program from
which the income tax credits are received, using the
proportional amortization method if certain conditions are
met. Under the proportional amortization method, an entity
amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to
the income tax credits and other income tax benefits
received, and recognizes the net amortization and income
tax credits and other income tax benefits in the income
statement as a component of the provision for income
taxes.

We adopted this guidance on Jan.1, 2024. The impact of
adopting this new guidance for our renewable energy
investments that met the eligibility criteria was an increase
in investment and other revenue and an increase in the
provision for income taxes on the consolidated income
statement. Renewable energy investments are recorded in
other assets on the balance sheet. In the first quarter of
2024, we restated the prior period financial statements to
reflect the impact of the retrospective application of the
new accounting guidance. The required disclosures are
included in Note 7.

Note 3–Acquisitions and dispositions

We sometimes structure our acquisitions and divestitures
with both an initial payment or receipt and later contingent
payments or receipts tied to post-closing revenue or
income growth.

At March 31, 2024, we are potentially obligated to pay
additional consideration which is recorded at fair value
totaling approximately $20 million and, using reasonable
assumptions and estimates, could range from $15 million
to $20 million over the next year.

Contingent payments totaled $5 million in the first three
months of 2024 and we recorded $1 million of increases to
contingent earnout payables reflected in other expense.

At March 31, 2024, we could potentially receive additional
consideration which is recorded at fair value totaling
approximately $30 million and, using reasonable
assumptions and estimates, could range from $20 million
to $45 million over the next four years. There were no
contingent receipts in the first three months of 2024.

Allowance for credit losses – Securities

The allowance for credit losses related to securities was
$1 million at March 31, 2024 and $1 million at Dec. 31,
2023, and relates to non-agency RMBS and other debt
securities.

At March 31, 2024, the gross unrealized losses on the
securities portfolio were primarily attributable to an
increase in interest rates from the date of purchase, and for
certain securities that were transferred from available-for-
sale to held-to-maturity, an increase in interest rates
through the date they were transferred. Specifically, $138
million of the unrealized losses at March 31, 2024 and
$146 million at Dec. 31, 2023 reflected in the tables below
relate to certain securities that were previously transferred
from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity. As the transfers
created a new cost basis for the securities, if these
securities have experienced unrealized losses since the date
of transfer, the corresponding unrealized losses would be
reflected in the held-to-maturity securities portfolio in the
following tables.

The following tables show the aggregate fair value of available-for-sale securities with a continuous unrealized loss position for
less than 12 months and those that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or more without an
allowance for credit losses.

The following tables show the credit quality of the held-to-maturity securities. We have included certain credit ratings
information because the information can indicate the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed. Significant changes in
ratings classifications could indicate increased credit risk for us and could be accompanied by an increase in the allowance for
credit losses and/or a reduction in the fair value of our securities portfolio.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Pledged assets

Restricted cash and securities

At March 31, 2024, BNY Mellon had pledged assets of
$145 billion, including $96 billion pledged as collateral for
potential borrowings at the Federal Reserve Discount
Window and $9 billion pledged as collateral for borrowing
at the Federal Home Loan Bank. The components of the
assets pledged at March 31, 2024 included $127 billion of
securities, $13 billion of loans, $4 billion of trading assets
and $1 billion of interest-bearing deposits with banks.

If there has been no borrowing at the Federal Reserve
Discount Window, the Federal Reserve generally allows
banks to freely move assets in and out of their pledged
assets account to sell or repledge the assets for other
purposes. BNY Mellon regularly moves assets in and out
of its pledged assets account at the Federal Reserve as
there have been no borrowings.

At Dec. 31, 2023, BNY Mellon had pledged assets of $134
billion, including $93 billion pledged as collateral for
potential borrowing at the Federal Reserve Discount
Window and $9 billion pledged as collateral for borrowing
at the Federal Home Loan Bank. The components of the
assets pledged at Dec. 31, 2023 included $116 billion of
securities, $13 billion of loans, $4 billion of trading assets
and $1 billion of interest-bearing deposits with banks.

At March 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, pledged assets
included $26 billion and $24 billion, respectively, for
which the recipients were permitted to sell or repledge the
assets delivered.

We also obtain securities as collateral, including receipts
under resale agreements, securities borrowed, derivative
contracts and custody agreements, on terms which permit
us to sell or repledge the securities to others. At March 31,
2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, the market value of the securities
received that can be sold or repledged was $217 billion and
$212 billion, respectively. We routinely sell or repledge
these securities through delivery to third parties. As of
March 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, the market value of
securities collateral sold or repledged was $197 billion and
$180 billion, respectively.

Cash and securities may be segregated under federal and
other regulations or requirements. At March 31, 2024 and
Dec. 31, 2023, cash segregated under federal and other
regulations or requirements was $2 billion and $3 billion,
respectively. Restricted cash is primarily included in
interest-bearing deposits with banks on the consolidated
balance sheet. Securities segregated under federal and
other regulations or requirements were $5 billion at March
31, 2024 and $3 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Restricted
securities were sourced from securities purchased under
resale agreements and are included in federal funds sold
and securities purchased under resale agreements on the
consolidated balance sheet.

Loan modifications

Modified loans are evaluated to determine whether a
modification or restructuring with a borrower experiencing
financial difficulty results in principal forgiveness, an
interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment
delay, or a term extension. The modification could result in
a new loan or a continuation of the existing loan.

In the first quarter of 2024, we modified one commercial
real estate exposure, with a recorded investment of $59
million and an unfunded lending commitment of $15
million, by extending the maturity date. We also modified
one residential

Credit quality indicators

BNY Mellon 63

mortgage loan, with an aggregate recorded investment of
less than $1 million, by providing payment modifications
and extending the maturity date.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, we modified three residential
mortgage loans, with an aggregate recorded investment of
less than $2 million, by payment modifications and
extending the maturity dates.

In the first quarter of 2023, we modified one commercial
real estate loan, with a recorded investment of $12 million,
by extending the maturity date.

Our credit strategy is to focus on investment-grade clients that are active users of our non-credit services. Each customer is
assigned an internal credit rating, which is mapped to an external rating agency grade equivalent, if possible, based upon a
number of dimensions, which are continually evaluated and may change over time. The tables below provide information about
the credit profile of the loan portfolio by the period of origination.

Commercial loans

Financial institutions

The commercial loan portfolio is divided into investment
grade and non-investment grade categories based on the
assigned internal credit ratings, which are generally
consistent with those of the public rating agencies.
Customers with ratings consistent with BBB- (S&P)/Baa3
(Moody’s) or better are considered to be investment grade.
Those clients with ratings lower than this threshold are
considered to be non-investment grade.

Commercial real estate

Our income-producing commercial real estate facilities are
focused on experienced owners and are structured with
moderate leverage based on existing cash flows. Our
commercial real estate lending activities also include
construction and renovation facilities.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Financial institution exposures are high quality, with 97%
of the exposures meeting the investment grade equivalent
criteria of our internal credit rating classification at March
31, 2024. In addition, 66% of the financial institutions
exposure is secured. For example, securities industry
clients and asset managers often borrow against marketable
securities held in custody. The exposure to financial
institutions is generally short term, with 84% expiring
within one year.

Wealth management loans

Wealth management loans are not typically rated by
external rating agencies. A majority of the wealth
management loans are secured by the customers’
investment management accounts or custody accounts.
Eligible assets pledged for these loans are typically
investment grade fixed-income securities, equities and/or
mutual funds. Internal ratings for this portion of the wealth
management loan portfolio, therefore, would equate to
investment grade external

BNY Mellon 65

ratings. Wealth management loans are provided to select
customers based on the pledge of other types of assets. For
the loans collateralized by other assets, the credit quality of
the obligor is carefully analyzed, but we do not consider
this portion of our wealth management loan portfolio to be
investment grade.

Wealth management mortgages

Credit quality indicators for wealth management mortgages
are not correlated to external ratings. Wealth management
mortgages are typically loans to high-net-worth
individuals, which are secured primarily by residential
property. These loans are primarily interest-only,
adjustable-rate mortgages with a weighted-average loan-to-
value ratio of 61% at origination. Delinquency rate is a key
indicator of credit quality in our wealth management
portfolio. At March 31, 2024, less than 1% of the
mortgages were past due.

At March 31, 2024, the wealth management mortgage
portfolio consisted of the following geographic
concentrations: California – 21%; New York – 14%;
Florida – 11%; Massachusetts – 8%; and other – 46%.

totaled $1.1 billion at March 31, 2024 and $1.2 billion at
Dec. 31, 2023. These loans are not typically correlated to
external ratings.

Capital call financing

Capital call financing includes loans to private equity funds
that are secured by the fund investors’ capital commitments
and the funds’ right to call capital.

Other loans

Other loans primarily include loans to consumers that are
fully collateralized with equities, mutual funds and fixed-
income securities.

Margin loans

We had $17.6 billion of secured margin loans at March 31,
2024, compared with $18.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.
Margin loans are collateralized with marketable securities,
and borrowers are required to maintain a daily collateral
margin in excess of 100% of the value of the loan. We have
rarely suffered a loss on these types of loans.

Lease financings

Overdrafts

At March 31, 2024, nearly all of the leasing exposure was
investment grade, or investment grade equivalent, and
consisted of exposures backed by well-diversified assets.
The largest components of our lease residual value
exposure relate to real estate and large-ticket transportation
equipment. Assets are both domestic and foreign-based,
with primary concentrations in Germany and the U.S.

Other residential mortgages

The other residential mortgages portfolio primarily consists
of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and

Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities
clearance clients and totaled $7.9 billion at March 31, 2024
and $3.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Overdrafts occur on a
daily basis and are generally repaid within two business
days.

Reverse repurchase agreements

Reverse repurchase agreements at March 31, 2024 and
Dec. 31, 2023 were fully secured with high-quality
collateral. As a result, there was no allowance for credit
losses related to these assets at March 31, 2024 and Dec.
31, 2023.

Non-readily marketable equity securities

Non-readily marketable equity securities do not have
readily determinable fair values. These investments are
valued using a measurement alternative where the
investments are carried at cost, less any impairment, and
plus or minus changes resulting from observable price
changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar
investment of the same issuer. The observable price
changes are recorded in investment and other revenue on
the consolidated income statement. Our non-readily
marketable equity securities totaled $494 million at March
31, 2024 and $479 million at Dec. 31, 2023, and are
included in other equity investments in the table above.

Tax credit investments

Tax credit investments include affordable housing projects
and renewable energy investments. We invest in affordable
housing projects primarily to satisfy the Company’s
requirements under the Community Reinvestment Act. On
Jan. 1, 2024, we adopted ASU 2023-02, Investments—
Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting
for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the
Proportional Amortization Method for our renewable
energy projects that met the eligibility criteria. See Note 2
for additional information.

Our tax credit investments totaled $2.1 billion at March 31,
2024 and $2.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Commitments to
fund future investments totaled $777 million at March 31,
2024 and $780 million at Dec. 31, 2023 and are recorded
in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. A
summary of the commitments to fund future investments is
as follows: remainder of 2024 – $283 million; 2025 – $227
million; 2026 – $92 million; 2027 – $44 million; 2028 –
$16 million; and 2029 and thereafter – $115 million.

Tax credits and other tax benefits recognized were $114
million in the first quarter of 2024, $97 million in the
fourth quarter of 2023 and $90 million in the first quarter
of 2023.

Amortization expense included in the provision for income
taxes was $92 million in the first quarter of 2024, $74
million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $73 million in the
first quarter of 2023.

Investments valued using net asset value (“NAV”) per
share

In our Investment and Wealth Management business
segment, we make seed capital investments in certain
funds we manage. We also hold private equity investments,
primarily small business investment

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

companies (“SBICs”), which are compliant with the
Volcker Rule, and certain other corporate investments.
Seed capital, private equity and other corporate
investments are included in other assets on

the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of certain of
these investments was estimated using the NAV per share
for our ownership interest in the funds.

(b)    Includes investments in funds that relate to deferred compensation arrangements with employees.
(c)    Private equity investments primarily include Volcker Rule-compliant investments in SBICs that invest in various sectors of the economy. Private equity
investments do not have redemption rights. Distributions from such investments will be received as the underlying investments in the private equity
investments, which have a life of 10 years, are liquidated.

Note 8–Contract revenue

Fee and other revenue in the Securities Services, Market
and Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth
Management business segments is primarily variable,
based on levels of assets under custody and/or
administration, assets under management and the level of
client-driven transactions, as specified in the fee schedules.
See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in our 2023 Annual Report for information on
the nature of our services and revenue recognition. See
Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
in our 2023 Annual Report for additional information on
our principal business segments — Securities Services,

Market and Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth
Management — and the primary services provided.

Disaggregation of contract revenue

Contract revenue is included in fee and other revenue on
the consolidated income statement. The following tables
present fee and other revenue related to contracts with
customers, disaggregated by type of fee revenue, for each
business segment. Business segment data has been
determined on an internal management basis of accounting,
rather than GAAP, which is used for consolidated financial
reporting.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Contract balances

Our clients are billed based on fee schedules that are
agreed upon in each customer contract. Receivables from
customers were $2.6 billion at March 31, 2024 and Dec.
31, 2023.

Contract assets represent accrued revenues that have not
yet been billed to customers due to certain contractual
terms other than the passage of time and were $48 million
at March 31, 2024 and $27 million at Dec. 31, 2023.
Accrued revenues recorded as contract assets are usually
billed on an annual basis.

Both receivables from customers and contract assets are
included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.

Contract liabilities represent payments received in advance
of providing services under certain contracts and were
$204 million at March 31, 2024 and $172 million at Dec.
31, 2023. Contract liabilities are included in other
liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Revenue
recognized in the first quarter of 2024 relating to contract
liabilities as of Dec. 31, 2023 was $55 million.

Changes in contract assets and liabilities primarily relate to
either party’s performance under the contracts.

Contract costs

Incremental costs for obtaining contracts that are deemed
recoverable are capitalized as contract costs. Such costs
result from the payment of sales

72 BNY Mellon

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

incentives, primarily in the Wealth Management business,
and totaled $52 million at March 31, 2024 and $46 million
at Dec. 31, 2023. Capitalized sales incentives are
amortized based on the transfer of goods or services to
which the assets relate. The amortization of capitalized
sales incentives, which is included in staff expense on the
consolidated income statement, totaled $3 million in the
first quarter of 2024, $4 million in the first quarter of 2023
and $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Costs to fulfill a contract are capitalized when they relate
directly to an existing contract or a specific anticipated
contract, generate or enhance resources that will be used to
fulfill performance obligations, and are recoverable. Such
costs generally represent set-up costs, which include any
direct cost incurred at the inception of a contract which
enables the fulfillment of the performance obligation, and
totaled $91 million at March 31, 2024 and $90 million at
Dec. 31, 2023. These capitalized costs are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the expected contract period.

Unsatisfied performance obligations

We do not have any unsatisfied performance obligations
other than those that are subject to a practical expedient
election under ASC 606, Revenue From Contracts With
Customers. The practical expedient election applies to (i)
contracts with an original expected length of one year or
less, and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at
the amount to which we have the right to invoice for
services performed.

In accordance with ASU 2023-02, Investments—Equity
Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for
Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the
Proportional Amortization Method, we elected to account
for investments in renewable energy projects that met the
eligibility requirement using the proportional amortization
method on a retrospective basis. Previously, we used the
hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”)

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

BNY Mellon 73

methodology to determine the pre-tax loss that is
recognized in each period. This change resulted in an
increase in investment and other revenue and an increase in
the provision for income taxes on the consolidated income
statement. For additional information, see Note 2 and Note
7.

Our total tax reserves as of March 31, 2024 were $105
million, compared with $109 million at Dec. 31, 2023. If
these tax reserves were unnecessary, $105 million would
affect the effective tax rate in future periods. We recognize
accrued interest and penalties, if applicable, related to
income taxes in income tax expense. Included in the
balance sheet at March 31, 2024 is accrued interest, where
applicable, of $33 million. The additional tax benefit
related to interest for the three months ended March 31,
2024 was $5 million, compared with $1 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2023.

It is reasonably possible the total reserve for uncertain tax
positions could decrease within the next 12 months by
approximately $10 million as a result of adjustments
related to tax years that are still subject to examination.

Our federal income tax returns are closed to examination
through 2016. Our New York State and New York City
income tax returns are closed to examination through 2014.
Our UK income tax returns are closed to examination
through 2020.

Note 12–Variable interest entities

We have variable interests in variable interest entities
(“VIEs”), which include investments in retail, institutional
and alternative investment funds.

We earn management fees from these funds, as well as
performance fees in certain funds, and may also provide
start-up capital for new funds. The funds are primarily
financed by our customers’ investments in the funds’ equity
or debt.

Additionally, we invest in qualified affordable housing and
renewable energy projects, which are designed to generate
a return primarily through the realization of tax credits.
The projects, which are structured as limited partnerships
and limited liability companies, are also VIEs, but are not
consolidated.

The following table presents the incremental assets and
liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet as of
March 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023. The net assets of any
consolidated VIE are solely available to settle the liabilities
of the VIE and to settle any investors’ ownership
liquidation requests, including any seed capital we invested
in the VIE.

We have not provided financial or other support that was
not otherwise contractually required to be provided to our
VIEs. Additionally, creditors of any consolidated VIEs do
not have any recourse to the general credit of BNY Mellon.

Non-consolidated VIEs

As of March 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, assets and
liabilities related to the VIEs where we are not the primary
beneficiary were included in other assets and other

finance subsidiary of the Parent, which will pass through
any dividend on the Series A preferred stock to the holders
of its Normal Preferred Capital Securities. The Parent’s
obligations under the trust and other agreements relating to
Mellon Capital IV

have the effect of providing a full and unconditional

Normal Preferred Capital Securities. No other subsidiary of
the Parent guarantees the securities of Mellon Capital IV.

(a)    Includes the impact of hedges of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. See Note 17 for additional information.

(b)    The reclassification adjustment related to the unrealized gain (loss) on assets available-for-sale is recorded as net securities gains (losses), which is included in

investment and other revenue on the consolidated income statement. The amortization of prior service credit, net loss and initial obligation included in net periodic

benefit cost is recorded as other expense on the consolidated income statement.

Note 15–Fair value measurement

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to
sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. A three-level hierarchy for fair value
measurements is utilized based upon the transparency of
inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the
measurement date. BNY Mellon’s own creditworthiness is
considered when valuing liabilities. See Note 20 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023
Annual Report for

information on how we determine fair value and the fair
value hierarchy.

The following tables present the financial instruments
carried at fair value at March 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023,
by caption on the consolidated balance sheet and by the
three-level valuation hierarchy. We have included credit
ratings information in certain of the tables because the
information indicates the degree of credit risk to which we
are exposed, and significant changes in ratings
classifications could result in increased risk for us.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis

Under certain circumstances, we make adjustments to the fair value of our assets, liabilities and unfunded lending-related
commitments, although they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis. The following table presents the carrying value
as of March 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023 of financial instruments for which nonrecurring adjustments to fair value have been

Note 16–Fair value option

Note 17–Derivative instruments

We elected fair value as an alternative measurement for
selected financial assets and liabilities that are not
otherwise required to be measured at fair value, including
the assets and liabilities of consolidated investment
management funds and subordinated notes associated with
certain equity investments.

We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk,
including interest rate risk, equity price risk and foreign
currency risk, as well as credit risk. Our trading activities
are focused on acting as a market-maker for our customers
and facilitating customer trades in compliance with the
Volcker Rule.

The following table presents the assets and liabilities of
consolidated investment management funds, at fair value.

The assets and liabilities of the consolidated investment
management funds are included in other assets and other
liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet.
We value the assets and liabilities of consolidated
investment management funds using quoted prices for
identical assets or liabilities in active markets or observable
inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities.
Quoted prices for either identical or similar assets or
liabilities in inactive markets may also be used.
Accordingly, fair value best reflects the interests BNY
Mellon holds in the economic performance of the
consolidated investment management funds. Changes in
the fair value of the assets and liabilities are recorded as
income (loss) from consolidated investment management
funds, which is included in investment and other revenue
on the consolidated income statement.

We elected the fair value option on subordinated notes
associated with certain equity investments. The fair value
of these subordinated notes was $4 million at March 31,
2024 and $4 million at Dec. 31, 2023. The subordinated
notes were valued using observable market inputs and
included in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

The notional amounts for derivative financial instruments
express the dollar volume of the transactions; however,
credit risk is much smaller. We perform credit reviews and
enter into netting agreements and collateral arrangements
to minimize the credit risk of derivative financial
instruments. We enter into offsetting positions to reduce
exposure to foreign currency, interest rate and equity price
risk.

Use of derivative financial instruments involves reliance
on counterparties. Failure of a counterparty to honor its
obligation under a derivative contract is a risk we assume
whenever we engage in a derivative contract. There were
no counterparty default losses recorded in the first quarter
of 2024.

Hedging derivatives

We utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage our
exposure to interest rate fluctuations. We enter into fair
value hedges as an interest rate risk management strategy
to reduce fair value variability by converting certain fixed
rate interest payments associated with available-for-sale
securities, loans and long-term debt to floating interest
rates. We also utilize interest rate swaps and forward
exchange contracts as cash flow hedges to manage our
exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate
changes.

The available-for-sale securities hedged consist of U.S.
Treasury, agency and non-agency commercial MBS, non-
U.S. government and foreign covered bonds. At March 31,
2024, $33.6 billion par value of available-for-sale
securities was hedged with interest rate swaps designated
as fair value hedges that had notional values of $33.6
billion.

At March 31, 2024, $250 million of interest rate swaps was
designated as portfolio layer method fair value hedges of
loans against a closed portfolio of fixed rate loans of
$3.3 billion, essentially converting $250 million of such
fixed rate loans to a floating rate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

BNY Mellon 81

The fixed rate long-term debt instruments hedged generally
have original maturities of five to 30 years. In fair value
hedging relationships, fixed rate debt is hedged with
“receive fixed rate, pay variable rate” swaps. At March 31,
2024, $23.4 billion par value of debt was hedged with
interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges that had
notional values of $23.4 billion.

From time to time, we have utilized forward foreign
exchange contracts as fair value hedges of the foreign
exchange risk associated with available-for-sale securities.
Forward points are designated as an excluded component
and amortized into earnings over the hedge period. At
March 31, 2024, there were no remaining foreign exchange
contracts.

In addition, we utilize forward foreign exchange contracts
as hedges to mitigate foreign exchange exposures. We use
forward foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges to
convert certain forecasted non-U.S. dollar revenue and
expenses into U.S. dollars. We use forward foreign
exchange contracts with maturities of 15 months or less as
cash flow hedges to hedge our foreign exchange exposure
to currencies such as the Indian rupee, Polish zloty, Hong
Kong dollar, Singapore dollar, British pound and euro used
in revenue and expense transactions for entities that have
the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. As of March
31, 2024, the hedged forecasted foreign currency
transactions and designated forward foreign exchange
contract hedges were $689 million (notional), with a net
pre-tax gain of $5 million recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income (“OCI”). Over the next 12 months,
a gain of $5 million will be reclassified into earnings.

Forward foreign exchange contracts are also used to hedge
the value of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
These forward foreign exchange contracts have maturities
of less than one year. The derivatives employed are
designated as hedges of changes in value of our foreign
investments due to exchange rates. The change in fair
market value of these forward foreign exchange contracts
is reported within foreign currency translation adjustments
in shareholders’ equity, net of tax. At March 31, 2024,
forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts
totaling $10.6 billion were designated as net investment
hedges.

From time to time, we also designate non-derivative
financial instruments as hedges of our net investments in
foreign subsidiaries. At March 31, 2024, there were no
non-derivative financial instruments hedging our net
investments in foreign subsidiaries.

Trading activities (including trading derivatives)

Our trading activities are focused on acting as a market-
maker for our customers, facilitating customer trades and
risk-mitigating economic hedging in compliance with the
Volcker Rule. The change in the fair value of the
derivatives utilized in our trading activities is recorded in
foreign exchange revenue and investment and other
revenue on the consolidated income statement.

The following table presents our foreign exchange revenue
and other trading revenue.

Foreign exchange revenue

Foreign exchange revenue includes income from
purchasing and selling foreign currencies, currency
forwards, futures and options as well as foreign currency
remeasurement. Other trading revenue reflects results from
trading in cash instruments, including fixed income and
equity securities, and trading and economic hedging
activity with non-foreign exchange derivatives.

We also use derivative financial instruments as risk-
mitigating economic hedges, which are not formally
designated as accounting hedges. This includes hedging the
foreign currency, interest rate or market risks inherent in
some of our balance sheet exposures, such as seed capital
investments and deposits, as well as certain investment
management fee revenue streams. We also use total return
swaps to economically hedge obligations arising from the
Company’s deferred compensation plan whereby the
participants defer compensation and earn a return linked to
the performance of investments they select. The gains or
losses on these total return swaps are recorded in staff
expense on the consolidated income statement and was a
gain of $11 million in the first quarter of 2024, $7 million
in the first quarter of 2023 and $18 million in the fourth
quarter of 2023.

We manage trading risk through a system of position
limits, a value-at-risk (“VaR”) methodology based on
historical simulation and other market sensitivity measures.
Risk is monitored and reported to senior management by a
separate unit, independent from trading, on a daily basis.
Based on certain assumptions, the VaR methodology is
designed to

84 BNY Mellon

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

capture the potential overnight pre-tax dollar loss from
adverse changes in fair values of all trading positions. The
calculation assumes a one-day holding period, utilizes a
99% confidence level and incorporates non-linear product
characteristics. The VaR model is one of several statistical
models used to develop economic capital results, which are
allocated to lines of business for computing risk-adjusted
performance.

VaR methodology does not evaluate risk attributable to
extraordinary financial, economic or other occurrences. As
a result, the risk assessment process includes a number of
stress scenarios based upon the risk factors in the portfolio
and management’s assessment of market conditions.
Additional stress scenarios based upon historical market
events are also performed. Stress tests may incorporate the
impact of reduced market liquidity and the breakdown of
historically observed correlations and extreme scenarios.
VaR and other statistical measures, stress testing and
sensitivity analysis are incorporated into other risk
management materials.

Counterparty credit risk and collateral

We assess the credit risk of our counterparties through
regular examination of their financial statements,
confidential communication with the management of those
counterparties and regular monitoring of publicly available
credit rating information. This and other information is
used to develop proprietary credit rating metrics used to
assess credit quality.

Collateral requirements are determined after a
comprehensive review of the credit quality of each
counterparty. Collateral is generally held or pledged in the
form of cash and/or highly liquid government securities.
Collateral requirements are monitored and adjusted daily.

Additional disclosures concerning derivative financial
instruments are provided in Note 15.

Disclosure of contingent features in over-the-counter
(“OTC”) derivative instruments

Certain OTC derivative contracts and/or collateral
agreements contain credit risk-contingent features
triggered upon a rating downgrade in which the
counterparty has the right to request additional collateral or
the right to terminate the contracts in a net liability
position.

The following table shows the aggregate fair value of OTC
derivative contracts in net liability positions that contained
credit risk-contingent features and the value of collateral
that has been posted.

The following table shows the fair value of contracts
falling under early termination provisions that were in net

The aggregate fair value of OTC derivative contracts

The Bank of New York Mellon, our largest banking
subsidiary, enters into the substantial majority of our OTC
derivative contracts and/or collateral agreements. As such,
the contingent features may be triggered if The Bank of
New York Mellon’s long-term issuer rating were
downgraded.

BNY Mellon’s repurchase agreements and securities
lending transactions primarily encounter risk associated
with liquidity. We are required to pledge collateral based
on predetermined terms within the agreements. If we were
to experience a decline in the fair value of the collateral
pledged for these transactions, we could be required to
provide

additional collateral to the counterparty, therefore
decreasing the amount of assets available for other
liquidity needs that may arise. BNY Mellon also offers tri-
party collateral agency services in the tri-party repo market
where we are exposed to credit risk. In order to mitigate
this risk, we require dealers to fully secure intraday credit.

Note 18–Commitments and contingent liabilities

Off-balance sheet arrangements

In the normal course of business, various commitments and
contingent liabilities are outstanding that are not reflected
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Our significant trading and off-balance sheet risks are
securities, foreign currency and interest rate risk
management products, commercial lending commitments,
letters of credit and securities lending indemnifications. We
assume these risks to reduce interest rate and foreign
currency risks, to provide customers with the ability to
meet credit and liquidity needs and to hedge foreign
currency and interest rate risks. These items involve, to
varying degrees, credit, foreign currency and interest rate
risks not recognized on the balance sheet. Our off-balance
sheet risks are managed and monitored in manners similar
to those used for on-balance sheet risks.

The following table presents a summary of our off-balance
sheet credit risks.

The total potential loss on undrawn lending commitments,

expire without being drawn upon, the total amount does
not necessarily represent future cash requirements. A
summary of lending commitment

maturities is as follows: $30.3 billion in less than one year,
$19.1 billion in one to five years and $471 million over
five years.

SBLCs principally support obligations of corporate clients
and were collateralized with cash and securities of $162
million at March 31, 2024 and $158 million at Dec. 31,
2023. At March 31, 2024, $1.2 billion of the SBLCs will
expire within one year, $466 million in one to five years
and $8 million over five years.

We must recognize, at the inception of an SBLC and
foreign and other guarantees, a liability for the fair value of
the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The fair
value of the liability, which was recorded with a
corresponding asset in other assets, was estimated as the
present value of contractual customer fees. The estimated
liability for losses related to SBLCs and foreign and other
guarantees, if any, is included in the allowance for lending-
related commitments.

Payment/performance risk of SBLCs is monitored using
both historical performance and internal ratings criteria.
BNY Mellon’s historical experience is that SBLCs
typically expire without being funded. SBLCs below
investment grade are monitored closely for
payment/performance risk. The table below shows SBLCs
by investment grade:

Standby letters of credit

Investment grade

Non-investment grade

March 31, 2024 Dec. 31, 2023

71 %

29 %

74 %

26 %

A commercial letter of credit is normally a short-term
instrument used to finance a commercial contract for the
shipment of goods from a seller to a buyer. Although the
commercial letter of credit is contingent upon the
satisfaction of specified conditions, it represents a credit
exposure if the buyer defaults on the underlying
transaction. As a result, the total contractual amounts do
not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
Commercial letters of credit totaled $66 million at March
31, 2024 and $41 million at Dec. 31, 2023.

We expect many of the lending commitments and letters of
credit to expire without the need to advance any cash. The
revenue associated with guarantees frequently depends on
the credit rating of the obligor and the structure of the
transaction, including

collateral, if any. The allowance for lending-related
commitments was $81 million at March 31, 2024 and $87
million at Dec. 31, 2023.

A securities lending transaction is a fully collateralized
transaction in which the owner of a security agrees to lend
the security (typically through an agent, in our case, The
Bank of New York Mellon) to a borrower, usually a broker-
dealer or bank, on an open, overnight or term basis, under
the terms of a prearranged contract.

We typically lend securities with indemnification against
borrower default. We generally require the borrower to
provide collateral with a minimum value of 102% of the
fair value of the securities borrowed, which is monitored
on a daily basis, thus reducing credit risk. Market risk can
also arise in securities lending transactions. These risks are
controlled through policies limiting the level of risk that
can be undertaken. Securities lending transactions are
generally entered into only with highly rated
counterparties. Securities lending indemnifications were
secured by collateral of $569 billion at March 31, 2024 and
$518 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.

CIBC Mellon, a joint venture between BNY Mellon and
the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (“CIBC”),
engages in securities lending activities.  CIBC Mellon,
BNY Mellon and CIBC jointly and severally indemnify
securities lenders against specific types of borrower
default. At March 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, $59 billion
and $59 billion, respectively, of borrowings at CIBC
Mellon, for which BNY Mellon acts as agent on behalf of
CIBC Mellon clients, were secured by collateral of $63
billion and $62 billion, respectively. If, upon a default, a
borrower’s collateral was not sufficient to cover its related
obligations, certain losses related to the indemnification
could be covered by the indemnitors.

Unsettled repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements

In the normal course of business, we enter into repurchase
agreements and reverse repurchase agreements that settle
at a future date. In repurchase agreements, BNY Mellon
receives cash from and provides securities as collateral to a
counterparty at settlement. In reverse repurchase
agreements, BNY Mellon advances cash to and receives
securities as collateral from the counterparty at settlement.
These

transactions are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet
on the settlement date. At March 31, 2024, we had no
unsettled repurchase agreements and $85.4 billion of
unsettled reverse repurchase agreements. At Dec. 31, 2023,
we had no unsettled repurchase agreements and $77.9
billion of unsettled reverse repurchase agreements.

Sponsored member repo program

BNY Mellon is a sponsoring member in the FICC
sponsored member program, where we submit eligible
repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions in U.S.
Treasury and agency securities (“Sponsored Member
Transactions”) between BNY Mellon and our sponsored
member clients for novation and clearing through FICC
pursuant to the FICC Government Securities Division
rulebook (the “FICC Rules”). We also guarantee to FICC
the prompt and full payment and performance of our
sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under the
FICC Rules in connection with such

clients’ Sponsored Member Transactions. We minimize our

interest in our sponsored member clients’ collateral and
rights under Sponsored Member Transactions. See
“Offsetting assets and liabilities” in Note 17 for additional
information on our repurchase and reverse repurchase
agreements.

market loss until the loss occurs. Any ancillary costs that
occur as a result of any mark-to-market loss cannot be
quantified. In addition, we also sponsor clients as members
on clearing and settlement exchanges and guarantee their
obligations. At March 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, we did
not record any material liabilities under these
arrangements.

Indemnification arrangements

Legal proceedings

We have provided standard representations for
underwriting agreements, acquisition and divestiture
agreements, sales of loans and commitments, and other
similar types of arrangements and customary
indemnification for claims and legal proceedings related to
providing financial services that are not otherwise included
above. Insurance has been purchased to mitigate certain of
these risks. Generally, there are no stated or notional
amounts included in these indemnifications, and the
contingencies triggering the obligation for indemnification
are not expected to occur. Furthermore, often
counterparties to these transactions provide us with
comparable indemnifications. We are unable to develop an
estimate of the maximum payout under these
indemnifications for several reasons. In addition to the lack
of a stated or notional amount in a majority of such
indemnifications, we are unable to predict the nature of
events that would trigger indemnification or the level of
indemnification for a certain event. We believe, however,
that the possibility that we will have to make any material
payments for these indemnifications is remote. At March
31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, we have not recorded any
material liabilities under these arrangements.

Clearing and settlement exchanges

We are a noncontrolling equity investor in, and/or member
of, several industry clearing or settlement exchanges
through which foreign exchange, securities, derivatives or
other transactions settle. Certain of these industry clearing
and settlement exchanges require their members to
guarantee their obligations and liabilities and/or to provide
liquidity support in the event other members do not honor
their obligations. We believe the likelihood that a clearing
or settlement exchange (of which we are a member) would
become insolvent is remote. Additionally, certain
settlement exchanges have implemented loss allocation
policies that enable the exchange to allocate settlement
losses to the members of the exchange. It is not possible to
quantify such mark-to-

90 BNY Mellon

In the ordinary course of business, The Bank of New York
Mellon Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely
named as defendants in or made parties to pending and
potential legal actions. We also are subject to governmental
and regulatory examinations, information-gathering
requests, investigations and proceedings (both formal and
informal). Claims for significant monetary damages are
often asserted in many of these legal actions, while claims
for disgorgement, restitution, penalties and/or other
remedial actions or sanctions may be sought in
governmental and regulatory matters. It is inherently
difficult to predict the eventual outcomes of such matters
given their complexity and the particular facts and
circumstances at issue in each of these matters. However,
on the basis of our current knowledge and understanding,
we do not believe that judgments, settlements or orders, if
any, arising from these matters (either individually or in the
aggregate, after giving effect to applicable reserves and
insurance coverage) will have a material adverse effect on
the consolidated financial position or liquidity of BNY
Mellon, although they could have a material effect on our
results of operations in a given period.

In view of the inherent unpredictability of outcomes in
litigation and regulatory matters, particularly where (i) the
damages sought are substantial or indeterminate, (ii) the
proceedings are in the early stages, or (iii) the matters
involve novel legal theories or a large number of parties, as
a matter of course there is considerable uncertainty
surrounding the timing or ultimate resolution of litigation
and regulatory matters, including a possible eventual loss,
fine, penalty or business impact, if any, associated with
each such matter. In accordance with applicable accounting
guidance, we establish accruals for litigation and
regulatory matters when those matters proceed to a stage
where they present loss contingencies that are both
probable and reasonably estimable. In such cases, there
may be a possible exposure to loss in excess of any
amounts accrued. We regularly monitor such matters for
developments

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

that could affect the amount of the accrual, and will adjust
the accrual amount as appropriate. If the loss contingency
in question is not both probable and reasonably estimable,
we do not establish an accrual and the matter continues to
be monitored for any developments that would make the
loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable.
We believe that our accruals for legal proceedings are
appropriate and, in the aggregate, are not material to the
consolidated financial position of BNY Mellon, although
future accruals could have a material effect on the results
of operations in a given period. In addition, if we have the
potential to recover a portion of an estimated loss from a
third party, we record a receivable up to the amount of the
accrual that is probable of recovery.

For certain of those matters described here for which a loss
contingency may, in the future, be reasonably possible
(whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where
there is no accrued liability), BNY Mellon is currently
unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss. For
those matters described here where BNY Mellon is able to
estimate a reasonably possible loss, the aggregate range of
such reasonably possible loss is up to $660 million in
excess of the accrued liability (if any) related to those
matters. For matters where a reasonably possible loss is
denominated in a foreign currency, our estimate is adjusted
quarterly based on prevailing exchange rates. We do not
consider potential recoveries when estimating reasonably
possible losses.

The following describes certain judicial, regulatory and
arbitration proceedings involving BNY Mellon:

Mortgage-Securitization Trusts Proceedings
BNY Mellon has been named as a defendant in a number
of legal actions brought by MBS investors alleging that the
trustee has expansive duties under the governing
agreements, including the duty to investigate and pursue
breach of representation and warranty claims against other
parties to the MBS transactions. Two actions commenced
in December 2015 and February 2017 are pending in New
York federal court. In New York state court, six actions are
pending: one case commenced in May 2016; two related
cases commenced in September 2021 and October 2022;
and three related cases commenced in October 2021,
December 2021 and February 2022.

Matters Related to R. Allen Stanford
In late December 2005, Pershing LLC (“Pershing”)
became a clearing firm for Stanford Group Co. (“SGC”), a
registered broker-dealer that was part of a group of entities
ultimately controlled by R. Allen Stanford (“Stanford”).
Stanford International Bank, also controlled by Stanford,
issued certificates of deposit (“CDs”). Some investors
allegedly wired funds from their SGC accounts to purchase
CDs. In 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission
charged Stanford with operating a Ponzi scheme in
connection with the sale of CDs, and SGC was placed into
receivership. Alleged purchasers of CDs have filed two
putative class action proceedings against Pershing: one in
November 2009 in Texas federal court, and one in May
2016 in New Jersey federal court. On Nov. 5, 2021, the
court dismissed the class action filed in New Jersey and
that matter has concluded. Three lawsuits remain against
Pershing in Louisiana and New Jersey federal courts,
which were filed in January 2010, October 2015 and May
2016. The purchasers allege that Pershing, as SGC’s
clearing firm, assisted Stanford in a fraudulent scheme and
assert contractual, statutory and common law claims. In
March 2019, a group of investors filed a putative class
action against The Bank of New York Mellon in New
Jersey federal court, making the same allegations as in the
prior actions brought against Pershing. On Nov. 12, 2021,
the court dismissed the class action against The Bank of
New York Mellon; on Dec. 15, 2022, an appeals court
reversed the dismissal and returned the case to the trial
court for further proceedings. All the cases that have been
brought in federal court have been consolidated in Texas
federal court for discovery purposes. Various alleged
Stanford CD purchasers asserted similar claims in
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”)
arbitration proceedings.

Brazilian Postalis Litigation
BNY Mellon Servicos Financeiros DTVM S.A.
(“DTVM”), a subsidiary that provides asset services in
Brazil, acts as administrator for certain investment funds in
which a public pension fund for postal workers called
Postalis-Instituto de Seguridade Social dos Correios e
Telégrafos (“Postalis”) invested. On Aug. 22, 2014,
Postalis sued DTVM in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for losses
related to a Postalis fund for which DTVM is
administrator. Postalis alleges that DTVM failed to
properly perform duties, including to conduct due diligence
of and exert control over the manager. On March 12, 2015,
Postalis filed a lawsuit in Rio de Janeiro against DTVM
and BNY Mellon

BNY Mellon 91

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Administração de Ativos Ltda. (“Ativos”) alleging failure
to properly perform duties relating to another fund of
which DTVM is administrator and Ativos is manager. On
Dec. 14, 2015, Associacão dos Profissionais dos Correios
(“ADCAP”), a Brazilian postal workers association, filed a
lawsuit in São Paulo against DTVM and other defendants
alleging that DTVM improperly contributed to Postalis
investment losses. On March 20, 2017, the lawsuit was
dismissed without prejudice, and ADCAP appealed. On
Aug. 4, 2021, the appellate court overturned the dismissal
and sent the lawsuit to a state lower court. On March 2,
2023, DTVM appealed the August 4 decision to Brazil’s
Superior Court of Justice. On Dec. 17, 2015, Postalis filed
three lawsuits in Rio de Janeiro against DTVM and Ativos
alleging failure to properly perform duties with respect to
investments in several other funds. On May 20, 2021, the
court in one of those lawsuits entered a judgment of
approximately $3 million against DTVM and Ativos. On
Aug. 23, 2021, DTVM and Ativos filed an appeal of the
May 20 decision. On June 7, 2022, the appellate court
partially granted and partially denied the appeal, reducing
the judgment to approximately $2 million. On July 13,
2023, DTVM and Ativos filed a further appeal to Brazil’s
Superior Court of Justice. On Aug. 24, 2022, the court
dismissed one of the other lawsuits. On Nov. 24, 2022,
Postalis appealed that decision. On Oct. 24, 2023,
Postalis’s appeal was denied. On Feb. 4, 2016, Postalis
filed a lawsuit in Brasilia against DTVM, Ativos and BNY
Mellon Alocação de Patrimônio Ltda. (“Alocação de
Patrimônio”), an investment management subsidiary,
alleging failure to properly perform duties and liability for
losses with respect to investments in various funds of
which the defendants were administrator and/or manager.
On Jan. 16, 2018, the Brazilian Federal Prosecution
Service filed a civil lawsuit in São Paulo against DTVM
alleging liability for Postalis losses based on alleged
failures to properly perform certain duties as administrator
to certain funds in which Postalis invested or as controller
of Postalis’s own investment portfolio. On April 18, 2018,
the court dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice. On Aug.
4, 2021, the appellate court overturned the dismissal and
returned the lawsuit to the lower court. On April 11, 2022,
DTVM appealed the Aug. 4 decision to Brazil’s Superior
Court of Justice. On Aug. 21, 2023, DTVM’s appeal was
denied. In addition, the Tribunal de Contas da União
(“TCU”), an administrative tribunal, has initiated
proceedings with

92 BNY Mellon

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

the purpose of determining liability for losses to three
investment funds administered by DTVM in which Postalis
was an investor. On Sept. 9, 2020, TCU rendered a
decision in one of the proceedings, finding DTVM and two
former Postalis directors jointly and severally liable for
approximately $50 million. TCU also imposed on DTVM a
fine of approximately $2 million. DTVM’s administrative
appeal of the decision was denied. On Feb. 25, 2022,
DTVM filed a lawsuit in Brazil federal court in Brasilia
seeking annulment of TCU’s decision and an injunction
preventing TCU from enforcing the judgment. On Aug. 24,
2022, the Brazilian Federal Attorneys filed an action in Rio
de Janeiro court seeking to enforce the fine portion of the
judgment. On Nov. 8, 2022, the Brasilia federal court in the
annulment action granted DTVM’s request for an
injunction, suspending the Sept. 9, 2020 TCU decision
until the annulment action is decided. On Oct. 4, 2019,
Postalis and another pension fund filed a request for
arbitration in São Paulo against DTVM and Ativos alleging
liability for losses to an investment fund for which DTVM
was administrator and Ativos was manager. On March 26,
2021, DTVM and Ativos filed a lawsuit in São Paulo
challenging the decision rendered by the Arbitration Court
with respect to its jurisdiction over the case. On Feb. 24,
2023, the São Paulo court annulled the Arbitration Court’s
decision that it had jurisdiction, and Postalis and the other
pension fund have appealed. On Sept. 21, 2023, the São
Paulo court issued an order suspending the arbitration; the
Arbitration Court implemented the suspension on Oct. 6,
2023. On April 8, 2024, the appellate court reversed the
São Paulo court’s decision and found that the Arbitration
Court did have jurisdiction. DTVM plans to further appeal.
On Oct. 25, 2019, Postalis filed a lawsuit in Rio de Janeiro
against DTVM and Alocação de Patrimônio, alleging
liability for losses in another fund for which DTVM was
administrator and Alocação de Patrimônio and Ativos were
managers. On May 9, 2022, the court found DTVM and
Alocação de Patrimônio jointly and severally liable for
approximately $20 million. On Aug. 12, 2022, DTVM and
Alocação de Patrimônio appealed the decision. On June 19,
2020, a lawsuit was filed in federal court in Rio de Janeiro
against DTVM, Postalis, and various other defendants
alleging liability against DTVM for certain Postalis losses
in an investment fund of which DTVM was administrator.
On Feb. 10, 2021, Postalis and another pension fund served
DTVM in a lawsuit filed in Rio de Janeiro, alleging
liability for losses in another

investment fund for which DTVM was administrator and
the other defendant was manager.

Brazilian Silverado Litigation
DTVM acts as administrator for the Fundo de Investimento
em Direitos Creditórios Multisetorial Silverado Maximum
(“Silverado Maximum Fund”), which invests in
commercial credit receivables. On June 2, 2016, the
Silverado Maximum Fund sued DTVM in its capacity as
administrator, along with Deutsche Bank S.A. - Banco
Alemão in its capacity as custodian and Silverado Gestão e
Investimentos Ltda. in its capacity as investment manager.
The Fund alleges that each of the defendants failed to
fulfill its respective duty, and caused losses to the Fund for
which the defendants are jointly and severally liable. On
March 21, 2024, the São Paulo court issued a decision
finding DTVM, Deutsche Bank and Silverado Gestão e
Investimentos jointly liable for losses to the Fund in an
amount to be determined during a later calculation phase.
DTVM plans to appeal.

German Tax Matters
German authorities are investigating past “cum/ex”
trading, which involved the purchase of equity securities
on or shortly before the dividend date, but settled after that
date, potentially resulting in an unwarranted refund of
withholding tax. German authorities have taken the view
that past cum/ex trading may have resulted in tax
avoidance or evasion. European subsidiaries of BNY
Mellon have been informed by German authorities about
investigations into potential cum/ex trading by certain
third-party investment funds, where one of the subsidiaries
had acquired entities that served as depositary and/or fund
manager for those third-party investment funds. We have
received information requests from the authorities relating
to pre-acquisition activity and are cooperating fully with
those requests. In August 2019, the District Court of Bonn
ordered that one of these subsidiaries be joined as a
secondary party in connection with the prosecution of
unrelated individual defendants. Trial commenced in
September 2019. In March 2020, the court stated that it
would refrain from taking action against the subsidiary in
order to expedite the conclusion of the trial. The court
convicted the unrelated individual defendants, and
determined that the cum/ex trading activities of the
relevant third-party investment funds were unlawful. In
November and December 2020 and February 2023, we
received secondary liability notices from the German tax

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

authorities totaling approximately $150 million (at then-
prevailing exchange rates) related to pre-acquisition
activity in various funds for which the entities we acquired
were depositary and/or fund manager. We have appealed
the notices. In connection with the acquisition of the
subject entities, we obtained an indemnity for liabilities
from the sellers that we intend to pursue as necessary.

Off-Channel Business-Related Communications
The Company has been responding to a request for
information from the SEC concerning compliance with
recordkeeping obligations relating to business
communications transmitted on unapproved electronic
communication platforms. SEC Staff has stated that it is
conducting similar inquiries into recordkeeping practices at
other financial institutions. The Company is cooperating
with the inquiry. In April 2023, the Company received a
similar request from the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission and is cooperating with that inquiry as well.

Pershing Rule 15c3-3 Matter
The Company has been responding to investigative
requests for information and records from the SEC
concerning Pershing LLC’s compliance with its obligations
under SEC Rule 15c3-3, among other regulatory rules and
statutes. The Company continues to cooperate with the
inquiry.

Note 19–Business segments

We have an internal information system that produces
performance data along product and service lines for our
three principal business segments and the Other segment.
The primary products and services and types of revenue for
our principal businesses and a description of the Other
segment are presented in Note 24 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Annual
Report.

Business accounting principles

Our business data has been determined on an internal
management basis of accounting, rather than GAAP, which
is used for consolidated financial reporting. These
measurement principles are designed so that reported
results of the businesses will track their economic
performance.

Business segment results are subject to reclassification
when organizational changes are made, or for refinements
in revenue and expense

BNY Mellon 93

allocation methodologies. Refinements are typically
reflected on a prospective basis. In the first quarter of
2024, we made certain realignments of similar products
and services within our lines of business. The largest
change was the movement of Institutional Solutions from
Pershing to Clearance and Collateral Management, both in
the Market and Wealth Services business segment. We
made other smaller changes that moved activity from Asset
Servicing in the Securities Services business segment to
Treasury Services in the Market and Wealth Services
business segment, and from Wealth Management in the
Investment and Wealth Management business segment and
Pershing in the Market and Wealth Services business
segment to Investment Management in the Investment and
Wealth Management business segment. The Other segment
was not impacted by the changes. Prior period business
segment results have been revised to reflect these changes.

The accounting policies of the businesses are the same as
those described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in our 2023 Annual Report.

The results of our business segments are presented and
analyzed on an internal management reporting basis.

• Revenue amounts reflect fee and other revenue

generated by each business and include revenue for
services provided between the segments that are also
provided to third parties. Fee and other revenue
transferred between businesses under revenue transfer
agreements is included within other fees in each
segment.

• Revenues and expenses associated with specific client
bases are included in those businesses. For example,
foreign exchange activity associated with clients using
custody products is included in the Securities Services
segment.

• Net interest income is allocated to businesses based on
the yields on the assets and liabilities generated by each
business. We employ a funds

•

•

•

transfer pricing system that matches funds with the
specific assets and liabilities of each business based on
their interest sensitivity and maturity characteristics.

The provision for credit losses associated with the
respective credit portfolios is reflected in each segment.

Incentives expense related to restricted stock and RSUs
is allocated to the segments.

Support and other indirect expenses, including services
provided between segments that are not provided to
third parties or not subject to a revenue transfer
agreement, are allocated to the businesses based on
internally developed methodologies and reflected in
noninterest expense.

• Recurring FDIC expense is allocated to the businesses
based on average deposits generated within each
business.

•

•

Severance expense is recorded in the segments based on
the business or function the impacted employees reside,
with severance related to corporate staff, technology
and operations reflected in the Other segment.

Litigation expense is generally recorded in the business
in which the charge occurs.

• Management of the securities portfolio is a shared

service contained in the Other segment. As a result,
gains and losses associated with the valuation of the
securities portfolio are generally included in the Other
segment.

• Client deposits serve as the primary funding source for

our securities portfolio. We typically allocate all interest
income to the businesses generating the deposits.

• Balance sheet assets and liabilities and their related
income or expense are specifically assigned to each
business. Segments with a net liability position have
been allocated assets.

• Goodwill and intangible assets are reflected within

individual businesses.
