Overview
Established in 1784 by Alexander Hamilton, we were the first
company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: BK).
With a history of more than 235 years, BNY Mellon is a global
company that manages and services assets for financial
institutions, corporations and individual investors in 35 countries.
BNY Mellon has two business segments, Investment Services and
Investment and Wealth Management, which offer a
comprehensive set of capabilities and deep expertise across the
investment lifecycle, enabling the Company to provide solutions
to buy-side and sell-side market participants, as well as leading
institutional and wealth management clients globally.
The diagram below presents our two business segments and linesof business, with the remaining operations in the Other segment.Key third quarter 2020 eventsEmily Portney named Chief Financial OfficerIn July 2020, Emily Portney was appointed Chief FinancialOfficer, succeeding Michael P. Santomassimo, and joined theCompany’s Executive Committee. Ms. Portney previously led theclient management, sales and services teams for the AssetServicing business globally and oversaw the Americas region forthe Asset Servicing business. She has also previously held seniorfinancial roles.
CCAR and common stock repurchasesIn August 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that BNYMellon’s stress capital buffer (“SCB”) requirement would be2.5%, which equals the regulatory minimum, effective on Oct. 1,2020.
The Federal Reserve also announced that it has requiredparticipating Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review(“CCAR”) firms, including us, to update and resubmit theircapital plans and that, as

a result, unless otherwise approved by the Federal Reserve,
participating firms were not permitted, during the third quarter of
2020, to conduct open market common stock repurchases, to
increase their common stock dividends or to pay common stock
dividends that exceed average net income for the preceding four
quarters. On Sept. 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve extended these
limitations through the fourth quarter of 2020.
Highlights of third quarter 2020 results
Net income applicable to common shareholders was $876
million, or $0.98 per diluted common share, in the third quarter of
2020. Net income applicable to common shareholders was $1.0
billion, or $1.07 per diluted common share, in the third quarter of
2019. The highlights below are based on the third quarter of 2020
compared with the third quarter of 2019, unless otherwise noted. • Total revenue of $3.8 billion decreased less than 1%primarily reflecting: • Fee revenue decreased 1%, primarily reflecting higher
money market fee waivers, partially offset by higher
client activity and balances in Pershing and Asset
Servicing, higher market values and the favorable impact
of a weaker U.S. dollar. (See “Fee and other revenue”
beginning on page 7.) • Net interest revenue decreased 4%. The decrease would
have been 8% larger due to the impact of the third quarter
2019 lease-related impairment of $70 million. The
decrease primarily reflects lower interest rates on interestearning assets, partially offset by the benefit of lower
deposit and funding rates, higher deposits, securities
portfolio and loan balances. (See “Net interest revenue”
on page 10.) • Provision for credit losses of $9 million reflects a fairly
consistent macroeconomic outlook compared with the second
quarter of 2020. (See “Consolidated balance sheet review -
Allowance for credit losses” beginning on page 28.) • Noninterest expense increased 4%, 3% of which was due to
the impact of the third quarter 2019 net reduction of reserves
for a tax-related exposure of certain investment management
funds. The remainder of the increase primarily reflects
continued investments in technology,
higher professional, legal and other purchased servicesexpense and the unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar,partially offset by lower staff and business development(travel and marketing) expenses. (See “Noninterest expense”on page 13.) • Effective tax rate of 18.4%. (See “Income taxes” on page 13.)Capital and liquidity• CET1 ratio was 13.0% at Sept. 30, 2020, compared with12.6% at June 30, 2020. The increase in the CET1 ratioprimarily reflects capital generated through earnings, foreigncurrency translation and unrealized gains on securitiesavailable-for-sale, partially offset by higher risk-weightedassets (“RWAs”) and capital deployed through dividendpayments. (See “Capital” beginning on page 36.)Highlights of our principal businessesInvestment Services

Impact of coronavirus pandemic on our business
The coronavirus pandemic has had a significant effect on the
global macroeconomic environment. The following discusses the
areas of our business that have been impacted and could continue
to be impacted by the current environment.
Since March 2020, the vast majority of our employees have
worked from home. They have been fully operational with
minimal disruption to servicing our clients. However, our
continued reliance on work-from-home arrangements may result
in increased operational risks.
Market volatility associated with the performance of global
equity and fixed income markets and lower interest rates has had,
and may continue to have, a considerable impact on all of our
businesses. Our lower-risk diversified fee-based business model
benefits from heightened volatility and a flight-to-quality on a
relative basis compared with other credit-focused financial
institutions.
Our Investment Services businesses were favorably impacted by
higher client volumes in the first nine months of 2020 compared
with the prior year. The significant increases in market volatility
also resulted in increased client activity in foreign exchange, and
higher asset servicing, clearing services in Pershing, as well as
clearance and collateral management fee revenue. However, the
heightened volumes and volatility were lower in the second and
third quarters of 2020 compared with the first quarter of 2020.
This volatility, coupled with the interest rate environment, also
led to an increase in deposit levels from the prior year as our
clients increased the levels of cash placed with us. This favorably
impacted net interest revenue. However, the low interest rate
environment has more than offset that benefit and is expected to
continue to reduce our net interest revenue and margin.
Given the recent levels of short-term interest rates, money market
mutual fund fees have been waived and may continue to be
waived, which reduced fee revenue in the second and third
quarters of 2020. See further discussion of money market fee
waivers in “Fee and other revenue.”
As discussed above under “Key third quarter 2020 events,” weand the other CCAR firms have suspended open market commonstock repurchases through the fourth quarter of 2020, and wecontinued our current quarterly common stock dividend of $0.31per share. See “Recent regulatory developments” for additionalinformation related to the 2020 CCAR.
The significant changes in market values during 2020 haveimpacted revenue related to seed capital investments (net ofhedges) in our Investment and Wealth Management business,which benefited the second and third quarters of 2020 andnegatively impacted the first quarter of 2020. The Investment andWealth Management business continued to be negativelyimpacted by higher money market fee waivers in the second andthird quarters of 2020.
During the first quarter of 2020, we purchased $2.2 billion ofcommercial paper and certificates of deposit (“CDs”) fromaffiliated money market mutual funds in order to provide liquiditysupport to the funds. We also purchased $650 million in the firstquarter of 2020 and $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2020 ofcommercial paper and CDs from third-party money marketmutual funds and funded this purchase through the FederalReserve Bank of Boston’s Money Market Mutual Fund LiquidityFacility (“MMLF”) program. At Sept. 30, 2020, commercialpaper and CDs totaled approximately $650 million. See “Recentregulatory developments” in the First Quarter 2020 Form 10-Qfor additional information on the MMLF.
The need to apply macroeconomic forecasting in the currentenvironment in conjunction with the new expected credit lossaccounting guidance has resulted in and may continue to result inheightened levels of credit loss provisioning. The continuingeffects of the pandemic could also result in increased credit lossesand charge-offs. The macroeconomic outlook in the third quarterof 2020 was fairly consistent with the second quarter of 2020.In addition, a prolonged economic downturn may result in otherasset write-downs and impairments, including, but not limited to,equity investments, goodwill and intangibles.It is difficult to forecast the impact of the coronavirus, togetherwith related public health measures, on our results with certaintybecause so much depends on6 BNY Mellon
how the health crisis evolves, its impact on the global economy as
well as actions taken by central banks and governments to
support the economy.
The current macroeconomic environment has also resulted in
responses by governmental and regulatory bodies. See “Recent
regulatory developments” in the first quarter 2020 Form 10-Q for
additional information on legislative and regulatory developments
in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
For further discussion of the current and potential impact of thecoronavirus pandemic see Item 1A. Risk Factors “Thecoronavirus pandemic is adversely affecting us and createssignificant risks and uncertainties for our business, and theultimate impact of the pandemic on us will depend on futuredevelopments, which are highly uncertain and cannot bepredicted.”

N/M - Not meaningful.
Fee and other revenue decreased less than 1% compared with the
third quarter of 2019 and decreased 2% compared with the
second quarter of 2020. The decrease compared with the third
quarter of 2019 primarily reflects lower issuer services and
clearing services fees, partially offset by higher asset servicing
fees, investment and other income and treasury services fees. The
decrease compared with the second quarter of 2020 primarily
reflects lower investment and other income, clearing services fees
and foreign exchange and other trading revenue, partially offsetby higher investment management and performance fees andissuer services fees.
Money market fee waiversGiven the recent levels of short-term interest rates, money marketmutual fund fees and other similar fees are being waived toprotect investors from negative returns. The fee waivers haveprimarily impactedBNY Mellon 7
clearing services fees in Pershing, and to a lesser extent revenue
in our other businesses including investment management fees
and distribution and servicing revenue in Investment and Wealth
Management and fees in other Investment Services businesses,
but also resulted in lower distribution and servicing expense.
Money market fee waivers are highly sensitive to changes in
short-term interest rates and are difficult to predict.
The following table presents the impact of money market fee
waivers on our consolidated fee revenue, net of distribution and
servicing expense. A majority of the money market fee waivers
were driven by low short-term interest rates.

We expect the impact from money market fee waivers, net of

million in the fourth quarter of 2020. We also expect the quarterly
run rate in 2021 to be at the higher end of that range. This impact
may be partially offset depending on the levels of money market
balances.
Investment services fees
Investment services fees decreased 1% compared with both thethird quarter of 2019 and second quarter of 2020 reflecting thefollowing: • Asset servicing fees increased 1% compared with the thirdquarter of 2019 and decreased less than 1% compared withthe second quarter of 2020. The increase compared with thethird quarter of 2019 primarily reflects higher client volumes.The decrease compared with the second quarter of 2020primarily reflects lower securities lending revenue driven bytighter spreads. • Clearing services fees decreased 5% compared with the thirdquarter of 2019 and 8% compared with the second quarter of2020. The decrease compared with the third quarter of 2019primarily reflects the impact of rate-driven money market feewaivers, partially offset by higher money market balances.The decrease compared with the second quarter of 2020primarily reflects lower clearing volumes and higher ratedriven money market fee waivers. • Issuer services fees decreased 9% compared with the thirdquarter of 2019 and increased 6% compared with the secondquarter of 2020. The decrease compared with the third quarterof 2019 primarily reflects lower Depositary Receipts revenue.The increase compared with the second quarter of 2020primarily reflects seasonally higher Depositary Receiptsrevenue. • Treasury services fees increased 9% compared with the thirdquarter of 2019 and 6% compared with the second quarter of2020. The increase compared with the third quarter of 2019primarily reflects lower compensating balance creditsprovided to clients driven by lower rates and higher moneymarket balances. The increase compared with the secondquarter of 2020 primarily reflects higher payment volumesand other fees.
See “Investment Services business” in “Review of businesses”for additional details.
Investment management and performance feesInvestment management and performance fees increased slightlycompared with the third quarter of 2019 and 6% compared withthe second quarter of 2020. The increase compared with the thirdquarter of 2019 primarily reflects higher market values, the8 BNY Mellon
favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar and higher performance
fees, partially offset by the impact of money market fee waivers.
The increase compared with the second quarter of 2020 primarily
reflects higher market values and the favorable impact of a
weaker U.S. dollar. On a constant currency basis (Non-GAAP),
investment management and performance fees decreased 1%compared with the third quarter of 2019. Performance fees were
$7 million in the third quarter of 2020, $2 million in the third
quarter of 2019 and $5 million in the second quarter of 2020.
AUM was $2.0 trillion at Sept. 30, 2020, an increase of 9%compared with Sept. 30, 2019, primarily reflecting higher market
values, the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar (principally
versus the British pound) and net inflows.

Foreign exchange and other trading revenue decreased 9%compared with the third quarter of 2019 and 17% compared with
the second quarter of 2020.
Foreign exchange revenue is primarily driven by the volume of
client transactions and the spread realized on these transactions,
both of which are impacted by market volatility, and the impact
of foreign currency hedging activities. In the third quarter of
2020, foreign exchange revenue totaled $151 million, an increase
of 17% compared with the third quarter of 2019 and a decrease of
13% compared with the second quarter of 2020. The increase
compared with the third quarter of 2019 primarily reflects the
impact of foreign currency hedging activity. The decrease
compared with the second quarter of 2020 primarily reflects
lower volumes and volatility. Foreign exchange revenue is
primarily reported in the
Investment Services business and, to a lesser extent, theInvestment and Wealth Management business and the Othersegment.
Other trading losses totaled $14 million in the third quarter of2020 compared with other trading revenue of $21 million in thethird quarter of 2019 and other trading losses of $8 million in thesecond quarter of 2020. Both decreases primarily reflect lowerderivative and fixed income trading and hedging, which ispartially offset in net interest revenue. Other trading revenue isreported in all three business segments.

Net interest revenue decreased 4% compared with the third
quarter of 2019 and 10% compared with the second quarter of
2020. The decrease compared with the third quarter of 2019
would have been 8% larger due to the impact of the third quarter
2019 lease-related impairment of $70 million. The decrease
primarily reflects lower interest rates on interest-earning assets,
partially offset by the benefit of lower deposit and funding rates,
higher deposits, securities portfolio and loan balances. The
decrease compared with the second quarter of 2020 was primarily
driven by lower interest rates on interest-earning assets, partially
offset by the benefit of lower deposit and funding rates and a
larger securities portfolio.
Net interest margin decreased 20 basis points compared with the
third quarter of 2019 and 9 basis points compared with the second
quarter of 2020. The decreases reflect the factors mentioned
above.
Average interest-earning assets increased 22% compared with the
third quarter of 2019 and increased slightly compared with the
second quarter of 2020. The increase compared with the third
quarter of 2019 primarily reflects a larger securities portfolio and
higher interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and
other central banks.
Average non-U.S. dollar deposits comprised approximately 25%of our average total deposits in the third quarter of 2020.Approximately 40% of the average non-U.S. dollar deposits inthe third quarter of 2020 were euro denominated.Net interest revenue in future quarters will depend on the leveland mix of client deposits, deposit rates, as well as the level andshape of the yield curve, which may result in lower yields oninterest-earning assets.
Year-to-date 2020 compared with year-to-date 2019Net interest revenue decreased 3% compared with the first ninemonths of 2019. The decrease would have been 3% larger due tothe impact of the third quarter 2019 lease-related impairment of$70 million. The decrease is primarily driven by lower interestrates on interest-earning assets, partially offset by the benefit oflower deposit and funding rates, higher deposits, securitiesportfolio and loan balances. The decrease in the net interestmargin primarily reflects the factors mentioned above.Average interest-earning assets increased 20% compared with thefirst nine months of 2019. The increase primarily reflects a largersecurities portfolio and higher interest-bearing deposits with theFederal Reserve and other central banks.

quarter of 2019 and decreased slightly compared with the second
quarter of 2020. The increase compared with the third quarter of
2019 primarily reflects a reduction of previously established
reserves for a tax-related exposure of certain investment
management funds that we manage, net of staff expense. The
increase compared with the third quarter of 2019 also reflects
continued investments in technology, higher professional, legal
and other purchased services expense and the unfavorable impact
of a weaker U.S. dollar, partially offset by lower staff and
business development (travel and marketing) expenses. The
investments in technology are included in staff, professional,
legal and other purchased services, and software and equipment
expenses. The slight decrease compared with the second quarter
of 2020 primarily reflects decreases in most expense categories,
partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar
and higher professional, legal and other purchased services
expense.
Our investments in technology infrastructure and platforms are
expected to continue. As a result, we expect to incur higher
technology-related expenses in 2020 than in 2019 and higher
pension expense as a result of a lower expected rate of return on
plan assets. These increases are expected to be offset by decreases
in other expenses as we continue to manage overall expenses.
Year-to-date 2020 compared with year-to-date 2019Noninterest expense increased 2% compared with the first ninemonths of 2019, primarily reflecting continued investments intechnology and a reduction of previously established reserves fora tax-related exposure of certain investment management fundsthat we manage, net of staff expense recorded in 2019, partiallyoffset by lower business development (travel and marketing)expense.

Review of businesses
We have an internal information system that produces
performance data along product and service lines for our two
principal businesses, Investment Services and Investment and
Wealth Management, and the Other segment.
Business accounting principles
Our business data has been determined on an internal
management basis of accounting, rather than the generally
accepted accounting principles used for consolidated financial
reporting. These measurement principles are designed so that
reported results of the businesses will track their economic
performance.
For information on the accounting principles of our businesses,
see Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
For information on the primary products and services in each line
of business, the primary types of revenue by business and how
our businesses are presented and analyzed, see Note 24 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual
Report.
Business results are subject to reclassification when
organizational changes are made, or for refinements in revenue
and expense allocation methodologies. Refinements are typically
reflected on a prospective basis. There were no significant
organizational changes in the second or third quarters of 2020. In
the first quarter of 2020, we reclassified the results of certain
services provided between the segments from noninterest expense
to fee and other revenue. The intersegment activity is eliminated
in the Other segment and relates to services that are also provided
to third parties and provides consistency with the reporting of the
revenues. This adjustment had no impact on income before taxes
of the businesses. Also in the first quarter of 2020, we reclassified
the results related to certain lending activities from the Wealth
Management business to the Pershing business. These loans were
originated by the Wealth Management business as a service to
Pershing clients. This resulted in an increase in total revenue,
noninterest expense and income before taxes in the Pershing
business and a corresponding decrease in the Wealth
Management business. Prior periods were restated in the first
quarter of 2020 for both reclassifications.
The results of our businesses may be influenced by client andother activities that vary by quarter. In the first quarter, staffexpense typically increases reflecting the vesting of long-termstock awards for retirement-eligible employees. In the thirdquarter, Depositary Receipts revenue is typically higher due to anincreased level of client dividend payments. Also in the thirdquarter, volume-related fees may decline due to reduced clientactivity, and staff expense typically increases reflecting theannual employee merit increase. In the fourth quarter, wetypically incur higher business development and marketingexpenses; however, 2020 is expected to be different given theimpact of the coronavirus pandemic. In our Investment andWealth Management business, performance fees are typicallyhigher in the fourth and first quarters, as those quarters representthe end of the measurement period for many of the performancefee-eligible relationships.
The results of our businesses may also be impacted by thetranslation of financial results denominated in foreign currenciesto the U.S. dollar. We are primarily impacted by activitiesdenominated in the British pound and the euro. On a consolidatedbasis and in our Investment Services business, we typically havemore foreign currency-denominated expenses than revenues.However, our Investment and Wealth Management businesstypically has more foreign currency-denominated revenues thanexpenses. Overall, currency fluctuations impact the year-overyear growth rate in the Investment and Wealth Managementbusiness more than the Investment Services business. However,currency fluctuations, in isolation, are not expected tosignificantly impact net income on a consolidated basis.Fee revenue in Investment and Wealth Management, and to alesser extent in Investment Services, is impacted by the value ofmarket indices. At Sept. 30, 2020, we estimated that a 5% changein global equity markets, spread evenly throughout the year,would impact fee revenue by less than 1% and diluted earningsper common share by $0.03 to $0.06.
See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statementsfor the consolidating schedules which show the contribution ofour businesses to our overall profitability.

Review of financial results
AUC/A of $38.6 trillion increased 8% compared with Sept. 30,
2019, primarily reflecting higher market values, net new business,
client inflows and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar.
AUC/A consisted of 34% equity securities and 66% fixed-income
securities at Sept. 30, 2020 and Sept. 30, 2019.
Total revenue of $2.9 billion decreased 4% compared with the
third quarter of 2019 and 6% compared with the second quarter of
2020. The drivers of total revenue by line of business are
indicated below.
Asset Servicing revenue of $1.4 billion decreased 4% compared
with the third quarter of 2019 and 7% compared with the second
quarter of 2020. The decrease compared with the third quarter of
2019 primarily reflects lower interest rates, partially offset by
higher client deposits and client volumes. The decrease compared
with the second quarter of 2020 primarily reflects lower foreign
exchange volumes, lower net interest revenue, a one-time fee
recorded in the second quarter of 2020 and lower securities
lending revenue driven by tighter spreads.
Pershing revenue of $538 million decreased 6% compared with
the third quarter of 2019 and 7% compared with the second
quarter of 2020. The decrease compared with the third quarter of
2019 primarily reflects the impact of rate-driven money market
fee waivers, partially offset by higher money market balances.
The decrease compared with the second quarter of 2020 primarily
reflects lower clearing volumes and higher rate-driven money
market fee waivers.
Issuer Services revenue of $435 million decreased 7% comparedwith the third quarter of 2019 and increased 1% compared withthe second quarter of 2020. The decrease compared with the thirdquarter of 2019 primarily reflects lower Depositary Receiptsrevenue. The increase compared with the second quarter of 2020primarily reflects seasonally higher Depositary Receipts revenue,partially offset by lower net interest revenue.Treasury Services revenue of $323 million increased 4%compared with the third quarter of 2019 and decreased 5%compared with the second quarter of 2020. The increasecompared with the third quarter of 2019 primarily reflects higherclient deposits and money market balances. The decreasecompared with the second quarter of 2020 primarily reflectslower net interest revenue, partially offset by higher paymentvolumes.
Clearance and Collateral Management revenue of $277 milliondecreased 5% compared with the third quarter of 2019 and 6%compared with the second quarter of 2020. The decreasecompared with the third quarter of 2019 primarily reflects lowerinvestment income due to the fourth quarter 2019 sale of anequity investment. The decrease compared with the secondquarter of 2020 primarily reflects lower clearance volumes andnet interest revenue.
Market and regulatory trends are driving investable assets towardlower fee asset management products at reduced margins for ourclients. These dynamics are also negatively impacting ourinvestment services fees. However, at the same time, these trendsare providing additional outsourcing opportunities as clients andother market participants seek to comply with regulations andreduce their operating costs.
Noninterest expense of $2.0 billion increased 2% compared withboth the third quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2020. Theincrease compared with the third quarter of 2019 was primarilydriven by continued investments in technology.

new business in Corporate Trust. Treasury Services revenue of
$1.0 billion increased 6%, primarily reflecting higher money

Review of financial results
AUM increased 9% compared with Sept. 30, 2019 primarily
reflecting higher market values, the favorable impact of a weaker
U.S. dollar (principally versus the British pound) and net inflows.
Net long-term strategy inflows were $5 billion in the third quarterof 2020, driven by liability-driven investment funds. Short-termstrategy outflows were $10 billion in the third quarter of 2020.Market and regulatory trends have resulted in increased demandfor lower fee asset management products and for performancebased fees.
Total revenue of $918 million increased 3% compared with thethird quarter of 2019 and 4% compared with the second quarter of2020.
Investment Management revenue of $641 million increased 5%compared with the third quarter of 2019 and 3% compared withthe second quarter of 2020. The increase compared with the thirdquarter of 2019 primarily reflects the impact of hedging activitiesin the third quarter of 2019, higher market values, the favorableimpact of a weaker U.S. dollar and higher performance fees,partially offset by the impact of money market fee waivers. Theincrease compared with the second quarter of 2020 primarilyreflects higher market values and the favorable impact of aBNY Mellon 19
weaker U.S. dollar, partially offset by lower seed capital gains,
net of hedges.
Wealth Management revenue of $277 million decreased 1%compared with the third quarter of 2019 and increased 5%compared with the second quarter of 2020. The decrease
compared with the third quarter of 2019 primarily reflects lower
net interest revenue. The comparisons with the third quarter of
2019 and second quarter of 2020 reflect higher market values
offset by a shift to lower fee investment products.
Revenue generated in the Investment and Wealth Management
business included 41% from non-U.S. sources in the third quarter
of 2020, compared with 39% in the third quarter of 2019 and 40%in the second quarter of 2020.
Noninterest expense of $661 million increased 12% compared
with the third quarter of 2019 and increased slightly compared
with the second quarter of 2020. The increase compared with the
third
quarter of 2019 primarily reflects the net reduction of reserves fora tax-related exposure of certain investment management funds inthe third quarter of 2019.
Year-to-date 2020 compared with year-to-date 2019Total revenue of $2.7 billion decreased 1% compared with thefirst nine months of 2019. Investment Management revenue of$1.9 billion increased 1% primarily reflecting higher marketvalues, the impact of hedging activities and higher performancefees, partially offset by an unfavorable change in the mix ofAUM and the impact of fee waivers. Wealth Managementrevenue of $820 million decreased 5% reflecting lower netinterest revenue, partially offset by higher market values.Noninterest expense of $2.0 billion increased 5% compared withthe first nine months of 2019, primarily reflecting the netreduction of reserves for a tax-related exposure of certaininvestment management funds in the third quarter of 2019.Other segment

See page 18 of our 2019 Annual Report for additional
information on the Other segment.
In the first quarter of 2020, we reclassified the results of certain
services provided between the segments from noninterest expense
to fee and other revenue. The intersegment activity is eliminated
in the Other segment and relates to services that are also provided
to third parties and provides consistency with the reporting of the
revenues. This adjustment had no impact on income before taxes
of the businesses.
Review of financial resultsFee revenue, net securities gains (losses) and net interest expenseinclude corporate treasury and other investment activity,including hedging activity which offsets between fee revenue andnet interest expense.
Fee revenue increased $16 million compared with the thirdquarter of 2019 and decreased $18 million compared with thesecond quarter of 2020. The increase compared with the thirdquarter of 2019 primarily reflects higher corporate treasuryactivity and equity investment income. The decrease comparedwith the second quarter of 2020 primarily20 BNY Mellon
reflects lower corporate treasury activity and equity investment
income.
Net interest expense decreased $55 million compared with the
third quarter of 2019 and $11 million compared with the second
quarter of 2020. The decrease compared with the third quarter of
2019 primarily reflects the lease-related impairment of $70
million recorded in the third quarter of 2019 and corporate
treasury activity. The decrease compared with the second quarter
of 2020 primarily reflects corporate treasury activity.
Noninterest expense decreased $25 million compared with the
third quarter of 2019 and $39 million compared with the second
quarter of 2020. Both decreases primarily reflects lower staff
expense.
Year-to-date 2020 compared with year-to-date 2019
Loss before taxes decreased $110 million compared with the first
nine months of 2019. Total loss decreased $90 million, primarily
reflecting the lease-related impairment of $70 million recorded in
the third quarter of 2019 and corporate treasury activity.
Noninterest expense decreased $34 million compared with the
first nine months of 2019, primarily reflecting lower staff expense
and higher intersegment eliminations, partially offset by higher
pension expense.

Consolidated balance sheet reviewOne of our key risk management objectives is to maintain abalance sheet that remains strong throughout market cycles tomeet the expectations of our major stakeholders, including ourshareholders, clients, creditors and regulators.We also seek to undertake overall liquidity risk, includingintraday liquidity risk, that stays within our risk appetite. Theobjective of our balance sheet management strategy is to maintaina balance sheet that is characterized by strong liquidity and assetquality, ready access to external funding sources at competitiverates and a strong capital structure that supports our risk-takingactivities and is adequate to absorb potential losses. In managingthe balance sheet, appropriate consideration is given to balancingthe competing needs of maintaining sufficient levels of liquidityand complying with applicable regulations and supervisoryexpectations while optimizing profitability.At Sept. 30, 2020, total assets were $428 billion, compared with$382 billion at Dec. 31, 2019. The increase in total assets wasprimarily driven by higher securities and interest-bearing depositswith the Federal Reserve and other central banks, resulting fromsignificant deposit inflows. Deposits totaled $296 billion at Sept.30, 2020, compared with $259 billion at Dec. 31, 2019. Theincrease reflects the current macroeconomic environment. Totalinterest-bearing deposits as a percentage of total interest-earningassets were 58% at Sept. 30, 2020 and 62% at Dec. 31, 2019.At Sept. 30, 2020, available funds totaled $159 billion whichinclude cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits withthe Federal Reserve and other central banks, interest-bearingdeposits with banks and federal funds sold and securitiespurchased under resale agreements. This compares with availablefunds of $145 billion at Dec. 31, 2019. Total available funds as apercentage of total assets were 37% at Sept. 30, 2020 and 38% atDec. 31, 2019. For additional information on our available funds,see “Liquidity and dividends.”Securities were $155 billion, or 36% of total assets, at Sept. 30,2020, compared with $123 billion, or 32% of total assets, at Dec.31, 2019. The increase primarily reflects investments in U.S.Treasury securities, agency residential mortgage-backedsecurities (“RMBS”), supranational securities, andBNY Mellon 21
U.S. government agency securities and an increase in the
unrealized pre-tax gain. For additional information on our
securities portfolio, see “Securities” and Note 4 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Loans were $55.5 billion, or 13% of total assets, at Sept. 30,
2020, compared with $55.0 billion, or 14% of total assets, at Dec.
31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by higher overdrafts
and commercial real estate loans, partially offset by lower loans
to financial institutions. For additional information on our loan
portfolio, see “Loans” and Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Long-term debt totaled $26.1 billion at Sept. 30, 2020 and $27.5
billion at Dec. 31, 2019. Maturities and redemptions were
partially offset by issuances and an increase in the fair value of
hedged long-term debt. For additional information on long-termdebt, see “Liquidity and dividends.”
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total shareholders’
equity increased to $44.9 billion at
Sept. 30, 2020 from $41.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2019. For additionalinformation, see “Capital.”Country risk exposureThe following table presents BNY Mellon’s top 10 exposures bycountry (excluding the U.S.) as of Sept. 30, 2020, as well ascertain countries with higher-risk profiles, and is presented on aninternal risk management basis. We monitor our exposure tothese and other countries as part of our internal country riskmanagement process.
The country risk exposure below reflects the Company’s risk toan immediate default of the counterparty or obligor based on thecountry of residence of the entity which incurs the liability. Ifthere is credit risk mitigation, the country of residence of theentity providing the risk mitigation is the country of risk. Thecountry of risk for securities is generally based on the domicile ofthe issuer of the security.

Based on our internal country risk management process at Sept.
30, 2020, our largest country risk exposure was to the UK, which
withdrew from the European Union (“EU”) on Jan. 31, 2020. For
additional information, see “Other Matters - UK’s Withdrawal
from the EU (“Brexit”)” and “Risk
Factors - The UK’s withdrawal from the EU may have negativeeffects on global economic conditions, global financial markets,and our business and results of operations” both included in our2019 Annual Report.
22 BNY Mellon
Events in recent years have resulted in increased focus on Italy
and Brazil. The country risk exposure to Italy primarily consists
of investment grade sovereign debt. The country risk exposure to
Brazil is primarily short-term trade finance loans extended to
large financial institutions. We also have operations in Brazil
providing investment services and investment management
services.

The fair value of our securities portfolio, including related
hedges, was $155.1 billion at Sept. 30, 2020, compared with
$122.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2019. The increase primarily reflects
investments in U.S. Treasury, agency RMBS, supranational and
U.S. government agency securities and an increase in unrealized
pre-tax gain.
Included in the securities portfolio at Sept. 30, 2020 were $159million of commercial paper and $198 million of CDs purchasedfrom affiliated money market mutual funds in order to provideliquidity support to the funds.

At Sept. 30, 2020, the securities portfolio had a net unrealized
gain, including the impact of related hedges, of $3.3 billion,
compared with $796 million at Dec. 31, 2019. The increase in the
net unrealized pre-tax gain was primarily driven by lower market

Sept. 30, 2020, a decrease of 5% compared with Dec. 31, 2019,
primarily reflecting a decrease in loans to banks and unfunded
commitments to the securities industry.
Financial institution exposures are high quality, with 95% of the
exposures meeting the investment grade equivalent criteria of our
internal credit rating classification at Sept. 30, 2020. Each
customer is assigned an internal credit rating, which is mapped to
an equivalent external rating agency grade based upon a number
of dimensions, which are continually evaluated and may change
over time. For ratings of non-U.S. counterparties, our internal
credit rating is generally capped at a rating equivalent to the
sovereign rating of the country where the counterparty resides,
regardless of the internal credit rating assigned to the
counterparty or the underlying collateral.
In addition, 75% of the financial institutions exposure is secured.
For example, securities industry clients and asset managers often
borrow against marketable securities held in custody.
The exposure to financial institutions is generally short-term, with
89% of the exposures expiring within one year. At Sept. 30, 2020,
61% of the exposure to financial institutions had an expiration
within 90 days, compared with 18% at Dec. 31, 2019.
Secured intraday credit facilities represent approximately 40% ofthe exposure in the financial institutions portfolio and arereviewed and reapproved annually.
At Sept. 30, 2020, the secured intraday credit provided to dealersin connection with their tri-party repo activity totaled $18.9billion and was included in the securities industry portfolio.Dealers secure the outstanding intraday credit with high-qualityliquid collateral having a market value in excess of the amount ofthe outstanding credit.
Our banks exposure primarily relates to our global trade finance.These exposures are short-term in nature, with 97% due in lessthan one year. The investment grade percentage of our banksexposure was 85% at Sept. 30, 2020, compared with 77% at Dec.31, 2019. Our non-investment grade exposures are primarily tradefinance loans in Brazil.
The asset managers portfolio exposure is high-quality, with 98%of the exposures meeting our investment grade equivalent ratingscriteria as of Sept. 30, 2020. These exposures are generally shortterm liquidity facilities, with the majority to regulated mutualfunds.

increased exposure in the services and other and energy and
utilities portfolios.
We have $734 million of total direct exposure to the oil and gas
industry, most of which is reflected in the energy and utilities
portfolio in the table above. This exposure is to exploration and

real estate facilities are focused on experienced owners and are
structured with moderate leverage based on existing cash flows.
Our commercial real estate lending activities also include
construction and renovation facilities. Our client base consists of
experienced developers and long-term holders of real estate
assets. Loans are approved on the basis of existing or projected
cash flows and supported by appraisals and knowledge of local
market conditions. Development loans are structured with
moderate leverage, and in many instances, involve some level of
recourse to the developer.
At Sept. 30, 2020, the unsecured portfolio consists of real estate
investment trusts (“REITs”) and real estate operating companies,
which are both primarily investment grade.
At Sept. 30, 2020, our commercial real estate portfolio consisted
of the following concentrations: New York metro - 39%; REITs
and real estate operating companies - 36%; and other - 25%.
Lease financings
The lease financings portfolio exposure totaled $1.1 billion at
Sept. 30, 2020 and Dec. 31, 2019. At Sept. 30, 2020,
approximately 98% of leasing exposure was investment grade, or
investment grade equivalent and consisted of exposures backed
by well-diversified assets, primarily large-ticket transportation
equipment and real estate. The largest component of our lease
residual value exposure is freight-related rail cars.
Assets are both domestic and foreign-based, with primaryconcentrations in the U.S. and Germany.
Other residential mortgagesThe other residential mortgages portfolio primarily consists of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and totaled $423 million atSept. 30, 2020 and $494 million at Dec. 31, 2019. Included in thisportfolio at Sept. 30, 2020 were $76 million of mortgage loanspurchased in 2005, 2006 and the first quarter of 2007, of which19% of the serviced loan balance was at least 60 days delinquent.Overdrafts
Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities clearanceclients and are generally repaid within two business days.Other loans
Other loans primarily include loans to consumers that are fullycollateralized with equities, mutual funds and fixed-incomesecurities.
Margin loans
Margin loan exposure of $13.6 billion at Sept. 30, 2020 and $13.5billion at Dec. 31, 2019 was collateralized with marketablesecurities. Borrowers are required to maintain a daily collateralmargin in excess of 100% of the value of the loan. Margin loansincluded $3.6 billion at Sept. 30, 2020 and Dec. 31, 2019 relatedto a term loan program that offers fully collateralized loans tobroker-dealers.

Allowance for credit losses
Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade clients who
are active users of our non-credit services. Our primary exposure
to the credit risk of a customer consists of funded loans, unfunded
contractual commitments to lend, standby letters of credit
(“SBLC”) and overdrafts associated with our custody and
securities clearance businesses.
On Jan. 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments– Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on FinancialInstruments, on a prospective basis. See Note 2 of the Notes toConsolidated Financial Statements for the significant accountingpolicy related to allowance for credit losses on loans and lendingrelated commitments.
The following table details changes in our allowance for credit losses.

N/A - Not applicable.
The provision for credit losses of $9 million in the third quarter of
2020 reflects a fairly consistent macroeconomic outlook
compared with the second quarter of 2020.
We had $13.5 billion of secured margin loans on our balance
sheet at Sept. 30, 2020 compared with $13.4 billion at Dec. 31,
2019. We have rarely suffered a loss on these types of loans. As a
result, we believe that the ratio of allowance for loan losses and
lending-related commitments as a percentage of nonmargin loans is a more appropriate metric to measure theadequacy of the reserve.
The allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-relatedcommitments represent management’s estimate of lifetimeexpected losses in our credit portfolio. This evaluation process issubject to numerous estimates and judgments. To the extentactual results differ from forecasts or management’s judgment,the allowance for credit losses may be greater or less than futurecharge-offs.
28 BNY Mellon
Based on an evaluation of the allowance for credit losses as discussed in “Critical accounting estimates” and Note 2 of the Notes toConsolidated Financial Statements, we have allocated our allowance for loans and lending-related commitments as presented below.Allocation of allowance for loan losses and lending-related commitments
Sept. 30, 2020 June 30, 2020Dec. 31, 2019Sept. 30, 2019Commercial real estate 84 %81 %35 %35 %Commercial 6 9 28 27 Financial institutions 2 4 9 9 Other residential mortgages 4 3 6 6 Wealth management (b) 3 2 9 9 Lease financings 1 1 2 1 Foreign —(a) — (a) 11 13 Total 100 %100 %100 %100 %(a) The allowance related to foreign exposure has been reclassified to the respective classes of financing receivables.
(b) Includes the allowance for credit losses on wealth management mortgages.
The allocation of the allowance for credit losses is inherently
judgmental, and the entire allowance for credit losses is available
to absorb credit losses regardless of the nature of the losses.
Our allowance for credit losses is sensitive to a number of inputs,
most notably the credit ratings assigned to each borrower as well
as macroeconomic forecast assumptions that are incorporated in
our estimate of credit losses through the expected life of the loan
portfolio. Thus, as the macroeconomic environment and related
forecasts change, the allowance for credit losses may change
materially. The following sensitivity analyses do not represent
management’s expectations of the deterioration of our portfolios
or the economic environment, but are provided as hypothetical
scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for credit
losses to changes in key inputs. If each credit were rated one
grade better, the allowance would have decreased by $119
million, and if each credit were rated one grade worse, the
allowance would have increased by $146 million. Our multiscenario based macroeconomic forecast used in determining the
Sept. 30, 2020 allowance for credit losses consisted of three
recessionary scenarios, each of varying severity and duration. The
baseline scenario reflects moderate recovery across most key
variables, whereas the upside scenario is principally a V-shaped
recovery, and the downside scenario is reflective of W-shaped
recovery in GDP and unemployment and deeper reductions in
asset prices compared to the baseline. We placed the most weight
on our baseline scenario, with the remaining weighting resulting
in slightly
more weight placed on the downside scenario than the upsidescenario. From a sensitivity perspective, at Sept. 30, 2020, if wehad applied 100% weighting to the downside scenario, theallowance for credit losses would have been approximately $245million higher.

Lost interest
Interest revenue would have increased by $1 million in the third
quarter of 2020, second quarter of 2020 and the third quarter of
2019 and $4 million in the first nine months of 2020 and first nine
months of 2019, if nonperforming loans at period-end had been
performing for the entire respective periods.
Loan modifications
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, there have been two forms of
relief provided for classifying loans as troubled debt
restructurings (“TDRs”): The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and
Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) and the Interagency
Guidance. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional details on this guidance. Financial
institutions may account for eligible loan modifications either
under the CARES Act or the Interagency Guidance and we have
elected to apply both, as applicable, in providing borrowers with
loan modification relief in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
We modified loans of $106 million in the third quarter of 2020
and $282 million in the second quarter of 2020. Nearly all of the
modifications were short-term loan payment forbearances or
modified principal and/or interest payments. These loans were
primarily residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans.
We also modified loans of $56 million in the third quarter of
2020, a majority of which were commercial real estate loans, by
providing long-term loan payment modifications and an extension
of maturity. We did not identify any of the modifications as
TDRs. None of these loans were reported as past due or
nonperforming at Sept. 30, 2020. At Sept. 30, 2020, the unpaid
principal balance of the loans modified under the CARES Act or
Interagency Guidance was $174 million. We modified residential
mortgage loans of $4 million in the third quarter of 2019.
Deposits
Increased volatility coupled with the interest rate environment has
led to an increase in deposit levels as our clients increased the
levels of cash placed with us. Total deposits were $296.3 billion
at Sept. 30, 2020, an increase of 14%, compared with $259.5
billion at Dec. 31, 2019.
Noninterest-bearing deposits were $79.5 billion at Sept. 30, 2020,
compared with $57.6 billion at Dec.
31, 2019. Interest-bearing deposits were $216.8 billion at Sept.30, 2020, compared with $201.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2019. See“Impact of coronavirus pandemic on our business” for additionalinformation.
Short-term borrowingsWe fund ourselves primarily through deposits and, to a lesserextent, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Shortterm borrowings consist of federal funds purchased and securitiessold under repurchase agreements, payables to customers andbroker-dealers, commercial paper and other borrowed funds.Certain short-term borrowings, for example, securities sold underrepurchase agreements, require the delivery of securities ascollateral.

Funding liquidity riskis the risk that BNY Mellon cannot meet its cash and collateralobligations at a reasonable cost for both expected and unexpectedcash flow and collateral needs without adversely affecting dailyoperations or our financial condition. Funding liquidity risk canarise from funding mismatches, market constraints from theinability to convert assets into cash, the inability to hold or raiseBNY Mellon 31
cash, low overnight deposits, deposit run-off or contingent
liquidity events.
Changes in economic conditions or exposure to credit, market,
operational, legal and reputational risks also can affect BNY
Mellon’s liquidity risk profile and are considered in our liquidity
risk framework. See “Impact of coronavirus pandemic on our
business” for additional information.
The Parent’s policy is to have access to sufficient unencumbered
cash and cash equivalents at each quarter-end to cover maturities
and other forecasted debt redemptions, net interest payments and
net tax payments for the following 18-month period, and to
provide sufficient collateral to satisfy transactions subject to
Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. As of Sept. 30, 2020, the
Parent was in compliance with this policy.
For additional information on our liquidity policy, see “Risk
Management - Liquidity Risk” in our 2019 Annual Report.
We monitor and control liquidity exposures and funding needswithin and across significant legal entities, branches, currenciesand business lines, taking into account, among other factors, anyapplicable restrictions on the transfer of liquidity among entities.BNY Mellon also manages potential intraday liquidity risks. Wemonitor and manage intraday liquidity against existing andexpected intraday liquid resources (such as cash balances,remaining intraday credit capacity, intraday contingency fundingand available collateral) to enable BNY Mellon to meet itsintraday obligations under normal and reasonably severe stressedconditions.
We define available funds for internal liquidity managementpurposes as cash and due from banks, interest-bearing depositswith the Federal Reserve and other central banks, interest-bearingdeposits with banks and federal funds sold and securitiespurchased under resale agreements. The following table presentsour total available funds at period end and on an average basis.Available funds

compared with $144.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2019. The increase was
primarily due to higher interest-bearing deposits with the Federal
Reserve and other central banks.
Average non-core sources of funds, such as federal funds
purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements,
trading liabilities, commercial paper and other borrowed funds,
were $19.7 billion for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2020 and
$18.9 billion for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2019. The
increase primarily reflects an increase in federal funds purchased
and securities sold under repurchase agreements, partially offset
by decreases in commercial paper and other borrowed funds.
Average foreign deposits, primarily from our European-basedInvestment Services businesses, were $105.0 billion for the ninemonths ended Sept. 30, 2020, compared with $92.5 billion for thenine months ended Sept. 30, 2019. Average interest-bearingdomestic deposits were $101.6 billion for the nine months endedSept. 30, 2020 and $75.8 billion for the nine months ended Sept.30, 2019. The increase primarily reflects increased client activity.Average payables to customers and broker-dealers were $17.9billion for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2020 and $15.7 billionfor the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2019. Payables to customersand broker-dealers are driven by customer trading activity andmarket volatility.

Average long-term debt was $27.3 billion for the nine months
ended Sept. 30, 2020 and $28.1 billion for the nine months ended
Sept. 30, 2019.
Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased to $66.9 billion
for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2020 from $52.2 billion for
the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2019, primarily reflecting client
activity.
A significant reduction in our Investment Services business
would reduce our access to deposits. See
“Asset/liability management” for additional factors that couldimpact our deposit balances.
Sources of liquidityThe Parent’s three major sources of liquidity are access to thedebt and equity markets, dividends from its subsidiaries, and cashon hand and cash otherwise made available in business-as-usualcircumstances to the Parent through a committed credit facilitywith our intermediate holding company (“IHC”).Our ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms, or at all, is partially dependent on our credit ratings, which are as follows:Credit ratings at Sept. 30, 2020

Long-term debt totaled $26.1 billion at Sept. 30, 2020 and $27.5
billion at Dec. 31, 2019. Maturities of $2.05 billion and
redemptions of $2.35 billion were partially offset by issuances of
$2.25 billion and an increase in the fair value of hedged longterm debt. The Parent had $800 million of 2.45% senior notes
scheduled to mature in the remainder of 2020. These notes were
redeemed in October 2020 at par plus accrued and unpaid
interest.
In November 2020, the Parent issued 582,500 depositary shares,
each representing a 1/100th interest in a share of the Parent’s
Series H Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (the “Series HPreferred Stock”). The Series H Preferred Stock has a liquidation
preference of $100,000 per share. The
Parent will pay dividends on the Series H Preferred Stock, ifdeclared by its board of directors, on each March 20, June 20,September 20 and December 20, commencing on March 20,2021, at an annual rate equal to 3.70% from the original issuedate to but excluding, March 20, 2026; and at a floating rate equalto the five-year treasury rate (as defined in the certificate ofdesignations) on the date that is three business days prior to thereset date plus 3.352% for each reset period, from and includingMarch 20, 2026. The floating rate will initially reset on March 20,2026 and subsequently on each date falling on the fifthanniversary of the preceding reset date.
The Parent will use the net proceeds, after deducting theunderwriting discount and estimated offeringBNY Mellon 33
expenses, of approximately $575 million from the sale of the
depositary shares to redeem all outstanding shares of the Series C
Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, $100,000 liquidation
preference per share (the “Series C Preferred Stock”). On Nov. 4,
2020, the Parent issued a notice of redemption to the holders of
the Series C Preferred Stock to redeem in full the Series C
Preferred Stock on Dec. 20, 2020. Deferred fees of approximately
$15 million will be realized as preferred stock dividends upon
redemption.
The Bank of New York Mellon may issue notes and CDs. At
Sept. 30, 2020 and Dec. 31, 2019 there were $137 million and
$1.1 billion, respectively, of CDs outstanding. At Sept. 30, 2020
and Dec. 31, 2019, $30 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, of
notes were outstanding.
The Bank of New York Mellon also issues commercial paper that
matures within 397 days from the date of issue and is not
redeemable prior to maturity or subject to voluntary prepayment.
The average commercial paper outstanding was $1.4 billion for
the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2020 and $2.7 billion for the nine
months ended Sept. 30, 2019. Commercial paper outstanding was
$671 million at Sept. 30, 2020 and $4.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2019.
Subsequent to Sept. 30, 2020, our U.S. bank subsidiaries could
declare dividends to the Parent of approximately $973 million,
without the need for a regulatory waiver. In addition, at Sept. 30,
2020, non-bank subsidiaries of the Parent had liquid assets of
approximately $1.6 billion. Restrictions on our ability to obtain
funds from our subsidiaries are discussed in more detail in
“Supervision and Regulation - Capital Planning and Stress
Testing - Payment of Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Other
Capital Distributions” and in Note 19 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report.
Pershing LLC has uncommitted lines of credit in place for
liquidity purposes which are guaranteed by the Parent. Pershing
LLC has two separate uncommitted lines of credit amounting to
$350 million in aggregate. Average borrowings under these lines
were $4 million, in aggregate, in the third quarter of 2020.
Pershing Limited, an indirect UK-based subsidiary of BNY
Mellon, has three separate uncommitted lines of credit amounting
to $350 million in aggregate. Average borrowings under
these lines were $4 million, in aggregate, in the third quarter of2020.
BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC also has an uncommitted lineof credit in place for $100 million for liquidity purposes. Therewere no borrowings under this line in the third quarter of 2020.The double leverage ratio is the ratio of our equity investment insubsidiaries divided by our consolidated Parent company equity,which includes our noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Inshort, the double leverage ratio measures the extent to whichequity in subsidiaries is financed by Parent company debt. As thedouble leverage ratio increases, this can reflect greater demandson a company’s cash flows in order to service interest paymentsand debt maturities. BNY Mellon’s double leverage ratio ismanaged in a range considering the high level of unencumberedavailable liquid assets held in its principal subsidiaries (such ascentral bank deposit placements and government securities), theCompany’s cash generating fee-based business model, with feerevenue representing 81% of total revenue in the third quarter of2020, and the dividend capacity of our banking subsidiaries. Ourdouble leverage ratio was 115.4% at Sept. 30, 2020 and 116.9%at Dec. 31, 2019, and within the range targeted by management.Uses of funds
The Parent’s major uses of funds are repurchases of commonstock, payment of dividends, principal and interest payments onits borrowings, acquisitions and additional investments in itssubsidiaries.
In August 2020, a quarterly cash dividend of $0.31 per commonshare was paid to common shareholders. Our common stockdividend payout ratio was 32% for the third quarter of 2020.In the third quarter of 2020, we repurchased 15.1 thousandcommon shares from employees, primarily in connection with theemployees’ payment of taxes upon the vesting of restricted stock,at an average price of $36.65 per common share for a total cost ofless than $1 million.
In June 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that it wouldrequire participating CCAR firms, including us, to update andresubmit their capital plans and that, as a result, unless otherwiseapproved by the Federal
34 BNY Mellon
Reserve, participating firms were not permitted, during the third
quarter of 2020, to conduct open market common stock
repurchases, to increase their common stock dividends or to pay
common stock dividends that exceed average net income for the
preceding four quarters. On Sept. 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve
extended these limitations through the fourth quarter of 2020.
BNY Mellon intends to resume the common stock repurchase
program as early as possible, depending on factors such as
prevailing market conditions, our outlook for the economic
environment and the additional capital analysis required by the
Federal Reserve. See “Recent regulatory developments” for
additional information related to the 2020 CCAR.
Liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”)
U.S. regulators have established an LCR that requires certain
banking organizations, including BNY Mellon, to maintain a
minimum amount of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets
(“HQLA”) sufficient to withstand the net cash outflow under a
hypothetical standardized acute liquidity stress scenario for a 30-
day time horizon.
The following table presents BNY Mellon’s consolidated HQLAat Sept. 30, 2020, and the average HQLA and average LCR for
the third quarter of 2020.
Consolidated HQLA and LCR Sept. 30, 2020 (dollars in billions)
Securities (a) $ 120
Cash (b) 103
Total consolidated HQLA (c) $ 223
Total consolidated HQLA – average (c) $ 213
Average LCR 111 %(a) Primarily includes securities of U.S. government-sponsored enterprises,
sovereign securities, U.S. Treasury, U.S. agency and investment-grade
corporate debt.
(b) Primarily includes cash on deposit with central banks.
(c) Consolidated HQLA presented before adjustments. After haircuts and the
impact of trapped liquidity, consolidated HQLA totaled $163 billion at Sept.
30, 2020 and averaged $154 billion for the third quarter of 2020.
BNY Mellon and each of our affected domestic bank subsidiaries
were compliant with the U.S. LCR requirements of at least 100%throughout the third quarter of 2020.
Statement of cash flows
The following summarizes the activity reflected on theconsolidated statement of cash flows. While this information maybe helpful to highlight certain macro trends and businessstrategies, the cash flow analysis may not be as relevant whenanalyzing changes in our net earnings and net assets. We believethat in addition to the traditional cash flow analysis, thediscussion related to liquidity and dividends and asset/liabilitymanagement herein may provide more useful context inevaluating our liquidity position and related activity.Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.9 billion in thenine months ended Sept. 30, 2020, compared with $2.6 billion inthe nine months ended Sept. 30, 2019. In the nine months endedSept. 30, 2020, cash flows provided by operations primarilyresulted from earnings and changes in trading assets andliabilities. In the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2019, cash flowsprovided by operations primarily resulted from earnings, partiallyoffset by changes in trading assets and liabilities.Net cash used for investing activities was $44.3 billion in the ninemonths ended Sept. 30, 2020, compared with $5.2 billion in thenine months ended Sept. 30, 2019. In the nine months ended Sept.30, 2020, net cash used for investing activities primarily reflectsnet changes in securities and changes in interest-bearing depositswith the Federal Reserve and other central banks. In the ninemonths ended Sept. 30, 2019, net cash used for investingactivities primarily reflects changes in interest-bearing depositswith the Federal Reserve and other central banks, partially offsetby changes in federal funds sold and securities purchased underresale agreements.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $38.1 billion in thenine months ended Sept. 30, 2020, compared with $3.5 billion inthe nine months ended Sept. 30, 2019. In the nine months endedSept. 30, 2020, net cash provided by financing activity reflectschanges in deposits, payables to customers and broker-dealersand federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchaseagreements, partially offset by changes in commercial paper. Inthe nine months ended Sept. 30, 2019, net cash provided byfinancing activities primarily reflects changes in deposits and netproceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, partially offset byrepayments of long-term debt, changes in federal funds purchasedand
BNY Mellon 35
securities sold under repurchase agreements, changes in other
borrowed funds and common stock repurchases.

equity increased to $44.9 billion at Sept. 30, 2020 from $41.5
billion at Dec. 31, 2019. The increase primarily reflects earnings,
unrealized gains on assets available-for-sale and the issuance of
preferred stock in May 2020, partially offset by common stock
repurchases and dividend payments.
In May 2020, the Parent issued 1,000,000 depositary shares, each
representing a 1/100th interest in a share of the Parent’s Series GNoncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (the “Series G
Preferred Stock”). The Series G Preferred Stock has a liquidation
preference of $100,000 per share. The Parent will pay dividends
on the Series G Preferred Stock, if declared by its board of
directors, on each March 20 and September 20, at an annual rate
equal to 4.70% from the original issue date to but excluding,
Sept. 20, 2025; and at a floating rate equal to the five-year
treasury rate (as defined in the certificate of designations) on the
date that is three business days prior to the reset date plus 4.358%for each reset period, from and including Sept. 20, 2025. The
floating rate will initially reset on Sept. 20, 2025 and
subsequently on each date falling on the fifth anniversary of the
preceding reset date.
In November 2020, the Parent issued 582,500 depositary shares,each representing a 1/100th interest in a share of the Parent’sSeries H Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (the “Series HPreferred Stock”). The Series H Preferred Stock has a liquidationpreference of $100,000 per share. The Parent will pay dividendson the Series H Preferred Stock, if declared by its board ofdirectors, on each March 20, June 20, September 20 andDecember 20, commencing on March 20, 2021, at an annual rateequal to 3.70% from the original issue date to but excluding,March 20, 2026; and at a floating rate equal to the five-yeartreasury rate (as defined in the certificate of designations) on thedate that is three business days prior to the reset date plus 3.352%for each reset period, from and including March 20, 2026. Thefloating rate will initially reset on March 20, 2026 andsubsequently on each date falling on the fifth anniversary of thepreceding reset date.
The Parent will use the net proceeds, after deducting theunderwriting discount and estimated offering expenses, ofapproximately $575 million from the sale of the depositary sharesto redeem all outstanding shares of the Series C Preferred Stock.On Nov. 4, 2020, the Parent issued a notice of redemption to theholders of the Series C Preferred Stock to redeem in full theSeries C Preferred Stock on Dec. 20, 2020.36 BNY Mellon
Deferred fees of approximately $15 million will be realized as
preferred stock dividends upon redemption.
The unrealized gain (after-tax) on our available-for-sale securities
portfolio, net of hedges, included in accumulated OCI was $1.4
billion at Sept. 30, 2020, compared with $361 million at Dec. 31,
2019. The increase in the unrealized gain, net of tax, was
primarily driven by lower market interest rates.
In the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2020, we repurchased 21.8
million common shares at an average price of $45.43 per
common share for a total of $988 million, nearly all of which
were repurchased prior to the temporary suspension of share
repurchases in March 2020.
In June 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that it would
require participating CCAR firms, including us, to update and
resubmit their capital plans and that, as a result, unless otherwise
approved by the Federal Reserve, participating firms were not
permitted, during the third quarter of 2020, to conduct open
market common stock repurchases, to increase their common
stock dividends or to pay common stock dividends that exceed
average net income for the preceding four quarters. On Sept. 30,
2020, the Federal Reserve extended these limitations through the
fourth quarter of 2020.
BNY Mellon intends to resume the common stock repurchase
program as early as possible, depending on factors such as
prevailing market conditions, our outlook for the economic
environment and the additional capital analysis required by the
Federal Reserve. For additional information, see “Recent
regulatory developments.”
Capital adequacy
Regulators establish certain levels of capital for bank holdingcompanies (“BHCs”) and banks, including BNY Mellon and ourbank subsidiaries, in accordance with established quantitativemeasurements. For the Parent to maintain its status as a financialholding company (“FHC”), our U.S. bank subsidiaries and BNYMellon must, among other things, qualify as “well capitalized.”As of Sept. 30, 2020 and Dec. 31, 2019, BNY Mellon and ourU.S. bank subsidiaries were “well capitalized.”Failure to satisfy regulatory standards, including “wellcapitalized” status or capital adequacy rules more generally,could result in limitations on our activities and adversely affectour financial condition. See the discussion of these matters in“Supervision and Regulation - Regulated Entities of BNY Mellonand Ancillary Regulatory Requirements” and “Risk Factors -Operational Risk - Failure to satisfy regulatory standards,including “well capitalized” and “well managed” status or capitaladequacy and liquidity rules more generally, could result inlimitations on our activities and adversely affect ourbusiness and financial condition,” both of which are in our 2019Annual Report.
The U.S. banking agencies’ capital rules are based on theframework adopted by the Basel Committee on BankingSupervision (“BCBS”), as amended from time to time. Foradditional information on these capital requirements, see“Supervision and Regulation” in our 2019 Annual Report and“Recent regulatory developments” in this Form 10-Q.BNY Mellon 37

The U.S. global systemically important banks (“G-SIB”)surcharge of 1.5% is subject to change. The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set to 0%. Effective Oct. 1, 2020, the stress capital buffer (“SCB”) requirement is2.5%, equal to the regulatory minimum, and replaces the current 2.5% capital conservation buffer for Standardized Approach capital ratios.
(b) For our CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, our effective capital ratios under U.S. capital rules are the lower of the ratios as calculated under the Standardizedand Advanced Approaches. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is based on Tier 1 capital and quarterly average total assets.
(c) The Federal Reserve’s regulations do not establish well capitalized thresholds for these measures for BHCs.
(d) The SLR is based on Tier 1 capital and total leverage exposure, which includes certain off-balance sheet exposures. The SLR at Sept. 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020 reflectsthe exclusion of certain central bank placements from leverage exposure.
(e) The SLR at Sept. 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020 reflects the temporary exclusion of U.S. Treasury securities from the leverage exposure which increased our consolidated SLRby 78 basis points and 40 basis points, respectively.
Our CET1 ratio determined under the Advanced Approaches was
13.0% at Sept. 30, 2020 and 11.5% at Dec. 31, 2019. The
increase primarily reflects capital generated through earnings and
unrealized gains on assets available-for-sale, partially offset by
capital deployed through common stock repurchased, prior to the
temporary suspension of share repurchases that began in March
2020, and dividend payments.
Our operational loss risk model is informed by external losses,
including fines and penalties levied against institutions in the
financial services industry, particularly those that relate to
businesses in which we operate, and as a result external losses
have
impacted and could in the future impact the amount of capital thatwe are required to hold.
Our capital ratios are necessarily subject to, among other things,anticipated compliance with all necessary enhancements to modelcalibration, approval by regulators of certain models used as partof RWA calculations, other refinements, further implementationguidance from regulators, market practices and standards and anychanges BNY Mellon may make to its businesses. As aconsequence of these factors, our capital ratios may materiallychange, and may be volatile over time and from period to period.38 BNY Mellon

period end and the levels and types of investments in assets. The
balance sheet size fluctuates from period to period based on
levels of customer and market activity. In general, when servicing
clients are more actively trading securities, deposit balances and
the balance sheet as a whole are higher. In addition, when
markets experience significant volatility or stress, our balance
sheet size may increase considerably as client deposit levels
increase.
Effective April 1, 2020, custody banks, including BNY Mellon
and The Bank of New York Mellon, are permitted to exclude
certain central bank placements from leverage exposure used in
the SLR calculation. Also, effective April 1, 2020 and lasting
through March 31, 2021, BHCs are permitted to temporarily
exclude U.S. Treasury securities from the leverage exposure used
in the SLR calculation. This temporary exclusion increased our
consolidated SLR by 78 basis points at Sept. 30, 2020 and 40
basis points at June 30, 2020. See “Supervision and Regulation”
in our 2019 Annual Report and “Recent regulatory
developments” in our First Quarter 2020 Form 10-Q for
additional information.
Stress capital buffer
In August 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that BNY
Mellon’s SCB requirement would be 2.5%, equal to the
regulatory minimum, effective as of Oct. 1, 2020. The SCB
replaces the current 2.5% capital conservation buffer for
Standardized Approach capital ratios.
The SCB final rule generally eliminates the requirement for prior
approval of common stock repurchases in excess of the
distributions in a firm’s capital plan, provided that such
distributions are consistent with applicable capital requirements,
including the SCB. In conjunction with the release of the 2020
CCAR results, the Federal Reserve has imposed restrictions on
capital distributions for the third quarter of 2020, which have
been extended through the fourth quarter of 2020. For more detail
regarding these restrictions, see “Recent regulatory developments- CCAR 2020 results” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (“TLAC”)The final TLAC rule establishing external TLAC, external longterm debt (“LTD”) and related requirements for U.S. G-SIBs,including BNY Mellon, at the top-tier holding company levelbecame effective on Jan. 1, 2019.

Trading activities and risk management
Our trading activities are focused on acting as a market-maker for
our customers, facilitating customer trades and risk mitigating
hedging in compliance with the Volcker Rule. The risk frommarket-making activities for customers is managed by our traders
and limited in total exposure through a system of position limits,
value-at-risk (“VaR”) methodology and other market sensitivity
measures. VaR is the potential loss in value due to adverse
market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified
confidence level. The calculation of our VaR used by
management and presented below assumes a one-day holding
period, utilizes a 99% confidence level and incorporates nonlinear product characteristics. VaR facilitates comparisons across
portfolios of different risk characteristics. VaR also captures the
diversification of aggregated risk at the firm-wide level.
VaR represents a key risk management measure and it is
important to note the inherent limitations to VaR, which include: • VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer time
horizons where moves may be extreme;
• VaR does not take account of potential variability of marketliquidity; and• Previous moves in market risk factors may not produceaccurate predictions of all future market moves.See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statementsfor additional information on the VaR methodology.The following tables indicate the calculated VaR amounts for thetrading portfolio for the designated periods using the historicalsimulation VaR model.

N/M - Because the minimum and maximum may occur on different days for different risk
components, it is not meaningful to compute a minimum and maximum portfolio
diversification effect.
The interest rate component of VaR represents instruments whose
values are predominantly driven by interest rate levels. These
instruments include, but are not limited to, U.S. Treasury
securities, swaps, swaptions, forward rate agreements, exchangetraded futures and options, and other interest rate derivative
products.
The foreign exchange component of VaR represents instruments
whose values predominantly vary with the level or volatility of
currency exchange rates or interest rates. These instruments
include, but are not limited to, currency balances, spot and
forward transactions, currency options and other currency
derivative products.
The equity component of VaR consists of instruments that
represent an ownership interest in the form of domestic and
foreign common stock or other equity-linked instruments. These
instruments include, but are not limited to, common stock,
exchange-traded funds, preferred stock, listed equity options (puts
and calls), OTC equity options, equity total return swaps, equity
index futures and other equity derivative products.
The credit component of VaR represents instruments whose
values are predominantly driven by credit spread levels, i.e.,
idiosyncratic default risk. These instruments include, but are not
limited to, securities with exposures from corporate and
municipal credit spreads.
The diversification component of VaR is the risk reduction
benefit that occurs when combining
portfolios and offsetting positions, and from the correlatedbehavior of risk factor movements.
During the third quarter of 2020, interest rate risk generated 29%of average gross VaR, foreign exchange risk generated 36% ofaverage gross VaR, equity risk generated 4% of average grossVaR and credit risk generated 31% of average gross VaR. Duringthe third quarter of 2020, our daily trading loss did not exceed ourcalculated VaR amount of the overall portfolio.The following table of total daily trading revenue or lossillustrates the number of trading days in which our tradingrevenue or loss fell within particular ranges during the past fivequarters.

Trading assets include debt and equity instruments and derivativeassets, primarily interest rate and foreign exchange contracts, notdesignated as hedging instruments. Trading assets were $13.1billion at Sept. 30, 2020 and $13.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2019.Trading liabilities include debt and equity instruments andderivative liabilities, primarily interest rate and foreign exchangecontracts, not designated as hedging instruments. Tradingliabilities were $6.1 billion at Sept. 30, 2020 and $4.8 billion atDec. 31, 2019.
Under our fair value methodology for derivative contracts, aninitial “risk-neutral” valuation is performed on each positionassuming time-discounting based on a AA credit curve. Inaddition, we consider credit risk in arriving at the fair value of ourderivatives.
42 BNY Mellon
We reflect external credit ratings as well as observable credit
default swap spreads for both ourselves and our counterparties
when measuring the fair value of our derivative positions.
Accordingly, the valuation of our derivative positions is sensitive
to the current changes in our own credit spreads, as well as those
of our counterparties.
At Sept. 30, 2020, our OTC derivative assets, including those in
hedging relationships, of $4.2 billion included a credit valuation
adjustment (“CVA”) deduction of $39 million. Our OTC
derivative liabilities, including those in hedging relationships, of
$3.6 billion included a debit valuation adjustment (“DVA”) of $1
million related to our own credit spread. Net of hedges, the CVAdecreased by $3 million and the DVA was unchanged in the third
quarter of 2020, which increased foreign exchange and other
trading revenue by $3 million. The net impact decreased foreign
exchange and other trading revenue by $2 million in the second
quarter of 2020 and increased foreign exchange and other trading
revenue by $1 million in the third quarter of 2019.
The table below summarizes the distribution of credit ratings for
our foreign exchange and interest rate derivative counterparties
over the past five quarters, which indicates the level of
counterparty credit associated with these trading activities.
Significant changes in counterparty credit ratings could alter the
level of credit risk faced by BNY Mellon.

Asset/liability management
Our diversified business activities include processing securities,accepting deposits, investing in securities, lending, raising moneyas needed to fund assets and other transactions. The market risksfrom these activities include interest rate risk and foreignexchange risk. Our primary market risk is exposure to movementsin U.S. dollar interest rates and certain foreign currency interestrates. We actively manage interest rate sensitivity and useearnings simulation and discounted cash flow models to identifyinterest rate exposures.
An earnings simulation model is the primary tool used to assesschanges in pre-tax net interest revenue. The model incorporatesmanagement’s assumptions regarding interest rates, marketspreads, changes in the prepayment behavior of loans andsecurities and the impact of derivative financial instruments usedfor interest rate risk management purposes. These assumptionshave been developed through a combination of historical analysisand future expected pricing behavior and are inherently uncertain.Actual results may differ materially from projected results due totiming, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, andchanges in market conditions and management’s strategies,among other factors.
In the table below, we use the earnings simulation model to runvarious interest rate ramp scenarios from a baseline scenario. Theinterest rate ramp scenarios examine the impact of large interestrate movements. In each scenario, all currencies’ interest rates areshifted higher or lower. The 100 basis point ramp scenarioassumes rates change 25 basis points above or below the yieldcurve in each of the next four quarters and the 200 basis pointramp scenario assumes a 50 basis point per quarter change.Interest rate sensitivity is quantified by calculating the change inpre-tax net interest revenue between the scenarios over a 12-month measurement period. The net interest revenue sensitivitymethodology assumes static deposit levels and also assumes thatno management actions will be taken to mitigate the effects ofinterest rate changes.

(b) Long-term is equal to or greater than one year.
The down 100 basis point scenario was impacted by a change in
our deposit assumptions. Specifically, we increased the amount of
deposit balances to which we would pass through negative central
bank rates in the scenario.
To illustrate the net interest revenue sensitivity to deposit runoff,
we note that a $5 billion instantaneous reduction of U.S. dollar
denominated noninterest-bearing deposits would reduce the net
interest revenue sensitivity results in the ramp up 100 basis point
and 200 basis point scenarios in the table above by approximately
$30 million and approximately $65 million, respectively. The
impact would be smaller if the runoff was assumed to be a
mixture of interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits.

Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP and
Non-GAAP financial measures
BNY Mellon has included in this Form 10-Q certain Non-GAAP
financial measures on a tangible basis as a supplement to
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) information,
which exclude goodwill and intangible assets, net of deferred tax
liabilities. We believe that the return on tangible common equity
is additional useful information for investors because it presents a
measure of those assets that can generate income, and the tangible
book value per common share is additional useful information
because it presents the level of tangible assets in relation to shares
of common stock outstanding.
The presentation of the growth rates of investment management
and performance fees on a constant currency basis permits
investors to assess the significance of changes in foreign currency
exchange
rates. Growth rates on a constant currency basis were determinedby applying the current period foreign currency exchange rates tothe prior period revenue. We believe that this presentation, as asupplement to GAAP information, gives investors a clearerpicture of the related revenue results without the variabilitycaused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.BNY Mellon has also included the adjusted pre-tax operatingmargin – Non-GAAP, which is the pre-tax operating margin forthe Investment and Wealth Management business net ofdistribution and servicing expense that was passed to third partieswho distribute or service our managed funds. We believe that thismeasure is useful when evaluating the performance of theInvestment and Wealth Management business relative to industrycompetitors.

Recent accounting and regulatory developments
Recent accounting developments
The following ASU issued by the FASB had not yet been adopted
as of Sept. 30, 2020.
ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform: Facilitation of the Effects
of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting
In March 2020, the FASB issued an ASU, Reference Rate
Reform: Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on
Financial Reporting. This ASU provides temporary optional
expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to financial
contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by
reference rate reform. This ASU also permits an entity to make a
one-time election to sell and/or transfer held-to-maturity
securities that are affected by reference rate reform and were
classified as held-to-maturity on or before Jan. 1, 2020. The
guidance in this ASU can be adopted as of March 12, 2020
through Dec. 31, 2022. We are assessing the impacts of the newstandard, but would not expect this ASU to have a material
impact on BNY Mellon.
Recent regulatory developments
For a summary of additional regulatory matters relevant to our
operations, see “Recent regulatory developments” in our Form10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020
and “Supervision and Regulation” in our 2019 Annual Report.
The following discussions summarize certain regulatory,
legislative and other developments that may affect BNY Mellon,
the impact of many of which we are still evaluating.
CCAR Refiling, Limitations and SCB
In light of the changes in the financial markets and the economy,
in June 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that all banking
institutions subject to CCAR, including BNY Mellon, are
required to resubmit their capital plans. On Sept. 17, 2020, the
Federal Reserve released the supervisory scenarios for the
resubmission, which was submitted on Nov. 2, 2020.
Also in September 2020, the Federal Reserve extended throughthe fourth quarter of 2020 the limitations on capital distributionsand share repurchases that the Federal Reserve imposed onCCAR firms, including BNY Mellon, earlier in the year. Foradditional information regarding these limitations, see “Recentregulatory developments - CCAR 2020 results” in our SecondQuarter 2020 Form 10-Q. Consistent with these limitations, forthe fourth quarter, BNY Mellon maintained its quarterly commonstock dividend of $0.31 per share and plans to maintain thesuspension of its open market common stock repurchases.On Aug. 10, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced the individualCCAR firms’ SCBs. The BNY Mellon SCB requirement is 2.5%,which equals the regulatory minimum, and is unchangedcompared to the capital conservation buffer that previouslyapplied. The SCB became effective on Oct. 1, 2020. Foradditional information regarding the SCB, see “Recent regulatorydevelopments - Changes to CCAR and Stress Capital Buffer” inour First Quarter 2020 Form 10-Q and “Supervision andRegulation - Capital Planning and Stress Testing” in our 2019Annual Report.
Capital, Liquidity and TLAC Relief
On Sept. 29, 2020, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC(the “Agencies”) finalized without changes an interim final ruleissued in March 2020 that neutralizes the regulatory capital andliquidity coverage ratio effects for institutions that participate inthe Federal Reserve’s MMLF.
Similarly, in August 2020, the Agencies finalized without changean interim final rule issued in March 2020 that revised thedefinition of “eligible retained income” to make more gradual theautomatic restrictions on capital distributions, such as sharerepurchases, dividend payments, and bonus payments. In thesame final rulemaking, the Federal Reserve also finalized theMarch 2020 interim final rule that made corresponding changesto the TLAC buffer requirements. The final rule is effective as ofJan. 1, 2021.
Also in August 2020, the Agencies finalized a current expectedcredit loss (“CECL”) final rule that is substantially similar to theinterim final rule issued in March 2020. The final rule permitsbanking organizations to temporarily delay the estimatedBNY Mellon 47
effects of CECL on regulatory capital until Jan. 1, 2022 and then
to phase in those effects through Jan. 1, 2025. Under the final
rule, during 2020 and 2021, the adjustment to CET1 capital
reflects the change in retained earnings upon adoption of CECL
at Jan. 1, 2020 plus 25% of the increase in the allowance for
credit losses since Jan. 1, 2020. BNY Mellon has not yet elected
to apply this final rule. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information on the impact of
the adoption of CECL and Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for the change in the allowance for credit
losses during the third quarter of 2020.

rulemakings noted above, see “Recent regulatory developments –

Net Stable Funding Ratio
On Oct. 20, 2020, the Agencies issued a final net stable funding
ratio (“NSFR”) rule that implements a quantitative measure of
funding stability over a one-year horizon, and is applicable to
certain large banking organizations, including BNY Mellon.
Under the rule, BNY Mellon’s NSFR would be expressed as a
ratio of its available stable funding to its required stable funding
amount, calculated on an ongoing basis, and BNY Mellon would
be required to maintain an NSFR of 100%. The effective date of
the final NSFR rule is July 1, 2021, with the exception of certain
disclosure requirements, which will begin to apply in 2023. BNYMellon expects to be in compliance with the NSFR rule by the
effective date.
Capital Treatment of Investments in Certain Debt Instruments ofG-SIBs
On Oct. 20, 2020, the Agencies finalized a rule that generallyrequires certain advanced approaches banking organizations(including BNY Mellon) to deduct from Tier 2 capital, subject tocertain exceptions, direct, indirect and synthetic exposures tocovered debt instruments. Covered debt instruments under therule include, for example, unsecured debt instruments issued byU.S. or foreign G-SIBs, among other entities, to meet TLACrequirements or similar foreign requirements as well as any otherunsecured debt instruments pari passu or subordinated to suchdebt instruments. The rule is effective on April 1, 2021. Theimpact of the final rule is not expected to be material to BNYMellon.
ECB Declaration of Exceptional CircumstancesIn September 2020, the European Central Bank (“ECB”) issued adeclaration of exceptional circumstances, which is in effect fromSept. 26, 2020 to June 27, 2021, and which, as a result of the socalled “quick-fix” to the Capital Requirements Regulation(“CRR”) earlier in the year, has the effect of allowing creditinstitutions subject to direct ECB supervision, such as The Bankof New York Mellon SA/NV, to disclose their leverage ratiosexcluding central bank deposits (as well as the leverage ratiosabsent this exclusion). The leverage ratio requirement is currentlynot binding on EU credit institutions but will become a bindingrequirement as part of the CRR 2, on June 28, 2021.
