Overview
Established in 1784 by Alexander Hamilton, we were the first
company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: BK).
With a history of more than 235 years, BNY Mellon is a global
company that manages and services assets for financial institutions,
corporations and individual investors in 35 countries.
BNY Mellon has two business segments, Investment Services and
Investment and Wealth Management (formerly Investment
Management), which offer a comprehensive set of capabilities and
deep expertise across the investment lifecycle, enabling the
Company to provide solutions to buy-side and sell-side market
participants, as well as leading institutional and wealth management
clients globally.
The diagram below presents our two business segments and lines ofbusiness, with the remaining operations in the Other segment.Key second quarter 2020 and subsequent eventsEmily Portney named Chief Financial OfficerIn July 2020, Emily Portney was appointed Chief Financial Officer,succeeding Michael P. Santomassimo, and joined the Company’sExecutive Committee. Ms. Portney previously led the clientmanagement, sales and services teams for the Asset Servicingbusiness globally and oversaw the Americas region for the AssetServicing business. She has also previously held senior financialroles.
CCAR and common stock repurchasesIn March 2020, we and the other members of the Financial ServicesForum announced the temporary suspension of share repurchasesuntil the end of the second quarter of 2020 to preserve capital andliquidity in order to further the objective of using capital andliquidity to support clients and customers.

On June 25, 2020, the Federal Reserve released the results of its
annual stress tests for 2020 and additional sensitivity analyses that
the Federal Reserve conducted in light of the coronavirus
pandemic. The Federal Reserve also notified BNY Mellon that its
stress capital buffer (“SCB”) requirement will be 2.5%, which
equals the regulatory floor. The SCB will be effective on Oct. 1,
2020.
The Federal Reserve also announced that it has required
participating Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review
(“CCAR”) firms, including us, to update and resubmit their capital
plans and that, as a result, unless otherwise approved by the Federal
Reserve, participating firms would not be permitted, during the
third quarter of 2020, to conduct open market common stock
repurchases, to increase their common stock dividends or to pay
common stock dividends that exceed average net income for the
preceding four quarters. The Federal Reserve also stated that it may
extend these limitations quarter-by-quarter.
Highlights of second quarter 2020 results
Net income applicable to common shareholders was $901 million, or $1.01 per diluted common share, in the second quarter of 2020. Net income applicable to common shareholders was $969 million, or $1.01 per diluted common share, in the second quarter of 2019. The highlights below are based on the second quarter of 2020
compared with the second quarter of 2019, unless otherwise noted. • Total revenue of $4.0 billion increased 2% primarily reflecting: • Fee revenue increased 2% primarily reflecting higher fees
in Pershing and Asset Servicing, partially offset by money
market fee waivers, lower investment management fees and
the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. (See “Fee
and other revenue” beginning on page 7.) • Net interest revenue decreased 3% primarily reflecting
lower interest rates on interest-earning assets, partially
offset by the benefit of lower deposit and funding rates and
higher deposits, securities portfolio and loans. (See “Net
interest revenue” on page 10.) • Provision for credit losses was $143 million primarily reflecting
increased downgrades and the continuation of the challenging
macroeconomic outlook. (See “Consolidated balance sheetreview - Allowance for credit losses” beginning on page 29.)• Noninterest expense increased 1% primarily reflecting thecontinued investments in technology and higher staff andpension expenses, partially offset by lower businessdevelopment (travel and marketing) expense and the favorableimpact of a stronger U.S. dollar. (See “Noninterest expense” onpage 13.) • Effective tax rate of 18.3%. (See “Income taxes” on page 13.)Capital and liquidity• CET1 ratio was 12.6% under the Advanced Approaches atJune 30, 2020, compared with 11.3% under the StandardizedApproach at March 31, 2020. The increase in the CET1 ratioprimarily reflects capital generated through earnings andunrealized gains on assets available-for-sale, partially offset bycapital deployed through dividend payments. (See “Capital”beginning on page 37.) • Tier 1 capital increased $2.55 billion, including the issuance of$1 billion of preferred stock. (See “Capital” beginning on page37.)

Impact of coronavirus pandemic on our business
The coronavirus pandemic has had a significant effect on the global
macroeconomic environment. The following discusses the areas of
our business that have been impacted and could continue to be
impacted by the current environment.
At the end of June 2020, approximately 95% of our employees
continued to work from home and be fully operational with
minimal disruption to servicing our clients. However, our continued
reliance on work-from-home arrangements may result in increased
operational risks.
Market volatility associated with the performance of global equity
and fixed income markets and lower interest rates has had, and may
continue to have, a considerable impact on all of our businesses.
Our lower-risk diversified fee-based business model benefits fromheightened volatility and a flight-to-quality on a relative basis
compared with other credit-focused financial institutions.
Our Investment Services businesses were favorably impacted by
higher client volumes in the first and second quarters of 2020
compared with the prior year. The significant increases in market
volatility also resulted in increased client activity in foreign
exchange, and higher asset servicing, clearing services in Pershing,
as well as clearance and collateral management fee revenue.
However, the heightened volumes and volatility were lower in the
second quarter compared with the first quarter of 2020.
This volatility coupled with the interest rate environment also led to
an increase in deposit levels from the prior year as our clients
increased the levels of cash placed with us. This favorably impacted
net interest revenue. However, the low interest rate environment
has begun to more than offset that benefit and is expected to
continue to reduce our net interest revenue and margin.
Given the recent levels of short-term interest rates, money market
mutual funds have begun to waive fees, which reduced fee revenue
in the second quarter of 2020. See further discussion of money
market fee waivers in “Fee and other revenue.”
As discussed above under “Key second quarter 2020 andsubsequent events,” we and the other members of the FinancialServices Forum announced in March 2020 that we would suspendshare repurchases through the second quarter of 2020. Additionally,in connection with the Federal Reserve’s release of the CCARresults in June 2020, BNY Mellon announced that it will notconduct open market common stock repurchases in the third quarterof 2020, as required of all participating CCAR firms, and willcontinue the current quarterly common stock dividend of $0.31 pershare. See “Recent regulatory developments” for additionalinformation related to the 2020 CCAR results.The significant changes in market values during 2020 haveimpacted revenue related to seed capital investments (net ofhedges) in our Investment and Wealth Management business,which benefited the second quarter of 2020 and negativelyimpacted the first quarter of 2020. Also, in the second quarter, theInvestment and Wealth Management business was negativelyimpacted by higher money market fee waivers.During the first quarter of 2020, we purchased $2.2 billion ofcommercial paper and certificates of deposit (“CDs”) fromaffiliated money market mutual funds in order to provide liquiditysupport to the funds. We also purchased $650 million in the firstquarter of 2020 and $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2020 ofcommercial paper and CDs from third-party money market mutualfunds and funded this purchase through the Federal Reserve Bankof Boston’s Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility(“MMLF”) program. See “Recent regulatory developments” in theFirst Quarter 2020 Form 10-Q for additional information on theMMLF.
The need to apply macroeconomic forecasting in the currentenvironment in conjunction with the new expected credit lossaccounting guidance has resulted in and may continue to result inheightened levels of credit loss provisioning. The continuing effectsof the pandemic could also result in increased credit losses andcharge offs.
In addition, a prolonged economic downturn may result in otherasset write-downs and impairments, including, but not limited to,equity investments, goodwill and intangibles.6 BNY Mellon
It is difficult to forecast the impact of the coronavirus, together with
related public health measures, on our results with certainty because
so much depends on how the health crisis evolves, its impact on the
global economy as well as actions taken by central banks and
governments to support the economy.
The current macroeconomic environment has also resulted in
responses by governmental and regulatory bodies. See “Recent
regulatory developments” for additional information on legislative
and regulatory
developments in response to the coronavirus pandemic.For further discussion of the current and potential impact of thecoronavirus pandemic see Item 1A. Risk Factors “The coronaviruspandemic is adversely affecting us and creates significant risks anduncertainties for our business, and the ultimate impact of thepandemic on us will depend on future developments, which arehighly uncertain and cannot be predicted.”Fee and other revenue

Fee and other revenue increased 2% compared with the second
quarter of 2019 and decreased 5% compared with the first quarter
of 2020. The increase compared with the second quarter of 2019
primarily reflects higher investment and other income, asset
servicing fees and clearing services fees, partially offset by lower
investment management and performance fees. The decrease
compared with the first quarter of 2020 primarily reflects lower
foreign exchange and other trading revenue, investment
management and performance fees and clearing
services fees, partially offset by higher investment and otherincome.
Money market fee waivers
Given the recent levels of short-term interest rates, money marketmutual fund fees and other similar fees have begun to be waived toprotect investors from negative returns. The fee waivers are initiallyprimarily impacting clearing services fees in Pershing, and to alesser extent revenue in our other
BNY Mellon 7
businesses including investment management fees and distribution
and servicing revenue in Investment Management (formerly Asset
Management) and fees in other Investment Services businesses, but
also result in lower distribution and servicing expense. Money
market fee waivers are highly sensitive to changes in short-terminterest rates and are difficult to predict, but are expected to growover the coming quarters.
The following table presents the impact of money market fee
waivers on our consolidated fee revenue, net of distribution and
servicing expense. A majority of the money market fee waivers
were driven by low short-term interest rates. An increase in money
market balances in the second quarter 2020 compared with the first
quarter 2020 resulted in an approximate $50 million increase in
total fee and other revenue which partially offset the increase in
money market fee waivers.

Note: The line of business revenue for management reporting purposes reflects the

Assuming quarter-end money market balances, we expect the
impact from fee waivers, net of lower distribution and servicing
expense, to increase in the third quarter of 2020 by approximately
$30 million to $45 million and to increase an incremental $25
million in the fourth quarter of 2020, for a full run rate of
approximately $135 million to $150 million. This impact may be
partially offset depending on the levels of money market balances.
Investment services fees
Investment services fees increased 2% compared with the secondquarter of 2019 and decreased 1% compared with the first quarterof 2020 reflecting the following: • Asset servicing fees increased 3% compared with the secondquarter of 2019 and 1% compared with the first quarter of 2020.Both increases primarily reflect higher volumes from existingclients. • Clearing services fees increased 5% compared with the secondquarter of 2019 and decreased 8% compared with the firstquarter of 2020. The increase compared with the second quarterof 2019 primarily reflects higher money market balances andclearing volumes, partially offset by the impact of rate-drivenmoney market fee waivers. The decrease compared with thefirst quarter of 2020 primarily reflects the impact of rate-drivenmoney market fee waivers and lower clearing volumes,partially offset by higher money market balances.• Issuer services fees decreased 5% compared with the secondquarter of 2019 and increased 5% compared with the firstquarter of 2020. The decrease compared with the secondquarter of 2019 primarily reflects lower Depositary Receiptsand Corporate Trust fees. The increase compared with the firstquarter of 2020 primarily reflects higher Depositary Receiptsfees. • Treasury services fees increased 3% compared with the secondquarter of 2019 and decreased 3% compared with the firstquarter of 2020. The increase compared with the second quarterof 2019 primarily reflects higher liquidity fees. The decreasecompared with the first quarter of 2020 primarily reflects lowerpayment volumes and other fees.
See the “Investment Services business” in “Review of businesses”for additional details.
Investment management and performance feesInvestment management and performance fees decreased 6%compared with the second quarter of 2019 and 9% compared withthe first quarter of 2020. The decrease compared with the secondquarter of 2019 primarily reflects money market fee waivers, theunfavorable change in the mix of AUM since the second quarter of2019 and the unfavorable impact of8 BNY Mellon
a stronger U.S. dollar (principally versus the British pound). The
decrease compared with the first quarter of 2020 primarily reflects
the timing of performance fees and money market fee waivers. On a
constant currency basis (Non-GAAP), investment management and
performance fees decreased 5% compared with the second quarter
of 2019. Performance fees were $5 million in the second quarter of
2020, $2 million in the second quarter of 2019 and $50 million in
the first quarter of 2020. AUM was $2.0 trillion at June 30, 2020, an increase of 6%compared with June 30, 2019, primarily reflecting higher market
values and net inflows, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of
a stronger U.S. dollar (principally versus the British pound).

Foreign exchange and other trading revenue was unchanged
compared with the second quarter of 2019 and decreased 48%compared with the first quarter of 2020. Foreign exchange revenue is primarily driven by the volume of
client transactions and the spread realized on these transactions,
both of which are impacted by market volatility, and the impact of
foreign currency hedging activities. In the second quarter of 2020, foreign exchange revenue totaled $174 million, an increase of 16%compared with the second quarter of 2019 and a decrease of 31%compared with the first quarter of 2020. The increase compared
with the second quarter of 2019 reflects higher volatility partially
offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation
hedging (mostly offset in investment and other income). The
decrease compared with the first quarter of 2020 reflects lower
volumes and volatility and the negative impact of
foreign currency translation hedging. Foreign exchange revenue isprimarily reported in the Investment Services business and, to alesser extent, the Investment and Wealth Management business andthe Other segment.
Other trading losses totaled $8 million in the second quarter of2020 compared with other trading revenue of $16 million in thesecond quarter of 2019 and other trading revenue of $66 million inthe first quarter of 2020. Both decreases primarily reflect the impactof Investment Management seed capital hedging activities.

Net interest revenue decreased 3% compared with the second
quarter of 2019 and 4% compared with the first quarter of 2020. The decrease compared with the second quarter of 2019 primarily
reflects lower interest rates on interest-earning assets, partially
offset by the benefit of lower deposit and funding rates and higher
deposits, securities portfolio and loans. The decrease compared
with the first quarter of 2020 was primarily driven by lower interest
rates on interest-earning assets. This was partially offset by the
benefit of lower deposit and funding rates, higher securities
portfolio and the impact of hedging activities (primarily offset in
foreign exchange and other trading revenue).
Net interest margin decreased 24 basis points compared with the
second quarter of 2019 and 13 basis points compared with the first
quarter of 2020. Both decreases primarily reflect lower asset yields
and higher interest-earning assets, partially offset by lower deposit
rates.
Average interest-earning assets of $358 billion in the second
quarter of 2020 increased 24% compared with the second quarter of
2019 and 10% compared with the first quarter of 2020. Both
increases primarily reflect higher interest-bearing deposits with the
Federal Reserve and other central banks and securities portfolio.
Average non-U.S. dollar deposits comprised approximately 25% ofour average total deposits in the second quarter of 2020.Approximately 40% of the average non-U.S. dollar deposits in thesecond quarter of 2020 were euro denominated.Net interest revenue in future quarters will depend on the level andmix of client deposits, deposit rates, as well as the level and shapeof the yield curve, which may result in lower yields on interestearning assets.
Year-to-date 2020 compared with year-to-date 2019Net interest revenue decreased 3% compared with the first sixmonths of 2019, primarily driven by lower interest rates on interestearning assets, partially offset by the benefit of lower deposit andfunding rates and higher deposits, securities portfolio and loans.The decrease in net interest margin primarily reflects lower assetyields and higher interest-earning assets, partially offset by lowerdeposit and funding rates and higher deposits and securitiesportfolio.
Average interest-earning assets of $341 billion in the first sixmonths of 2020 increased 20% compared with the first six monthsof 2019. The increase primarily reflects higher interest-bearingdeposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks,securities portfolio and loans.

quarter of 2019 and decreased 1% compared with the first quarter
of 2020. The increase compared with the second quarter of 2019
primarily reflects the continued investments in technology and
higher staff and pension expenses, partially offset by lower
business development (travel and marketing) expense and the
favorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. The investments in
technology are included in staff, software and equipment, and
professional, legal and other purchased services expenses. The
decrease compared with the first quarter of 2020 primarily reflects
lower other and business development (travel and marketing)
expenses and the favorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar,
partially offset by higher software and equipment and sub-custodian
and clearing expenses.
Our investments in technology infrastructure and platforms are
expected to continue. As a result, we expect to incur higher
technology-related expenses in 2020 than in 2019 and higher
pension expense as a result of a lower expected rate of return on
plan assets. These increases are expected to be offset by decreases
in other expenses as we continue to manage overall expenses.
Year-to-date 2020 compared with year-to-date 2019Noninterest expense increased 1% compared with the first sixmonths of 2019, primarily reflecting the continued investments intechnology and higher software and equipment, staff and pensionexpenses, partially offset by the favorable impact of a stronger U.S.dollar and lower business development (travel and marketing)expense.

Review of businesses
We have an internal information system that produces performance
data along product and service lines for our two principal
businesses, Investment Services and Investment and Wealth
Management (formerly Investment Management), and the Other
segment.
Business accounting principles
Our business data has been determined on an internal management
basis of accounting, rather than the generally accepted accounting
principles used for consolidated financial reporting. These
measurement principles are designed so that reported results of the
businesses will track their economic performance.
For information on the accounting principles of our businesses, see
Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For
information on the primary products and services in each line of
business, the primary types of revenue by business and how our
businesses are presented and analyzed, see Note 24 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report.
Business results are subject to reclassification when organizational
changes are made. There were no significant organizational
changes in the second quarter of 2020. The results are also subject
to refinements in revenue and expense allocation methodologies,
which are typically reflected on a prospective basis.
In the first quarter of 2020, we reclassified the results of certain
services provided between the segments from noninterest expense
to fee and other revenue. This activity is offset in the Other segment
and relates to services that are also provided to third parties and
provides consistency with the reporting of the revenues. This
adjustment had no impact on income before taxes of the businesses.
Also in the first quarter of 2020, we reclassified the results related
to certain lending activities from the Wealth Management business
to the Pershing business. These loans were originated by the Wealth
Management business as a service to Pershing clients. This resulted
in an increase in total revenue, noninterest expense and income
before taxes in the Pershing business and corresponding decrease in
the Wealth Management business. Prior periods were restated in the
first quarter of 2020 for both reclassifications.
The results of our businesses may be influenced by client and otheractivities that vary by quarter. In the first quarter, staff expensetypically increases reflecting the vesting of long-term stock awardsfor retirement-eligible employees. In the third quarter, volumerelated fees may decline due to reduced client activity. In the thirdquarter, staff expense typically increases reflecting the annualemployee merit increase. In the fourth quarter, we typically incurhigher business development and marketing expenses; however,2020 is expected to be different given the impact of the coronaviruspandemic. In our Investment and Wealth Management business,performance fees are typically higher in the fourth and firstquarters, as those quarters represent the end of the measurementperiod for many of the performance fee-eligible relationships.The results of our businesses may also be impacted by thetranslation of financial results denominated in foreign currencies tothe U.S. dollar. We are primarily impacted by activitiesdenominated in the British pound and the euro. On a consolidatedbasis and in our Investment Services business, we typically havemore foreign currency-denominated expenses than revenues.However, our Investment and Wealth Management businesstypically has more foreign currency-denominated revenues thanexpenses. Overall, currency fluctuations impact the year-over-yeargrowth rate in the Investment and Wealth Management businessmore than the Investment Services business. However, currencyfluctuations, in isolation, are not expected to significantly impactnet income on a consolidated basis.
Fee revenue in Investment and Wealth Management, and to a lesserextent in Investment Services, is impacted by the value of marketindices. At June 30, 2020, we estimate that a 5% change in globalequity markets, spread evenly throughout the year, would impactfee revenue by less than 1% and diluted earnings per common shareby $0.03 to $0.06. See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements forthe consolidating schedules which show the contribution of ourbusinesses to our overall profitability.

Review of financial results
AUC/A of $37.3 trillion increased 5% compared with June 30,
2019, primarily reflecting higher client inflows, market values and
net new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a
stronger U.S. dollar. AUC/A consisted of 33% equity securities and
67% fixed-income securities at June 30, 2020 and 35% equity
securities and 65% fixed-income securities at June 30, 2019. Total revenue of $3.1 billion increased 3% compared with the
second quarter of 2019 and decreased 4% compared with the first
quarter of 2020. The drivers of total revenue by line of business are
indicated below.
Asset Servicing revenue of $1.5 billion increased 5% compared
with the second quarter of 2019 and decreased 4% compared with
the first quarter of 2020. The increase compared with the second
quarter of 2019 reflects higher foreign exchange and other trading
revenue, partially offset by lower net interest revenue. The decrease
compared with the first quarter of 2020 reflects lower foreign
exchange and other trading revenue and net interest revenue. Total
revenue in the second quarter of 2020 also benefited from higher
volumes from existing clients and a one-time fee.
Pershing revenue of $578 million increased 1% compared with the
second quarter of 2019 and decreased 11% compared with the first
quarter of 2020. The increase compared with the second quarter of
2019 primarily reflects higher money market balances and clearing
volumes, partially offset by the impact of rate-driven money market
fee waivers. The
decrease compared with the first quarter of 2020 primarily reflectsthe impact of rate-driven money market fee waivers, a one-time feerecorded in the first quarter of 2020 and lower clearing volumes,partially offset by higher money market balances.Issuer Services revenue of $431 million decreased 3% comparedwith the second quarter of 2019 and increased 3% compared withthe first quarter of 2020. The decrease compared with the secondquarter of 2019 reflects lower Depositary Receipts and CorporateTrust fees. The increase compared with the first quarter of 2020primarily reflects higher Depositary Receipts fees.Treasury Services revenue of $340 million increased 7% comparedwith the second quarter of 2019 and increased slightly comparedwith the first quarter of 2020. The increase compared with thesecond quarter of 2019 primarily reflects higher net interest revenuedriven by deposit growth and higher fees.
Clearance and Collateral Management revenue of $295 millionincreased 4% compared with the second quarter of 2019 anddecreased 2% compared with the first quarter of 2020. The increasecompared with the second quarter of 2019 primarily reflects highernet interest revenue and growth in collateral management andclearance volumes, mostly from non-U.S. clients. The decreasecompared with the first quarter of 2020 primarily reflects lowercollateral management fees.
Market and regulatory trends are driving investable assets towardlower fee asset management products at reduced margins for ourclients. These dynamics are also negatively impacting ourinvestment services fees. However, at the same time, these trendsare providing additional outsourcing opportunities as clients andother market participants seek to comply with regulations andreduce their operating costs.
The provision for credit losses of $145 million in the second quarterof 2020 primarily reflects increased downgrades and thecontinuation of the challenging macroeconomic outlook.Noninterest expense of $2.0 billion increased 1% compared withthe second quarter of 2019 and slightly compared with the firstquarter of 2020. The increase compared with the second quarter of2019 was primarily driven by continued investments in technology,partially offset by lower business development and staff expenses.The slight increase compared with the first quarter of 2020 reflectsBNY Mellon 17
continued investments in technology, offset by lower staff expense.
Year-to-date 2020 compared with year-to-date 2019
Total revenue of $6.3 billion increased 6% compared with the first
six months of 2019. Asset Servicing revenue of $3.0 billion
increased 6%, primarily reflecting higher foreign exchange and
other trading revenue and higher volumes from existing clients,
partially offset by lower net interest revenue. Pershing revenue of
$1.2 billion increased 9%, primarily reflecting higher clearing
volumes and money market balances, partially offset by the impact
of rate-driven money market fee waivers.
Issuer Services revenue of $850 million increased 1%, primarilyreflecting higher Depositary Receipts and Corporate Trust fees.Treasury Services revenue of $679 million increased 7%, primarilyreflecting higher fees and net interest revenue. Clearance andCollateral Management revenue of $595 million increased 6%,primarily reflecting growth in collateral management and clearancevolumes and higher net interest revenue.

Review of financial results
AUM increased 6% compared with June 30, 2019 primarily
reflecting higher market values and net inflows, partially offset by
the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar (principally versus
the British pound).
Net long-term strategy inflows were $9 billion in the second quarterof 2020, primarily resulting from inflows of index funds. Shortterm strategy inflows were $11 billion in the second quarter of2020. Market and regulatory trends have resulted in increaseddemand for lower fee asset management products and forperformance-based fees.
Total revenue of $886 million decreased3%compared with thesecond quarter of 2019 and 1% compared with the first quarter of2020. Investment Management revenue of $621 million decreased slightlycompared with the second quarter of 2019 and increased slightlycompared with the first quarter of 2020. The decrease comparedwith the second quarter of 2019 primarily reflects the unfavorablechange in the mix of AUM since the second quarter of 2019 and theimpact of money market fee waivers, partially offset by equityinvestment gains (net of hedges), including seed capital. Theincrease compared with the first quarter of 2020 primarily reflectsequity investment gains (net of hedges), including seed capital,partially offset
BNY Mellon 19
by the timing of performance fees and the impact of money market
fee waivers.
Wealth Management revenue of $265 million decreased 9%compared with the second quarter of 2019 and 5% compared with
the first quarter of 2020. Both decreases primarily reflect lower net
interest revenue and a shift within portfolios to lower fee asset
classes.
Revenue generated in the Investment and Wealth Management
business included 40% from non-U.S. sources in the second quarter
of 2020, compared with 38% in the second quarter of 2019 and
42% in the first quarter of 2020. Noninterest expense of $658 million increased slightly compared
with the second quarter of 2019 and decreased 5% compared with
the first quarter of 2020. The increase compared with the second
quarter of 2019 primarily reflects higher continued investments in
technology. The decrease compared with the first quarter of 2020
primarily reflects lower staff and other expenses.
Year-to-date 2020 compared with year-to-date 2019Total revenue of $1.8 billion decreased 4% compared with the firstsix months of 2019. Investment Management revenue of $1.2billion decreased 2% primarily reflecting an unfavorable change inthe mix of AUM, equity investment losses (net of hedges),including seed capital, and the impact of fee waivers, partiallyoffset by higher performance fees and market values. WealthManagement revenue of $543 million decreased 7% reflectinglower net interest revenue.
Noninterest expense of $1.4 billion increased 2% compared withthe first six months of 2019, primarily reflecting higherprofessional, legal and other purchased services expense and higherinvestments in technology, partially offset by the favorable impactof a stronger U.S. dollar (principally versus the British pound).Other segment

Review of financial results
Fee revenue, net securities gains (losses) and net interest expense
include corporate treasury and other investment activity, including
hedging activity which offsets between fee revenue and net interest
expense.
Fee revenue increased $5 million compared with the second quarter
of 2019 and $8 million compared with the first quarter of 2020, primarily reflecting higher
equity investment income, partially offset by sequentially lowerforeign currency translation gains.
Net interest expense decreased $4 million compared with thesecond quarter of 2019 and $8 million compared with the firstquarter of 2020, primarily reflecting corporate treasury activity.Noninterest expense increased $10 million compared with thesecond quarter of 2019 and $9 million compared to the first quarterof 2020, primarily reflecting higher staff expense.20 BNY Mellon
Year-to-date 2020 compared with year-to-date 2019
Losses before taxes decreased $12 million compared with the first
six months of 2019. Total loss decreased $9 million, primarily
reflecting higher foreign currency translation gains and net
securities gains, partially offset by corporate treasury activity.
Critical accounting estimates
Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual
Report and in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in this Form 10-Q. Our critical accounting estimates are
those related to the allowance for credit losses, fair value of
financial instruments and derivatives, goodwill and other
intangibles and litigation and regulatory contingencies, as
referenced below.

“Legal proceedings” in Note 18 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
BNY Mellon’s business segments include six reporting units for
which goodwill impairment testing is performed on an annual basis.
The Investment Services segment is comprised of four reporting
units and the Investment and Wealth Management segment is
comprised of two reporting units.
In the second quarter of 2020, we performed our annual goodwill
impairment test on all six reporting units using an income approach
to estimate fair values of each reporting unit. Estimated cash flows
used in the income approach were based on management’s
projections as of March 31, 2020. The discount rate applied to these
cash flows was 10% and incorporated a 7% market equity risk
premium. Estimated cash flows extend far into the future, and, by
their nature, are difficult to estimate over such an extended time
frame.
As a result of the annual goodwill impairment test of the sixreporting units, no goodwill impairment was recognized. The fairvalues of five of the Company’s reporting units were substantiallyin excess of the respective reporting units’ carrying value. TheInvestment Management (formerly Asset Management) reportingunit, with $7.2 billion of allocated goodwill, which is one of thetwo reporting units in the Investment and Wealth Managementsegment, exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5%. For theInvestment Management reporting unit, in the future, small changesin the assumptions, such as changes in the level of AUM andoperating margin, could produce a non-cash goodwill impairment.See “Critical accounting estimates” in our 2019 Annual Report foradditional information on the annual goodwill impairment test.As of June 30, 2020, if the discount rate applied to the estimatedcash flows was increased or decreased by 25 basis points, the fairvalue of the Investment Management reporting unit would decreaseor increase by 4%, respectively. Similarly, if the long-term growthrate was increased or decreased by 10 basis points, the fair value ofthe Investment Management reporting unit would increase ordecrease by approximately 1%, respectively.Consolidated balance sheet reviewOne of our key risk management objectives is to maintain a balancesheet that remains strong throughout market cycles to meet theexpectations of our major stakeholders, including our shareholders,clients, creditors and regulators.
We also seek to undertake overall liquidity risk, including intradayliquidity risk, that stays within our risk appetite. The objective ofour balance sheet management strategy is to maintain a balancesheet that is characterized by strong liquidity and asset quality,ready access to external funding sources at competitive rates and astrong capital structure that supports our risk-taking activities and isadequate to absorb potential losses. In managing the balance sheet,appropriate consideration is given to balancing the competing needsof maintaining sufficient levels of liquidity and complying withapplicable regulations and supervisory expectations whileoptimizing profitability.
At June 30, 2020, total assets were $442 billion, compared with$382 billion at Dec. 31, 2019. The increase in total assets wasprimarily driven by higher
BNY Mellon 21
securities and interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve
and other central banks, resulting from significant deposit inflows.
Deposits totaled $305 billion at June 30, 2020, compared with $259
billion at Dec. 31, 2019. The increase reflects the current
macroeconomic environment. Total interest-bearing deposits as a
percentage of total interest-earning assets were 59% at June 30,
2020 and 62% at Dec. 31, 2019. The higher level of client deposits
received in the first six months of 2020 was primarily placed in the
securities portfolio or with the Federal Reserve and other central
banks.
At June 30, 2020, available funds totaled $172 billion which
include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits with the
Federal Reserve and other central banks, interest-bearing deposits
with banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements. This compares with available funds of $145
billion at Dec. 31, 2019. Total available funds as a percentage of
total assets were 39% at June 30, 2020 and 38% at Dec. 31, 2019. For additional information on our available funds, see “Liquidity
and dividends.”
Securities were $155 billion, or 35% of total assets, at June 30,
2020, compared with $123 billion, or 32% of total assets, at Dec.
31, 2019. The increase in securities primarily reflects investments
in U.S. Treasury securities, agency residential mortgage-backed
securities (“RMBS”), sovereign debt/sovereign guaranteed
securities, commercial paper/CDs and an increase in unrealized pretax gain. For additional information on our securities portfolio, see
“Securities” and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Loans were $55.4 billion, or 13% of total assets, at June 30, 2020, compared with $55.0 billion, or 14% of total assets, at Dec. 31,
2019. The increase was
primarily driven by higher overdrafts and higher loans in thecommercial portfolio, partially offset by lower loans in the financialinstitutions portfolio. For additional information on our loanportfolio, see “Loans” and Note 5 of the Notes to ConsolidatedFinancial Statements.
Long-term debt totaled $27.6 billion at June 30, 2020 and $27.5billion at Dec. 31, 2019. Issuances of $2.25 billion and an increasein the fair value of hedged long-term debt were partially offset bymaturities and a redemption. For additional information on longterm debt, see “Liquidity and dividends.”The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total shareholders’equity increased to $43.7 billion at June 30, 2020 from $41.5 billionat Dec. 31, 2019. For additional information, see “Capital.”Country risk exposureThe following table presents BNY Mellon’s top 10 exposures bycountry (excluding the U.S.) as of June 30, 2020, as well as certaincountries with higher-risk profiles, and is presented on an internalrisk management basis. We monitor our exposure to these and othercountries as part of our internal country risk management process.The country risk exposure below reflects the Company’s risk to animmediate default of the counterparty or obligor based on thecountry of residence of the entity which incurs the liability. If thereis credit risk mitigation, the country of residence of the entityproviding the risk mitigation is the country of risk. The country ofrisk for securities is generally based on the domicile of the issuer ofthe security.

Based on our internal country risk management process at June 30,
2020, our largest country risk exposure was to the UK, which
withdrew from the European Union (“EU”) on Jan. 31, 2020. For
additional information, see “Other Matters - UK’s Withdrawal fromthe EU (“Brexit”)” and “Risk Factors - The UK’s withdrawal fromthe EU may have negative effects on global economic conditions,
global financial markets, and our business and results of
operations” both included in our 2019 Annual Report.
Events in recent years have resulted in increased focus on Italy and
Brazil. The country risk exposure to Italy primarily consists of
investment grade sovereign debt. The country risk exposure to
Brazil
is primarily short-term trade finance loans extended to largefinancial institutions. We also have operations in Brazil providinginvestment services and investment management services.Securities
In the discussion of our securities portfolio, we have includedcertain credit ratings information because the information canindicate the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed.Significant changes in ratings classifications for our securitiesportfolio could indicate increased credit risk for us and could beaccompanied by a reduction in the fair value of our securitiesportfolio.

The fair value of our securities portfolio, including related hedges,
was $154.2 billion at June 30, 2020, compared with $122.7 billion
at Dec. 31, 2019. The increase primarily reflects investments in
U.S. Treasury securities, agency RMBS, sovereign debt/ sovereign
guaranteed securities, commercial paper/CDs and an increase in
unrealized pre-tax gain. At June 30, 2020, the securities portfolio,
including the impact of interest rate swap hedges, is 74% fixed rate
and 26% floating rate.
Included in the securities portfolio at June 30, 2020 were $1.2
billion of commercial paper and $697 million of CDs purchased
from affiliated money market mutual funds in order to provide
liquidity support to the funds. Additionally, at June 30, 2020, the
securities portfolio included $1.5 billion of commercial paper and
CDs purchased from money market mutual funds managed by third
parties and funded through the MMLF program.
At June 30, 2020, the securities portfolio had a net unrealized gain,including the impact of related hedges, of $3.0 billion, comparedwith $796 million at Dec. 31, 2019. The increase in the netunrealized pre-tax gain was primarily driven by lower marketinterest rates.
The unrealized gain (after-tax) on our available-for-sale securitiesportfolio, net of hedges, included in accumulated othercomprehensive income (“OCI”) was $1.2 billion at June 30, 2020,compared with $361 million at Dec. 31, 2019. The increase in theunrealized gain, net of tax, was primarily driven by lower marketinterest rates.
At June 30, 2020, 94% of the securities in our portfolio were ratedAAA/AA-, compared with 95% at Dec. 31, 2019.24 BNY Mellon

June 30, 2020, a decrease of 1% compared with Dec. 31, 2019, primarily reflecting lower exposure to banks and the securities
industry.
Financial institution exposures are high quality, with 95% of the
exposures meeting the investment grade equivalent criteria of our
internal credit rating classification at June 30, 2020. Each customer
is assigned an internal credit rating, which is mapped to an
equivalent external rating agency grade based upon a number of
dimensions, which are continually evaluated and may change over
time. For ratings of non-U.S. counterparties, our internal credit
rating is generally capped at a rating equivalent to the sovereign
rating of the country where the counterparty resides, regardless of
the internal credit rating assigned to the counterparty or the
underlying collateral.
In addition, 75% of the financial institutions exposure is secured.
For example, securities industry clients and asset managers often
borrow against marketable securities held in custody.
The exposure to financial institutions is generally short-term with
90% of the exposures expiring within one year. At June 30, 2020, 14% of the exposure to
financial institutions had an expiration within 90 days, comparedwith 18% at Dec. 31, 2019. At June 30, 2020, the secured intraday credit provided to dealers inconnection with their tri-party repo activity totaled $20.6 billionand was included in the securities industry portfolio. Dealers securethe outstanding intraday credit with high-quality liquid collateralhaving a market value in excess of the amount of the outstandingcredit. Secured intraday credit facilities represent nearly half of theexposure in the financial institutions portfolio and are reviewed andreapproved annually.
Our banks exposure primarily relates to our global trade finance.These exposures are short-term in nature, with 98% due in less thanone year. The investment grade percentage of our bank exposurewas 82% at June 30, 2020, compared with 77% at Dec. 31, 2019.Our non-investment grade exposures are primarily trade financeloans in Brazil.
The asset managers portfolio exposure is high-quality, with 99% ofthe exposures meeting our investment grade equivalent ratingscriteria as of June 30, 2020. These exposures are generally shortterm liquidity facilities, with the majority to regulated mutualfunds.

based on existing cash flows. Our commercial real estate lending
activities also include construction and renovation facilities. Our
client base consists of experienced developers and long-termholders of real estate assets. Loans are approved on the basis of
existing or projected cash flows and supported by appraisals and
knowledge of local market conditions. Development loans are
structured with moderate leverage, and in many instances, involve
some level of recourse to the developer.
At June 30, 2020, the unsecured portfolio consists of real estate
investment trusts (“REITs”) and real estate operating companies,
which are both primarily investment grade.
At June 30, 2020, our commercial real estate portfolio consisted of

N/A - Not applicable.
The provision for credit losses was $143 million in the second
quarter of 2020, primarily driven by our commercial real estate
portfolio and reflecting increased downgrades and the continuation
of the challenging macroeconomic outlook.
We had $12.9 billion of secured margin loans on our balance sheet
at June 30, 2020 compared with $13.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2019. We
have rarely suffered a loss on these types of loans. As a result, we
believe that the ratio of allowance for loan losses and lendingrelated commitments as a percentage of non-margin loans is a more
appropriate metric to measure the adequacy of the reserve.
Reverse repurchase agreements at June 30, 2020 were fully securedwith high quality collateral. As a result, there was no allowance forcredit losses related to these assets at June 30, 2020. This comparesto an $18 million allowance at March 31, 2020. The decrease isdriven by a reduction in exposure and improvement in collateralliquidity and values related to reverse repurchase agreementscollateralized by non-agency debt securities.The allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-relatedcommitments represent management’s estimate of lifetime expectedlosses in our credit portfolio. This evaluation process is subject tonumerous estimates and judgments. To the extent actual resultsdiffer from forecasts or
BNY Mellon 29
management’s judgment, the allowance for credit losses may be
greater or less than future charge-offs.
Based on an evaluation of the allowance for credit losses as
discussed in “Critical accounting estimates” and Note 2 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have allocated our
allowance for loans and lending-related commitments as presented
below.

Financial Instruments, on a prospective basis. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statement for additional information.
(b) The allowance related to foreign exposure has been reclassified to the respective
classes of financing receivables.
(c) Includes the allowance for credit losses on wealth management mortgages.
The allocation of the allowance for credit losses is inherently
judgmental, and the entire allowance for credit losses is available to
absorb credit losses regardless of the nature of the losses.
Our allowance for credit losses is sensitive to a number of inputs,
most notably the credit ratings assigned to each borrower as well as
macroeconomic forecast assumptions that are incorporated in our
estimate of credit losses through the expected life of the loan
portfolio. Thus, as the macroeconomic environment and related
forecasts change, the allowance for credit losses may change
materially. The following sensitivity analyses do not represent
management’s expectations of the deterioration of our portfolios or
the economic environment, but are provided as hypothetical
scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses
to changes in key inputs. If each credit were rated one grade better,
the allowance would have decreased by $125 million, and if each
credit were rated one grade worse, the allowance would have
increased by $202 million. Our multi-scenario based
macroeconomic forecast used in determining the June 30, 2020
allowance for credit losses consisted of three recessionaryscenarios, each of varying severity and duration. The baselinescenario reflects moderate recovery across most key variables,whereas the upside scenario is principally a V-shaped recovery, andthe downside scenario is reflective of W-shaped recovery in GDPand unemployment and deeper reductions in asset prices comparedto the baseline. We placed the most weight on our baselinescenario, with the remaining weighting resulting in slightly moreweight placed on the downside scenario than the upside scenario.From a sensitivity perspective, at June 30, 2020, if we had applied100% weighting to the downside scenario, the allowance for creditlosses would have been approximately $245 million higher.Nonperforming assetsThe table below presents our nonperforming assets.Nonperforming assets

Lost interest
Interest revenue would have increased by $1 million in the secondquarter of 2020 and first quarter of 2020, $4 million in the secondquarter of 2019, $3 million in the first six months of 2020 and $7million in the first six months of 2019, if nonperforming30 BNY Mellon
loans at period-end had been performing for the entire respective
periods.
Loan modifications
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, there have been two forms of
relief provided for classifying loans as troubled debt restructurings
(“TDRs”): The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security
Act (the “CARES Act”) and the Interagency Guidance. See Note 2
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
details on this guidance. Financial institutions may account for
eligible loan modifications either under the CARES Act or the
Interagency Guidance and we have elected to apply both, as
applicable, in providing borrowers with loan modification relief in
response to the coronavirus pandemic. We modified loans totaling
$282 million in the second quarter of 2020 by providing short-termloan payment forbearances or modified principal and/or interest
payments. We did not identify these modifications as TDRs. These
loans were primarily residential mortgage and commercial real
estate loans. During the loan modification period, these loans are
not reported as nonperforming or past due. We modified other
residential mortgage loans totaling less than $1 million in both the
second quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2020. Deposits
Increased volatility coupled with the interest rate environment led
to an increase in deposit levels as our clients increased the levels of
cash placed with us. Total deposits were $305.5 billion at June 30,
2020, an increase of 18%, compared with $259.5 billion at Dec. 31,
2019. Noninterest-bearing deposits were $78.1 billion at June 30, 2020
compared with $57.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2019. Interest-bearing
deposits were $227.4 billion at June 30, 2020 compared with
$201.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2019. See “Impact of coronavirus
pandemic on our business” for additional information.
Short-term borrowings
We fund ourselves primarily through deposits and, to a lesser
extent, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Short-termborrowings consist of federal funds purchased and securities sold
under repurchase agreements, payables to customers and brokerdealers, commercial paper and other borrowed funds. Certain shortterm borrowings, for example, securities sold under repurchaseagreements, require the delivery of securities as collateral.Information related to federal funds purchased and securities soldunder repurchase agreements is presented below.Federal funds purchased and securities sold under

Overdrafts typically relate to timing differences forsettlements. The decrease in other borrowed funds compared withJune 30, 2019 primarily reflects a decrease in borrowings from theFederal Home Loan Bank, partially offset by borrowings from theFederal Reserve Bank of Boston under the MMLF program. Theincrease in other borrowed funds compared with March 31, 2020primarily reflects higher borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bankof Boston under the MMLF program, partially offset by loweroverdrafts of sub-custodian account balances in our InvestmentServices businesses and borrowings from the Federal Home LoanBank.
Liquidity and dividendsBNY Mellon defines liquidity as the ability of the Parent and itssubsidiaries to access funding or convert assets to cash quickly andefficiently, or to roll over or issue new debt, especially duringperiods of market stress, at a reasonable cost, and in order to meetits short-term (up to one year) obligations. Funding liquidity risk isthe risk that BNY Mellon cannot meet its cash and collateralobligations at a reasonable cost for both expected and unexpectedcash flow and collateral needs without adversely affecting dailyoperations or our financial condition. Funding liquidity risk canarise from funding mismatches, market constraints from theinability to convert assets into cash, the inability to hold or raise32 BNY Mellon
cash, low overnight deposits, deposit run-off or contingent liquidity
events.
Changes in economic conditions or exposure to credit, market,
operational, legal and reputational risks also can affect BNY
Mellon’s liquidity risk profile and are considered in our liquidity
risk framework. See “Impact of coronavirus pandemic on our
business” for additional information.
The Parent’s policy is to have access to sufficient unencumbered
cash and cash equivalents at each quarter-end to cover maturities
and other forecasted debt redemptions, net interest payments and
net tax payments for the following 18-month period, and to provide
sufficient collateral to satisfy transactions subject to Section 23A of
the Federal Reserve Act. As of June 30, 2020, the Parent was in
compliance with this policy.
For additional information on our liquidity policy, see “Risk
Management - Liquidity Risk” in our 2019 Annual Report.
We monitor and control liquidity exposures and funding needswithin and across significant legal entities, branches, currencies andbusiness lines, taking into account, among other factors, anyapplicable restrictions on the transfer of liquidity among entities.BNY Mellon also manages potential intraday liquidity risks. Wemonitor and manage intraday liquidity against existing andexpected intraday liquid resources (such as cash balances,remaining intraday credit capacity, intraday contingency fundingand available collateral) to enable BNY Mellon to meet its intradayobligations under normal and reasonably severe stressed conditions.We define available funds for internal liquidity managementpurposes as cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits withthe Federal Reserve and other central banks, interest-bearingdeposits with banks and federal funds sold and securities purchasedunder resale agreements.

The increase was
primarily due to higher interest-bearing deposits with the Federal
Reserve and other central banks.
Average non-core sources of funds, such as federal funds purchased
and securities sold under repurchase agreements, trading liabilities,
commercial paper and other borrowed funds, were $18.2 billion for
the six months ended June 30, 2020 and $18.4 billion for the six
months ended June 30, 2019. The decrease primarily reflects a
decrease in other borrowed funds and commercial paper, partially
offset by an increase in federal funds purchased and securities sold
under repurchase agreements.
Average foreign deposits, primarily from our European-basedInvestment Services businesses, were $103.1 billion for the sixmonths ended June 30, 2020, compared with $91.4 billion for thesix months ended June 30, 2019. Average interest-bearing domesticdeposits were $101.0 billion for the six months ended June 30,2020 and $72.4 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2019. Theincrease primarily reflects increased client activity.Average payables to customers and broker-dealers were $17.6billion for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and $15.9 billion forthe six months ended June 30, 2019. Payables to customers andbroker-dealers are driven by customer trading activity and marketvolatility.

Average long-term debt was $27.7 billion for the six months ended
June 30, 2020 and $28.0 billion for six months ended June 30,
2019. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased to $66.5 billion for
the six months ended June 30, 2020 from $53.8 billion for the six
months ended June 30, 2019, primarily reflecting client activity.
A significant reduction in our Investment Services business would
reduce our access to deposits. See
“Asset/liability management” for additional factors that couldimpact our deposit balances.
Sources of liquidity
The Parent’s three major sources of liquidity are access to the debtand equity markets, dividends from its subsidiaries, and cash onhand and cash otherwise made available in business-as-usualcircumstances to the Parent through a committed credit facility withour intermediate holding company (“IHC”).Our ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms, or at all, is partially dependent on our credit ratings, which are as follows:Credit ratings at June 30, 2020

Long-term debt totaled $27.6 billion at June 30, 2020 and $27.5
billion at Dec. 31, 2019. Issuances of $2.25 billion and an increase
in the fair value of hedged long-term debt were partially offset by
maturities of $1.75 billion and a redemption of $1.25 billion. The
Parent has $2.2 billion of long-term debt that will mature in the
remainder of 2020.
In July 2020, the Parent redeemed $1.1 billion of 2.6% senior notes
due in August 2020 at par plus accrued and unpaid interest.
In May 2020, the Parent issued 1,000,000 depositary shares, each
representing a 1/100th interest in a share of the Parent’s Series GNoncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (the “Series G Preferred
Stock”). The Series G Preferred Stock has an aggregate
liquidation preference of $1 billion. The Parent will pay dividendson the Series G Preferred Stock, if declared by its board of directorson each March 20 and September 20, at an annual rate equal to4.70% from the original issue date to but excluding, Sept. 20, 2025;and at a floating rate equal to the five-year treasury rate (as definedin the certificate of designation) on the date that is three businessdays prior to the reset date plus 4.358% for each reset period, fromand including Sept. 20, 2025. The floating rate will initially reset onSept. 20, 2025 and subsequently on each date falling on the fifthanniversary of the preceding reset date.
The Bank of New York Mellon may issue notes and CDs. Therewere no CDs outstanding at June 30, 2020. At Dec. 31, 2019, $1.1billion of CDs were
34 BNY Mellon
outstanding. At June 30, 2020 and Dec. 31, 2019, $32 million and
$1.3 billion, respectively, of notes were outstanding.
The Bank of New York Mellon also issues commercial paper that
matures within 397 days from the date of issue and is not
redeemable prior to maturity or subject to voluntary prepayment.
The average commercial paper outstanding was $886 million for
the six months ended June 30, 2020 and $2.2 billion for the six
months ended June 30, 2019. Commercial paper outstanding was
$665 million at June 30, 2020 and $4.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2019. Subsequent to June 30, 2020, our U.S. bank subsidiaries could
declare dividends to the Parent of approximately $796 million, without the need for a regulatory waiver. In addition, at June 30,
2020, non-bank subsidiaries of the Parent had liquid assets of
approximately $1.6 billion. Restrictions on our ability to obtain
funds from our subsidiaries are discussed in more detail in
“Supervision and Regulation - Capital Planning and Stress Testing -
Payment of Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Other Capital
Distributions” and in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report.
Pershing LLC has uncommitted lines of credit in place for liquidity
purposes which are guaranteed by the Parent. Pershing LLC has
three separate uncommitted lines of credit amounting to $750
million in aggregate. There were no borrowings under these lines in
the second quarter of 2020. Pershing Limited, an indirect UK-based
subsidiary of BNY Mellon, has three separate uncommitted lines of
credit amounting to $350 million in aggregate. Average borrowings
under these lines were $31 million, in aggregate, in the second
quarter of 2020. BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC also has an uncommitted line
of credit in place for $100 million for liquidity purposes. There
were no borrowings under this line in the second quarter of 2020. The double leverage ratio is the ratio of our equity investment in
subsidiaries divided by our consolidated Parent company equity,
which includes our noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. In
short, the double leverage ratio measures the extent to which equity
in subsidiaries is financed by Parent company debt. As the double
leverage ratio increases, this can reflect greater demands on a
company’s cash flows in order to service interest
payments and debt maturities. BNY Mellon’s double leverage ratiois managed in a range considering the high level of unencumberedavailable liquid assets held in its principal subsidiaries (such ascentral bank deposit placements and government securities), theCompany’s cash generating fee-based business model, with feerevenue representing 79% of total revenue in the second quarter of2020, and the dividend capacity of our banking subsidiaries. Ourdouble leverage ratio was 116.6% at June 30, 2020 and 116.9% atDec. 31, 2019, and within the range targeted by management.Uses of funds
The Parent’s major uses of funds are repurchases of common stock,payment of dividends, principal and interest payments on itsborrowings, acquisitions and additional investments in itssubsidiaries.
In May 2020, a quarterly cash dividend of $0.31 per common sharewas paid to common shareholders. Our common stock dividendpayout ratio was 31% for the second quarter of 2020.In March 2020, we and the other members of the Financial ServicesForum announced the temporary suspension of share repurchasesuntil the end of the second quarter of 2020 to preserve capital andliquidity in order to further the objective of using capital andliquidity to support clients and customers. In the second quarter of2020, we repurchased 61.2 thousand common shares fromemployees, primarily in connection with the employees’ paymentof taxes upon the vesting of restricted stock, at an average price of$43.59 per common share for a total cost of $3 million.In connection with the Federal Reserve’s release of the CCARresults in June 2020, BNY Mellon announced that it will notconduct open market common stock repurchases in the third quarterof 2020 and will resume the common stock repurchase program asearly as possible, depending on factors such as prevailing marketconditions, our outlook for the economic environment, theadditional capital analysis required by the Federal Reserve, andwhether the Federal Reserve keeps the limitations for the thirdquarter of 2020 in place for subsequent quarters. The FederalReserve has announced that it will conduct additional analysis forall participating CCAR firms, including us, later this year and willnot allow participating firms to make open market commonBNY Mellon 35
stock repurchases during the third quarter of 2020. See “Recent
regulatory developments” for additional information related to the
2020 CCAR results.
Liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”)
U.S. regulators have established an LCR that requires certain
banking organizations, including BNY Mellon, to maintain a
minimum amount of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets
(“HQLA”) sufficient to withstand the net cash outflow under a
hypothetical standardized acute liquidity stress scenario for a 30-
day time horizon.
The following table presents BNY Mellon’s consolidated HQLA at
June 30, 2020, and the average HQLA and average LCR for the
second quarter of 2020. Consolidated HQLA and LCR
(dollars in billions) June 30, 2020
Securities (a) $ 125
Cash (b) 107
Total consolidated HQLA (c) $ 232
Total consolidated HQLA – average (c) $ 210
Average LCR 112%(a) Primarily includes securities of U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, U.S.
Treasury, sovereign securities, U.S. agency and investment-grade corporate
debt.
(b) Primarily includes cash on deposit with central banks.
(c) Consolidated HQLA presented before adjustments. After haircuts and the
impact of trapped liquidity, consolidated HQLA totaled $167 billion at June 30,
2020 and averaged $156 billion for the second quarter of 2020. BNY Mellon and each of our affected domestic bank subsidiaries
were compliant with the U.S. LCR requirements of at least 100%throughout the second quarter of 2020. Statement of cash flows
The following summarizes the activity reflected on the consolidated
statement of cash flows. While this information may be helpful to
highlight certain macro trends and business strategies, the cash flowanalysis may not be as relevant when analyzing changes in our
net earnings and net assets. We believe that in addition to thetraditional cash flow analysis, the discussion related to liquidity anddividends and asset/liability management herein may provide moreuseful context in evaluating our liquidity position and relatedactivity.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.1 billion in the sixmonths ended June 30, 2020, compared with net cash used foroperating activities of $2.5 billion in the six months ended June 30,2019. In the six months ended June 30, 2020, cash flows providedby operations primarily resulted from earnings and changes inaccruals. In the six months ended June 30, 2019, cash flows usedfor operations primarily resulted from changes in accruals andtrading activities, partially offset by earnings.Net cash used for investing activities was $58.7 billion in the sixmonths ended June 30, 2020, compared with $11.4 billion in the sixmonths ended June 30, 2019. In the six months ended June 30,2020, net cash used for investing activities primarily reflects netchanges in securities, change in interest-bearing deposits with theFederal Reserve and other central banks and changes in federalfunds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements. In thesix months ended June 30, 2019, net cash used for investingactivities primarily reflects changes in federal funds sold andsecurities purchased under resale agreements, partially offset bychanges in loans.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $53.4 billion in thesix months ended June 30, 2020, compared with $13.2 billion in thesix months ended June 30, 2019. In the six months ended June 30,2020, net cash provided by financing activity reflects changes indeposits and payables to customers and broker-dealers, partiallyoffset by changes in commercial paper. In the six months endedJune 30, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities primarilyreflects changes in deposits and changes in commercial paper,partially offset by repayment of long-term debt, changes in federalfunds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreementsand changes in other borrowed funds.

equity increased to $43.7 billion at June 30, 2020 from $41.5 billion
at Dec. 31, 2019. The increase primarily reflects earnings, the
issuance of preferred stock and unrealized gain on securities
available-for-sale, partially offset by common stock repurchases
and dividend payments.
In May 2020, the Parent issued 1,000,000 depositary shares, each
representing a 1/100th interest in a share of the Parent’s Series GPreferred Stock. The Series G Preferred Stock has an aggregate
liquidation preference of $1 billion. The Parent will pay dividends
on the Series G Preferred Stock, if declared by its board of directors
on each March 20 and September 20, at an annual rate equal to
4.70% from the original issue date to but excluding, Sept. 20, 2025;
and at a floating rate equal to the five-year treasury rate (as defined
in the certificate of designation) on the date that is three business
days prior to the reset date plus 4.358% for each reset period, fromand including Sept. 20, 2025. The floating rate will initially reset on
Sept. 20, 2025 and subsequently on each date falling on the fifth
anniversary of the preceding reset date.
The unrealized gain (after-tax) on our available-for-sale securities
portfolio, net of hedges, included in accumulated OCI was $1.2
billion at June 30, 2020, compared with $361 million at Dec. 31,
2019. The increase in the unrealized gain, net of tax, was primarily
driven by lower market interest rates.
In the six months ended June 30, 2020, we repurchased 21.7million common shares at an average price of $45.43 per commonshare for a total of $988 million under the current program prior tothe temporary suspension of share repurchases in March 2020.In connection with the Federal Reserve’s release of the CCARresults in June 2020, BNY Mellon announced that it will notconduct open market common stock repurchases in the third quarterof 2020 and will resume the common stock repurchase program asearly as possible, depending on factors such as prevailing marketconditions, our outlook for the economic environment, theadditional capital analysis required by the Federal Reserve, andwhether the Federal Reserve keeps the limitations for the thirdquarter of 2020 in place for subsequent quarters. The FederalReserve has announced that it will conduct additional analysis forall participating CCAR firms, including us, later this year and willnot allow participating firms to make open market common stockrepurchases during the third quarter of 2020. For additionalinformation, see “Recent Regulatory Developments.”Capital adequacy
Regulators establish certain levels of capital for bank holdingcompanies (“BHCs”) and banks, including BNY Mellon and ourbank subsidiaries, in accordance with established quantitativemeasurements. For theBNY Mellon 37
Parent to maintain its status as a financial holding company
(“FHC”), our U.S. bank subsidiaries and BNY Mellon must, among
other things, qualify as “well capitalized.” As of June 30, 2020 and
Dec. 31, 2019, BNY Mellon and our U.S. bank subsidiaries were
“well capitalized.”
Failure to satisfy regulatory standards, including “well capitalized”
status or capital adequacy rules more generally, could result in
limitations on our activities and adversely affect our financial
condition. See the discussion of these matters in “Supervision and
Regulation - Regulated Entities of BNY Mellon and Ancillary
Regulatory Requirements” and “Risk Factors - Operational Risk -
Failure to satisfy
regulatory standards, including “well capitalized” and “wellmanaged” status or capital adequacy and liquidity rules moregenerally, could result in limitations on our activities and adverselyaffect our
business and financial condition,” both of which are in our 2019Annual Report.
The U.S. banking agencies’ capital rules are based on theframework adopted by the Basel Committee on BankingSupervision (“BCBS”), as amended from time to time. Foradditional information on these capital requirements, see“Supervision and Regulation” in our 2019 Annual Report and“Recent regulatory developments” in this Form 10-Q.The table below presents our consolidated and largest bank subsidiary regulatory capital ratios.

(b) For our CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, our effective capital ratios under U.S. capital rules are the lower of the ratios as calculated under the Standardizedand Advanced Approaches. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is based on Tier 1 capital and quarterly average total assets. The U.S. global systemically important banks (“G-SIB”)surcharge of 1.5% is subject to change. The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set to 0%.
(c) The Federal Reserve’s regulations do not establish well capitalized thresholds for these measures for BHCs.
(d) The SLR is based on Tier 1 capital and total leverage exposure, which includes certain off-balance sheet exposures. The SLR at June 30, 2020 reflects the exclusion ofcertain central bank placements from leverage exposure.
(e) The SLR at June 30, 2020 reflects the temporary exclusion of U.S. Treasury securities from the leverage exposure which increased our consolidated SLR by 40 basis points.38 BNY Mellon
Our CET1 ratio determined under the Advanced Approaches was
12.6% at June 30, 2020 and 11.5% at Dec. 31, 2019. The increase
primarily reflects capital generated through earnings and unrealized
gains on assets available-for-sale, partially offset by capital
deployed through common stock repurchased, prior to the
temporary suspension of share repurchases in March 2020, and
dividend payments.
Our operational loss risk model is informed by external losses,
including fines and penalties levied against institutions in the
financial services industry, particularly those that relate to
businesses in which we operate, and as a result external losses have
impacted and could in the future impact the amount of capital that
we are required to hold.
Our capital ratios are necessarily subject to, among other things,
anticipated compliance with all necessary enhancements to model
calibration, approval by regulators of certain models used as part of
RWA calculations, other refinements, further implementation
guidance from regulators, market practices and standards and any
changes BNY Mellon may make to its businesses. As a
consequence of these factors, our capital ratios may materially
change, and may be volatile over time and from period to period.

Capital ratios vary depending on the size of the balance sheet atperiod end and the levels and types of investments in assets. Thebalance sheet size fluctuates from period to period based on levelsof customer and market activity. In general, when servicing clientsare more actively trading securities, deposit balances and thebalance sheet as a whole are higher. In addition, when marketsexperience significant volatility or stress, our balance sheet sizemay increase considerably as client deposit levels increase.Effective April 1, 2020, custody banks, including BNY Mellon andThe Bank of New York Mellon, are permitted to exclude certaincentral bank placements from leverage exposure used in the SLRcalculation. Also, effective April 1, 2020 and lasting through March31, 2021, BHCs are permitted to exclude U.S. Treasury securitiesfrom the leverage exposure used in the SLR calculation. Thistemporary exclusion increased our consolidated SLR by 40 basispoints. See “Supervision and Regulation” in our 2019 AnnualReport and “Recent regulatory developments” in our First Quarter2020 Form 10-Q for additional information.Stress capital buffer
In June 2020, the Federal Reserve notified BNY Mellon that itsstress capital buffer (“SCB”) requirement will be 2.5%, equal to theregulatory minimum, effective as of Oct. 1, 2020. The SCBreplaces the current 2.5% capital conservation buffer forStandardized Approach capital ratios.
The SCB final rule generally eliminates the requirement for priorapproval of common stock repurchases in excess of thedistributions in a firm’s capital plan, provided that suchdistributions do not cause a breach of the firm’s capital ratios,including the applicable capital buffer. In conjunction with therelease of the 2020 CCAR results, the Federal Reserve has imposedrestrictions on capital distributions for the third quarter of 2020. Formore detail regarding these restrictions, see “Recent regulatorydevelopments - CCAR 2020 results” in this Quarterly Report onForm 10-Q.
Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (“TLAC”)The final TLAC rule establishing external TLAC, external longterm debt (“LTD”) and related requirements for U.S. G-SIBs,including BNY

(b) Buffer to be met using only CET1.
(c) Buffer to be met using only Tier 1 capital.
External TLAC consists of the Parent’s Tier 1 capital and eligible
unsecured LTD issued by it that has a remaining term to maturity of
at least one year and satisfies certain other conditions. Eligible LTDconsists of the unpaid principal balance of eligible unsecured debt
securities, subject to haircuts for amounts due to be paid within two
years, that satisfy certain other conditions. Debt issued prior to Dec.
31, 2016 has been permanently grandfathered to the extent these
instruments otherwise would be ineligible only due to containing
impermissible acceleration rights or being governed by foreign law.
The following table presents our external TLAC and external LTDratios.

If BNY Mellon maintains risk-based ratio or leverage TLACmeasures above the minimum required level, but with a risk-basedratio or leverage below the minimum level with buffers, we willface constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and discretionaryexecutive compensation based on the amount of the shortfall andeligible retained income.
Trading activities and risk managementOur trading activities are focused on acting as a market-maker forour customers, facilitating customer trades and risk mitigatinghedging in compliance with the Volcker Rule. The risk frommarket-making activities for customers is managed by our tradersand limited in total exposure through a system of position limits,value-at-risk (“VaR”) methodology and other market sensitivitymeasures. VaR is the potential loss in value due to adverse marketmovements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidencelevel. The calculation of our VaR used by management andpresented below assumes a one-day holding period, utilizes a 99%confidence level and incorporates non-linear productcharacteristics. VaR facilitates comparisons across portfolios ofdifferent risk characteristics. VaR also captures the diversificationof aggregated risk at the firm-wide level.
VaR represents a key risk management measure and it is importantto note the inherent limitations to VaR, which include:• VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer time horizonswhere moves may be extreme; • VaR does not take account of potential variability of marketliquidity; and• Previous moves in market risk factors may not produce accuratepredictions of all future market moves.
See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements foradditional information on the VaR methodology.The following tables indicate the calculated VaR amounts for thetrading portfolio for the designated periods using the historicalsimulation VaR model.

N/M - Because the minimum and maximum may occur on different days for different risk
components, it is not meaningful to compute a minimum and maximum portfolio
diversification effect.
The decrease in VaR at June 30, 2020 compared with March 31,2020 reflects lower market volatility in the second quarter of 2020.The interest rate component of VaR represents instruments whosevalues are predominantly driven by U.S. Treasury securities interestrate levels. These instruments include, but are not limited to, U.S.Treasury securities, swaps, swaptions, forward rate agreements,exchange-traded futures and options, and other interest ratederivative products.
The foreign exchange component of VaR represents instrumentswhose values predominantly vary with the level or volatility ofcurrency exchange rates or interest rates. These instrumentsinclude, but are not limited to, currency balances, spot and forwardtransactions, currency options and other currency derivativeproducts.
The equity component of VaR consists of instruments that representan ownership interest in the form of domestic and foreign commonstock or other equity-linked instruments. These instruments include,but are not limited to, common stock, exchange-traded funds,preferred stock, listed equity options (puts and calls), OTC equityoptions, equity total return swaps, equity index futures and otherequity derivative products.
The credit component of VaR represents instruments whose valuesare predominantly driven by credit spread levels, i.e., idiosyncraticdefault risk. These instruments include, but are not limited to,securities with exposures from corporate and municipal creditspreads.
The diversification component of VaR is the risk reduction benefitthat occurs when combining portfolios and offsetting positions, andfrom the correlated behavior of risk factor movements.During the second quarter of 2020, interest rate risk generated 29%of average gross VaR, foreign exchange risk generated 33% ofaverage gross VaR, equity risk generated 5% of average gross VaRand credit risk generated 33% of average gross VaR. During thesecond quarter of 2020, our daily trading loss did not exceed ourcalculated VaR amount of the overall portfolio.42 BNY Mellon

primarily related to spot and forward foreign exchange transactions,
derivatives and securities trades for our customers and excludes any associated
commissions, underwriting fees and net interest revenue.
The number of days when revenue was generated decreased
compared with the first quarter of 2020 driven by lower volumes
and volatility in the second quarter of 2020.
Trading assets include debt and equity instruments and derivative
assets, primarily interest rate and foreign exchange contracts, not
designated as hedging instruments. Trading assets were $14.2
billion at June 30, 2020 and $13.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2019. Trading liabilities include debt and equity instruments and
derivative liabilities, primarily interest rate and foreign exchange
contracts, not designated as hedging instruments. Trading liabilities
were $5.6 billion at June 30, 2020 and $4.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2019. Under our fair value methodology for derivative contracts, an initial
“risk-neutral” valuation is performed on each position assuming
time-discounting based on a AA credit curve. In addition, we
consider credit risk in arriving at the fair value of our derivatives.
We reflect external credit ratings as well as observable creditdefault swap spreads for both ourselves and our counterpartieswhen measuring the fair value of our derivative positions.Accordingly, the valuation of our derivative positions is sensitive tothe current changes in our own credit spreads, as well as those ofour counterparties.
At June 30, 2020, our OTC derivative assets, including those inhedging relationships, of $4.3 billion included a credit valuationadjustment (“CVA”) deduction of $41 million. Our OTC derivativeliabilities, including those in hedging relationships, of $3.9 billionincluded a debit valuation adjustment (“DVA”) of $1 millionrelated to our own credit spread. Net of hedges, the CVA increasedby $2 million and the DVA increased by less than $1 million in thesecond quarter of 2020, which decreased foreign exchange andother trading revenue by $2 million. The net impact increasedforeign exchange and other trading revenue by $4 million in thefirst quarter of 2020 and $1 million in the second quarter of 2019.The table below summarizes the distribution of credit ratings forour foreign exchange and interest rate derivative counterpartiesover the past five quarters, which indicates the level of counterpartycredit associated with these trading activities. Significant changesin counterparty credit ratings could alter the level of credit riskfaced by BNY Mellon.

Asset/liability management
Our diversified business activities include processing securities,
accepting deposits, investing in securities, lending, raising money
as needed to fund assets and other transactions. The market risks
from these activities include interest rate risk and foreign exchange
risk. Our primary market risk is exposure to movements in U.S.
dollar interest rates and certain foreign currency interest rates. We
actively manage interest rate sensitivity and use earnings simulation
and discounted cash flow models to identify interest rate exposures.
An earnings simulation model is the primary tool used to assess
changes in pre-tax net interest revenue. The model incorporates
management’s assumptions regarding interest rates, market spreads,
changes in the prepayment behavior of loans and securities and the
impact of derivative financial instruments used for interest rate risk
management purposes. These assumptions have been developed
through a combination of historical analysis and future expected
pricing behavior and are inherently uncertain. Actual results may
differ materially from projected results due to timing, magnitude
and frequency of interest rate changes, and changes in market
conditions and management’s strategies, among other factors.
In the table below, we use the earnings simulation model to run
various interest rate ramp scenarios from a baseline scenario. The
interest rate ramp scenarios examine the impact of large interest
rate movements. In each scenario, all currencies’ interest rates are
shifted higher or lower. Typically, the baseline scenario uses the
average deposit balances of the last month of the quarter. However,
during the month of March we experienced a significant increase in
deposits and a corresponding increase in central bank placements.
To normalize the analysis, we used the first quarter average for
these balances. The 100 basis point ramp scenario assumes rates
change 25 basis points above or below the yield curve in each of
the next four quarters and the 200 basis point ramp scenario
assumes a 50 basis point per quarter change. Interest rate sensitivity
is quantified by calculating the change in pre-tax net interest
revenue between the scenarios over a 12-month measurement
period. The net interest revenue sensitivity methodology assumes
static deposit levels and also assumes that no management actions
will be taken to mitigate the effects of interest rate changes.
The following table shows net interest revenue sensitivity for BNYMellon.

interest revenue

(b) Long-term is equal to or greater than one year.
The down 100 basis point scenario was impacted by a change in ourdeposit assumptions. Specifically, we increased the amount ofdeposit balances to which we would pass through negative centralbank rates in the scenario.
To illustrate the net interest revenue sensitivity to deposit runoff,we note that a $5 billion instantaneous reduction of U.S. dollardenominated noninterest-bearing deposits would reduce the netinterest revenue sensitivity results in the ramp up 100 basis pointand 200 basis point scenarios in the table above by approximately$35 million and approximately $65 million, respectively. Theimpact would be smaller if the runoff was assumed to be a mixtureof interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits.For a discussion of factors impacting the growth or contraction ofdeposits, see “Risk Factors - Our business, financial condition andresults of operations could be adversely affected if we do noteffectively manage our liquidity,” in our 2019 Annual Report.Off-balance sheet arrangementsOff-balance sheet arrangements discussed in this section are limitedto certain guarantees, retained or contingent interests andobligations arising out of unconsolidated variable interest entities(“VIEs”). Guarantees include SBLCs issued as part of ourcorporate banking business and securities lending indemnificationsissued as part of our Investment Services business. See Note 18 ofthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a furtherdiscussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements.44 BNY Mellon
Supplemental information - Explanation of GAAP and
Non-GAAP financial measures
BNY Mellon has included in this Form 10-Q certain Non-GAAP
financial measures on a tangible basis as a supplement to generally
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) information, which
exclude goodwill and intangible assets, net of deferred tax
liabilities. We believe that the return on tangible common equity is
additional useful information for investors because it presents a
measure of those assets that can generate income, and the tangible
book value per common share is additional useful information
because it presents the level of tangible assets in relation to shares
of common stock outstanding.
The presentation of the growth rates of investment management and
performance fees on a constant currency basis permits investors to
assess the significance of changes in foreign currency exchange
rates. Growth rates on a constant currency basis were determinedby applying the current period foreign currency exchange rates tothe prior period revenue. We believe that this presentation, as asupplement to GAAP information, gives investors a clearer pictureof the related revenue results without the variability caused byfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.BNY Mellon has also included the adjusted pre-tax operatingmargin – Non-GAAP, which is the pre-tax operating margin for theInvestment and Wealth Management business net of distributionand servicing expense that was passed to third parties whodistribute or service our managed funds. We believe that thismeasure is useful when evaluating the performance of theInvestment and Wealth Management business relative to industrycompetitors.

Recent accounting and regulatory developments
Recent accounting developments
The following ASU issued by the FASB had not yet been adopted
as of June 30, 2020.
ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform: Facilitation of the Effects of
Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting
In March 2020, the FASB issued an ASU, Reference Rate Reform:
Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial
Reporting. This ASU provides temporary optional expedients and
exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to financial contracts, hedging
relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate
reform. This ASU also permits an entity to make a one-time
election to sell and/or transfer held-to-maturity securities that are
affected by reference rate reform and were classified as held-tomaturity on or before Jan. 1, 2020. The guidance in this ASU can
be adopted as of March 12, 2020 through Dec. 31, 2022. We are
assessing the impacts of the new standard, but would not expect this
ASU to have a material impact on BNY Mellon.
Recent regulatory developments
For a summary of additional regulatory matters relevant to our
operations, see “Recent regulatory developments” in our Form 10-
Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and “Supervision and
Regulation” in our 2019 Annual Report. The following discussions
summarize certain regulatory, legislative and other developments
that may affect BNY Mellon, the impact of many of which we are
still evaluating.
CCAR 2020 results
On June 25, 2020, the Federal Reserve released the results of its
stress tests for 2020 and additional sensitivity analyses that the
Federal Reserve conducted in light of the coronavirus pandemic.
The Federal Reserve also notified BNY Mellon that its SCB
requirement will be 2.5%, which equals the regulatory floor. The
SCB will be effective on Oct. 1, 2020. For additional information
regarding the SCB, see “Recent regulatory developments - Changes
to CCAR and Stress Capital Buffer” in our First Quarter
2020 Form 10-Q and “Supervision and Regulation - CapitalPlanning and Stress Testing” in our 2019 Annual Report.In light of the changes in the financial markets and the economy,the Federal Reserve announced that all banking institutions subjectto CCAR, including BNY Mellon, will be required to resubmit theircapital plans. In connection with the capital plan resubmission, theFederal Reserve may recalculate CCAR firms’ SCBs (includingBNY Mellon’s). For the third quarter of 2020, all CCAR firms,including BNY Mellon, will only be permitted to repurchase stockin connection with employee benefit plans, pay common stockdividends that do not exceed an amount equal to the average of thefirm’s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters providedthat the amount of the common stock dividend is not increased, andpay scheduled dividends on additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capitalinstruments. The Federal Reserve has stated that it may extendthese limitations quarter-by-quarter. Consistent with theselimitations, for the third quarter, BNY Mellon plans to maintain itsquarterly common stock dividend of $0.31 per share and to suspendits open market common stock repurchases. Volcker Covered Funds Regulations RevisionOn June 25, 2020, the Federal Reserve, OCC, FDIC, Securities andExchange Commission (“SEC”) and Commodity Futures TradingCommission (“CFTC”) finalized a second major set of amendmentsto the implementing regulations for the provisions of the DoddFrank Act commonly referred to as the “Volcker Rule”. This set ofamendments, which follows revisions to the proprietary tradingprovisions of the Volcker Rule in 2019, contains a number oftargeted amendments to the Volcker Rule regulations, principallyfocused on the restrictions on banking entities’ investments in,sponsorship of, and other relationships with covered funds. BNYMellon’s preliminary assessment is that the changes are favorableand reduce certain compliance burdens; however, the generalprohibitions and requirements with respect to investment in,sponsoring of and transactions with covered funds would remain inplace.
The provision that may have the most targeted benefits to BNYMellon concerns transactions with covered funds which we sponsoror advise. The amendments exempt certain transactions from theBNY Mellon 47
currently applicable prohibitions, including intraday credit
extensions and certain payment, clearing and settlement
transactions, subject to certain conditions. Additionally, the
amendments narrow the definition of “ownership interest,” which
may reduce the compliance burden on BNY Mellon investments.
The amendments will become effective on Oct. 1, 2020.
CRR “Quick Fix”
On June 27, 2020, a so-called “quick fix” to the Capital
Requirements Regulation (“CRR Quick Fix”) became applicable.
Among other things, the CRR Quick Fix enables EU credit
institutions, such as The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, to
exclude central bank deposits from leverage ratio calculations under
certain conditions, including a declaration of “exceptional
circumstances” from the credit institution’s competent authority.
The leverage ratio will become a binding requirement in the EU, as
part of the Capital Requirements Regulation 2, on June 28, 2021.
The extent to which the UK implements the leverage ratio
exclusion of the CRR Quick Fix depends on its policy stance after
the end of the transition period under the EU withdrawal
agreement.
