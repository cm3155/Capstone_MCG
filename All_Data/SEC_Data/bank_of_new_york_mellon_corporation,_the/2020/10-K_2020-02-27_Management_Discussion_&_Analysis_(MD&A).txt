Overview

Established in 1784 by Alexander Hamilton, we were
the first company listed on the New York Stock
Exchange (NYSE: BK). With a history of more than
235 years, BNY Mellon is a global company that
manages and services assets for financial institutions,
corporations and individual investors in 35 countries.

BNY Mellon has two business segments, Investment
Services and Investment and Wealth Management,
which offer a comprehensive set of capabilities and
deep expertise across the investment lifecycle,
enabling the Company to provide solutions to buy-
side and sell-side market participants, as well as
leading institutional and wealth management clients
globally.

The diagram below presents our two business
segments and lines of business, with the remaining
operations in the Other segment.

Our enduring ambition is to build the best global team
—one that is inclusive of varying perspectives,
backgrounds and experiences, and represents the
increasingly varied markets and clients we serve. Our
core objective is to empower our teams to do their
best work, make unique contributions, and build
purposeful careers in an equitable environment where
they are treated with fairness, dignity and respect.

Diversity and Inclusion

Diversity and inclusion is integral to who we are as a
company, what our people experience as members of
our global team, and how we serve all of our
stakeholders. Our diversity and inclusion strategy is
not separate, but embedded in our business strategy,
operating model, talent experience and client value
proposition.

To increase our talent pool diversity, we work with
professional associations, educational institutions,
think tanks and nonprofits to deepen engagement with
Black, Latinx, Asian, LGBT+, neuro-diverse
individuals, people with disabilities, and talent from
other underrepresented backgrounds. We aim for fair
inclusion by requiring diverse candidate slates,
creating gender-neutral job descriptions and involving

BNY Mellon 3

Results of Operations (continued)

diverse interview panels. We embed diversity and
inclusion in our talent review processes, succession
plans and development objectives to improve
promotion readiness and advance and retain talent
from all backgrounds.

At the most senior level, our Executive Committee
sets diversity and inclusion goals with specific targets
to improve senior leader diversity and to increase
female representation globally and diverse ethnic and/
or racial representation in the United States.
Executive Committee members’ variable
compensation is directly tied to performance against
these goals.

At the end of 2020, women were 41% of BNY
Mellon’s global workforce and 44% of BNY
Mellon’s U.S. workforce. Further, 35% of BNY
Mellon’s U.S. workforce were from underrepresented
ethnic and/or racial backgrounds.

At the end of 2020, 29% of BNY Mellon’s Executive
Committee were women and 20% of BNY Mellon’s
Executive Committee were from underrepresented
ethnic and/or racial backgrounds.

Our Board of Directors is committed to fostering and
maintaining its diversity. At the end of 2020, 27% of
our Board of Directors were women and 36% of our
Board of Directors was composed of individuals from
underrepresented ethnic and/or racial backgrounds.

In addition, four of BNY Mellon’s six standing
committees of its Board of Directors are chaired by a
diverse director based on race or gender.

Retention, Training and Development

We seek to attract and retain employees by providing
arewarding employee experience. We recognize that
employees seek a supportive, safe and inclusive
workplace, and we continually evaluate our employee
engagement and wellbeing programs in an effort to
meet those expectations. We offer a 401(k) plan for
U.S. employees, and other defined contribution
retirement plans worldwide, where consistent with
market practice. We also maintain frozen defined
benefit plans for certain current and former
employees. At Dec. 31, 2020, we had approximately
43,100 participants in our 401(k) plan, including
former employees. In addition, our frozen US.
defined benefit pension plan covered approximately
9,800 U.S. participants and our non-U.S. defined

4 BNY Mellon

benefit plans (some frozen) covered approximately
13,900 non-U.S. participants.

At key career transition points, from internship to
executive management, we offer programs and
development opportunities to help employees
advance their careers and progress within our
organization. Our extensive training and
development opportunities are designed to enable
employees to grow professionally and advance within
our organization.

We engage with employees to encourage innovation,
show appreciation for their contributions, and gather
feedback on how we can build a more rewarding,
inclusive workplace. For example, we regularly
gather feedback through an all-employee survey.

Employee Wellbeing, Health and Safety

BNY Mellon’s holistic approach to employee
wellbeing is designed to create a healthy, resilient and
vibrant workforce. Our programs are designed to
provide employees easy access to resources to help
improve their physical health, emotional resilience,
financial wellbeing and social connections. Further,
we work to ensure the safety of our employees and
clients in all of our facilities. During the coronavirus
pandemic, we were early to initiate our business
continuity plans and to restrict activities such as
travel and in-person participation in events and large
meetings. We quickly transitioned the vast majority
of our employees, including our senior management
and key personnel, to working from home, which
opened up space for us to create social distancing for
the small number of essential in-office staff. These
essential in-office staff are primarily performing roles
that cannot be done remotely. Since March 2020, the
vast majority of our global employees have worked
from home. We are taking a conservative and
measured approach in assessing how, and when, we
will return employees to our offices when the
COVID-19 pandemic subsides. This phased,
enterprise-wide approach 1s principles-based and will
be centrally coordinated and localized based on the
situation. Our guiding principles are adherence to
government/jurisdictional guidelines, facility
preparedness, business function prioritization, and
staff safety and wellbeing.

We assembled a comprehensive Supporting You Now
COVID-19 framework that communicated the array
of measures to support our employees in the moment.

Results of Operations (continued)

This included expanded employee assistance program
benefits, telehealth coverage, increased back-up
dependent care benefits, virtual babysitting services
and toolkits for managers and employees to conduct
supportive conversations around life balance needs.

Employees and International Operations

Globally, at Dec. 31, 2020, BNY Mellon and its
subsidiaries had approximately 48,500 full-time
employees.

We pride ourselves on providing dedicated service
through our multilingual sales, marketing and client
service teams. At Dec. 31, 2020, approximately 49%
of our total employees (full-time and part-time
employees) were based outside the U.S., with
approximately 9,400 employees in Europe, the
Middle East and Africa (“EMEA), approximately
14,000 employees in the Asia-Pacific region
(“APAC’”) and approximately 700 employees in other
global locations, primarily Brazil.

Key 2020 events
Todd Gibbons named Chief Executive Officer

In March 2020, Todd Gibbons was appointed Chief
Executive Officer (“CEO”) and continued as a
member of the Board of Directors. During Todd’s
career at BNY Mellon, he has held leadership roles
across risk, finance, client management and many of
our businesses.

Emily Portney named Chief Financial Officer

In July 2020, Emily Portney was appointed Chief
Financial Officer and joined the Company’s
Executive Committee. Ms. Portney previously led
the client management, sales and services teams for
the Asset Servicing business globally and oversaw the
Americas region for the Asset Servicing business.

She has also previously held senior financial roles.

CCAR and common stock repurchases

In March 2020, we and the other members of the
Financial Services Forum announced the temporary
suspension of share repurchases until the end of the
second quarter of 2020 to preserve capital and
liquidity in order to further the objective of using
capital and liquidity to support clients and customers.

In June 2020, the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) announced
that it required participating Comprehensive Capital
Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) firms, including us,
to update and resubmit their capital plans and that, as
a result, unless otherwise approved by the Federal
Reserve, participating firms were not permitted to
conduct open market common stock repurchases in
the third quarter of 2020.

In August 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that
BNY Mellon’s stress capital buffer (“SCB”)
requirement would be 2.5%, which equals the
regulatory minimum, effective on Oct. 1, 2020.

In September 2020, the Federal Reserve extended the
limitation on open market common stock repurchases
through the fourth quarter of 2020.

In December 2020, the Federal Reserve released the
results of the second round of CCAR stress tests
during 2020 and extended the restriction on common
stock dividends and open market common share
repurchases applicable to participating CCAR firms,
including us, to the first quarter of 2021, with certain
modifications. Under the modified restrictions, we
are authorized to conduct open market common share
repurchases in an amount up to approximately $625
million under the Federal Reserve’s modified
distribution limitation in the first quarter of 2021.
See “Supervision and Regulation — Capital Planning
and Stress Testing — Payment of Dividends, Stock
Repurchases and Other Capital Distributions” for
additional information related to the 2020 CCAR.

Summary of financial highlights

We reported net income applicable to common
shareholders of BNY Mellon of $3.4 billion, or $3.83
per diluted common share, in 2020, including the
negative impact of $159 million, or $0.18 per diluted
common share, related to litigation expense,
severance, losses on business sales and real estate
charges in the fourth quarter of 2020. In 2019, net
income applicable to common shareholders of BNY
Mellon was $4.3 billion, or $4.51 per diluted
common share, including a net benefit of $467
million, or $0.49 per diluted common share, related to
the gain on the sale of an equity investment and a net
reduction of reserves for a tax-related exposure of
certain investment management funds, partially offset
by severance, a lease-related impairment, net
securities losses and litigation expense.

Highlights of 2020 results

AUC/A totaled $41.1 trillion at Dec. 31, 2020
compared with $37.1 trillion at Dec. 31, 2019.
The 11% increase primarily reflects higher
market values and client inflows, the favorable
impact of a weaker U.S. dollar and net new
business. (See “Investment Services business”
beginning on page 16.)

AUM totaled $2.2 trillion at Dec. 31, 2020
compared with $1.9 trillion at Dec. 31, 2019.

The 16% increase primarily reflects higher
market values, net inflows and the favorable
impact of a weaker U.S. dollar (principally versus
the British pound). (See “Investment and Wealth
Management business” beginning on page 18.)

Investment services fees totaled $8.0 billion in
2020 compared with $7.9 billion in 2019, an
increase of 2%. The increase primarily reflects
higher balances and clearing revenue, growth in
collateral management and lower compensating
balance credits, partially offset by money market
fee waivers. (See “Investment Services business”
beginning on page 16.)

Investment management and performance fees
totaled $3.37 billion in 2020 compared with
$3.39 billion in 2019, a decrease of 1%. The
decrease primarily reflects higher money market
fee waivers and an unfavorable change in the mix
of AUM, partially offset by higher market values
and performance fees. (See “Investment and
Wealth Management business” beginning on
page 18.)

Foreign exchange and other trading revenue
totaled $789 million in 2020, compared with
$654 million in 2019. Foreign exchange revenue
totaled $776 million in 2020, an increase of 34%,
compared with $577 million in 2019, primarily
reflecting higher volatility and volumes. (See
“Fee and other revenue” beginning on page 8.)

Net interest revenue totaled $3.0 billion in 2020,
compared with $3.2 billion in 2019, a decrease of
7%. The decrease was primarily driven by lower
interest rates on interest-earnings assets, partially
offset by the benefit of lower deposit and funding
rates, higher deposit balances and a larger
securities portfolio. Net interest margin was
0.84% in 2020, compared with 1.10% in 2019.
(See “Net interest revenue” beginning on page
11.)

6 BNY Mellon

* The provision for credit losses was $336 million
in 2020 and a credit of $25 million in 2019. The
increase in the provision primarily reflects
additional reserves in the commercial real estate
portfolio and as a result of the challenging
macroeconomic outlook due to the coronavirus
pandemic. (See “Asset quality and allowance for
credit losses” beginning on page 37.)

* Noninterest expense totaled $11.0 billion in 2020
compared with $10.9 billion in 2019. The 1%
increase primarily reflects continued investments
in technology, the 2019 reserve reduction for a
tax-related exposure of certain investment
management funds and higher professional, legal
and other purchased services expense. The
increase was partially offset by lower staff
(severance) and business development (travel and
marketing) expenses. See “Noninterest expense”
beginning on page 14.)

¢ The provision for income taxes was $842 million
(18.8% effective tax rate) in 2020. (See “Income
taxes” on page 14.)

« The net unrealized pre-tax gain on the securities
portfolio, including the impact of related hedges,
was $3.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2020, compared with
$796 million at Dec. 31, 2019. The increase was
primarily driven by lower market interest rates.
(See “Securities” beginning on page 30.)

* Our CET ratio calculated under the Advanced
Approaches was 13.1% at Dec. 31, 2020 and
11.5% at Dec. 31, 2019. The increase primarily
reflects capital generated through earnings,
unrealized gain on assets available-for-sale and
foreign currency translation, partially offset by
capital deployed through dividend payments and
higher risk-weighted assets (“RWAs’”). (See
“Capital” beginning on page 45.)

Impact of coronavirus pandemic on our
business

The coronavirus pandemic has had a significant effect
on the global macroeconomic environment. The
following discusses the areas of our business that
have been impacted and could continue to be
impacted by the current environment.

Since March 2020, the vast majority of our
employees have worked from home. They have been
fully operational with minimal disruption to servicing
our clients. However, our continued reliance on

Results of Operations (continued)

work-from-home arrangements may result in
increased operational risks.

Market volatility associated with the performance of
global equity and fixed income markets and lower
interest rates has had, and may continue to have, a
considerable impact on all of our businesses. Our
lower-risk diversified fee-based business model
benefits from heightened volatility and a flight-to-
quality on a relative basis compared with other credit-
focused financial institutions.

Our Investment Services businesses were favorably
impacted by higher client volumes in 2020 compared
with the prior year. The significant increases in
market volatility also resulted in increased client
activity in foreign exchange, and higher asset
servicing, clearing services in Pershing, as well as
clearance and collateral management fee revenue.
However, the heightened volumes and volatility
experienced in the first quarter of 2020 declined over
the remainder of 2020.

This volatility, coupled with the interest rate
environment, also led to an increase in deposit levels
from the prior year as our clients increased the levels
of cash placed with us. This favorably impacted net
interest revenue. However, the low interest rate
environment has more than offset that benefit and is
expected to continue to reduce our net interest
revenue and margin.

Given the decrease in short-term interest rates, there
was a Significant increase in money market mutual
fund fees that were waived, which reduced fee
revenue for both our Investment Services and
Investment and Wealth Management businesses in
2020 and is expected to continue. See further
discussion of money market fee waivers in “Fee and
other revenue.”

We and the other CCAR firms suspended open
market common stock repurchases for most of 2020
however, we continued our current quarterly common
stock dividend of $0.31 per share. See “Supervision
and Regulation — Capital Planning and Stress Testing
— Payment of Dividends, Stock Repurchases and
Other Capital Distributions” for additional
information related to the 2020 CCAR.

The significant changes in market values during 2020
initially negatively impacted revenue related to seed
capital investments (net of hedges) in our Investment

and Wealth Management business. However,
revenue related to seed capital investments (net of
hedges) improved as the markets rebounded after the
first quarter of 2020.

During the first quarter of 2020, we purchased $2.2
billion of commercial paper and certificates of deposit
(“CDs”) from affiliated money market mutual funds
in order to provide liquidity support to the funds. At
Dec. 31, 2020, commercial paper and CDs totaled
approximately $250 million. We also purchased
$650 million in the first quarter of 2020 and $1.1
billion in the second quarter of 2020 of commercial
paper and CDs from third-party money market mutual
funds and funded this purchase through the Federal
Reserve Bank of Boston’s Money Market Mutual
Fund Liquidity Facility (““MMLF”) program. The
commercial paper and CDs purchased from third
parties matured prior to Dec. 31, 2020. See
“Supervision and Regulation — Pandemic-Related
Measures — Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity
Facility” for additional information on the MMLF.

The deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook as a
result of the pandemic has resulted in and may
continue to result in heightened levels of credit loss
provisioning. Although we did not experience net
charge-offs in 2020, the continuing effects of the
pandemic could result in increased credit losses and
charge-offs.

In addition, a prolonged economic downturn may
result in other asset write-downs and impairments,
including, but not limited to, equity investments,
goodwill and intangibles.

It is difficult to forecast the impact of the coronavirus,
together with related public health measures, on our
results with certainty because so much depends on
how the health crisis evolves, its impact on the global
economy as well as actions taken by central banks
and governments to support the economy and the
availability, use and effectiveness of vaccines.

The current macroeconomic environment has also
resulted in responses by governmental and regulatory
bodies. See “Supervision and Regulation —
Pandemic-Related measures” for additional
information on legislative and regulatory
developments in response to the coronavirus
pandemic.

Fee and other revenue decreased 4% compared with

the sale of an equity investment recorded in 2019 and
higher money market fee waivers, partially offset by
higher clearing services fees, foreign exchange and
other trading revenue, asset servicing fees, investment
management and performance fees, net securities
gains and treasury services fees.

Money market fee waivers

Given the recent levels of short-term interest rates,
money market mutual fund fees and other similar fees
are being waived to protect investors from negative
returns. The fee waivers have primarily impacted fee
revenues in Pershing and Investment Management,
but also resulted in lower distribution and servicing
expense. The fee waivers also began to impact fee
revenues in our other businesses in the second half of
2020. Money market fee waivers are highly sensitive
to changes in short-term interest rates and are difficult
to predict.

Results of Operations (continued)

The following table presents the impact of money
market fee waivers on our consolidated fee revenue,
net of distribution and servicing expense. A majority
of the money market fee waivers were driven by low
short-term interest rates.

(b) The line of business revenue for management reporting

We expect the impact from money market fee
waivers, net of distribution and servicing expense, to
approximate $175 million per quarter of 2021,
assuming short-term rates remain unchanged from
recent levels. This impact may be partially offset
depending on the levels of money market balances.

Investment services fees

Investment services fees increased 2% compared with
2019 reflecting the following:

* Asset servicing fees increased 2%, primarily
reflecting the impact of higher market values,
higher balances and growth in collateral
management and clearance volumes, partially
offset by money market fee waivers.

* Clearing services fees increased 4%, primarily
driven by higher balances, higher clearing
revenue and the positive impact of equity
markets, partially offset by higher money market
fee waivers.

* Issuer services fees decreased 3%, primarily
reflecting lower Depositary Receipts fees and
money market fee waivers in Corporate Trust
partially offset by net new business in Corporate
Trust.

« Treasury services fees increased 8%, primarily
reflecting lower compensating balance credits
provided to clients driven by lower rates and
higher money market balances.

See “Investment Services business” in “Review of
businesses” for additional details.

Investment management and performance fees

Investment management and performance fees
decreased 1% compared with 2019, primarily
reflecting higher money market fee waivers and an
unfavorable change in the mix of AUM, partially
offset by higher market values and performance fees.
Performance fees were $107 million in 2020 and $83
million in 2019. On a constant currency basis (Non-
GAAP), investment management and performance
fees decreased 1% compared with 2019.

AUM was $2.2 trillion at Dec. 31, 2020, an increase
of 16% compared with Dec. 31, 2019, primarily
reflecting higher market values, net inflows and the
favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar (principally
versus the British pound).

in “Review of businesses” for additional details
regarding the drivers of investment management and
performance fees, AUM and AUM flows.

on these transactions, both of which are impacted by

hedging activities. In 2020, foreign exchange
revenue totaled $776 million, an increase of 34%
compared with 2019, primarily reflecting higher
volatility and volumes and the positive impact of
foreign currency hedging. Foreign exchange revenue
18 primarily reported in the Investment Services
business and, to a lesser extent, the Investment and
Wealth Management business and the Other segment.

Other trading revenue totaled $13 million in 2020
compared with $77 million in 2019. The decrease
primarily reflects higher losses on seed capital
hedging, which is partially offset by increased gains
on seed capital reflected in operations of consolidated
investment management funds and investment and
other income. Other trading revenue is reported in all
three business segments.

Financing-related fees

Financing-related fees, which are primarily reported
in the Investment Services business, include capital
market fees, loan commitment fees and credit-related
fees. Financing-related fees totaled $212 million in
2020 compared with $196 million in 2019, primarily
reflecting higher underwriting fees.

Distribution and servicing fees

Distribution and servicing fees earned from mutual
funds are primarily based on average assets in the
funds and the sales of funds that we manage or
administer and are primarily reported in the
Investment Management business. These fees, which
include 12b-1 fees, fluctuate with the overall level of
net sales, the relative mix of sales between share
classes, the funds’ market values and money market
fee waivers.

Distribution and servicing fees were $115 million in
2020 compared with $129 million in 2019. The
decrease primarily reflects higher money market fee
waivers. The impact of distribution and servicing
fees on income in any one period is partially offset by
distribution and servicing expense paid to other
financial intermediaries to cover their costs for

10 BNY Mellon

distribution and servicing of mutual funds.
Distribution and servicing expense is recorded as
noninterest expense on the income statement.

Investment and other income

Investment and other income includes corporate and
bank-owned life insurance contracts, expense
reimbursements from our CIBC Mellon joint venture,
seed capital gains or losses, gains or losses from
asset-related activity and other income (loss).
Expense rermbursements from our CIBC Mellon joint
venture relate to expenses incurred by BNY Mellon
on behalf of the CIBC Mellon joint venture. Asset-
related gains (losses) include dispositions of loans,
businesses and other assets as well as fair value
changes of non-readily marketable equity securities.

Other income (loss) primarily includes foreign
currency remeasurement gain (loss), other
investments, including renewable energy, and various
miscellaneous revenues. Investments in renewable
energy generate losses in other income that are more
than offset by benefits and credits recorded to the
provision for income taxes.

The following table provides the components of
investment and other income.

industry practice. The adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income.

N/M — Not meaningful.
bps — basis points.

Net interest revenue decreased 7% compared with
2019, primarily reflecting lower interest rates on
interest-earning assets and the impact of hedging
activities (primarily offset in foreign exchange and
other trading revenue). The decrease was partially
offset by the benefit of lower deposit and funding
rates, higher deposit balances, a larger securities
portfolio, a $70 million lease-related impairment
recorded in 2019 and lower debt balances.

Net interest margin decreased 26 basis points

compared with 2019. The decrease primarily reflects

the factors mentioned above.

Average interest-earning assets increased 22%

compared with 2019. The increase primarily reflects

higher interest-bearing deposits with the Federal

Reserve and other central banks and a larger
securities portfolio.

Average non-U.S. dollar deposits comprised
approximately 25% of our average total deposits in
2020 and 30% in 2019. Approximately 40% of the
average non-U.S. dollar deposits in 2020 and 45% in
2019 were euro denominated.

Net interest revenue in future periods will depend on
the level and mix of client deposits, deposit rates, as
well as the level and shape of the yield curve, which
may result in lower yields on interest-earning assets.

Due to lower interest rates, net interest revenue has
been trending lower during 2020. That trend is
expected to continue into the first quarter of 2021.

(a) Includes the average impact of offsetting under enforceable netting agreements of approximately $57 billion in 2020 and $56 billion in 2019. On a Non-GAAP
basis, excluding the impact of offsetting, the yield on federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements would have been 0.62% for 2020 and

2.33% for 2019, and the rate on federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements would have been 0.39% for 2020 and 2.11% for 2019.
We believe providing the rates excluding the impact of netting is useful to investors as it is more reflective of the actual rates earned and paid.

Review of businesses

We have an internal information system that produces
performance data along product and service lines for
our two principal businesses, Investment Services and
Investment and Wealth Management, and the Other
segment.

Business accounting principles

Our business data has been determined on an internal
management basis of accounting, rather than the
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)
used for consolidated financial reporting. These
measurement principles are designed so that reported
results of the businesses will track their economic
performance.

For information on the accounting principles of our
businesses, the primary products and services in each
line of business, the primary types of revenue by
business and how our businesses are presented and
analyzed, see Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Business results are subject to reclassification when
organizational changes are made, or for refinements
in revenue and expense allocation methodologies.
Refinements are typically reflected on a prospective
basis. In 2020, we reclassified the results of certain
services provided between the segments from
noninterest expense to fee and other revenue. The
intersegment activity is eliminated in the Other
segment and relates to services that are also provided
to third parties and provides consistency with the
reporting of the revenues. This adjustment had no
impact on income before taxes of the businesses.
Also in 2020, we reclassified the results related to
certain lending activities from the Wealth
Management business to the Pershing business.
These loans were originated by the Wealth
Management business as a service to Pershing clients.
This resulted in an increase in total revenue,
noninterest expense and income before taxes in the
Pershing business and a corresponding decrease in the
Wealth Management business. Prior periods were
restated for both reclassifications.

The results of our businesses may be influenced by
client and other activities that vary by quarter. In the

first quarter, staff expense typically increases
reflecting the vesting of long-term stock awards for
retirement-eligible employees. In the third quarter,
Depositary Receipts revenue is typically higher due to
an increased level of client dividend payments. Also
in the third quarter, volume-related fees may decline
due to reduced client activity, and staff expense
typically increases reflecting the annual employee
merit increase. In the fourth quarter, we typically
incur higher business development and marketing
expenses; however, 2020 was an exception given the
impact of the coronavirus pandemic. In our
Investment and Wealth Management business,
performance fees are typically higher in the fourth
and first quarters, as those quarters represent the end
of the measurement period for many of the
performance fee-eligible relationships.

The results of our businesses may also be impacted
by the translation of financial results denominated in
foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. We are
primarily impacted by activities denominated in the
British pound and the euro. On a consolidated basis
and in our Investment Services business, we typically
have more foreign currency-denominated expenses
than revenues. However, our Investment and Wealth
Management business typically has more foreign
currency-denominated revenues than expenses.
Overall, currency fluctuations impact the year-over-
year growth rate in the Investment and Wealth
Management business more than the Investment
Services business. However, currency fluctuations, in
isolation, are not expected to significantly impact net
income on a consolidated basis.

Fee revenue in Investment and Wealth Management,
and to a lesser extent in Investment Services, is
impacted by the value of market indices. At Dec. 31,
2020, we estimated that a 5% change in global equity
markets, spread evenly throughout the year, would
impact fee revenue by less than 1% and diluted
earnings per common share by $0.03 to $0.06.

See Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for the consolidating schedules which
show the contribution of our businesses to our overall
profitability.

Review of financial results

AUC/A of $41.1 trillion increased 11% compared
with Dec. 31, 2019, primarily reflecting higher
market values and client inflows, the favorable
impact of a weaker U.S. dollar and net new business.
AUC/A consisted of 36% equity securities and 64%
fixed-income securities at Dec. 31, 2020 and 35%
equity securities and 65% fixed-income securities at
Dec. 31, 2019.

Total revenue of $12.2 billion increased 1%
compared with 2019. The drivers of total revenue by
line of business are indicated below.

Asset Servicing revenue of $5.7 billion increased 1%
compared with 2019. The increase primarily reflects
higher foreign exchange volatility and volumes,
higher market values and higher balances, partially
offset by lower net interest revenue.

Pershing revenue of $2.3 billion increased 2%
compared with 2019. The increase primarily reflects
higher balances, higher clearing revenue and the
positive impact of equity markets, partially offset by
higher money market fee waivers.

Issuer Services revenue of $1.7 billion decreased 3%
compared with 2019. The decrease primarily reflects
lower Depositary Receipts revenue and lower net
interest revenue in Corporate Trust.

Treasury Services revenue of $1.3 billion increased

reflects higher deposit and money market balances.

providing additional outsourcing opportunities as
clients and other market participants seek to comply
with regulations and reduce their operating costs.

Noninterest expense of $8.2 billion increased 1%
compared with 2019. The increase primarily reflects
continued investments in technology, higher software
and equipment and litigation expenses, partially offset
by lower severance and business development (travel
and marketing) expenses.

Business description

Our Investment and Wealth Management business
consists of two distinct lines of business, Investment
Management and Wealth Management, which have a
combined AUM of $2.2 trillion as of Dec. 31, 2020

BNY Mellon Investment Management is the seventh-
largest global asset manager and comprises our eight
specialist investment firms and global distribution
network to deliver a highly diversified portfolio of
investment strategies to institutional and retail clients
globally.

Our Investment Management model provides
specialized expertise from eight respected investment

firms offering solutions across every major asset
class, with backing from the proven stewardship and
global presence of BNY Mellon. Each investment
firm has its own individual culture, investment
philosophy and proprietary investment process. This
approach brings our clients clear, independent
thinking from highly experienced investment
professionals.

The investment firms offer a broad range of actively
managed equity, fixed income, alternative and
hability-driven investments, along with passive
products and cash management. Our seven majority-
owned investment firms are as follows: Alcentra,
ARX, Dreyfus Cash Investment Strategies, Insight
Investment, Mellon, Newton Investment Management
and Walter Scott. BNY Mellon owns a non-
controlling minority interest in Siguler Guff.

In February 2021, Investment Management undertook
a strategic initiative to enhance the specialist
investment capabilities of our investment firms to
help meet the changing needs of clients, who are
increasingly seeking outcome-oriented solutions, and
to drive business growth. In partnership with four of
our investment firms, Mellon’s capabilities in fixed
income, equities and multi-asset, and liquidity
management will be realigned with Insight
Investment, Newton Investment Management and
Dreyfus Cash Investment Strategies, respectively. In
addition, BNY Mellon Investment Management
Japan’s Japanese equities team will also combine
capabilities with Newton Investment Management.

Upon conclusion of this realignment, which is
expected to be completed by the third quarter of
2021, Mellon will continue to deliver institutional
equities and fixed income index management; Insight
Investment will strengthen its position as a global
fixed income manager with an expanded U.S.
footprint; Newton Investment Management will be an
equity and multi-asset manager with an enhanced
global research platform; and Dreyfus Cash
Investment Strategies will offer clients a
comprehensive platform of institutional liquidity
solutions across investment vehicles.

In addition to the investment firms, Investment
Management has multiple global distribution entities,
which are responsible for distributing investment
products developed and managed by the investment
firms, as well as responsibility for management and

distribution of our U.S. mutual funds and certain
offshore money market funds.

BNY Mellon Wealth Management provides
investment management, custody, wealth and estate
planning, private banking services, investment

servicing and information management. BNY Mellon

Wealth Management has $286 billion in client assets
as of Dec. 31, 2020, and 35 offices in the U.S. and
internationally.

Wealth Management clients include individuals,
families and institutions. Institutions include family
offices, charitable gift programs and endowments and
foundations. We work with clients to build, manage
and sustain wealth across generations and market
cycles.

The wealth business differentiates itself with a
holistic wealth management framework that seeks to
empower clients to build and sustain long-term
wealth.

The results of the Investment and Wealth
Management business are driven by a blend of daily,
monthly and quarterly averages of AUM by product
type. The overall level of AUM for a given period is
determined by:

« the beginning level of AUM;

* the net flows of new assets during the period
resulting from new business wins and existing
client enrichments, reduced by the loss of clients
and withdrawals; and

* the impact of market price appreciation or
depreciation, foreign exchange rates and
investment firm acquisitions or divestitures.

The mix of AUM is a result of the historical growth
rates of equity and fixed income markets and the
cumulative net flows of our investment firms as a
result of client asset allocation decisions. Actively
managed equity, multi-asset and alternative assets
typically generate higher percentage fees than fixed-
income and liability-driven investments and cash.
Also, actively managed assets typically generate
higher management fees than indexed or passively
managed assets of the same type. Market and
regulatory trends have resulted in increased demand
for lower fee asset management products and for
performance-based fees.

20 BNY Mellon

Investment management fees are dependent on the
overall level and mix of AUM and the management
fees expressed in basis points (one-hundredth of one
percent) charged for managing those assets.
Management fees are typically subject to fee
schedules based on the overall level of assets
managed for a single client or by individual asset
class and style. This is most common for institutional
clients where we typically manage substantial assets
for individual accounts.

Performance fees are generally calculated as a
percentage of a portfolio’s performance in excess of a
benchmark index or a peer group’s performance.

A key driver of organic growth in investment
management and performance fees is the amount of
net new AUM flows. Overall market conditions are
also key drivers, with a significant long-term
economic driver being growth of global financial
assets.

Net interest revenue is determined by loan and
deposit volumes and the interest rate spread between
customer rates and internal funds transfer rates on
loans and deposits. Expenses in the Investment and
Wealth Management business are mainly driven by
staff and distribution and servicing expenses.

Review of financial results

AUM of $2.2 trillion increased 16% compared with
Dec. 31, 2019 primarily reflecting higher market
values, net inflows and the favorable impact of a
weaker U.S. dollar (principally versus the British
pound).

Net long-term strategy inflows were $24 billion in
2020, driven by hability-driven investment funds.
Short-term strategy inflows were $49 billion in 2020.

Total revenue of $3.7 billion decreased slightly
compared with 2019.

Investment Management revenue of $2.6 billion
increased 1% compared with 2019. The increase
primarily reflects higher market values and
performance fees, partially offset by money market
fee waivers and an unfavorable change in the mix of
AUM.

Wealth Management revenue of $1.1 billion
decreased 4% compared with 2019. The decrease

Results of Operations (continued)

reflects lower net interest revenue and a shift to lower
fee investment products, partially offset by higher
market values.

Revenue generated in the Investment and Wealth
Management business included 41% from non-U.S.

Noninterest expense of $2.7 billion increased 2%
compared with 2019. The increase primarily reflects
the 2019 reserve reduction for a tax-related exposure
of certain investment management funds, partially
offset by lower business development (travel and
marketing) expense.

Description of segment

The Other segment primarily includes:

* the leasing portfolio;

* corporate treasury activities, including our
securities portfolio;

« derivatives and other trading activity;

* corporate and bank-owned life insurance;

« renewable energy investments; and

* certain business exits.

Revenue primarily reflects:

* net interest revenue and lease-related gains
(losses) from leasing operations;

* net interest revenue (expense) and derivatives and
other corporate treasury activities;

« fee and other revenue from corporate and bank-
owned life insurance and certain business exits;
and

* gains (losses) associated with investment
securities and other assets, including renewable
energy.

Expenses include:

« direct expenses supporting leasing, investing and
funding activities; and

* expenses not directly attributable to Investment
Services and Investment and Wealth
Management operations.

In 2020, we reclassified the results of certain services
provided between the segments from noninterest
expense to fee and other revenue. The intersegment
activity is eliminated in the Other segment and relates
to services that are also provided to third parties and
provides consistency with the reporting of the
revenues. This adjustment had no impact on income
before taxes of the businesses.

Review of financial results

Loss before taxes was $208 million in 2020 compared
with income before taxes of $528 million in 2019.

Fee revenue decreased $815 million compared with
2019, primarily reflecting the gain on sale of an
equity investment recorded in 2019.

Net securities gains of $33 million in 2020 and net
securities losses of $16 million in 2019 were
primarily related to corporate treasury activity.

Net interest expense decreased $15 million compared
with 2019, primarily reflecting a lease-related
impairment recorded in 2019, partially offset by
corporate treasury activity.

Noninterest expense decreased $24 million compared
with 2019, primarily reflecting lower severance
expense and higher intersegment eliminations,
partially offset by higher pension expense.

International operations

Our primary international activities consist of asset
servicing and global payment services in our
Investment Services business and investment
management in our Investment and Wealth
Management business.

Our clients include central banks and sovereigns,
financial institutions, asset managers, insurance
companies, corporations, local authorities and high-
net-worth individuals and family offices. Through
our global network of offices, we have developed a
deep understanding of local requirements and cultural
needs, and we pride ourselves on providing dedicated
service through our multilingual sales, marketing and
client service teams.

At Dec. 31, 2020, approximately 49% of our total
employees (full-time and part-time employees) were
based outside the U.S., with approximately 9,400
employees in EMEA, approximately 14,000
employees in APAC and approximately 700
employees in other global locations, primarily Brazil.

We are the seventh-largest global asset manager. Our
international operations managed 56% of BNY
Mellon’s AUM at Dec. 31, 2020 and 55% at Dec. 31,
2019.

In Europe, we maintain capabilities to service
Undertakings for Collective Investment in
Transferable Securities and alternative investment
funds. We offer a full range of tailored solutions for
investment companies, financial institutions and
institutional investors across Europe.

We are a provider of non-U.S. government securities,
fixed income and equities clearance, settling
securities transactions directly in European markets,
and using a high-quality and established network of
local agents in non-European markets.

We have extensive experience providing trade and
cash services to financial institutions and central
banks outside of the U.S. In addition, we offer a
broad range of servicing and fiduciary products to
financial institutions, corporations and central banks.
In emerging markets, we lead with custody, global
payments and issuer services, introducing other
products as the markets mature. For more established
markets, our focus is on global investment services.

22 BNY Mellon

We are also a full-service global provider of foreign
exchange services, actively trading in over 100 of the
world’s currencies. We serve clients from trading
desks located in Europe, Asia and North America.

Our financial results, as well as our levels of AUC/A
and AUM, are impacted by translation from foreign
currencies to the U.S. dollar. We are primarily
impacted by activities denominated in the British
pound and the euro. Ifthe U.S. dollar depreciates
against these currencies, the translation impact is a
higher level of fee revenue, net interest revenue,
noninterest expense and AUC/A and AUM.
Conversely, if the U.S. dollar appreciates, the
translated levels of fee revenue, net interest revenue,
noninterest expense and AUC/A and AUM will be
lower.

International clients accounted for 37% of revenues in
2020, compared with 35% in 2019. Net income from
international operations was $2.0 billion in 2020,
compared with $1.9 billion in 2019.

In 2020, revenues from EMEA were $4.0 billion,
compared with $3.8 billion in 2019. The 3% increase
primarily reflects higher revenue in both the
Investment Services and Investment and Wealth
Management businesses. The increase in revenue in
the Investment Services business was primarily
driven by higher client activity in Asset Servicing,
Pershing and Clearance and Collateral Management,
higher foreign exchange revenue and the favorable
impact of a weaker dollar, partially offset by lower
net interest revenue. The increase in revenue in the
Investment and Wealth Management business
primarily reflects higher market values and
performance fees and the favorable impact of a
weaker U.S. dollar (principally versus the British
pound), partially offset by an unfavorable change in
the mix of AUM. Our Investment Services and
Investment and Wealth Management businesses
generated 70% and 30% of EMEA revenues,
respectively. Net income from EMEA was $1.2
billion in 2020, compared with $1.1 billion in 2019.

Cross-border outstandings

Cross-border outstandings are based on the Federal
Financial Institutions Examination Council’s
(“FFIEC”) regulatory guidelines for reporting cross-
border risk and provide information on the
distribution, by country and sector, of claims on
foreign residents held by U.S. banks. Under the
FFIEC guidelines, cross-border outstandings are
reported based on the domicile of the counterparty,
issuer of collateral or guarantor. Cross-border
outstandings in the table below include claims of U.S.
domiciled offices on foreign counterparties as well as
claims of foreign offices on counterparties located
outside those foreign jurisdictions. The guidelines to
determine the cross-border outstandings in the table
below are different from how we determine and
manage our country risk exposure. For example,
unfunded loan commitments as well as central bank

deposits made by our foreign bank subsidiaries in
their local jurisdiction are not considered cross-border
outstandings. As a result, the cross-border
outstandings in the table below are not comparable to
the country risk exposure in the previous section.

Foreign assets are subject to the general risks
attendant on the conduct of business in each foreign
country, including economic uncertainties and each
foreign government’s regulations. In addition, our
foreign assets may be affected by changes in demand
or pricing resulting from fluctuations in currency
exchange rates or other factors.

The table below shows our cross-border outstandings
at Dec. 31 of each of the last three years where cross-
border exposure exceeds 1.00% of total assets
(denoted with “*”) or exceeds 0.75% but is less than
or equal to 1.00% of total assets (denoted with “**”).

accounting estimates are those related to the
allowance for credit losses, fair value of financial
instruments and derivatives, goodwill and other
intangibles and litigation and regulatory
contingencies. Management has discussed the
development and selection of the critical accounting
estimates with the Company’s Audit Committee.

Emerging markets exposure

We determine our emerging markets exposures using
the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. Our emerging
markets exposures totaled $13.1 billion at Dec. 31,
2020 and $12.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2019. The
increase primarily reflects increased exposure to
South Korea, China and India and was largely offset
by decreased exposure to Brazil, Mexico, Tatwan,
Chile and the Philippines.

Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. Certain of these policies include critical
accounting estimates which require management to

commitments, held-to-maturity securities, certain
securities financing transactions and deposits with
banks. The allowance for credit losses is intended to
adjust the carrying value of these assets by an
estimated amount of credit losses that we expect to
incur over the life of the asset. Similarly, the
allowance for credit losses on lending-related
commitments and other off-balance sheet financial
instruments is meant to capture the credit losses that
we expect to recognize in these portfolios as of the
balance sheet date.

A quantitative methodology and qualitative
framework is used to estimate the allowance for
credit losses.

The quantitative component of our estimate uses
models and methodologies that categorize financial
assets based on product type, collateral type, and
other credit trends and risk characteristics, including
relevant information about past events, current
conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts
of future economic conditions that affect the
collectability of the recorded amounts. For the
quantitative component, we segment portfolios into
various major components including commercial
loans and lease financing, commercial real estate,
financial institutions, residential mortgages, and
other. The segmentation of our debt securities
portfolios is by major asset class and is influenced by
whether the security is structured or non-structured
(i.e., direct obligation), as well as the issuer type. The
components of the credit loss calculation for each
major portfolio or asset class include a probability of
default, loss given default and exposure at default, as
applicable, and their values depend on the forecast
behavior of variables in the macroeconomic
environment. We utilize a multi-scenario
macroeconomic forecast which includes a weighting
of three scenarios: a baseline and upside and
downside scenarios and allows us to develop our
estimate using a wide span of economic variables.
Our baseline scenario reflects a view on likely
performance of each global region and the other two
scenarios are designed relative to the baseline
scenario. This approach incorporates a reasonable
and supportable forecast period spanning the life of
the asset, and this period includes both an initial
estimated economic outlook component as well as a
reversion component for each economic input
variable. The length of each of the two components
depends on the underlying financial instrument,
scenario, and underlying economic input variable. In

general, the initial economic outlook period for each
economic input variable under each scenario ranges
between several months and two years. The speed at
which the scenario specific forecasts revert to long-
term historical mean is based on observed historical
patterns of mean reversion at the economic variable
input level that are reflected in our model parameter
estimates. Certain macroeconomic variables such as
unemployment or home prices take longer to revert
after a contraction, though specific recovery times are
scenario-specific. Reversion will usually take longer
the further away the scenario specific forecast is from
the historical mean. On a quarterly basis, and within
a developed governance structure, we update these
scenarios for current economic conditions and may
adjust the scenario weighting based on our economic
outlook. The Company uses its best judgment to
assess these economic conditions and loss data in
estimating the allowance for credit losses and these
estimates are subject to periodic refinement based on
changes to underlying external or Company-specific
historical data.

In the quantitative component of our estimate, we
measure expected credit losses using an individual
evaluation method if the risk characteristics of the
asset 1s no longer consistent with the portfolio or class
of asset. For these assets we do not employ the
macroeconomic model calculation but consider
factors such as payment status, collateral value, the
obligor’s financial condition, guarantor support, the
probability of collecting scheduled principal and
interest payments when due, and recovery
expectations if they can be reasonably estimated. For
loans, we measure the expected credit loss as the
difference between the amortized cost basis in the
loan and the present value of the expected future cash
flows from the borrower which is generally
discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, or the
fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral
dependent. We generally consider nonperforming
loans as well as loans that have been or are
anticipated to be modified under a troubled debt
restructuring for individual evaluation given the risk
characteristics of such loans.

Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair
value. When an available-for-sale debt security is in
an unrealized loss position, we employ a
methodology to identify and estimate the credit loss
portion of the unrealized loss position. The
measurement of expected credit losses is performed at
the security level and is based on our best single

BNY Mellon 25

Results of Operations (continued)

estimate of cash flows, on a discounted basis;
however, we do not specifically employ the
macroeconomic forecasting models and scenarios
summarized above.

The qualitative component of our estimate for the
allowance for credit losses is intended to capture
expected losses that may not have been fully captured
in the quantitative component. Through an
established governance structure, management
determines the qualitative allowance each period
based on an evaluation of various internal and
environmental factors which include: scenario
weighting and sensitivity risk, credit concentration
risk, economic conditions and other considerations.
We have made and may continue to make
adjustments for idiosyncratic risks.

To the extent actual results differ from forecasts or
management’s judgment, the allowance for credit
losses may be greater or less than future charge-offs
and recoveries.

Our allowance for credit losses is sensitive to a
number of inputs, most notably the credit ratings
assigned to each borrower as well as macroeconomic
forecast assumptions that are incorporated in our
estimate of credit losses through the expected life of
the loan portfolio. Thus, as the macroeconomic
environment and related forecasts change, the
allowance for credit losses may change materially.
The following sensitivity analyses do not represent
management’s expectations of the deterioration of our
portfolios or the economic environment, but are
provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the
sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses to
changes in key inputs. If each credit were rated one
grade better, the quantitative allowance would have
decreased by $137 million, and if each credit were
rated one grade worse, the quantitative allowance
would have increased by $184 million. Our multi-
scenario based macroeconomic forecast used in
determining the Dec. 31, 2020 allowance for credit
losses consisted of three scenarios. The baseline
scenario reflects moderate and flat GDP growth and
unemployment recovery but with declining
commercial real estate prices that begin to recover in
early 2022. The upside scenario reflects faster GDP
growth and unemployment recovery and less severe
commercial real estate declines than the baseline.
The downside scenario contemplates negative GDP
growth and increasing unemployment throughout
2021 and steeper declines in commercial real estate

26 BNY Mellon

prices than the baseline. Consistent with the third
quarter of 2020, we placed the most weight on our
baseline scenario, with the remaining weighting
resulting in slightly more weight placed on the
downside scenario than the upside scenario. From a
sensitivity perspective, at Dec. 31, 2020, if we had
applied 100% weighting to the downside scenario, the
quantitative allowance for credit losses would have
been approximately $325 million higher.

Fair value of financial instruments and
derivatives

The guidance included in Accounting Standards
Codification (“ASC”) 820, Fair Value Measurement,
defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value, and requires certain disclosures
about assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
The standard also established a three-level hierarchy
for fair value measurements based upon the
transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or
liability as of the measurement date.

Fair value — Securities
Level I — Securities: Securities where valuations are

based on recent quoted prices for identical securities
in actively traded markets.

Level 2 — Securities: For securities where quotes
from recent transactions are not available for identical
securities, we determine fair value primarily based on
pricing sources with reasonable levels of price
transparency. The pricing sources employ financial
models or obtain comparisons to similar instruments
to arrive at “consensus” prices.

Specifically, the pricing sources obtain recent
transactions for similar types of securities (e.g.,
vintage or position in the securitization structure) and
ascertain variables such as discount rate and speed of
prepayment for the type of transaction and apply such
variables to similar types of bonds. We view these as
observable transactions in the current marketplace
and classify such securities as Level 2.

In addition, we have significant investments in more
actively traded agency residential mortgage-backed
securities (“RMBS”) and other types of securities
such as sovereign debt. The pricing sources derive
the prices for these securities largely from quotes they
obtain from major inter-dealer brokers and electronic
communication networks. The pricing sources

Results of Operations (continued)

receive their daily-observed trade price and other
information feeds from the inter-dealer brokers.

We obtain prices for our Level 1 and Level 2
securities from multiple pricing sources. We have
designed controls to develop an understanding of the
pricing sources’ securities pricing methodologies and
have implemented specific internal controls over the
valuation of securities.

As appropriate, we review the quality control
procedures and pricing methodologies used by the
pricing sources, including the process for obtaining
prices provided by the pricing sources, their valuation
methodology and controls for each class of security.

Prices received from pricing sources are subject to
validation checks that help determine the
completeness and accuracy of the prices. These
validation checks are reviewed by management and,
based on the results, may be subject to additional
review and investigation. We also review securities
with no price changes (stale prices) and securities
with zero values.

We have a surveillance process in place to monitor
the reasonableness of prices provided by the pricing
sources. We utilize a hierarchy that compares
security prices obtained from multiple pricing sources
against established thresholds. Discrepancies that fall
outside of these thresholds are challenged with the
pricing services and adjusted if necessary.

If further research is required, we review and validate
these prices with the pricing sources. We also
validate prices from pricing sources by comparing
prices received to actual observed prices from actions
such as purchases and sales, when possible.

At Dec. 31, 2020, approximately 99% of our
securities were valued by pricing sources with
reasonable levels of price transparency. The
remaining securities were generally valued using
observable inputs.

Level 3 — Securities: Where we use our own cash
flow models, which includes a significant input into
the model that is deemed unobservable, to estimate
the value of securities, we classify them as Level 3.
At both Dec. 31, 2020 and Dec. 31, 2019, we have no
securities included in Level 3 of the fair value
hierarchy.

For details of our securities by level of the valuation
hierarchy, see Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Fair value — Derivative financial instruments
Level I — Derivative financial instruments: Includes

derivative financial instruments that are actively
traded on exchanges, principally listed equity options.

Level 2 — Derivative financial instruments: Includes
OTC derivative financial instruments. Derivatives
classified as Level 2 are valued utilizing discounted
cash flow analysis and financial models for which the
valuation inputs are observable or can be
corroborated, directly or indirectly, for substantially
the full term of the instrument. Valuation inputs
include interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange
rates, equity prices, credit curves, option volatilities
and other factors.

Where appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to
account for various factors such as creditworthiness
of the counterparty, creditworthiness of the Company
and model and liquidity risks.

Level 3 — Derivative financial instruments: Level 3
derivatives include derivatives for which valuations
are based on inputs that are unobservable and
significant to the overall fair value measurement, and
may include certain long-dated or highly structured
contracts. At both Dec. 31, 2020 and Dec. 31, 2019,
we have no derivatives included in Level 3 of the fair
value hierarchy.

For details of our derivative financial instruments by
level of the valuation hierarchy, see Note 20 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Fair value option

ASC 825, Financial Instruments, provides the option
to elect fair value as an alternative measurement basis
for selected financial assets and financial liabilities
which are not subject to fair value under other
accounting standards. The changes in fair value are
recognized in income. See Note 21 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
disclosure regarding the fair value option.

BNY Mellon 27

Results of Operations (continued)

Fair value — Judgments

In times of illiquid markets and financial stress, actual
prices and valuations may significantly diverge from
results predicted by models. In addition, other factors
can affect our estimate of fair value, including market
dislocations and unexpected correlations. The use of
different methodologies or different assumptions to
value certain financial instruments could result in a
different estimate of fair value. See Note 1 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Goodwill and other intangibles

We initially record all assets and liabilities acquired
in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill,
indefinite-lived intangibles and other intangibles, in
accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations.
Goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles and other
intangibles are subsequently accounted for in
accordance with ASC 350, /ntangibles — Goodwill
and Other. The initial measurement of goodwill and
intangibles requires judgment concerning estimates of
the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities.
Goodwill ($17.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2020) and
indefinite-lived intangible assets ($2.6 billion at Dec.
31, 2020) are not amortized but are subject to tests for
impairment annually or more often if events or
circumstances indicate it is more likely than not they
may be impaired. Other intangible assets are
amortized over their estimated useful lives and are
subject to impairment if events or circumstances
indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying
value.

BNY Mellon’s three business segments include six
reporting units for which annual goodwill impairment
testing is performed in accordance with ASC 350,
Intangibles — Goodwill and Other. The Investment
Services segment is comprised of four reporting units
and the Investment and Wealth Management segment
1s comprised of two reporting units.

The goodwill impairment test compares the estimated
fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying
amount, including goodwill. Ifthe estimated fair
value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying
amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered
not impaired. However, if the carrying amount of the
reporting unit were to exceed its estimated fair value,
an impairment loss would be recorded. A substantial
goodwill impairment charge would not have a
significant impact on our financial condition or our

28 BNY Mellon

regulatory capital ratios, but could have an adverse
impact on our results of operations. In addition, due
to regulatory restrictions, the Company’s subsidiary
banks could be restricted from distributing available
cash to the Parent, resulting in the Parent needing to
issue additional long-term debt. Capital distributions
could also be impacted if current limitations, which
are based on the average quarterly net income over
the prior four quarters, continue, or if similar
limitations apply in the future.

In the second quarter of 2020, we performed our
annual goodwill impairment test on all six reporting
units using an income approach to estimate the fair
values of each reporting unit. Estimated cash flows
used in the income approach were based on
management’s projections as of March 31, 2020. The
discount rate applied to these cash flows was 10%
and incorporated a 7% market equity risk premium.
Estimated cash flows extend far into the future, and,
by their nature, are difficult to estimate over such an
extended time frame.

As a result of the annual goodwill impairment test of
the six reporting units, no goodwill impairment was
recognized. The fair values of five of the Company’s
reporting units were substantially in excess of the
respective reporting units’ carrying value. The
Investment Management reporting unit, with $7.2
billion of allocated goodwill, which is one of the two
reporting units in the Investment and Wealth
Management segment, exceeded its carrying value by
approximately 5%. Since the annual impairment test,
we estimate that the Investment Management
reporting unit’s fair value in excess of its carrying
value has increased. For the Investment Management
reporting unit, in the future, small changes in the
assumptions, such as the discount rate, changes in the
level or mix of AUM and operating margin, could
produce a non-cash goodwill impairment. We also
evaluate the aggregate fair values of our reporting
units in comparison to our market capitalization. In
this analysis, we factor in an estimated control
premium that is adjusted for certain estimated risks
and other factors.

Key judgments in accounting for intangibles include
useful life and classification between goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangibles or other intangibles
requiring amortization.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for
impairment at least annually by comparing their fair

Results of Operations (continued)

values, estimated using discounted cash flow
analyses, to their carrying values. Other amortizing
intangible assets ($421 million at Dec. 31, 2020) are
evaluated for impairment if events and circumstances
indicate a possible impairment. Such evaluation of
other intangible assets would be initially based on
undiscounted cash flow projections.

See Notes 1 and 7 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information
regarding goodwill, intangible assets and the annual
and interim impairment testing.

Litigation and regulatory contingencies

Significant estimates and judgments are required in
establishing an accrued liability for litigation and
regulatory contingencies. For additional information
on our policy, see “Legal proceedings” in Note 22 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Consolidated balance sheet review

One of our key risk management objectives is to
maintain a balance sheet that remains strong
throughout market cycles to meet the expectations of
our major stakeholders, including our shareholders,
clients, creditors and regulators.

We also seek to undertake overall liquidity risk,
including intraday liquidity risk, that stays within our
risk appetite. The objective of our balance sheet
management strategy is to maintain a balance sheet
that is characterized by strong liquidity and asset
quality, ready access to external funding sources at
competitive rates and a strong capital structure that
supports our risk-taking activities and is adequate to
absorb potential losses. In managing the balance
sheet, appropriate consideration is given to balancing
the competing needs of maintaining sufficient levels
of liquidity and complying with applicable
regulations and supervisory expectations while
optimizing profitability.

At Dec. 31, 2020, total assets were $470 billion,
compared with $382 billion at Dec. 31, 2019. The
increase in total assets was primarily driven by higher
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve
and other central banks and securities, resulting from
significant deposit inflows. Deposits totaled $342
billion at Dec. 31, 2020, compared with $259 billion

at Dec. 31, 2019. The increase reflects the current
macroeconomic environment. Total interest-bearing
deposits as a percentage of total interest-earning
assets were 63% at Dec. 31, 2020 and 62% at Dec.
31, 2019.

At Dec. 31, 2020, available funds totaled $196 billion
which include cash and due from banks, interest-
bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other
central banks, interest-bearing deposits with banks
and federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements. This compares with available
funds of $145 billion at Dec. 31, 2019. Total
available funds as a percentage of total assets were
42% at Dec. 31, 2020 and 38% at Dec. 31, 2019. For
additional information on our available funds, see
“Liquidity and dividends.”

Securities were $156 billion, or 33% of total assets, at
Dec. 31, 2020, compared with $123 billion, or 32%
of total assets, at Dec. 31, 2019. The increase
primarily reflects investments in U.S. Treasury,
agency RMBS, U.S.government agency and
supranational securities, as well as nearly all other
security types and an increase in unrealized pre-tax
gain. For additional information on our securities
portfolio, see “Securities” and Note 4 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Loans were $56.5 billion, or 12% of total assets, at
Dec. 31, 2020, compared with $55.0 billion, or 14%
of total assets, at Dec. 31, 2019. The increase was
primarily driven by higher margin and other loans,
partially offset by lower loans to financial
institutions. For additional information on our loan
portfolio, see “Loans” and Note 5 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Long-term debt totaled $26.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2020
and $27.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2019. Redemptions and
maturities were partially offset by issuances and an
increase in the fair value of hedged long-term debt.
For additional information on long-term debt, see
“Liquidity and dividends” and Note 13 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total
shareholders’ equity increased to $45.8 billion at Dec.
31, 2020 from $41.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2019. For
additional information, see “Capital” and Note 15 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The financial institutions portfolio exposure was
$44.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2020, a decrease of 6%
compared with Dec. 31, 2019, primarily reflecting
lower exposure in the securities industry and banks
portfolios.

Financial institution exposures are high-quality, with
95% of the exposures meeting the investment grade
equivalent criteria of our internal credit rating
classification at Dec. 31, 2020. Each customer is
assigned an internal credit rating, which is mapped to
an equivalent external rating agency grade based
upon a number of dimensions, which are continually
evaluated and may change over time. For ratings of
non-U.S. counterparties, our internal credit rating is
generally capped at a rating equivalent to the
sovereign rating of the country where the
counterparty resides, regardless of the internal credit
rating assigned to the counterparty or the underlying
collateral.

In addition, 74% of the financial institutions exposure
is secured. For example, securities industry clients
and asset managers often borrow against marketable
securities held in custody.

The exposure to financial institutions is generally
short-term, with 89% of the exposures expiring

within one year. At both Dec. 31, 2020 and Dec. 31,
2019, 18% of the exposure to financial institutions
had an expiration within 90 days.

At Dec. 31, 2020, the secured intraday credit
provided to dealers in connection with their tri-party
repo activity totaled $18.2 billion and was included in
the securities industry portfolio. Dealers secure the
outstanding intraday credit with high-quality liquid
collateral having a market value in excess of the
amount of the outstanding credit.

Our banks exposure primarily relates to our global
trade finance. These exposures are short-term in
nature, with 95% due in less than one year. The
investment grade percentage of our banks exposure
was 85% at Dec. 31, 2020, compared with 77% at
Dec. 31, 2019. Our non-investment grade exposures
are primarily trade finance loans in Brazil.

The asset managers portfolio exposure is high-
quality, with 98% of the exposures meeting our
investment grade equivalent ratings criteria as of Dec.
31, 2020. These exposures are generally short-term
liquidity facilities, with the majority to regulated
mutual funds.

Our wealth management exposure was $17.5 billion
at Dec. 31, 2020, compared with $17.0 billion at Dec.
31, 2019. Wealth management loans and mortgages
primarily consist of loans to high-net-worth
individuals, which are secured by marketable
securities and/or residential property. Wealth
management mortgages are primarily interest-only,
adjustable-rate mortgages with a weighted-average
loan-to-value ratio of 62% at origination. Less than

Our commercial real estate exposure totaled $9.3
billion at Dec. 31, 2020 and $9.2 billion at Dec. 31,
2019. Our income-producing commercial real estate
facilities are focused on experienced owners and are
structured with moderate leverage based on existing
cash flows. Our commercial real estate lending
activities also include construction and renovation
facilities. Our client base consists of experienced
developers and long-term holders of real estate assets.
Loans are approved on the basis of existing or
projected cash flows and supported by appraisals and
knowledge of local market conditions. Development
loans are structured with moderate leverage, and in
many instances, involve some level of recourse to the
developer.

At Dec. 31, 2020, the unsecured portfolio consisted
of real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) and real
estate operating companies, which are both primarily
investment grade.

At Dec. 31, 2020, our commercial real estate portfolio
consisted of the following concentrations: New York
metro — 39%; REITs and real estate operating
companies — 36%; and other — 25%.

Lease financings

The lease financings portfolio exposure totaled $1.0
billion at Dec. 31, 2020 and $1.1 billion at Dec. 31,
2019. At Dec. 31, 2020, approximately 98% of
leasing exposure was investment grade, or investment
grade equivalent and consisted of exposures backed
by well-diversified assets, primarily large-ticket
transportation equipment and real estate. The largest
component of our lease residual value exposure is
freight-related rail cars. Assets are both domestic and
foreign-based, with primary concentrations in the
U.S. and Germany.

Approximately 62% of the portfolio is additionally
secured by highly rated securities and/or secured by

letters of credit from investment grade issuers.
Counterparty rating equivalents at Dec. 31, 2020,
were as follows:

« 52% were A or better, or equivalent;
« 46% were BBB; and
« 2% were non-investment grade.

Other residential mortgages

The other residential mortgages portfolio primarily
consists of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and
totaled $389 million at Dec. 31, 2020 and $494
million at Dec. 31, 2019. Included in this portfolio at
Dec. 31, 2020 were $68 million of mortgage loans
purchased in 2005, 2006 and the first quarter of 2007,
of which 19% of the serviced loan balance was at
least 60 days delinquent.

Overdrafis

Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities
clearance clients and are generally repaid within two
business days.

Other loans

Other loans primarily include loans to consumers that
are fully collateralized with equities, mutual funds
and fixed-income securities.

Margin loans

Margin loan exposure of $15.5 billion at Dec. 31,
2020 and $13.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2019 was
collateralized with marketable securities. Borrowers
are required to maintain a daily collateral margin in
excess of 100% of the value of the loan. Margin
loans included $4.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2020 and $3.6
billion at Dec. 31, 2019 related to a term loan
program that offers fully collateralized loans to
broker-dealers.

Allowance for credit losses

Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade clients who are active users of our non-credit services. Our

lend, standby letters of credit (““SBLC”) and overdrafts associated with our custody and securities clearance

businesses.

Results of Operations (continued)

The provision for credit losses was $336 million in
2020 and a credit of $25 million in 2019. The
increase in the provision primarily reflects additional
reserves in the commercial real estate portfolio and as
aresult of the challenging macroeconomic outlook
due to the coronavirus pandemic.

We had $15.4 billion of secured margin loans on our
balance sheet at Dec. 31, 2020 compared with $13.4
billion at Dec. 31, 2019. We have rarely suffered a
loss on these types of loans. As a result, we believe
that the ratio of allowance for loan losses and
lending-related commitments as a percentage of non-
margin loans is a more appropriate metric to measure
the adequacy of the reserve.

The allowance for loan losses and allowance for
lending-related commitments represent
management’s estimate of lifetime expected losses in
our credit portfolio. This evaluation process is
subject to numerous estimates and judgments. To the
extent actual results differ from forecasts or
management’s judgment, the allowance for credit
losses may be greater or less than future charge-offs.

Based on an evaluation of the allowance for credit
losses as discussed in “Critical accounting estimates”
and Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, we have allocated our allowance for
loans and lending-related commitments as presented
below.

The allocation of the allowance for credit losses is inherently judgmental, and the entire allowance for credit losses
is available to absorb credit losses regardless of the nature of the losses.

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, there have been
two forms of relief provided for classifying loans as
troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”): The
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act
(the “CARES Act”), the relevant provisions of which
were extended by the Consolidated Appropriations
Act, 2021, and the Interagency Guidance. See Note 1
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional details on this guidance. Financial
institutions may account for eligible loan
modifications either under the CARES Act or the
Interagency Guidance and we have elected to apply
both, as applicable, in providing borrowers with loan
modification relief in response to the coronavirus
pandemic. We modified loans of $404 million in

2020. Nearly all of the modifications were short-term
loan payment forbearances or modified principal and/
or interest payments. These loans were primarily
residential mortgage and commercial real estate
loans. We also modified loans of $56 million in
2020, a majority of which were commercial real
estate loans, by providing long-term loan payment
modifications and an extension of maturity. We did
not identify any of the modifications as TDRs. None
of these loans were reported as past due or
nonperforming at Dec. 31, 2020. At Dec. 31, 2020,
the unpaid principal balance of the loans modified
under the CARES Act or Interagency Guidance was
$92 million. We modified residential mortgage loans
of $6 million in 2019.

Deposits

We receive client deposits through a variety of
Investment Services and Investment and Wealth
Management businesses and we rely on those
deposits as a low-cost and stable source of funding.

Increased volatility coupled with the interest rate
environment has led to an increase in deposit levels as
our clients increased the levels of cash placed with us.
Total deposits were $341.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2020,
an increase of 32%, compared with $259.5 billion at
Dec. 31, 2019.

Noninterest-bearing deposits were $83.8 billion at
Dec. 31, 2020, compared with $57.6 billion at Dec.
31, 2019. Interest-bearing deposits were $257.7
billion at Dec. 31, 2020, compared with $201.9
billion at Dec. 31, 2019. See “Impact of coronavirus
pandemic on our business” for additional information.

The aggregate amount of deposits by foreign
customers in domestic offices was $64.0 billion and
$47.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2020 and Dec. 31, 2019,

respectively.

Deposits in foreign offices totaled $130.4 billion at
Dec. 31, 2020 and $105.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2019.
The majority of these deposits were in amounts in
excess of $100,000 and were primarily overnight
foreign deposits.

client demand deposits.

Short-term borrowings

We fund ourselves primarily through deposits and, to
a lesser extent, other short-term borrowings and long-
term debt. Short-term borrowings consist of federal
funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, payables to customers and broker-
dealers, commercial paper and other borrowed funds.
Certain short-term borrowings, for example,
securities sold under repurchase agreements, require
the delivery of securities as collateral.

Information related to federal funds purchased and
securities sold under repurchase agreements is
presented below.

excluding the impact of offsetting, the weighted-average
rates would have been 0.39% for 2020, 2.11% for 2019 and
1.86% for 2018. We believe providing the rates excluding
the impact of netting is useful to investors as it is more
reflective of the actual rates paid.

2018.

40 BNY Mellon

Fluctuations of federal funds purchased and securities
sold under repurchase agreements reflect changes in
overnight borrowing opportunities. The decreases in
the weighted-average rates compared with 2019
primarily reflect lower interest rates and the impact of
repurchase agreement activity with the Fixed Income
Clearing Corporation (“FICC”), where we record
interest expense gross, but the ending and average
balances reflect the impact of offsetting under
enforceable netting agreements. This activity
primarily relates to government securities
collateralized resale and repurchase agreements
executed with clients that are novated to and settle
with the FICC.

Information related to payables to customers and
broker-dealers is presented below.

in 2020, $15,595 million in 2019 and $16,353 million in
2018.

Payables to customers and broker-dealers represent
funds awaiting reinvestment and short sale proceeds
payable on demand. Payables to customers and
broker-dealers are driven by customer trading activity
and market volatility.

The Bank of New York Mellon may issue
commercial paper that matures within 397 days from
the date of issue and is not redeemable prior to

decreases in the commercial paper balances compared
with 2019 primarily reflect higher deposit levels.

Information related to other borrowed funds is
presented below.

Other borrowed funds primarily include borrowings
from the Federal Home Loan Bank, the Federal
Reserve Bank of Boston under the MMLF program,
overdrafts of sub-custodian account balances in our
Investment Services businesses, finance lease
liabilities and borrowings under lines of credit by our
Pershing subsidiaries. Overdrafts typically relate to
timing differences for settlements. The decrease in
other borrowed funds compared with 2019 primarily
reflects a decrease in borrowings from the Federal
Home Loan Bank.

Liquidity and dividends

BNY Mellon defines liquidity as the ability of the
Parent and its subsidiaries to access funding or
convert assets to cash quickly and efficiently, or to
roll over or issue new debt, especially during periods
of market stress, at a reasonable cost, and in order to
meet its short-term (up to one year) obligations.
Funding liquidity risk is the risk that BNY Mellon
cannot meet its cash and collateral obligations at a
reasonable cost for both expected and unexpected
cash flow and collateral needs without adversely
affecting daily operations or our financial condition.
Funding liquidity risk can arise from funding

mismatches, market constraints from the inability to
convert assets into cash, the inability to hold or raise
cash, low overnight deposits, deposit run-off or
contingent liquidity events.

Changes in economic conditions or exposure to
credit, market, operational, legal and reputational
risks also can affect BNY Mellon’s liquidity risk
profile and are considered in our liquidity risk
framework. See “Impact of coronavirus pandemic on
our business” for additional information.

The Parent’s policy is to have access to sufficient
unencumbered cash and cash equivalents at each
quarter-end to cover maturities and other forecasted
debt redemptions, net interest payments and net tax
payments for the following 18-month period, and to
provide sufficient collateral to satisfy transactions
subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.
As of Dec. 31, 2020, the Parent was in compliance
with this policy.

We monitor and control liquidity exposures and
funding needs within and across significant legal
entities, branches, currencies and business lines,
taking into account, among other factors, any
applicable restrictions on the transfer of liquidity
among entities.

BNY Mellon also manages potential intraday
liquidity risks. We monitor and manage intraday
liquidity against existing and expected intraday liquid
resources (such as cash balances, remaining intraday
credit capacity, intraday contingency funding and
available collateral) to enable BNY Mellon to meet
its intraday obligations under normal and reasonably
severe stressed conditions.

We define available funds for internal liquidity
management purposes as cash and due from banks,
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve
and other central banks, interest-bearing deposits with
banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased
under resale agreements. The following table
presents our total available funds at period end and on
an average basis.

Total available funds were $196.2 billion at Dec. 31,
2020, compared with $144.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2019.
The increase was primarily due to higher interest-
bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other
central banks.

Average non-core sources of funds, such as federal
funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, trading liabilities, commercial paper and
other borrowed funds, were $19.2 billion for 2020
and $18.3 billion for 2019. The increase primarily
reflects an increase in federal funds purchased and
securities sold under repurchase agreements, partially
offset by a decrease in commercial paper.

Average foreign deposits, primarily from our
European-based Investment Services businesses, were
$106.8 billion for 2020, compared with $93.2 billion
for 2019. Average interest-bearing domestic deposits
were $106.0 billion for 2020 and $78.7 billion for
2019. The increase primarily reflects increased client
activity.

Average payables to customers and broker-dealers
were $17.8 billion for 2020 and $15.6 billion for

42 BNY Mellon

2019. Payables to customers and broker-dealers are
driven by customer trading activity and market
volatility.

Average long-term debt was $26.9 billion for 2020
and $28.1 billion for 2019.

Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased to
$69.1 billion for 2020 from $51.5 billion for 2019,
primarily reflecting increased client activity.

A significant reduction in our Investment Services
business would reduce our access to deposits. See
“Asset/liability management” for additional factors
that could impact our deposit balances.

Sources of liquidity

The Parent’s major sources of liquidity are access to
the debt and equity markets, dividends from its
subsidiaries, and cash on hand and cash otherwise
made available in business-as-usual circumstances to
the Parent through a committed credit facility with
our intermediate holding company (“IHC”).

Subsequent to Dec. 31, 2020, our U.S. bank
subsidiaries could declare dividends to the Parent of
approximately $803 million, without the need for a
regulatory waiver. In addition, at Dec. 31, 2020, non-
bank subsidiaries of the Parent had liquid assets of
approximately $1.6 billion. Restrictions on our
ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries are
discussed in more detail in “Supervision and
Regulation — Capital Planning and Stress Testing —
Payment of Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Other
Capital Distributions” and in Note 19 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Pershing LLC has uncommitted lines of credit in
place for liquidity purposes which are guaranteed by
the Parent. Pershing LLC has two separate
uncommitted lines of credit amounting to $350
million in aggregate. Average borrowings under
these lines were $1 million, in aggregate, in 2020.
Pershing Limited, an indirect UK-based subsidiary of
BNY Mellon, has two separate uncommitted lines of
credit amounting to $250 million in aggregate.
Average borrowings under these lines were $38
million, in aggregate, in 2020.

The double leverage ratio is the ratio of our equity
investment in subsidiaries divided by our
consolidated Parent company equity, which includes
our noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. In
short, the double leverage ratio measures the extent to
which equity in subsidiaries is financed by Parent
company debt. As the double leverage ratio
increases, this can reflect greater demands on a
company’s cash flows in order to service interest
payments and debt maturities. BNY Mellon’s double
leverage ratio is managed in a range considering the
high level of unencumbered available liquid assets
held in its principal subsidiaries (such as central bank
deposit placements and government securities), the
Company’s cash generating fee-based business
model, with fee revenue representing 80% of total
revenue in 2020, and the dividend capacity of our
banking subsidiaries. Our double leverage ratio was
114.3% at Dec. 31, 2020 and 116.9% at Dec. 31,
2019, and within the range targeted by management.

Uses of funds
The Parent’s major uses of funds are repurchases of
common stock, payment of dividends, principal and

interest payments on its borrowings, acquisitions and
additional investments in its subsidiaries.

44 BNY Mellon

In 2020, we paid $1.3 billion in dividends on our
common and preferred stock. Our common stock
dividend payout ratio was 32% for 2020.

In 2020, we repurchased 21.8 million common shares
at an average price of $45.42 per common share for a
total cost of $989 million, nearly all of which were
repurchased prior to the temporary suspension of
share repurchases in March 2020.

See “Capital” for additional information on the
limitations on common share repurchases and
common stock dividends in 2020 and the modified
restrictions applicable to the first quarter of 2021.

Planning and Stress Testing — Payment of Dividends,
Stock Repurchases and Other Capital Distributions”
for additional information related to the 2020 CCAR.

Liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”)

U.S. regulators have established an LCR that requires
certain banking organizations, including BNY
Mellon, to maintain a minimum amount of
unencumbered high-quality liquid assets (“HQLA”)
sufficient to withstand the net cash outflow under a
hypothetical standardized acute liquidity stress
scenario for a 30-day time horizon.

The following table presents BNY Mellon’s
consolidated HQLA at Dec. 31, 2020, and the average
HQLA and average LCR for the fourth quarter of
2020.

Consolidated HQLA and LCR Dec. 31,

haircuts and the impact of trapped liquidity, consolidated
HOLA totaled $199 billion at Dec. 31, 2020 and averaged
$173 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020.

BNY Mellon and each of our affected domestic bank
subsidiaries were compliant with the U.S. LCR
requirements of at least 100% throughout 2020.

Statement of cash flows

The following summarizes the activity reflected on
the consolidated statement of cash flows. While this
information may be helpful to highlight certain macro
trends and business strategies, the cash flow analysis
may not be as relevant when analyzing changes in our
net earnings and net assets. We believe that in
addition to the traditional cash flow analysis, the
discussion related to liquidity and dividends and
asset/liability management herein may provide more
useful context in evaluating our liquidity position and
related activity.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.0
billion in 2020, compared with $96 million in 2019.
In 2020, cash flows provided by operations primarily
resulted from earnings. In 2019, cash flows provided
by operations primarily resulted from earnings,
partially offset by changes in trading assets and
liabilities.

Net cash used for investing activities was $78.5
billion in 2020, compared with $10.5 billion in 2019.
In 2020, net cash used for investing activities
primarily reflects changes in interest-bearing deposits
with the Federal Reserve and other central banks and
net increases in the available-for-sale and held-to-
maturity securities portfolios. In 2019, net cash used
for investing activities primarily reflects changes in
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve
and other central banks, partially offset by changes in
federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $75.5
billion in 2020, compared with $9.5 billion in 2019.
In 2020, net cash provided by financing activity
reflects changes in deposits. In 2019, net cash
provided by financing activities primarily reflects
changes in deposits, partially offset by repayments of
long-term debt, common stock repurchases and
changes in federal funds purchased and securities sold
under repurchase agreements.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total
shareholders’ equity increased to $45.8 billion at Dec.
31, 2020 from $41.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2019. The
increase primarily reflects earnings, the issuance of
preferred stock, the unrealized gain on assets
available-for-sale and foreign currency translation,
partially offset by dividend payments, common stock
repurchases and the redemption of preferred stock.

In 2020, the Parent issued 1,000,000 depositary
shares, each representing a 1/100th interest in a share
of the Parent’s Series G Noncumulative Perpetual
Preferred Stock and 582,500 depositary shares, each
representing a 1/100th interest in a share of the
Parent’s Series H Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred
Stock. The Parent used the net proceeds of
approximately $575 million from the sale of the

BNY Mellon 45

depositary shares representing the Series H
Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock to redeem
all outstanding shares of its Series C Noncumulative
Perpetual Preferred Stock. See Note 15 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information on the Parent’s preferred stock.

The unrealized gain (after-tax) on our available-for-
sale securities portfolio, net of hedges, included in
accumulated other comprehensive income was $1.5
billion at Dec. 31, 2020, compared with $361 million
at Dec. 31, 2019. The increase in the unrealized gain,
net of tax, was primarily driven by lower market
interest rates.

We repurchased 21.8 million common shares at an
average price of $45.42 per common share for a total
of $989 million in 2020, nearly all of which were
repurchased prior to the temporary suspension of
share repurchases in March 2020.

In June 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that it
would require participating CCAR firms, including
us, to update and resubmit their capital plans and that,
as a result, unless otherwise approved by the Federal
Reserve, participating CCAR firms were not
permitted, during the third quarter of 2020, to conduct
open market common stock repurchases, to increase
their common stock dividends or to pay common
stock dividends that exceed average net income for
the preceding four quarters. On Sept. 30, 2020, the
Federal Reserve extended these limitations through
the fourth quarter of 2020.

In December 2020, the Federal Reserve released the
results of the second round of CCAR stress tests
during 2020 and extended the restriction on common
stock dividends and open market common share
repurchases applicable to participating CCAR firms,
including us, to the first quarter of 2021, with certain
modifications. Under the modified restrictions, we

46 BNY Mellon

are authorized to conduct open market common share
repurchases in an amount up to approximately $625
million in the first quarter of 2021. See “Supervision
and Regulation — Capital Planning and Stress Testing
— Payment of Dividends, Stock Repurchases and
Other Capital Distributions” for additional
information related to the 2020 CCAR.

Capital adequacy

Regulators establish certain levels of capital for bank
holding companies (““BHCs”) and banks, including
BNY Mellon and our bank subsidiaries, in
accordance with established quantitative
measurements. For the Parent to maintain its status
as a financial holding company (“FHC”), our U.S.
bank subsidiaries and BNY Mellon must, among
other things, qualify as “well capitalized.” As of Dec.
31, 2020 and Dec. 31, 2019, BNY Mellon and our
U.S. bank subsidiaries were “well capitalized.”

Failure to satisfy regulatory standards, including
“well capitalized” status or capital adequacy rules
more generally, could result in limitations on our

(a) Minimum requirements for Dec. 31, 2020 include minimum thresholds plus currently applicable buffers. The U.S. global systemically
important banks (“G-SIB”) surcharge of 1.5% is subject to change. The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set to 0%. Effective
Oct. 1, 2020, the SCB requirement is 2.5%, equal to the regulatory minimum, and replaces the current 2.5% capital conservation buffer
for Standardized Approach capital ratios.

(b) For our CET, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, our effective capital ratios under U.S. capital rules are the lower of the ratios as
calculated under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is based on Tier 1 capital and quarterly

average total assets.

(c) The Federal Reserve's regulations do not establish well capitalized thresholds for these measures for BHCs.

(d) The SLR is based on Tier I capital and total leverage exposure, which includes certain off-balance sheet exposures. The SLR at Dec. 31,
2020 reflects the exclusion of certain central bank placements from total leverage exposure.

(e) The consolidated SLR at Dec. 31, 2020 reflects the temporary exclusion of U.S. Treasury securities from total leverage exposure which

increased our consolidated SLR by 72 basis points.

Our CET1 ratio determined under the Advanced
Approaches was 13.1% at Dec. 31, 2020 and 11.5%
at Dec. 31, 2019. The increase primarily reflects
capital generated through earnings, unrealized gains
on assets available-for-sale and foreign currency
translation, partially offset by capital deployed
through dividend payments and common stock
repurchased, prior to the temporary suspension of
share repurchases that began in March 2020, and
higher RWAs.

Our operational loss risk model is informed by
external losses, including fines and penalties levied
against institutions in the financial services industry,
particularly those that relate to businesses in which

we operate, and as a result external losses have
impacted and could in the future impact the amount
of capital that we are required to hold.

Our capital ratios are necessarily subject to, among
other things, anticipated compliance with all
necessary enhancements to model calibration,
approval by regulators of certain models used as part
of RWA calculations, other refinements, further
implementation guidance from regulators, market
practices and standards and any changes BNY Mellon
may make to its businesses. As a consequence of
these factors, our capital ratios may materially
change, and may be volatile over time and from
period to period.

Capital ratios vary depending on the size of the
balance sheet at period-end and the levels and types
of investments in assets. The balance sheet size
fluctuates from period to period based on levels of
customer and market activity. In general, when
servicing clients are more actively trading securities,
deposit balances and the balance sheet as a whole are
higher. In addition, when markets experience
significant volatility or stress, our balance sheet size
may increase considerably as client deposit levels
increase.

Effective April 1, 2020, custody banks, including
BNY Mellon and The Bank of New York Mellon, are
permitted to exclude certain central bank placements
from total leverage exposure used in the SLR
calculation. Also, effective April 1, 2020 and lasting
through March 31, 2021, BHCs are permitted to
temporarily exclude U.S. Treasury securities from
total leverage exposure used in the SLR calculation.
This temporary exclusion increased our consolidated
SLR by 72 basis points at Dec. 31, 2020. See
“Supervision and Regulation” for additional
information.

Stress capital buffer

In August 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that
BNY Mellon’s SCB requirement would be 2.5%,
equal to the regulatory floor, effective as of Oct. 1,
2020. The SCB replaces the current 2.5% capital
conservation buffer for Standardized Approach
capital ratios for CCAR firms. The SCB does not
apply to bank subsidiaries, which remain subject to
the static 2.5% capital conservation buffer.

The SCB final rule generally eliminates the
requirement for prior approval of common stock
repurchases in excess of the distributions in a firm’s
capital plan, provided that such distributions are
consistent with applicable capital requirements and
buffers, including the SCB. In conjunction with the
release of the 2020 CCAR results, the Federal
Reserve imposed restrictions on capital distributions
as described earlier in “Capital” and “Supervision and
Regulation.”

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (“TLAC”)

The final TLAC rule establishing external TLAC,
external long-term debt (“LTD”) and related
requirements for U.S. G-SIBs, including BNY
Mellon, at the top-tier holding company level

became effective on Jan. 1, 2019. The following

satisfies certain other conditions. Eligible LTD
consists of the unpaid principal balance of eligible
unsecured debt securities, subject to haircuts for
amounts due to be paid within two years, that satisfy
certain other conditions. Debt issued prior to Dec.
31, 2016 has been permanently grandfathered to the
extent these instruments otherwise would be
ineligible only due to containing impermissible
acceleration rights or being governed by foreign law.

distribution constraints during the third and fourth quarters of 2020 and first quarter of 2021. In December 2020, in connection with the
Federal Reserve’s release of the second round of CCAR stress tests during 2020, we announced a share repurchase plan approved by
our Board of Directors. This program provides for the repurchase of up to $4.451 billion from the third quarter of 2020 through the
third quarter of 2021. Any repurchases during that period will be made in a manner consistent with any applicable distribution
limitations imposed by the Federal Reserve. This new share repurchase plan replaces all previously authorized share repurchase plans.

Share repurchases may be executed through open
market repurchases, in privately negotiated
transactions or by other means, including through
repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule
10b5-1 and other derivative, accelerated share
repurchase and other structured transactions. The
timing and exact amount of any common stock
repurchases will depend on various factors, including
market conditions and the common stock trading
price; the Company’s capital position, liquidity and
financial performance; alternative uses of capital; and
legal and regulatory limitations and considerations.

Trading activities and risk management

Our trading activities are focused on acting as a
market-maker for our customers, facilitating customer
trades and risk-mitigating hedging in compliance with
the Volcker Rule. The risk from market-making
activities for customers is managed by our traders and
limited in total exposure through a system of position
limits, value-at-risk (“VaR”) methodology and other
market sensitivity measures. VaR is the potential loss
in value due to adverse market movements over a
defined time horizon with a specified confidence

50 BNY Mellon

level. The calculation of our VaR used by
management and presented below assumes a one-day
holding period, utilizes a 99% confidence level and
incorporates non-linear product characteristics. VaR
facilitates comparisons across portfolios of different
risk characteristics. VaR also captures the
diversification of aggregated risk at the firm-wide
level.

VaR represents a key risk management measure and
it is important to note the inherent limitations to VaR,
which include:

* VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer
time horizons where moves may be extreme;

* VaR does not take account of potential variability
of market liquidity; and

* Previous moves in market risk factors may not
produce accurate predictions of all future market
moves.

See Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information on the VaR
methodology.

N/M — Because the minimum and maximum may occur on different
days for different risk components, it is not meaningful to
compute a minimum and maximum portfolio diversification

effect.

The interest rate component of VaR represents
instruments whose values are predominantly driven
by interest rate levels. These instruments include, but
are not limited to, U.S. Treasury securities, swaps,
swaptions, forward rate agreements, exchange-traded
futures and options, and other interest rate derivative
products.

The foreign exchange component of VaR represents
instruments whose values predominantly vary with

the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or
interest rates. These instruments include, but are not
limited to, currency balances, spot and forward
transactions, currency options and other currency
derivative products.

The equity component of VaR consists of instruments
that represent an ownership interest in the form of
domestic and foreign common stock or other equity-
linked instruments. These instruments include, but
are not limited to, common stock, exchange-traded
funds, preferred stock, listed equity options (puts and
calls), OTC equity options, equity total return swaps,
equity index futures and other equity derivative
products.

The credit component of VaR represents instruments
whose values are predominantly driven by credit
spread levels, 1.e., idiosyncratic default risk. These
instruments include, but are not limited to, securities
with exposures from corporate and municipal credit
spreads.

The diversification component of VaR is the risk
reduction benefit that occurs when combining
portfolios and offsetting positions, and from the
correlated behavior of risk factor movements.

During 2020, interest rate risk generated 33% of
average gross VaR, foreign exchange risk generated
32% of average gross VaR, equity risk generated 6%
of average gross VaR and credit risk generated 29%
of average gross VaR. During 2020, our daily trading
loss did not exceed our calculated VaR amount of the
overall portfolio.

Trading assets include debt and equity instruments
and derivative assets, primarily interest rate and
foreign exchange contracts, not designated as hedging
instruments. Trading assets were $15.3 billion at
Dec. 31, 2020 and $13.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2019.

Trading liabilities include debt and equity instruments
and derivative liabilities, primarily interest rate and
foreign exchange contracts, not designated as hedging
instruments. Trading liabilities were $6.0 billion at
Dec. 31, 2020 and $4.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2019.

Under our fair value methodology for derivative
contracts, an initial “risk-neutral” valuation is
performed on each position assuming time-
discounting based on a AA credit curve. In addition,
we consider credit risk in arriving at the fair value of
our derivatives.

We reflect external credit ratings as well as
observable credit default swap spreads for both
ourselves and our counterparties when measuring the
fair value of our derivative positions. Accordingly,
the valuation of our derivative positions is sensitive to
the current changes in our own credit spreads, as well
as those of our counterparties.

At Dec. 31, 2020, our OTC derivative assets,
including those in hedging relationships, of $3.8
billion included a credit valuation adjustment
(“CVA”) deduction of $34 million. Our OTC
derivative liabilities, including those in hedging
relationships, of $4.8 billion included a debit
valuation adjustment (“DVA”) of $1 million related
to our own credit spread. Net of hedges, the CVA
decreased by $5 million and the DVA was unchanged
in 2020. The net impact of these adjustments
increased foreign exchange and other trading revenue
by $5 million in 2020. During 2020, no realized loss
was charged off against CVA reserves.

At Dec. 31, 2019, our OTC derivative assets,
including those in hedging relationships, of $3.2
billion included a CVA deduction of $24 million.

Our OTC derivative liabilities, including those in
hedging relationships, of $3.8 billion included a DVA
of $1 million related to our own credit spread. Net of
hedges, the CVA decreased by $4 million and the
DVA was unchanged in 2019. The net impact of
these adjustments increased foreign exchange and
other trading revenue by $4 million in 2019. During
2019, no realized loss was charged off against CVA
reserves.

The table below summarizes the distribution of credit ratings for our foreign exchange and interest rate derivative
counterparties over the past five quarters, which indicates the level of counterparty credit associated with these

Asset/liability management

Our diversified business activities include processing
securities, accepting deposits, investing in securities,
lending, raising money as needed to fund assets and
other transactions. The market risks from these
activities include interest rate risk and foreign
exchange risk. Our primary market risk is exposure
to movements in U.S. dollar interest rates and certain
foreign currency interest rates. We actively manage
interest rate sensitivity and use earnings simulation
and discounted cash flow models to identify interest
rate exposures.

An earnings simulation model is the primary tool
used to assess changes in pre-tax net interest revenue.
The model incorporates management’s assumptions
regarding interest rates, market spreads, changes in
the prepayment behavior of loans and securities and
the impact of derivative financial instruments used for
interest rate risk management purposes. These
assumptions have been developed through a
combination of historical analysis and future expected
pricing behavior and are inherently uncertain. Actual
results may differ materially from projected results
due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest
rate changes, and changes in market conditions and
management’s strategies, among other factors.

In the table below, we use the earnings simulation
model to run various interest rate ramp scenarios
from a baseline scenario. The interest rate ramp
scenarios examine the impact of large interest rate
movements. In each scenario, all currencies’ interest
rates are shifted higher or lower. Typically, the
baseline scenario uses the average deposit balances of
the last month of the quarter. However, during the
month of December 2020, we experienced a
significant increase in deposits and a corresponding
increase in central bank placements. To normalize
the analysis, we used the fourth quarter 2020 average
for these balances. The 100 basis point ramp scenario
assumes rates change 25 basis points above or below
the yield curve in each of the next four quarters and
the 200 basis point ramp scenario assumes a 50 basis
point per quarter change. Interest rate sensitivity 1s
quantified by calculating the change in pre-tax net
interest revenue between the scenarios over a 12-
month measurement period. The net interest revenue
sensitivity methodology assumes static deposit levels
and also assumes that no management actions will be
taken to mitigate the effects of interest rate changes.

The following table shows net interest revenue
sensitivity for BNY Mellon.

(a) In the parallel rate ramp, both short-term and long-term
rates move in four equal quarterly increments.
(b) Long-term is equal to or greater than one year.

The increases in the up 200 and up 100 basis point
scenarios compared with Sept. 30, 2020 were driven
by increased deposits.

The increases in the scenarios compared with Dec.
31, 2019 are primarily driven by increased deposit
balances. In addition, the down 100 basis point
scenario was impacted by a change in our deposit
assumptions. Specifically, in 2020, we increased the
amount of deposit balances to which we would pass
through negative central bank rates in that scenario.

While the net interest revenue sensitivity scenarios
calculations assume static deposit balances to
facilitate consistent period-over-period comparisons,
it is likely that a portion of the recent monetary
policy-driven deposit inflows would run-off in rising
rate environments, such as the up 100 bps and up 200
bps parallel ramps. Noninterest-bearing deposits are
particularly sensitive to changes in short-term rates.

To illustrate the net interest revenue sensitivity to
deposit runoff, we note that a $5 billion instantaneous
reduction of U.S. dollar denominated noninterest-
bearing deposits would reduce the net interest
revenue sensitivity results in the ramp up 100 basis
point and 200 basis point scenarios in the table above
by approximately $30 million and approximately $65
million, respectively. The impact would be smaller if
the runoff was assumed to be a mixture of interest-
bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits.

For a discussion of factors impacting the growth or

contraction of deposits, see “Risk Factors — Our
business, financial condition and results of operations

BNY Mellon 53

Results of Operations (continued)

could be adversely affected if we do not effectively
manage our liquidity.”

We also project future cash flows from our assets and
liabilities over a long-term horizon and then discount
these cash flows using instantaneous parallel shocks
to prevailing interest rates. This measure reflects the
structural balance sheet interest rate sensitivity by
discounting all future cash flows. The aggregation of
these discounted cash flows is the economic value of
equity (“EVE”). The following table shows how
EVE would change in response to changes in interest
rates.

Estimated changes in EVE Dec. 31,
2020

Rate change:
Up 200 bps vs. baseline (9.2)%
Up 100 bps vs. baseline (4.0)%

The asymmetrical accounting treatment of the impact
of a change in interest rates on our balance sheet may
create a situation in which an increase in interest rates
can adversely affect reported equity and regulatory

54 BNY Mellon

capital, even though economically there may be no
impact on our economic capital position. For
example, an increase in rates will result in a decline in
the value of our available-for-sale securities portfolio.
In this example, there is no corresponding change on
our fixed liabilities, even though economically these
liabilities are more valuable as rates rise.

These results do not reflect strategies that
management could employ to limit the impact as
interest rate expectations change.

To manage foreign exchange risk, we fund foreign
currency-denominated assets with liability
instruments denominated in the same currency. We
utilize various foreign exchange contracts if a liability
denominated in the same currency is not available or
desired, and to minimize the earnings impact of
translation gains or losses created by investments in
foreign markets. We use forward foreign exchange
contracts to protect the value of our net investment in
foreign operations. At Dec. 31, 2020, net investments
in foreign operations totaled $15 billion and were
spread across 17 foreign currencies.
