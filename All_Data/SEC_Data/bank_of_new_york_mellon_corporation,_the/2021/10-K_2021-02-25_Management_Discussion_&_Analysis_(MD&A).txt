Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Results of Operations

General

In this Annual Report, references to “our,” “we,”
“us,” “BNY Mellon,” the “Company” and similar
terms refer to The Bank of New York Mellon
Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. The
term “Parent” refers to The Bank of New York
Mellon Corporation but not its subsidiaries.

The following should be read in conjunction with the
Consolidated Financial Statements included in this
report. BNY Mellon’s actual results of future
operations may differ from those estimated or
anticipated in certain forward-looking statements
contained herein due to the factors described under
the headings “Forward-looking Statements” and
“Risk Factors,” both of which investors should read.

Certain business terms used in this Annual Report are
defined in the Glossary.

This Annual Report generally discusses 2021 and
2020 items and comparisons between 2021 and 2020.
Discussions of 2019 items and comparisons between
2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Annual
Report can be found in our 2020 Annual Report,
which was filed as an exhibit to our Form 10-K for
the year ended Dec. 31, 2020.

Overview

Established in 1784 by Alexander Hamilton, we were
the first company listed on the New York Stock
Exchange (NYSE: BK). With a history of more than
235 years, BNY Mellon is a global company that
manages and services assets for financial institutions,
corporations and individual investors in 35 countries.

In the fourth quarter of 2021, we revised our business
segment disclosures by disaggregating our former
Investment Services business segment into two new
business segments, Securities Services and Market
and Wealth Services. Our Investment and Wealth
Management business segment and the Other
segment were not impacted by the resegmentation.

BNY Mellon has three business segments, Securities
Services, Market and Wealth Services and Investment
and Wealth Management, which offer a
comprehensive set of capabilities and deep expertise
across the investment lifecycle, enabling the
Company to provide solutions to buy-side and sell-

side market participants, as well as leading
institutional and wealth management clients globally.

The diagram below presents our three business
segments and lines of business, with the remaining
operations in the Other segment.

Human capital

Our enduring ambition is to build the best global team
—one that is inclusive of varying perspectives,
backgrounds and experiences, and represents the
increasingly varied markets and clients we serve. Our
core objective is to empower our teams to do their
best work, make unique contributions, and build
purposeful careers in an equitable environment where
they are treated with fairness, dignity and respect.

Diversity and Inclusion

Diversity and inclusion is integral to who we are as a
company, what our people experience as members of
our global team, and how we serve all of our
stakeholders. Our diversity and inclusion strategy is
not separate, but embedded in our business strategy,
operating model, talent experience and client value
proposition.

To increase the diversity of our talent pool, we work

with professional associations, educational
institutions, think tanks and nonprofits to deepen

BNY Mellon 3

engagement with Black, Hispanic/Latino, Asian,
LGBT-, neuro-diverse individuals, people with
disabilities, and talent from other underrepresented
backgrounds. We aim for fair inclusion by requiring
diverse candidate slates, creating gender-neutral job
descriptions and involving diverse interview panels.
We embed diversity and inclusion in our talent
review processes, succession plans and development
objectives to improve promotion readiness and
advance and retain talent from all backgrounds.

At the most senior level, our Executive Committee
sets diversity and inclusion goals with specific targets
to improve senior leader diversity and to increase
female representation globally and diverse ethnic and/
or racial representation in the U.S. Executive
Committee members’ variable compensation is
informed by performance against these goals.

At the end of 2021, women were 40% of BNY
Mellon’s global workforce and 43% of BNY
Mellon’s U.S. workforce. Further, 36% of BNY
Mellon’s U.S. workforce were from underrepresented
ethnic and/or racial backgrounds.

At the end of 2021, 26% of BNY Mellon’s Executive
Committee were women and 18% of BNY Mellon’s
Executive Committee were from underrepresented
ethnic and/or racial backgrounds.

Our Board of Directors is committed to fostering and
maintaining its diversity. At the end of 2021, 31% of
our Board of Directors were women and 38% of our
Board of Directors was composed of individuals from
underrepresented ethnic and/or racial backgrounds.

In addition, four of BNY Mellon’s six standing
committees of its Board of Directors are chaired by a
diverse director based on race or gender.

Retention, Training and Development

We seek to attract and retain employees by providing
a rewarding employee experience. We recognize that
employees seek a supportive, safe and inclusive
workplace, and we continually evaluate our employee
engagement and wellbeing programs in an effort to
meet those expectations. We offer a 401(k) plan for
U.S. employees, and other defined contribution
retirement plans worldwide, where consistent with
market practice. We also maintain defined benefit
plans for certain current and former employees, some
of which are frozen (including in the U.S.). At Dec.
31, 2021, we had approximately 43,000 participants

4 BNY Mellon

in our 401({x) plan, including former employees. In
addition, our frozen U.S. defined benefit pension plan
covered approximately 9,100 U.S. participants and
our non-U.S. defined benefit plans (some frozen)
covered approximately 14,400 non-US. participants.

At key career transition points, from internship to
executive management, we offer programs and
development opportunities to help employees
advance their careers and progress within our
organization. Our extensive training and
development opportunities are designed to enable
employees to grow professionally and advance within
our organization.

We engage with employees to encourage innovation,
show appreciation for their contributions, and gather
feedback on how we can build a more rewarding,
inclusive workplace. For example, we regularly
gather feedback through an all-employee survey.

Employee Wellbeing, Health and Safety

BNY Mellon’s holistic approach to employee
wellbeing is designed to create a healthy, resilient and
vibrant workforce. Our programs are designed to
provide employees easy access to resources to help
improve their physical health, emotional resilience,
financial wellbeing and social connections. Further,
we work to ensure the safety of our employees and
clients in all of our facilities. During the coronavirus
pandemic, we were early to initiate our business
continuity plans and to restrict activities such as
travel and in-person participation in events and large
meetings. We quickly transitioned the vast majority
of our employees, including our senior management
and key personnel, to working from home, which
opened up space for us to create social distancing for
the small number of essential in-office staff. These
essential in-office staff are primarily performing roles
that cannot be done remotely. Since March 2020, the
vast majority of our global employees have worked
from home. We are taking a conservative and
measured approach in assessing how, and when, we
will return employees to our offices when the
COVID-19 pandemic subsides. This phased,
enterprise-wide approach 1s principles-based and will
be centrally coordinated and localized based on the
situation. Our guiding principles are adherence to
government/jurisdictional guidelines, facility
preparedness, business function prioritization, and
staff safety and wellbeing.

Results of Operations (continued)

We assembled a comprehensive Supporting You Now
COVID-19 framework that communicated the array
of measures to support our employees in the moment.
This included expanded employee assistance program
benefits, telehealth coverage, increased back-up
dependent care benefits, virtual babysitting services
and toolkits for managers and employees to conduct
supportive conversations around life balance needs.

Employees and International Operations

Globally, at Dec. 31, 2021, BNY Mellon and its
subsidiaries had approximately 49,100 full-time
employees.

We pride ourselves on providing dedicated service
through our multilingual sales, marketing and client
service teams. At Dec. 31, 2021, approximately 50%
of our total employees (full-time and part-time
employees) were based outside the U.S., with
approximately 9,800 employees in Europe, the
Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), approximately
14,600 employees in the Asia-Pacific region
(“APAC”) and approximately 800 employees in other
global locations, primarily Brazil.

Summary of financial highlights

We reported net income applicable to common
shareholders of BNY Mellon of $3.6 billion, or $4.14
per diluted common share, in 2021, including the
negative impact of $85 million, or $0.10 per diluted
common share, related to litigation reserves and
severance expense, partially offset by gains on
disposals (reflected in investment and other revenue).
In 2020, net income applicable to common
shareholders of BNY Mellon was $3.4 billion, or
$3.83 per diluted common share, including the
negative impact of $159 million, or $0.18 per diluted
common share, related to litigation reserves,
severance expense, losses on business sales (reflected
in investment and other revenue) and real estate
charges in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Highlights of 2021 results

* AUCY/A totaled $46.7 trillion at Dec. 31, 2021
compared with $41.1 trillion at Dec. 31, 2020.
The 14% increase primarily reflects net client
inflows and higher market values, partially offset
by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S.
dollar. (See “Fee and other revenue” beginning
on page 7.)

AUM totaled $2.4 trillion at Dec. 31, 2021
compared with $2.2 trillion at Dec. 31, 2020.
The 10% increase primarily reflects higher
market values and net inflows. (See “Investment
and Wealth Management business segment”
beginning on page 19.)

Investment services fees totaled $8.3 billion in
2021 compared with $8.0 billion in 2020, an
increase of 3%. The increase primarily reflects
higher market values and client activity, and the
favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar,
partially offset by money market fee waivers.
(See “Securities Services business segment”
beginning on page 15 and “Market and Wealth
Services business segment” beginning on page
17.)

Investment management and performance fees
totaled $3.6 billion in 2021 compared with $3.4
billion in 2020, an increase of 7%. The increase
primarily reflects higher market values, the
favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar, higher
equity income and net inflows, partially offset by
higher money market fee waivers. (See
“Investment and Wealth Management business
segment” beginning on page 19.)

Foreign exchange revenue totaled $799 million in
2021, compared with $774 million in 2020. The
increase of 3% primarily reflects higher volumes,
partially offset by lower volatility. (See “Fee and
other revenue” beginning on page 7.)

Net interest revenue totaled $2.6 billion in 2021,
compared with $3.0 billion in 2020, a decrease of
12%. The decrease was primarily driven by
lower interest rates on interest-earning assets,
partially offset by the benefit of lower funding
and deposit rates and larger deposit, loan and
securities balances. Net interest margin was
0.68% in 2021, compared with 0.84% in 2020.
(See “Net interest revenue” beginning on page
10.)

The provision for credit losses was a benefit of
$231 million in 2021 compared with a provision
of $336 million in 2020. The decrease was
primarily driven by an improvement in the
macroeconomic forecast. (See “Allowance for
credit losses” beginning on page 35.)

Noninterest expense totaled $11.5 billion in 2021
compared with $11.0 billion in 2020. The 5%
increase primarily reflects incremental
investments in growth, infrastructure and

BNY Mellon 5

efficiency initiatives, higher revenue-related
expenses and the unfavorable 1mpact of a weaker
U.S. dollar, partially offset by lower occupancy
(including the impact of real estate charges
recorded in 2020) and lower severance expense.
(See “Noninterest expense” on page 13.)

* The provision for income taxes was $877 million
(18.9% effective tax rate) in 2021. (See “Income
taxes” on page 13.)

* The net unrealized pre-tax gain on the securities
portfolio, including the impact of related hedges,
was $384 million at Dec. 31, 2021, compared
with $3.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The decrease
was primarily driven by higher market interest
rates. (See “Securities” beginning on page 28.)

« Our CET! ratio calculated under the Standardized
Approach was 11.2% at Dec. 31, 2021 and 13.1%
at Dec. 31, 2020 under the Advanced
Approaches. The decrease was primarily driven
by common stock repurchases, unrealized losses
on securities available-for-sale, dividend
payments, foreign currency translation and higher
risk-weighted assets (“RWAs’), partially offset
by capital generated through earnings. (See
“Capital” beginning on page 41.)

« Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.5% at Dec. 31, 2021,
compared with 6.3% at Dec. 31, 2020. The
decrease reflects lower common shareholders’
equity, driven by common share repurchases, and
higher average assets. (See “Capital” beginning
on page 41.)

Impact of coronavirus pandemic on our
business

The coronavirus pandemic had a significant effect on
the global macroeconomic environment and markets
in 2020 and 2021.

Since March 2020, the vast majority of our
employees have worked from home. They have been
fully operational with minimal disruption to servicing
our clients. However, our continued reliance on
work-from-home arrangements may result in
increased operational risks.

6 BNY Mellon

Short-term interest rates declined significantly in the
first quarter of 2020 and have remained low through
2021, which resulted in lower net interest revenue and
higher money market fee waivers in 2021 compared
with 2020. This has been partially offset by higher
average deposit balances and higher money market
balances compared with 2020. See further discussion
of money market fee waivers in “Fee and other
revenue.”

Equity market levels have continued to rebound since
the first quarter of 2020 and steadily increased
throughout 2021, resulting in increased asset-based
fees in Investment and Wealth Management,
Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services
in 2021 compared with 2020.

After a significant deterioration in the
macroeconomic outlook in 2020 that resulted in
heightened levels of credit provisioning, the
macroeconomic outlook continued to improve in
2021, resulting in decreases in the allowance for
credit losses and benefits to the provision for credit
losses.

We, along with other CCAR firms, suspended open
market common stock repurchases for most of 2020
but continued our quarterly common stock dividend.
The restrictions on common stock dividends and
share repurchases ended on June 30, 2021. In 2021,
BNY Mellon increased the quarterly cash dividend on
common stock, from $0.31 to $0.34 per share, and
repurchased 89.7 million common shares at an
average price of $50.91 per common share for a total
of $4.6 billion.

For further discussion of the current and potential
impact of the coronavirus pandemic see “Risk Factors
— Additional Risks — The coronavirus pandemic is
adversely affecting us and creates significant risks
and uncertainties for our business, and the ultimate
impact of the pandemic on us will depend on future
developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot
be predicted.”

trillion at Dec. 31, 2020 and Dec. 31, 2019.

(d) Excludes assets managed outside of the Investment and Wealth Management business segment.

N/M — Not meaningful.

Fee revenue increased 4% compared with 2020. The
increase primarily reflects higher investment services
fees and investment management and performance
fees, partially offset by higher money market fee
waivers. Excluding money market fee waivers, fee
revenue increased 9% (Non-GAAP). See
“Supplemental Information — Explanation of GAAP
and Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on
page 103 for the reconciliation of Non-GAAP
measures.

Investment and other revenue increased $20 million
in 2021 compared with 2020. The increase primarily
reflects gains on strategic equity investments, losses
on business sales recorded in 2020 and disposal gains
in 2021, partially offset by renewable energy
investment pre-tax losses and an impairment, one-

time fees in the Pershing and Asset Servicing
businesses recorded in 2020 and lower net securities
gains.

Money market fee waivers

Given the continued low short-term interest rates,
money market mutual fund fees and other similar fees
are being waived to protect investors from negative
returns. The fee waivers have primarily impacted fee
revenues in Pershing and Investment Management,
but also resulted in lower distribution and servicing
expense. The fee waivers also began to impact fee
revenues in our other businesses in the second half of
2020. Money market fee waivers are highly sensitive
to changes in short-term interest rates and are difficult
to predict.

Results of Operations (continued)

The following table presents the impact of money
market fee waivers on our consolidated fee revenue,
net of distribution and servicing expense. In 2021,
the net impact of the money market fee waivers was
$916 million, up from $337 million in 2020, driven
by the full-year impact of low short-term interest
rates.

(a) Money market fee waivers were $49 million in 2019.

(b) The line of business revenue for management reporting

the businesses.

We expect to recover a majority of money market fee
waivers, net of distribution and servicing expense, in
2022, based on implied forward rates as of Dec. 31,
2021 and money market balances, on average, that
are consistent with 2021. Fee waivers will continue
to be dependent on short-term interest rates and the
level of money market balances.

Investment services fees

Investment services fees increased 3% compared with
2020, primarily reflecting higher market values and
client activity, and the favorable impact of a weaker
U.S. dollar, partially offset by higher money market
fee waivers. AUC/A totaled $46.7 trillion at Dec. 31,

8 BNY Mellon

2021, an increase of 14% compared with Dec. 31,
2020, primarily reflecting net client inflows and
higher market values, partially offset by the
unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. AUC/A
consisted of 37% equity securities and 63% fixed-
income securities at Dec. 31, 2021 and 36% equity
securities and 64% fixed-income securities at Dec.
31, 2020.

See “Securities Services business segment” and
“Market and Wealth Services business segment” in
“Review of business segments” for additional details.

Investment management and performance fees

Investment management and performance fees
increased 7% compared with 2020, primarily
reflecting higher market values, the favorable impact
of a weaker U.S. dollar, higher equity income and net
inflows, partially offset by higher money market fee
waivers. Performance fees were $107 million in both
2021 and 2020. On a constant currency basis (Non-
GAAP), investment management and performance
fees increased 4% compared with 2020.

AUM was $2.4 trillion at Dec. 31, 2021, an increase
of 10% compared with Dec. 31, 2020, primarily
reflecting higher market values and net inflows.

See “Investment and Wealth Management business
segment” in “Review of business segments” for
additional details regarding the drivers of investment
management and performance fees, AUM and AUM
flows.

Foreign exchange revenue

Foreign exchange revenue is primarily driven by the
volume of client transactions and the spread realized
on these transactions, both of which are impacted by
market volatility, and the impact of foreign currency
hedging activities. In 2021, foreign exchange
revenue increased 3% compared with 2020, primarily
reflecting higher volumes, partially offset by lower
volatility. Foreign exchange revenue is primarily
reported in the Securities Services business segment
and, to a lesser extent, the Market and Wealth
Services and Investment and Wealth Management
business segments and the Other segment.

Results of Operations (continued)

Financing-related fees

Financing-related fees, which are primarily reported
in the Market and Wealth Services and Securities
Services business segments, include capital market
fees, loan commitment fees and credit-related fees.
Financing-related fees decreased 8% in 2021
compared with 2020, primarily reflecting lower
underwriting fees.

Distribution and servicing fees

Distribution and servicing fees earned from mutual
funds are primarily based on average assets in the
funds and the sales of funds that we manage or
administer and are primarily reported in the
Investment Management business. These fees, which
include 12b-1 fees, fluctuate with the overall level of
net sales, the relative mix of sales between share
classes, the funds’ market values and money market
fee waivers.

Distribution and servicing fees were $112 million in
2021 compared with $115 million in 2020. The
impact of distribution and servicing fees on income in
any one period is partially offset by distribution and
servicing expense paid to other financial
intermediaries to cover their costs for distribution and
servicing of mutual funds. Distribution and servicing
expense 1s recorded as noninterest expense on the
income statement.

Investment and other revenue

Investment and other revenue includes income or loss
from consolidated investment management funds,
seed capital gains or losses, other trading revenue or
loss, renewable energy investments losses, income
from corporate and bank-owned life insurance
contracts, other investment gains or losses, gains or
losses from disposals, expense ret1mbursements from
our CIBC Mellon joint venture, other income or loss
and net securities gains or losses. The income or loss
from consolidated investment management funds
should be considered together with the net income or
loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, which
reflects the portion of the consolidated funds for
which we do not have an economic interest and is
reflected below net income as a separate line item on
the consolidated income statement. Other trading

revenue or loss primarily includes the impact of
market-risk hedging activity related to our seed
capital investments in investment management funds,
non-foreign currency derivative and fixed income
trading, and other hedging activity. Investments in
renewable energy generate losses in investment and
other revenue that are more than offset by benefits
and credits recorded to the provision for income
taxes. Other investment gains or losses includes fair
value changes of non-readily marketable strategic
equity, private equity and other investments. Expense
reimbursements from our CIBC Mellon joint venture
relate to expenses incurred by BNY Mellon on behalf
of the CIBC Mellon joint venture. Other income or
loss includes various miscellaneous revenues.

Investment and other revenue was $336 million in
2021 compared with $316 million in 2020. The
increase primarily reflects gains on strategic equity
investments, losses on business sales recorded in
2020 and disposal gains in 2021, partially offset by
renewable energy investment pre-tax losses and an
impairment, one-time fees in the Pershing and Asset
Servicing businesses recorded in 2020 and lower net
securities gains.

N/M — Not meaningful.
bps — basis points.

Net interest revenue decreased 12% compared with
2020, primarily reflecting lower interest rates on
interest-earning assets, partially offset by the benefit
of lower funding and deposit rates and larger deposit,
loan and securities balances.

Net interest margin decreased 16 basis points
compared with 2020. The decrease primarily reflects
the factors mentioned above.

Average interest-earning assets increased 9%
compared with 2020. The increase primarily reflects
higher interest-bearing deposits with the Federal
Reserve and other central banks and larger securities
and loans balances.

10 BNY Mellon

Average non-U.S. dollar deposits comprised
approximately 25% of our average total deposits in
2021 and 2020. Approximately 40% of the average
non-U.S. dollar deposits in 2021 and 2020 were euro
denominated.

Net interest revenue in future periods will depend on
the level and mix of client deposits and deposit rates,
as well as the level and shape of the yield curve.
Based on the current expectations of an increase in
short-term rates in 2022, we expect net interest
revenue to increase in 2022.

hedged and reclassified prior periods to be comparable. The change reduced the income and average rates previously reported for U.S. government obligations
and U.S. government agency obligations and increased the income and average rates for Other securities in domestic offices.

(a) Includes the average impact of offsetting under enforceable netting agreements of approximately $56 billion in 2019. On a Non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact
of offsetting, the yield on federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements would have been 2.33%, and the rate on federal funds purchased and

Total noninterest expense increased 5% compared
with 2020. The increase primarily reflects
incremental investments in growth, infrastructure and
efficiency initiatives, higher revenue-related expenses
and the unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar,
partially offset by lower occupancy (including the
impact of real estate charges recorded in 2020) and
lower severance expense. The investments in growth,
infrastructure and efficiency initiatives are primarily
included in staff, software and equipment, and
professional, legal and other purchased services
expenses.

We expect noninterest expense to increase in 2022
driven by higher revenue-related expenses, including
higher distribution and servicing expenses associated
with the recovery of fee waivers, the impact of
inflationary pressures, and the impact of investments
in growth, infrastructure and efficiency opportunities.

Results of Operations (continued)

Review of business segments

We have an internal information system that produces
performance data along product and service lines for
our principal business segments and the Other
segment. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we
disaggregated our former Investment Services
business segment into two new business segments,
Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services.
The Securities Services business segment includes the
Asset Servicing and Issuer Services lines of business.
The Market and Wealth Services business segment
includes the Pershing, Treasury Services and
Clearance and Collateral Management lines of
business. Our Investment and Wealth Management
business segment and the Other segment were not
impacted by the resegmentation. Additionally, we are
now presenting investment services fees for each line
of business, as well as other fees, total fee revenue,
investment and other revenue and total fee and other
revenue for each business segment. Prior periods
were revised to reflect these changes.

Business segment accounting principles

Our business segment data has been determined on an
internal management basis of accounting, rather than
the generally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”) used for consolidated financial reporting.
These measurement principles are designed so that
reported results of the business segments will track
their economic performance.

For information on the accounting principles of our
business segments, the primary products and services
in each line of business, the primary types of revenue
by line of business and how our business segments
are presented and analyzed, see Note 24 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Business segment results are subject to
reclassification when organizational changes are
made, or for refinements in revenue and expense
allocation methodologies. Refinements are typically
reflected on a prospective basis.

The results of our business segments may be
influenced by client and other activities that vary by
quarter. In the first quarter, staff expense typically
increases reflecting the vesting of long-term stock

14 BNY Mellon

awards for retirement-eligible employees. In the third
quarter, staff expense typically increases reflecting
the annual employee merit increase. In the third
quarter, Depositary Receipts revenue is typically
higher due to an increased level of client dividend
payments, and volume-related fees may decline due
to reduced client activity. In the fourth quarter, we
typically incur higher business development and
marketing expenses; however, 2020 was an exception
due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. In
our Investment and Wealth Management business
segment, performance fees are typically higher in the
fourth and first quarters, as those quarters represent
the end of the measurement period for many of the
performance fee-cligible relationships.

The results of our business segments may also be
impacted by the translation of financial results
denominated in foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar.
We are primarily impacted by activities denominated
in the British pound and the euro. On a consolidated
basis and in our Securities Services and Market and
Wealth Services business segments, we typically have
more foreign currency-denominated expenses than
revenues. However, our Investment and Wealth
Management business segment typically has more
foreign currency-denominated revenues than
expenses. Overall, currency fluctuations impact the
year-over-year growth rate in the Investment and
Wealth Management business segment more than the
Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services
business segments. However, currency fluctuations,
in isolation, are not expected to significantly impact
net income on a consolidated basis.

Fee revenue in the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment, and to a lesser extent
the Securities Services and Market and Wealth
Services business segments, 1s impacted by the global
market fluctuations. At Dec. 31, 2021, we estimated
that a 5% change in global equity markets, spread
evenly throughout the year, would impact fee revenue
by less than 1% and diluted earnings per common
share by $0.04 to $0.07.

See Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for the consolidating schedules which
show the contribution of our business segments to our
overall profitability.

Review of financial results

AUC/A of $34.6 trillion increased 13% compared
with Dec. 31, 2020, primarily reflecting higher
market values and higher client inflows, partially
offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S.
dollar.

Total revenue of $7.2 billion decreased 2% compared
with 2020. The drivers of total revenue by line of
business are indicated below.

Asset Servicing revenue of $5.7 billion decreased
slightly compared with 2020, primarily reflecting
lower net interest revenue and higher money market
fee waivers, partially offset by higher market values
and client activity and strategic equity investment
gains.

16 BNY Mellon

Issuer Services revenue of $1.5 billion decreased 7%
compared with 2020, primarily reflecting higher
money market fee waivers and lower net interest
revenue in Corporate Trust, partially offset by higher
Depositary Receipts revenue.

Market and regulatory trends are driving investable
assets toward lower fee asset management products at
reduced margins for our clients. These dynamics are
also negatively impacting our investment services
fees. However, at the same time, these trends are
providing additional outsourcing opportunities as
clients and other market participants seek to comply
with regulations and reduce their operating costs.

Noninterest expense of $5.9 billion increased 5%
compared with 2020, primarily reflecting investments
in growth, infrastructure and efficiency initiatives,
higher revenue-related expense and the unfavorable
impact of a weaker U.S. dollar.

2020 compared with 2019

Total revenue of $7.4 billion increased less than 1%
compared with 2019. The drivers of total revenue by
line of business are indicated below.

Asset Servicing revenue of $5.7 billion increased 1%
compared with 2019, primarily reflecting higher
foreign exchange volatility and volumes, higher
market values and higher balances, partially offset by
lower net interest revenue.

Issuer Services revenue of $1.7 billion decreased 3%
compared with 2019, primarily reflecting lower
Depositary Receipts revenue and lower net interest
revenue in Corporate Trust.

Noninterest expense of $5.6 billion increased 2%
compared with 2019, primarily reflecting continued
investments in technology and higher litigation
expense, partially offset by lower severance and
business development (travel and marketing)
expenses.

Business segment description

The Market and Wealth Services business segment
consists of three distinct lines of business, Pershing,
Treasury Services and Clearance and Collateral
Management, which provide business services and
technology solutions to entities including financial
institutions, corporations, foundations and
endowments, public funds and government agencies.
For information on the drivers of the Market and
Wealth Services fee revenue, see Note 10 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Pershing provides execution, clearing, custody,
business and technology solutions, delivering
operational support to broker-dealers, wealth
managers and registered investment advisors
(“RIAs”) globally.

Our Treasury Services business is a leading
provider of global payments, liquidity management
and trade finance services for financial institutions,
corporations and the public sector.

Our Clearance and Collateral Management
business clears and settles equity and fixed-income
transactions globally and serves as custodian for
tri-party repo collateral worldwide. We are the
primary provider of U.S. government securities
clearance and a provider of non-U.S. government
securities clearance. Our collateral services
include collateral management, administration and
segregation. We offer innovative solutions and
industry expertise which help financial institutions
and institutional investors with their liquidity,
financing, risk and balance sheet challenges. We
are a leading provider of tri-party collateral
management services with an average of $4.3
trillion serviced globally including approximately
$3.1 trillion of the U.S. tri-party repo market at
Dec. 31, 2021.

Review of financial results

AUC/A of $11.8 trillion increased 16% compared
with Dec. 31, 2020, primarily reflecting net client
inflows and higher market values.

Total revenue of $4.7 decreased 1% compared with

2020. The drivers of total revenue by line of business
are indicated below.

18 BNY Mellon

Pershing revenue of $2.3 billion decreased 1%
compared with 2020, primarily reflecting higher
money market fee waivers, lower clearing volumes
and the impact of lost business, partially offset by
higher client activity, market values and balances.

Treasury Services revenue of $1.3 billion decreased
3% compared with 2020, primarily reflecting higher
money market fee waivers and lower net interest
revenues, partially offset by higher payment volumes.

Clearance and Collateral Management revenue of
$1.1 billion decreased 1% compared with 2020,
primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue and
intraday credit fees, partially offset by higher non-
U.S. collateral management fees driven by balances.

Noninterest expense of $2.7 billion increased 2%
compared with 2020 primarily reflecting investments
in growth, infrastructure and efficiency initiatives,
higher revenue-related expenses and the unfavorable
impact of a weaker U.S. dollar.

2020 compared with 2019

Total revenue of $4.8 billion increased 2% compared
with 2019. The drivers of total revenue by line of
business are indicated below.

Pershing revenue of $2.3 billion increased 2%
compared with 2019, primarily reflecting higher
balances, higher clearing revenue and the positive
impact of equity markets, partially offset by higher
money market fee waivers.

Treasury Services revenue of $1.3 billion increased
4% compared with 2019, primarily reflecting higher
deposit and money market balances.

Clearance and Collateral Management revenue of
$1.1 billion increased 1% compared with 2019,
primarily reflecting growth in collateral management
and clearance volumes and higher net interest
revenue, partially offset by lower investment income
due to the 2019 sale of an equity investment.

Noninterest expense of $2.6 billion decreased 1%
compared with 2019, primarily reflecting lower
business development (travel and marketing) and
severance expenses.

Business segment description

Our Investment and Wealth Management business
segment consists of two distinct lines of business,
Investment Management and Wealth Management,
which have a combined AUM of $2.4 trillion as of
Dec. 31, 2021.

BNY Mellon Investment Management is a leading
global asset manager and consists of our eight
specialist investment firms and global distribution
network to deliver a highly diversified portfolio of
investment strategies to institutional and retail clients
globally.

Our Investment Management model provides
specialized expertise from eight respected investment
firms offering solutions across every major asset
class, with backing from the proven stewardship and

20 BNY Mellon

global presence of BNY Mellon. Each investment
firm has its own individual culture, investment
philosophy and proprietary investment process. This
approach brings our clients clear, independent
thinking from highly experienced investment
professionals.

The investment firms offer a broad range of actively
managed equity, fixed income, alternative and
hability-driven investments, along with passive
products and cash management. Our seven majority-
owned investment firms are as follows: Alcentra,
ARX, Dreyfus Cash Investment Strategies, Insight
Investment, Mellon, Newton Investment Management
and Walter Scott. BNY Mellon owns a non-
controlling minority interest in Siguler Guff.

In September 2021, Investment Management
realigned Mellon’s capabilities in fixed income,
equities and multi-asset, and liquidity management to
Insight Investment, Newton Investment Management
and Dreyfus Cash Investment Strategies, respectively.
In addition, the Japanese equities team from BNY
Mellon Investment Management Japan is expected to
be added to Newton Investment Management’s
capabilities in 2022.

In addition to the investment firms, Investment
Management has multiple global distribution entities,
which are responsible for distributing the investment
products developed and managed by the investment
firms, as well as responsibility for management and
distribution of our U.S. mutual funds and certain
offshore money market funds.

BNY Mellon Wealth Management provides
investment management, custody, wealth and estate
planning, private banking services, investment
servicing and information management. BNY Mellon
Wealth Management has $321 billion in client assets
as of Dec. 31, 2021, and more than 30 offices in the
U.S. and internationally.

Wealth Management clients include individuals,
families and institutions. Institutions include family
offices, charitable gift programs and endowments and
foundations. We work with clients to build, manage
and sustain wealth across generations and market
cycles.

The wealth business differentiates itself with a
comprehensive wealth management framework called

Results of Operations (continued)

Active Wealth that seeks to empower clients to build
and sustain long-term wealth.

The results of the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment are driven by a blend
of daily, monthly and quarterly averages of AUM by
product type. The overall level of AUM for a given
period is determined by:

« the beginning level of AUM;

« the net flows of new assets during the period
resulting from new business wins and existing
client inflows, reduced by the loss of clients and
existing client outflows; and

* the impact of market price appreciation or
depreciation, foreign exchange rates and
investment firm acquisitions or divestitures.

The mix of AUM is a result of the historical growth
rates of equity and fixed income markets and the
cumulative net flows of our investment firms as a
result of client asset allocation decisions. Actively
managed equity, multi-asset and alternative assets
typically generate higher percentage fees than fixed-
income and liability-driven investments and cash.
Also, actively managed assets typically generate
higher management fees than indexed or passively
managed assets of the same type. Market and
regulatory trends have resulted in increased demand
for lower fee asset management products and for
performance-based fees.

Investment management fees are dependent on the
overall level and mix of AUM and the management
fees expressed in basis points (one-hundredth of one
percent) charged for managing those assets.
Management fees are typically subject to fee
schedules based on the overall level of assets
managed for a single client or by individual asset
class and style. This is most common for institutional
clients where we typically manage substantial assets
for individual accounts.

Performance fees are generally calculated as a
percentage of a portfolio’s performance in excess of a
benchmark index or a peer group’s performance.

A key driver of organic growth in investment
management and performance fees is the amount of

net new AUM flows. Overall market conditions are
also key drivers, with a significant long-term
economic driver being growth of global financial
assets.

Net interest revenue is determined by loan and
deposit volumes and the interest rate spread between
customer rates and internal funds transfer rates on
loans and deposits. Expenses in the Investment and
Wealth Management business segment are mainly
driven by staff and distribution and servicing
expenses.

Review of financial results

AUM of $2.4 trillion increased 10% compared with
Dec. 31, 2020 primarily reflecting higher market
values and net inflows.

Net long-term strategy inflows were $32 billion in
2021, driven by inflows of lability-driven investment
and fixed income funds, partially offset by outflows
of equity and index funds. Short-term strategy
inflows were $70 billion in 2021.

Total revenue of $4.0 billion increased 9% compared
with 2020.

Investment Management revenue of $2.8 billion
increased 9% compared with 2020, primarily
reflecting higher market values, the favorable impact
of a weaker U:S. dollar, higher equity income and
client inflows, partially offset by higher money
market fee waivers.

Wealth Management revenue of $1.2 billion
increased 10% compared with 2020, primarily
reflecting higher market values.

Revenue generated in the Investment and Wealth
Management business included 38% from non-U.S.
sources in 2021, compared with 41% in 2020.

Noninterest expense of $2.8 billion increased 5%
compared with 2020, primarily reflecting the
unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar,
investments in growth initiatives and higher revenue-
related expenses.

Review of financial results

Loss before taxes was $252 million in 2021 compared
with $208 million in 2020.

Investment and other revenue decreased $22 million
compared with 2020, primarily reflecting renewable
energy investment pre-tax losses and an impairment,
and lower net securities gains, partially offset by
gains on equity investments and a loss on a business
sale recorded in 2020.

Net interest expense increased $14 million compared
with 2020, primarily reflecting corporate treasury
activity.

Noninterest expense increased $28 million compared
with 2020, primarily reflecting higher staff expense.

International operations

Our primary international activities consist of asset
servicing in our Securities Services business segment,
global payment services in our Market and Wealth

Our clients include central banks and sovereigns,
financial institutions, asset managers, insurance
companies, corporations, local authorities and high-

our global network of offices, we have developed a
deep understanding of local requirements and cultural
needs, and we pride ourselves on providing dedicated

service through our multilingual sales, marketing and
client service teams.

At Dec. 31, 2021, approximately 50% of our total
employees (full-time and part-time employees) were
based outside the U.S., with approximately 9,800
employees in EMEA, approximately 14,600
employees in APAC and approximately 800
employees in other global locations, primarily Brazil.

We are a leading global asset manager. Our
international operations managed 60% of BNY
Mellon’s AUM at Dec. 31, 2021 and 56% at Dec. 31,
2020.

In Europe, we maintain capabilities to service
Undertakings for Collective Investment in
Transferable Securities and alternative investment
funds. We offer a full range of tailored solutions for
investment companies, financial institutions and
institutional investors across Europe.

We are a provider of non-U.S. government securities,
fixed income and equities clearance, settling
securities transactions directly in European markets,
and using a high-quality and established network of
local agents in non-European markets.

We have extensive experience providing trade and
cash services to financial institutions and central
banks outside of the U.S. In addition, we offer a
broad range of servicing and fiduciary products to
financial institutions, corporations and central banks.
In emerging markets, we lead with custody, global
payments and issuer services, introducing other
products as the markets mature. For more established
markets, our focus is on global investment services.

We are also a full-service global provider of foreign
exchange services, actively trading in over 100 of the
world’s currencies. We serve clients from trading
desks located in Europe, Asia and North America.

Our financial results, as well as our levels of AUC/A
and AUM, are impacted by translation from foreign
currencies to the U.S. dollar. We are primarily
impacted by activities denominated in the British
pound and the euro. If the U.S. dollar depreciates
against these currencies, the translation impact is a
higher level of fee revenue, net interest revenue,
noninterest expense and AUC/A and AUM.
Conversely, if the U.S. dollar appreciates, the
translated levels of fee revenue, net interest revenue,

noninterest expense and AUC/A and AUM will be
lower.

2021, compared with 37% in 2020. Net income from
international operations was $1.8 billion in 2021,
compared with $2.0 billion in 2020.

In 2021, revenues from EMEA were $4.1 billion,
compared with $4.0 billion in 2020. The 4% increase
reflects higher revenue in the Securities Services,
Market and Wealth Services and Investment and
Wealth Management business segments. The
increase in revenue in the Securities Services business
segment primarily reflects higher market values and
client activity and the favorable impact of a weaker
U.S. dollar, partially offset by lower net interest
revenue and foreign exchange revenue. The increase
in revenue in the Market and Wealth Services
business segment was primarily driven by higher
client activity. The increase in revenue in the
Investment and Wealth Management business
segment primarily reflects the favorable impact of a
weaker U.S. dollar and higher market values.

The Securities Services, Investment and Wealth
Management and Market and Wealth Services
business segments generated 52%, 29% and 19% of
EMEA revenues, respectively. Net income from
EMEA was $1.0 billion in 2021, compared with $1.2
billion in 2020.

Revenues from APAC were $1.14 billion in 2021,
compared with $1.17 billion in 2020. The 2%
decrease primarily reflects lower revenue in the
Investment and Wealth Management business
segment, partially offset by higher revenue in the
Securities Services business segment. The decrease
in Investment and Wealth Management revenue was
primarily driven by lower performance fees and
AUM outflows, partially offset by higher market
values.

Critical accounting estimates

Our significant accounting policies are described in
Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. Certain of these policies include critical
accounting estimates which require management to
make subjective or complex judgments about the
effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and
may change in subsequent periods. Our critical
accounting estimates are those related to the
allowance for credit losses, goodwill and other
intangibles and litigation and regulatory
contingencies. Management has discussed the
development and selection of the critical accounting
estimates with the Company’s Audit Committee.

Allowance for credit losses

The allowance for credit losses covers financial assets
subject to credit losses and measured at amortized
cost, including loans and lending-related
commitments, held-to-maturity securities, certain
securities financing transactions and deposits with
banks. The allowance for credit losses is intended to
adjust the carrying value of these assets by an
estimated amount of credit losses that we expect to
incur over the life of the asset. Similarly, the
allowance for credit losses on lending-related
commitments and other off-balance sheet financial
instruments is meant to capture the credit losses that
we expect to recognize in these portfolios as of the
balance sheet date.

A quantitative methodology and qualitative
framework is used to estimate the allowance for
credit losses.

The quantitative component of our estimate uses
models and methodologies that categorize financial
assets based on product type, collateral type, and
other credit trends and risk characteristics, including
relevant information about past events, current
conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts
of future economic conditions that affect the
collectability of the recorded amounts. For the
quantitative component, we segment portfolios into
various major components including commercial
loans and lease financing, commercial real estate,
financial institutions, residential mortgages, and
other. The segmentation of our debt securities
portfolios is by major asset class and is influenced by
whether the security is structured or non-structured
(i.e., direct obligation), as well as the issuer type. The

components of the credit loss calculation for each
major portfolio or asset class include a probability of
default, loss given default and exposure at default, as
applicable, and their values depend on the forecast
behavior of variables in the macroeconomic
environment. We utilize a multi-scenario
macroeconomic forecast which includes a weighting
of three scenarios: a baseline and upside and
downside scenarios and allows us to develop our
estimate using a wide span of economic variables.
Our baseline scenario reflects a view on likely
performance of each global region and the other two
scenarios are designed relative to the baseline
scenario. This approach incorporates a reasonable
and supportable forecast period spanning the life of
the asset, and this period includes both an initial
estimated economic outlook component as well as a
reversion component for each economic input
variable. The length of each of the two components
depends on the underlying financial instrument,
scenario, and underlying economic input variable. In
general, the initial economic outlook period for each
economic input variable under each scenario ranges
between several months and two years. The speed at
which the scenario-specific forecasts revert to long-
term historical mean is based on observed historical
patterns of mean reversion at the economic variable
input level that are reflected in our model parameter
estimates. Certain macroeconomic variables such as
unemployment or home prices take longer to revert
after a contraction, though specific recovery times are
scenario-specific. Reversion will usually take longer
the further away the scenario-specific forecast is from
the historical mean. On a quarterly basis, and within
a developed governance structure, we update these
scenarios for current economic conditions and may
adjust the scenario weighting based on our economic
outlook. The Company uses its best judgment to
assess these economic conditions and loss data in
estimating the allowance for credit losses and these
estimates are subject to periodic refinement based on
changes to underlying external or Company-specific
historical data.

In the quantitative component of our estimate, we
measure expected credit losses using an individual
evaluation method if the risk characteristics of the
asset is no longer consistent with the portfolio or class
of asset. For these assets we do not employ the
macroeconomic model calculation but consider

interest payments when due, and recovery
expectations if they can be reasonably estimated. For
loans, we measure the expected credit loss as the
difference between the amortized cost basis in the
loan and the present value of the expected future cash
flows from the borrower which is generally
discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, or the
fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral
dependent. We generally consider nonperforming
loans as well as loans that have been or are
anticipated to be modified and classified under a
troubled debt restructuring for individual evaluation
given the risk characteristics of such loans.

Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair
value. When an available-for-sale debt security is in
an unrealized loss position, we employ a
methodology to identify and estimate the credit loss
portion of the unrealized loss position. The
measurement of expected credit losses is performed at
the security level and is based on our best single
estimate of cash flows, on a discounted basis;
however, we do not specifically employ the
macroeconomic forecasting models and scenarios
summarized above.

The qualitative component of our estimate for the
allowance for credit losses is intended to capture
expected losses that may not have been fully captured
in the quantitative component. Through an
established governance structure, management
determines the qualitative allowance each period
based on an evaluation of various internal and
environmental factors which include: scenario
weighting and sensitivity risk, credit concentration
risk, economic conditions and other considerations.
We have made and may continue to make
adjustments for idiosyncratic risks.

To the extent actual results differ from forecasts or
management’s judgment, the allowance for credit
losses may be greater or less than future charge-offs
and recoveries.

Our allowance for credit losses is sensitive to a
number of inputs, most notably the credit ratings
assigned to each borrower as well as macroeconomic
forecast assumptions that are incorporated in our
estimate of credit losses through the expected life of
the loan portfolio. Thus, as the macroeconomic
environment and related forecasts change, the
allowance for credit losses may change materially.
The following sensitivity analyses do not represent

26 BNY Mellon

management’s expectations of the deterioration of our
portfolios or the economic environment, but are
provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the
sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses to
changes in key inputs. If commercial real estate
property values were increased 10% and all other
credits were rated one grade better, the quantitative
allowance would have decreased by $37 million, and
if commercial real estate property values were
decreased 10% and all other credits were rated one
grade worse, the quantitative allowance would have
increased by $83 million. Our multi-scenario based
macroeconomic forecast used in determining the Dec.
31, 2021 allowance for credit losses consisted of three
scenarios. The baseline scenario reflects flat GDP
growth, continued moderate labor market recovery
and stable commercial real estate prices through
mid-2022 that begin to increase in the second half of
2022. The upside scenario reflects faster GDP
growth and labor market recovery and higher
commercial real estate prices compared with the
baseline. The downside scenario contemplates
negative GDP growth throughout the first quarter of
2022 and subsequent stabilization throughout 2022 as
well as increasing unemployment throughout 2022
and lower commercial real estate prices than the
baseline. Throughout 2021, we placed the most
weight on our baseline scenario, with the remaining
weighting resulting in slightly more weight placed on
the downside scenario than the upside scenario. From
a sensitivity perspective, at Dec. 31, 2021, if we had
applied 100% weighting to the downside scenario, the
quantitative allowance for credit losses would have
been approximately $110 million higher.

Goodwill and other intangibles

We initially record all assets and liabilities acquired
in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill,
indefinite-lived intangibles and other intangibles, in
accordance with Accounting Standards Codification
(“ASC”) 805, Business Combinations. Goodwill,
indefinite-lived intangibles and other intangibles are
subsequently accounted for in accordance with ASC
350, Intangibles — Goodwill and Other. The initial
measurement of goodwill and intangibles requires
judgment concerning estimates of the fair value of the
acquired assets and liabilities. Goodwill ($17.5
billion at Dec. 31, 2021) and indefinite-lived
intangible assets ($2.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2021) are
not amortized but are subject to tests for impairment
annually or more often if events or circumstances
indicate it is more likely than not they may be

Results of Operations (continued)

impaired. Other intangible assets are amortized over
their estimated useful lives and are subject to
impairment if events or circumstances indicate a
possible inability to realize the carrying value.

BNY Mellon’s business segments include six
reporting units for which annual goodwill impairment
testing is performed in accordance with ASC 350,
Intangibles — Goodwill and Other.

The goodwill impairment test compares the estimated
fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying
amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair
value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying
amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered
not impaired. However, if the carrying amount of the
reporting unit were to exceed its estimated fair value,
an impairment loss would be recorded. A substantial
goodwill impairment charge would not have a
significant impact on our financial condition or our
regulatory capital ratios, but would have an adverse
impact on our results of operations. In addition, due
to regulatory restrictions, the Company’s subsidiary
banks could be restricted from distributing available
cash to the Parent, resulting in the Parent needing to
issue additional long-term debt.

In the second quarter of 2021, we performed our
annual goodwill impairment test on all six reporting
units using an income approach to estimate the fair
values of each reporting unit. Estimated cash flows
used in the income approach were based on
management’s projections as of March 31, 2021. The
discount rate applied to these cash flows was 10%
and incorporated a 6% market equity risk premium.
Estimated cash flows extend far into the future, and,
by their nature, are difficult to estimate over such an
extended time frame.

As a result of the annual goodwill impairment test of
the six reporting units, no goodwill impairment was
recognized. The fair values of all six of the
Company’s reporting units were substantially in
excess of the respective reporting units’ carrying
value. The Investment Management reporting unit,
with $7.3 billion of allocated goodwill, which is one
of the two reporting units in the Investment and
Wealth Management segment, exceeded its carrying
value by approximately 25%. For the Investment
Management reporting unit, in the future, small
changes in the assumptions, such as the discount rate,
changes in the level or mix of AUM and operating

margin, could produce a non-cash goodwill
impairment.

Key judgments in accounting for intangibles include
useful life and classification between goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangibles or other intangibles
requiring amortization.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for
impairment at least annually by comparing their fair
values, estimated using discounted cash flow
analyses, to their carrying values. Other amortizing
intangible assets ($402 million at Dec. 31, 2021) are
evaluated for impairment if events and circumstances
indicate a possible impairment. Such evaluation of
other intangible assets would be initially based on
undiscounted cash flow projections.

See Notes 1 and 7 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information
regarding goodwill, intangible assets and the annual
and interim impairment testing.

Litigation and regulatory contingencies

Significant estimates and judgments are required in

Consolidated balance sheet review

One of our key risk management objectives is to
maintain a balance sheet that remains strong
throughout market cycles to meet the expectations of
our major stakeholders, including our shareholders,
clients, creditors and regulators.

We also seek to undertake overall liquidity risk,
including intraday liquidity risk, that stays within our
risk appetite. The objective of our balance sheet
management strategy is to maintain a balance sheet
that is characterized by strong liquidity and asset
quality, ready access to external funding sources at
competitive rates and a strong capital structure that
supports our risk-taking activities and is adequate to
absorb potential losses. In managing the balance
sheet, appropriate consideration is given to balancing
the competing needs of maintaining sufficient levels
of liquidity and complying with applicable
regulations and supervisory expectations while
optimizing profitability.

Results of Operations (continued)

At Dec. 31, 2021, total assets were $444 billion,
compared with $470 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The
decrease in total assets was primarily driven by lower
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve
and other central banks, partially offset by higher
loans. Deposits totaled $320 billion at Dec. 31, 2021,
compared with $342 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The
decrease primarily reflects lower interest-bearing
deposits in both non-U.S. and U.S. offices, partially
offset by higher noninterest-bearing deposits
(principally in U.S. offices). Total interest-bearing
deposits as a percentage of total interest-earning
assets were 60% at Dec. 31, 2021 and 63% at Dec.
31, 2020.

At Dec. 31, 2021, available funds totaled $155 billion
and includes cash and due from banks, interest-
bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other
central banks, interest-bearing deposits with banks
and federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements. This compares with available
funds of $196 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. Total
available funds as a percentage of total assets were
35% at Dec. 31, 2021 and 42% at Dec. 31, 2020. For
additional information on our available funds, see
“Liquidity and dividends.”

Securities were $159 billion, or 36% of total assets, at
Dec. 31, 2021, compared with $156 billion, or 33%
of total assets, at Dec. 31, 2020. The increase
primarily reflects investments in U.S. Treasury
securities, partially offset by decreases in agency
residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS’”’) and
unrealized pre-tax gains. For additional information
on our securities portfolio, see “Securities” and Note
4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Loans were $68 billion, or 15% of total assets, at Dec.
31, 2021, compared with $56 billion, or 12% of total
assets, at Dec. 31, 2020. The increase was primarily
driven by higher margin loans, capital call financing
and wealth management loans. For additional
information on our loan portfolio, see “Loans” and
Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Long-term debt totaled $26 billion at Dec. 31, 2021
and Dec. 31, 2020. Redemptions and maturities and a
decrease in the fair value of hedged long-term debt
were partially offset by issuances. For additional
information on long-term debt, see “Liquidity and
dividends” and Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total
shareholders’ equity decreased to $43 billion at Dec.
31, 2021 from $46 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. For
additional information, see “Capital” and Note 15 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Securities

In the discussion of our securities portfolio, we have
included certain credit ratings information because
the information can indicate the degree of credit risk
to which we are exposed. Significant changes in
ratings classifications could indicate increased credit
risk for us and could be accompanied by an increase
in the allowance for credit losses and/or a reduction in
the fair value of our securities portfolio.

At Dec. 31, 2021, the securities portfolio had a net
unrealized gain, including the impact of related
hedges, of $384 million, compared with $3.2 billion

(b) Prior period was revised to exclude capital call financing loans.

Our commercial real estate exposure totaled $9.3
billion at Dec. 31, 2021 and $9.2 billion at Dec. 31,
2020. Our income-producing commercial real estate
facilities are focused on experienced owners and are
structured with moderate leverage based on existing
cash flows. Our commercial real estate lending
activities also include construction and renovation
facilities. Our client base consists of experienced
developers and long-term holders of real estate assets.
Loans are approved on the basis of existing or
projected cash flows and supported by appraisals and
knowledge of local market conditions. Development
loans are structured with moderate leverage, and in
many instances, involve some level of recourse to the
developer.

At Dec. 31, 2021, the unsecured portfolio consisted
of real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) and real
estate operating companies, which are both primarily
investment grade.

At Dec. 31, 2021, our commercial real estate portfolio
consisted of the following concentrations: New York
metro — 38%; REITs and real estate operating
companies — 34%; and other — 28%.

Lease financings

The lease financings portfolio exposure totaled $731
million at Dec. 31, 2021 and $1.0 billion at Dec. 31,
2020. At Dec. 31, 2021, approximately 99% of
leasing exposure was investment grade, or investment
grade equivalent and consisted of exposures backed
by well-diversified assets, primarily real estate and

large-ticket transportation equipment. The largest
components of our lease residual value exposure were
to aircraft and freight-related rail cars. Assets are
both domestic and foreign-based, with primary
concentrations in Germany and the U.S.

Approximately 63% of the portfolio is additionally
secured by highly rated securities and/or secured by
letters of credit from investment grade issuers.
Counterparty rating equivalents at Dec. 31, 2021,
were as follows:

« 43% were A or better, or equivalent;
* 56% were BBB; and
« 1% were non-investment grade.

Other residential mortgages

The other residential mortgages portfolio primarily
consists of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and
totaled $299 million at Dec. 31, 2021 and $389
million at Dec. 31, 2020.

Overdrafis

Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities
clearance clients and are generally repaid within two
business days.

Capital call financing

Capital call financing includes loans to private equity

funds that are secured by the fund investors’ capital
commitments and the funds’ right to call capital.

Allowance for credit losses
Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade clients who are active users of our non-credit services. Our
primary exposure to the credit risk of a customer consists of funded loans, unfunded contractual commitments to

lend, standby letters of credit (“SBLC”) and overdrafts associated with our custody and securities clearance
businesses.

The following table presents the changes in our allowance for credit losses.

Results of Operations (continued)

The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $231
million in 2021 driven by an improved
macroeconomic forecast. The provision for credit
losses was $336 million in 2020 and primarily
reflects additional reserves in the commercial real
estate portfolio and as a result of the challenging
macroeconomic outlook due to the coronavirus
pandemic.

The allowance for loan losses and allowance for
lending-related commitments represent
management’s estimate of lifetime expected losses in
our credit portfolio. This evaluation process is
subject to numerous estimates and judgments. To the
extent actual results differ from forecasts or
management’s judgment, the allowance for credit
losses may be greater or less than future charge-offs.

Based on an evaluation of the allowance for credit
losses as discussed in “Critical accounting estimates”
and Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, we have allocated our allowance for
loans and lending-related commitments as presented
below.

(a) The allowance allocated to margins loans, overdrafts and
other loans was insignificant at both Dec. 31, 2021 and Dec.
31, 2020. We have rarely suffered a loss on these types of
loans.

The allocation of the allowance for credit losses is
inherently judgmental, and the entire allowance for
credit losses is available to absorb credit losses
regardless of the nature of the losses.

other residential mortgage loans.

See “Nonperforming assets” in Note 1 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for our policy for
placing loans on nonaccrual status.

Deposits

We receive client deposits through the businesses in
the Securities Services, Market and Wealth Services
and Investment and Wealth Management segments
and we rely on those deposits as a low-cost and stable
source of funding.

Total deposits were $319.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2021, a
decrease of 6%, compared with $341.5 billion at Dec.
31, 2020. The decrease primarily reflects lower
interest-bearing deposits in both non-U.S. and U.S.
offices, partially offset by higher noninterest-bearing
deposits (principally U.S. offices).

Noninterest-bearing deposits were $93.7 billion at
Dec. 31, 2021, compared with $83.8 billion at Dec.
31, 2020. Interest-bearing deposits were primarily
demand deposits and totaled $226.0 billion at Dec.
31, 2021, compared with $257.7 billion at Dec. 31,
2020.

Results of Operations (continued)

The aggregate amount of deposits by foreign
customers in domestic offices was $65.4 billion at
Dec. 31, 2021 and $64.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2020.

Deposits in foreign offices totaled $112.1 billion at
Dec. 31, 2021 and $130.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2020.
These deposits were primarily overnight deposits.

Uninsured deposits are the portion of domestic
deposits accounts that exceed the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance limit.
Uninsured deposits in domestic deposit accounts are
generally demand deposits and totaled $186.2 billion
at Dec. 31, 2021 and $185.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2020.

Short-term borrowings

We fund ourselves primarily through deposits and, to
a lesser extent, other short-term borrowings and long-
term debt. Short-term borrowings consist of federal
funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, payables to customers and broker-
dealers, commercial paper and other borrowed funds.
Certain short-term borrowings, for example,
securities sold under repurchase agreements, require
the delivery of securities as collateral.

Federal funds purchased and securities sold under
repurchase agreements include repurchase agreement
activity with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation
(“FICC”), where we record interest expense gross,
but the ending and average balances reflect the
impact of offsetting under enforceable netting
agreements. This activity primarily relates to
government securities collateralized resale and
repurchase agreements executed with clients that are
novated to and settle with the FICC.

Payables to customers and broker-dealers represent
funds awaiting reinvestment and short sale proceeds
payable on demand. Payables to customers and

broker-dealers are driven by customer trading activity
and market volatility.

The Bank of New York Mellon may issue
commercial paper that matures within 397 days from
the date of issue and is not redeemable prior to
maturity or subject to voluntary prepayment.

Other borrowed funds primarily include overdrafts of
sub-custodian account balances in our Securities
Services businesses, finance lease liabilities and
borrowings under lines of credit by our Pershing
subsidiaries. Borrowings from the Federal Reserve
Bank of Boston under the Money Market Mutual
Fund Liquidity Facility (the “MMLF”) program were
also included in other borrowed funds in 2020.
Overdrafts typically relate to timing differences for
settlements.

Liquidity and dividends

BNY Mellon defines liquidity as the ability of the
Parent and its subsidiaries to access funding or
convert assets to cash quickly and efficiently, or to
roll over or issue new debt, especially during periods
of market stress, at a reasonable cost, and in order to
meet its short-term (up to one year) obligations.
Funding liquidity risk is the risk that BNY Mellon
cannot meet its cash and collateral obligations at a
reasonable cost for both expected and unexpected
cash flow and collateral needs without adversely
affecting daily operations or our financial condition.
Funding liquidity risk can arise from funding
mismatches, market constraints from the inability to
convert assets into cash, the inability to hold or raise
cash, low overnight deposits, deposit run-off or
contingent liquidity events.

Changes in economic conditions or exposure to
credit, market, operational, legal and reputational
risks also can affect BNY Mellon’s liquidity risk
profile and are considered in our liquidity risk
framework. For additional information, see “Risk
Management — Liquidity Risk.”

The Parent’s policy is to have access to sufficient
unencumbered cash and cash equivalents at each
quarter-end to cover maturities and other forecasted
debt redemptions, net interest payments and net tax
payments for the following 18-month period, and to
provide sufficient collateral to satisfy transactions
subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.

Total available funds were $154.8 billion at Dec. 31,
2021, compared with $196.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2020.
The decrease was primarily due to lower interest-
bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other
central banks.

Average non-core sources of funds, such as federal
funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, trading liabilities, other borrowed funds
and commercial paper, were $16.7 billion for 2021
and $19.2 billion for 2020. The decrease primarily
reflects lower federal funds purchased and securities
sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper
and other borrowed funds, partially offset by higher
trading liabilities.

Average interest-bearing domestic deposits were
$124.7 billion for 2021 and $106.0 billion for 2020.
Average foreign deposits, primarily from our
European-based businesses included in the Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services segments,
were $112.5 billion for 2021, compared with $106.8
billion for 2020. The increase primarily reflects
increased client activity.

Average payables to customers and broker-dealers

2020. Payables to customers and broker-dealers are
driven by customer trading activity and market
volatility.

Average long-term debt was $25.8 billion for 2021
and $26.9 billion for 2020.

Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased to
$86.6 billion for 2021 from $69.1 billion for 2020,
primarily reflecting client activity.

A significant reduction of client activity in our
Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services
business segments would reduce our access to
deposits. See “Asset/liability management’ for
additional factors that could impact our deposit
balances.

Sources of liquidity

The Parent’s major sources of liquidity are access to
the debt and equity markets, dividends from its
subsidiaries, and cash on hand and cash otherwise
made available in business-as-usual circumstances to
the Parent through a committed credit facility with
our intermediate holding company (“IHC”).

approximately $1.5 billion, without the need for a
regulatory waiver. In addition, at Dec. 31, 2021, non-
bank subsidiaries of the Parent had liquid assets of
approximately $2.3 billion. Restrictions on our
ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries are
discussed in more detail in “Supervision and
Regulation — Capital Planning and Stress Testing —
Payment of Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Other
Capital Distributions” and in Note 19 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Pershing LLC has uncommitted lines of credit in
place for liquidity purposes which are guaranteed by
the Parent. Pershing LLC has two separate
uncommitted lines of credit amounting to $350
million in aggregate. Average borrowings under
these lines were $1 million, in aggregate, in 2021.
Pershing Limited, an indirect UK-based subsidiary of
BNY Mellon, has two separate uncommitted lines of
credit amounting to $264 million in aggregate.
Average borrowings under these lines were $46
million, in aggregate, in 2021.

The double leverage ratio is the ratio of our equity
investment in subsidiaries divided by our
consolidated Parent company equity, which includes
our noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. In
short, the double leverage ratio measures the extent to
which equity in subsidiaries is financed by Parent
company debt. As the double leverage ratio
increases, this can reflect greater demands on a
company’s cash flows in order to service interest
payments and debt maturities. BNY Mellon’s double
leverage ratio is managed in a range considering the
high level of unencumbered available liquid assets
held in its principal subsidiaries (such as central bank
deposit placements and government securities), the
Company’s cash generating fee-based business
model, with fee revenue representing 81% of total
revenue in 2021, and the dividend capacity of our
banking subsidiaries. Our double leverage ratio was
119.3% at Dec. 31, 2021 and 114.3% at Dec. 31,
2020, and within the range targeted by management.

Uses of funds
The Parent’s major uses of funds are repurchases of
common stock, payment of dividends, principal and

interest payments on its borrowings, acquisitions and
additional investments in its subsidiaries.

40 BNY Mellon

In 2021, we paid $1.3 billion in dividends on our
common and preferred stock. Our common stock
dividend payout ratio was 32% for 2021.

In 2021, we repurchased 89.7 million common shares
at an average price of $50.91 per common share for a
total cost of $4.6 billion.

Liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”)

U.S. regulators have established an LCR that requires
certain banking organizations, including BNY
Mellon, to maintain a minimum amount of
unencumbered high-quality liquid assets (“HQLA”)
sufficient to withstand the net cash outflow under a
hypothetical standardized acute liquidity stress
scenario for a 30-day time horizon.

The following table presents BNY Mellon’s
consolidated HQLA at Dec. 31, 2021, and the average
HQLA and average LCR for the fourth quarter of
2021.

offset by a net change in loans and a net increase in
the securities portfolio. In 2020, net cash used for
investing activities primarily reflects changes in
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve
and other central banks and net increases in the
available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities
portfolios.

Net cash used for financing activities was $22.0
billion in 2021, compared with net cash provided by
financing activities of $75.5 billion in 2020. In 2021,
net cash used for financing activities primarily
reflects changes in deposits, repayments of long-term
debt and common stock repurchases, partially offset
by issuances of long-term debt. In 2020, net cash
provided by financing activities primarily reflects
changes in deposits.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total
shareholders’ equity decreased to $43.0 billion at
Dec. 31, 2021 from $45.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2020.
The decrease primarily reflects common stock
repurchases, dividend payments and unrealized losses
on securities available-for-sale, partially offset by
earnings.

We repurchased 89.7 million common shares at an
average price of $50.91 per common share for a total
of $4.6 billion in 2021.

In December 2020, the Federal Reserve extended the
restriction on common stock dividends and open
market common stock repurchases applicable to
participating Comprehensive Capital Analysis and
Review (“CCAR”) bank holding companies
(“BHCs”), including us, to the first quarter of 2021,
with certain modifications. The temporary
restrictions on dividends and share repurchases ended
for BNY Mellon after June 30, 2021. After these
temporary restrictions were lifted, BNY Mellon
continued to be subject to the stress capital buffer
(“SCB”) framework, which would impose restrictions
on capital distributions on an incremental basis if

BNY Mellon’s risk-based capital ratios decline into
the buffer zone. See “Supervision and Regulation —
Capital Planning and Stress Testing — Payment of
Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Other Capital
Distributions” for additional information related to
CCAR.

In June 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of up to $6.0 billion of common shares
over the six quarters beginning in the third quarter of
2021 and continuing through the fourth quarter of
2022. This new share repurchase plan replaced all
previously authorized share repurchase plans.

The unrealized gain (after-tax) on our available-for-
sale securities portfolio, net of hedges, included in
accumulated other comprehensive income was $362
million at Dec. 31, 2021, compared with $1.5 billion
at Dec. 31, 2020. The decrease in the unrealized
gain, net of tax, was primarily driven by higher
market interest rates.

In 2021, the Parent issued 1,300,000 depositary
shares, each representing a 1/100th interest in a share
of the Parent’s Series I Noncumulative Perpetual
Preferred Stock. The Parent used a portion of the net
proceeds to redeem all outstanding shares of its Series
E Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock. See
Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information on the Parent’s
preferred stock.

Capital adequacy

Regulators establish certain levels of capital for bank
holding companies (“BHCs”) and banks, including
BNY Mellon and our bank subsidiaries, in
accordance with established quantitative
measurements. For the Parent to maintain its status
as a financial holding company (“FHC”), our U.S.
bank subsidiaries and BNY Mellon must, among
other things, qualify as “well capitalized.” As of Dec.
31, 2021 and Dec. 31, 2020, BNY Mellon and our
U.S. bank subsidiaries were “well capitalized.”
Failure to satisfy regulatory standards, including
“well capitalized” status or capital adequacy rules
more generally, could result in limitations on our
activities and adversely affect our financial condition.
See the discussion of these matters in “Supervision
and Regulation — Regulated Entities of BNY Mellon
and Ancillary Regulatory Requirements” and “Risk
Factors — Capital and Liquidity Risk — Failure to
satisfy regulatory standards, including “well
capitalized” and “well managed” status or capital
adequacy and liquidity rules more generally, could
result in limitations on our activities and adversely
affect our business and financial condition.”

The U.S. banking agencies’ capital rules are based on
the framework adopted by the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision (“BCBS”), as amended from
time to time. For additional information on these
capital requirements, see “Supervision and
Regulation.”

(a) Minimum requirements for Dec. 31, 2021 include minimum thresholds plus currently applicable buffers. The U.S. global systemically
important banks (“G-SIB”) surcharge of 1.5% is subject to change. The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set to 0%. The SCB
requirement is 2.5%, equal to the regulatory minimum for Standardized Approach capital ratios.

(b) For our CETI, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, our effective capital ratios under U.S. capital rules are the lower of the ratios as
calculated under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is based on Tier 1 capital and quarterly

average total assets.

(c) The Federal Reserve's regulations do not establish well capitalized thresholds for these measures for BHCs.

(d) The SLR is based on Tier I capital and total leverage exposure, which includes certain off-balance sheet exposures.

(e) The consolidated SLR at Dec. 31, 2020 reflects the temporary exclusion of U.S. Treasury securities from total leverage exposure which
increased our consolidated SLR by 72 basis points. The temporary exclusion ceased to apply beginning April 1, 2021.

Our CET1 ratio determined under the Standardized
Approach was 11.2% at Dec. 31, 2021 and 13.1% at
Dec. 31, 2020 under the Advanced Approaches. The
decrease was primarily driven by common stock
repurchases, unrealized losses on securities available-
for-sale, dividend payments, foreign currency
translation and higher RWAs, partially offset by
capital generated through earnings.

Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.5% at Dec. 31, 2021,
compared with 6.3% at Dec. 31, 2020. The decrease
reflects lower common shareholders’ equity, driven
by common share repurchases, and higher average
assets.

Capital ratios vary depending on the size of the
balance sheet at period-end and the levels and types
of investments in assets. The balance sheet size
fluctuates from period to period based on levels of
customer and market activity. In general, when
servicing clients are more actively trading securities,

deposit balances and the balance sheet as a whole are
higher. In addition, when markets experience
significant volatility or stress, our balance sheet size
may increase considerably as client deposit levels
increase.

Our capital ratios are necessarily subject to, among
other things, anticipated compliance with all
necessary enhancements to model calibration,
approval by regulators of certain models used as part
of RWA calculations, other refinements, further
implementation guidance from regulators, market
practices and standards and any changes BNY Mellon
may make to its businesses. As a consequence of
these factors, our capital ratios may materially
change, and may be volatile over time and from
period to period.

Under the Advanced Approaches, our operational loss

risk model is informed by external losses, including
fines and penalties levied against institutions in the

relate to businesses in which we operate, and as a

From April 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, BHCs
were permitted to temporarily exclude U.S. Treasury
securities from total leverage exposure used in the
SLR calculation. This temporary exclusion increased
our consolidated SLR by 72 basis points at Dec. 31,
2020. The temporary exclusion also impacted the
TLAC and LTD calculations. BNY Mellon and The
Bank of New York Mellon, as custody banks, will
continue to be able to exclude certain central bank
placements from the total leverage exposure used in
the SLR calculation.

Stress capital buffer

In August 2021, the Federal Reserve announced that
BNY Mellon’s SCB requirement would be 2.5%,
equal to the regulatory floor, effective as of Oct. 1,
2021. The SCB replaced the static 2.5% capital
conservation buffer for Standardized Approach
capital ratios for CCAR BHCs. The SCB does not
apply to bank subsidiaries, which remain subject to
the static 2.5% capital conservation buffer. See
“Supervision and Regulation” for additional
information.

The SCB final rule generally eliminates the
requirement for prior approval of common stock
repurchases in excess of the distributions in a firm’s
capital plan, provided that such distributions are
consistent with applicable capital requirements and
buffers, including the SCB.

External TLAC consists of the Parent’s Tier 1 capital
and eligible unsecured LTD issued by it that has a
remaining term to maturity of at least one year and
satisfies certain other conditions. Eligible LTD
consists of the unpaid principal balance of eligible
unsecured debt securities, subject to haircuts for
amounts due to be paid within two years, that satisfy
certain other conditions. Debt issued prior to Dec.
31, 2016 has been permanently grandfathered to the
extent these instruments otherwise would be
ineligible only due to containing impermissible
acceleration rights or being governed by foreign law.

The following table presents our external TLAC and
external LTD ratios.

If BNY Mellon maintains risk-based ratio or leverage
TLAC measures above the minimum required level,
but with a risk-based ratio or leverage below the
minimum level with buffers, we will face constraints
on dividends, equity repurchases and discretionary
executive compensation based on the amount of the
shortfall and eligible retained income.

In June 2021, in connection with the Federal
Reserve’s release of the 2021 CCAR stress tests, we
announced a share repurchase program approved by
our Board of Directors providing for the repurchase
of up to $6.0 billion of common shares beginning in
the third quarter of 2021 and continuing through the
fourth quarter of 2022. This new share repurchase
plan replaced all previously authorized share
repurchase plans.

Share repurchases may be executed through open
market repurchases, in privately negotiated
transactions or by other means, including through
repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule
10b5-1 and other derivative, accelerated share
repurchase and other structured transactions. The
timing and exact amount of any common stock
repurchases will depend on various factors, including
market conditions and the common stock trading
price; the Company’s capital position, liquidity and
financial performance; alternative uses of capital; and
legal and regulatory limitations and considerations.

Trading activities and risk management

Our trading activities are focused on acting as a
market-maker for our customers, facilitating customer
trades and risk-mitigating hedging in compliance with
the Volcker Rule. The risk from market-making
activities for customers is managed by our traders and
limited in total exposure through a system of position
limits, value-at-risk (“VaR”) methodology and other
market sensitivity measures. VaR is the potential loss
in value due to adverse market movements over a
defined time horizon with a specified confidence
level. The calculation of our VaR used by

46 BNY Mellon

management and presented below assumes a one-day
holding period, utilizes a 99% confidence level and
incorporates non-linear product characteristics. VaR
facilitates comparisons across portfolios of different
risk characteristics. VaR also captures the
diversification of aggregated risk at the firm-wide
level.

VaR represents a key risk management measure and
it is important to note the inherent limitations to VaR,
which include:

* VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer
time horizons where moves may be extreme;

* VaR does not take account of potential variability
of market liquidity; and

* Previous moves in market risk factors may not
produce accurate predictions of all future market
moves.

See Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information on the VaR
methodology.

The following tables indicate the calculated VaR
amounts for the trading portfolio for the designated
periods using the historical simulation VaR model.

N/M — Because the minimum and maximum may occur on different
days for different risk components, it is not meaningful to
compute a minimum and maximum portfolio diversification

effect.

The interest rate component of VaR represents
instruments whose values are predominantly driven
by interest rate levels. These instruments include, but
are not limited to, U.S. Treasury securities, swaps,
swaptions, forward rate agreements, exchange-traded
futures and options, and other interest rate derivative
products.

The foreign exchange component of VaR represents
instruments whose values predominantly vary with
the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or
interest rates. These instruments include, but are not
limited to, currency balances, spot and forward
transactions, currency options and other currency
derivative products.

The equity component of VaR consists of instruments
that represent an ownership interest in the form of
domestic and foreign common stock or other equity-
linked instruments. These instruments include, but
are not limited to, common stock, exchange-traded
funds, preferred stock, listed equity options (puts and
calls), OTC equity options, equity total return swaps,
equity index futures and other equity derivative
products.

The credit component of VaR represents instruments
whose values are predominantly driven by credit
spread levels, i.e., idiosyncratic default risk. These
instruments include, but are not limited to, securities
with exposures from corporate and municipal credit
spreads.

The diversification component of VaR is the risk
reduction benefit that occurs when combining
portfolios and offsetting positions, and from the
correlated behavior of risk factor movements.

During 2021, interest rate risk generated 32% of
average gross VaR, foreign exchange risk generated
40% of average gross VaR, equity risk generated 2%
of average gross VaR and credit risk generated 26%
of average gross VaR. During 2021, our daily trading
loss exceeded our calculated VaR amount of the
overall portfolio on two occasions.

The following table of total daily trading revenue or
loss illustrates the number of trading days in which
our trading revenue or loss fell within particular

(a) Trading revenue (loss) includes realized and unrealized gains and

interest revenue.

Trading assets include debt and equity instruments
and derivative assets, primarily interest rate and
foreign exchange contracts, not designated as hedging
instruments. Trading assets were $16.6 billion at
Dec. 31, 2021 and $15.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2020.

Trading liabilities include debt and equity instruments
and derivative liabilities, primarily interest rate and
foreign exchange contracts, not designated as hedging
instruments. Trading liabilities were $5.5 billion at
Dec. 31, 2021 and $6.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2020.

Under our fair value methodology for derivative
contracts, an initial “risk-neutral” valuation is
performed on each position assuming time-
discounting based on a AA credit curve. In addition,
we consider credit risk in arriving at the fair value of
our derivatives.

We reflect external credit ratings as well as
observable credit default swap spreads for both
ourselves and our counterparties when measuring the
fair value of our derivative positions. Accordingly,
the valuation of our derivative positions 1s sensitive to
the current changes in our own credit spreads, as well
as those of our counterparties.

BNY Mellon 47

Results of Operations (continued)

At Dec. 31, 2021, our OTC derivative assets,
including those in hedging relationships, of $2.8
billion included a credit valuation adjustment
(“CVA”) deduction of $29 million. Our OTC
derivative liabilities, including those in hedging
relationships, of $3.4 billion included a debit
valuation adjustment (“DVA”) of $2 million related
to our own credit spread. Net of hedges, the CVA
increased by $1 million and the DVA was unchanged
in 2021, which decreased investment and other
revenue - other trading revenue by $1 million in
2021. During 2021, no realized loss was charged off
against CVA reserves.

At Dec. 31, 2020, our OTC derivative assets,
including those in hedging relationships, of $3.8
billion included a CVA deduction of $34 million.
Our OTC derivative liabilities, including those in
hedging relationships, of $4.8 billion included a DVA
of $1 million related to our own credit spread. Net of
hedges, the CVA decreased by $5 million and the
DVA was unchanged in 2020. The net impact of
these adjustments increased investment and other
revenue - other trading revenue by $5 million in
2020. During 2020, no realized loss was charged off
against CVA reserves.

The table below summarizes the distribution of credit
ratings for our foreign exchange and interest rate
derivative counterparties over the past five quarters,

Asset/liability management
Our diversified business activities include processing

securities, accepting deposits, investing in securities,
lending, raising money as needed to fund assets and

48 BNY Mellon

other transactions. The market risks from these
activities include interest rate risk and foreign
exchange risk. Our primary market risk is exposure
to movements in U.S. dollar interest rates and certain
foreign currency interest rates. We actively manage
interest rate sensitivity and use earnings simulation
and discounted cash flow models to identify interest
rate exposures.

An earnings simulation model is the primary tool
used to assess changes in pre-tax net interest revenue
between a baseline scenario and hypothetical interest
rate scenarios. Interest rate sensitivity is quantified
by calculating the change in pre-tax net interest
revenue between the scenarios over a 12-month
measurement period.

The baseline scenario incorporates the market’s
forward rate expectations and management’s
assumptions regarding client deposit rates, credit
spreads, changes in the prepayment behavior of loans
and securities and the impact of derivative financial
instruments used for interest rate risk management
purposes as of Dec. 31, 2021. These assumptions
have been developed through a combination of
historical analysis and future expected pricing
behavior and are inherently uncertain. Actual results
may differ materially from projected results due to
timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate
changes, and changes in market conditions and
management’s strategies, among other factors. Client
deposit levels and mix are key assumptions impacting
net interest revenue in the baseline as well as the
hypothetical interest rate scenarios. The earnings
simulation model assumes static deposit levels and
mix and it also assumes that no management actions
will be taken to mitigate the effects of interest rate
changes. Typically, the baseline scenario uses the
average deposit balances of the quarter.

In the table below, we use the earnings simulation
model to assess the impact of various hypothetical
interest rate scenarios compared to the baseline
scenario. Beginning in the third quarter of 2021, we
have refined our scenario analysis by replacing
gradual rate ramp scenarios with scenarios that reflect
the impact of instantaneous interest rate shock
movements. In each of the new scenarios, all
currencies’ interest rates are instantaneously shifted
higher or lower. The scenarios assume instantaneous
rate changes at the start of the forecast. Long-term
interest rates are defined as all tenors equal to or
greater than three years and short-term interest rates

Results of Operations (continued)

are defined as all tenors equal to or less than three
months. Interim term points are interpolated where
applicable. The refined scenarios are intended to
provide information on a basis that is consistent with
industry practice.

The following table shows net interest revenue
sensitivity for BNY Mellon. The sensitivity for Dec.
31, 2020 has been updated to reflect the impact of
instantaneous interest rate shock movements.

Estimated changes in net

interest revenue Dec. 31, Sept. 30, Dec. 31,
(in millions) 2021 2021 2020
Up 100 bps rate shock vs.

baseline $ 688 $ 840 $ 777
Long-term up 100 bps, short-

term unchanged 204 239 239
Short-term up 100 bps, long-

term unchanged 483 601 538
Long-term down 50 bps, short-

term unchanged (98) (17) (131)

Down 100 bp rate shock vs.

baseline 392 794 687

The decreases in the rising rate sensitivities compared
with Sept. 30, 2021 are driven by the forecasted
difference in asset yield changes versus deposit rate
changes given the anticipated interest rate increases
and higher net interest revenue in the baseline
scenario.

While the net interest revenue sensitivity scenario
calculations assume static deposit balances to
facilitate consistent period-over-period comparisons,
it is likely that a portion of the recent monetary
policy-driven deposit inflows would run off ina
rising short-term rate environment. Noninterest-
bearing deposits are particularly sensitive to changes
in short-term rates.

To illustrate the net interest revenue sensitivity to
deposit run-off, we note that a $5 billion
instantaneous reduction of U.S. dollar denominated
noninterest-bearing deposits would reduce the net
interest revenue sensitivity results in the up 100 basis
point scenario in the table above by approximately
$75 million. The impact would be smaller if the run-
off was assumed to be a mixture of interest-bearing
and noninterest-bearing deposits.

Additionally, given the continued low short-term
interest rates, money market mutual fund fees and
other similar fees are being waived to protect
investors from negative returns. See “Fee and other
revenue” for additional details on the impact of
money market fee waivers.

For a discussion of factors impacting the growth or
contraction of deposits, see “Risk Factors — Capital
and Liquidity Risk — Our business, financial
condition and results of operations could be adversely
affected if we do not effectively manage our
liquidity.”

We also project future cash flows from our assets and
liabilities over a long-term horizon and then discount
these cash flows using instantaneous parallel shocks
to prevailing interest rates. This measure reflects the
structural balance sheet interest rate sensitivity by
discounting all future cash flows. The aggregation of
these discounted cash flows is the economic value of
equity (“EVE”). The following table shows how
EVE would change in response to changes in interest
rates.

Estimated changes in EVE Dec. 31,
2021

Rate change:
Up 200 bps vs. baseline (8.9)%
Up 100 bps vs. baseline (2.0)%

The asymmetrical accounting treatment of the impact
of a change in interest rates on our balance sheet may
create a situation in which an increase in interest rates
can adversely affect reported equity and regulatory
capital, even though economically there may be no
impact on our economic capital position. For
example, an increase in rates will result in a decline in
the value of our available-for-sale securities portfolio.
In this example, there is no corresponding change on
our fixed liabilities, even though economically these
liabilities are more valuable as rates rise.

These results do not reflect strategies that
management could employ to limit the impact as
interest rate expectations change.

To manage foreign exchange risk, we fund foreign
currency-denominated assets with liability
instruments denominated in the same currency. We
utilize various foreign exchange contracts if a liability
denominated in the same currency is not available or
desired, and to minimize the earnings impact of
translation gains or losses created by investments in
foreign markets. We use forward foreign exchange
contracts to protect the value of our net investment in
foreign operations. At Dec. 31, 2021, net investments
in foreign operations totaled $14 billion and were
spread across 18 foreign currencies.
