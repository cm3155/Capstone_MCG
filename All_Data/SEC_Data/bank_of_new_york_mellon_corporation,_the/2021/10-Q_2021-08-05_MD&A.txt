Overview
Established in 1784 by Alexander Hamilton, we were the first
company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: BK).
With a history of more than 235 years, BNY Mellon is a global
company that manages and services assets for financial institutions,
corporations and individual investors in 35 countries.
BNY Mellon has two business segments, Investment Services and
Investment and Wealth Management, which offer a comprehensive
set of capabilities and deep expertise across the investment
lifecycle, enabling the Company to provide solutions to buy-side
and sell-side market participants, as well as leading institutional
and wealth management clients globally.
The diagram below presents our two business segments and lines
of business, with the remaining operations in the Other segment.
Key second quarter 2021 and subsequent events
Share repurchase program and increase in cash dividend on
common stock
In June 2021, our Board of Directors approved the repurchase of
up to $6.0 billion of common stock starting in the third quarter of
2021 and continuing through the fourth quarter of 2022.
Additionally, in July, our Board of Directors approved a 10%
increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock, from
$0.31 to $0.34 per share. This increased quarterly cash dividend
will be paid on Aug. 9, 2021.

Highlights of second quarter 2021 results
Net income applicable to common shareholders was $991 million,
or $1.13 per diluted common share, in the second quarter of 2021.
Net income applicable to common shareholders was $901 million,
or $1.01 per diluted common share, in the second quarter of 2020.
The highlights below are based on the second quarter of 2021
compared with the second quarter of 2020, unless otherwise noted.
• Total revenue of $4.0 billion decreased 1%, primarily reflecting:
• Fee revenue increased 4%, primarily reflecting the positive
impact of higher markets, the favorable impact of a weaker
U.S. dollar and higher client volumes, partially offset by
money market fee waivers. (See “Fee and other revenue”
beginning on page 7.)
• Other revenue decreased primarily reflecting lower gains
related to seed capital investments. (See “Fee and other
revenue” beginning on page 7.)
• Net interest revenue decreased 17%, primarily reflecting
lower interest rates on interest-earning assets. This was
partially offset by the benefit of lower funding and deposit
rates, lower debt balances, a larger securities portfolio and
higher deposit balances. (See “Net interest revenue” on
page 11.)
• Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $86 million
primarily driven by an improvement in the macroeconomic
forecast. (See “Consolidated balance sheet review – Allowance
for credit losses” beginning on page 31.)
• Noninterest expense increased 3%, primarily reflecting the
unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar, investments in
efficiency and growth initiatives and higher revenue-related
expenses. (See “Noninterest expense” on page 14.)
• Effective tax rate of 19.0%. (See “Income taxes” on page 14.)
Capital and liquidity
• CET1 ratio was 12.6% at June 30, 2021, unchanged compared
with March 31, 2021. Capital generated through earnings was
offset by capital deployed through common stock repurchases
and dividends, and higher risk-weighted assets. (See “Capital”
beginning on page 38.)
• Tier 1 leverage was 6.0% at June 30, 2021, compared with 5.8%
at March 31, 2021. The increase reflects capital generation and
lower average assets. (See “Capital” beginning on page 38.)
• Repurchased 12.8 million common shares for $618 million.
Highlights of our principal businesses
Investment Services
• Total revenue decreased 4%.
• Income before income taxes increased 3%.
• AUC/A of $45.0 trillion increased 21%, primarily reflecting
higher market values, net new business and the favorable
impact of a weaker U.S. dollar.
Investment and Wealth Management
• Total revenue increased 13%.
• Income before income taxes increased 48%.
• AUM of $2.3 trillion increased 18%, primarily reflecting higher
market values, the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar
(principally versus the British pound) and net inflows.

Impact of coronavirus pandemic on our business
See “Impact of coronavirus pandemic on our business” in our 2020
Annual Report for the areas of our business that have been
impacted and could continue to be impacted by the coronavirus
pandemic and its effect on the global macroeconomic environment.
The following updates those disclosures.
Short-term interest rates have remained low through the second
quarter of 2021, which has continued to result in lower net interest
revenue and higher money market fee waivers. This has been
partially offset by higher average deposit balances and higher
money market balances compared with 2020.
Equity market levels have continued to improve in the first six
months of 2021, resulting in increased asset-based fees in
Investment Services and Investment and Wealth Management.
The macroeconomic outlook continued to improve through the first
and second quarters of 2021, resulting in decreases in the
allowance for credit losses and benefits to the provision for credit
losses.
The restrictions on common stock dividends and share repurchases
ended on June 30, 2021.
It is difficult to forecast the impact of the coronavirus, together
with related public health measures, on our results with certainty
because so much depends on how the health crisis evolves and its
impact on the global economy, as well as actions taken by central
banks and governments to support the economy and the
availability, use and effectiveness of vaccines.
The current macroeconomic environment has also resulted in
responses by governmental and regulatory bodies. See
“Supervision and Regulation – Pandemic-Related Measures” in our
2020 Annual Report for additional information on legislative and
regulatory developments in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
For further discussion of the current and potential impact of the
coronavirus pandemic, see “Risk Factors – The coronavirus
pandemic is adversely affecting us and creates significant risks and
uncertainties for our business, and the ultimate impact of the
pandemic on us will depend on future developments, which are
highly uncertain and cannot be predicted,” in our 2020 Annual
Report.

N/M – Not meaningful.
Fee revenue increased 4% compared with the second quarter of
2020 and decreased 1% compared with the first quarter of 2021.
The increase compared with the second quarter of 2020 primarily
reflects higher investment management and performance fees, asset
servicing fees and treasury services fees, partially offset by lower
financing-related fees and foreign exchange revenue. The decrease
compared with the first quarter of 2021 primarily reflects lower
foreign exchange revenue and clearing services fees, partially
offset by higher issuer services fees.
Other revenue decreased $50 million compared with the second
quarter of 2020 and increased $82 million compared with the first
quarter of 2021. The decrease compared with the second quarter of
2020 primarily reflects lower gains related to seed capital
investments. The increase compared with the first
quarter of 2021 primarily reflects a $39 million impairment related
to a renewable energy investment recorded in the first quarter of
2021, gains from other investments and disposals, and higher other
income.
Money market fee waivers
Given the continued low short-term interest rates, money market
mutual fund fees and other similar fees are being waived to protect
investors from negative returns. The fee waivers have primarily
impacted fee revenues in Pershing and Investment Management,
but also resulted in lower distribution and servicing expense. The
fee waivers also began to impact fee revenues in our other
businesses in the second half of 2020. Money market fee waivers
are highly sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates and are
difficult to predict. Assuming no change in money market
BNY Mellon 7
balances, we expect to recover over 50% of the pre-tax income
related to fee waivers with a 25 basis point increase in the Fed
Funds rate and we expect to recover nearly 100% of the pre-tax
income related to fee waivers when the Fed Funds rate increases
100 basis points.
The following table presents the impact of money market fee
waivers on our consolidated fee revenue,
net of distribution and servicing expense. In the second quarter of
2021, the net impact of money market fee waivers was $252
million, up from $188 million in the first quarter of 2021, driven by
lower short-term interest rates and higher money market balances.

We expect the impact from money market fee waivers, net of
distribution and servicing expense, to approximate $225 million in
the third quarter of 2021, based on implied forward rates and
money market balances as of the end of the second quarter of 2021.
Fee waivers in subsequent periods will continue to be dependent on
short-term interest rates and the level of money market balances.
Investment services fees
Investment services fees increased 3% compared with the second
quarter of 2020 and 1% compared with the first quarter of 2021,
reflecting the following:
• Asset servicing fees increased 2% compared with the second
quarter of 2020 and was up slightly compared with the first
quarter of 2021. The increase compared with the second
quarter of 2020 primarily reflects higher client activity, market
values and tri-party collateral management balances, partially
offset by higher
money market fee waivers, and lower intraday credit fees and
clearance volumes. The slight increase compared with the first
quarter of 2021 primarily reflects higher tri-party collateral
management balances, partially offset by higher money market
fee waivers and lower clearance volumes.
• Clearing services fees increased 1% compared with the second
quarter of 2020 and decreased 4% compared with the first
quarter of 2021. The increase compared with the second
quarter of 2020 primarily reflects higher market values, client
activity and balances, partially offset by higher money market
fee waivers. The decrease compared with the first quarter of
2021 primarily reflects lower clearance volumes, partially
offset by higher market values.
• Issuer services fees increased 1% compared with the second
quarter of 2020 and 15% compared with the first quarter of
2021. Both increases
8 BNY Mellon
primarily reflect higher Depositary Receipts revenue, partially
offset by money market fee waivers in Corporate Trust. The
increase compared with the second quarter of 2020 also
reflects higher Corporate Trust revenue.
• Treasury services fees increased 11% compared with the
second quarter of 2020 and 2% compared with the first quarter
of 2021. The increase compared with the second quarter of
2020 primarily reflects higher payment volumes. The increase
compared with first quarter of 2021 primarily reflects net new
business.
See “Investment Services business” in “Review of businesses” for
additional details.
Investment management and performance fees
Investment management and performance fees increased 13%
compared with the second quarter of 2020 and decreased slightly
compared with the first quarter of 2021. The increase compared
with the second quarter of 2020 primarily reflects the impact of
higher market values, the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar,
higher performance fees and net inflows, partially offset by higher
money market fee waivers. The decrease compared with the first
quarter of 2021 primarily reflects the timing of performance fees
and higher money market fee waivers, offset by the impact of
higher market values, equity investment gains and net inflows.
Performance fees were $14 million in the second quarter of 2021,
$5 million in the second quarter of 2020 and $40 million in the first
quarter of 2021. On a constant currency basis (Non-GAAP),
investment management and performance fees increased 9%
compared with the second quarter of 2020.
AUM was $2.3 trillion at June 30, 2021, an increase of 18%
compared with June 30, 2020, primarily reflecting higher market
values, the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar (principally
versus the British pound) and net inflows.
See “Investment and Wealth Management business” in “Review of
businesses” for additional details regarding the drivers of
investment management and performance fees, AUM and AUM
flows.
Foreign exchange revenue
Foreign exchange revenue is primarily driven by the volume of
client transactions and the spread realized on these transactions,
both of which are impacted by market volatility, the impact of
foreign currency hedging activities and foreign currency
remeasurement gain (loss). In the second quarter of 2021, foreign
exchange revenue totaled $184 million, decreases of 5% compared
with the second quarter of 2020 and 20% compared with the first
quarter of 2021. The decrease compared with the second quarter of
2020 primarily reflects lower volatility, partially offset by higher
volumes. The decrease compared with the first quarter of 2021
primarily reflects lower volumes and volatility. Foreign exchange
revenue is primarily reported in the Investment Services business
and, to a lesser extent, the Investment and Wealth Management
business and the Other segment.
Financing-related fees
Financing-related fees, which are primarily reported in the
Investment Services business, include capital market fees, loan
commitment fees and credit-related fees. Financing-related fees
totaled $48 million in the second quarter of 2021, $58 million in
the second quarter of 2020 and $51 million in the first quarter of
2021. Both decreases primarily reflect lower underwriting fees.
Investment and other income
Investment and other income includes income or loss from
consolidated investment management funds, seed capital gains or
losses, other trading revenue or loss, renewable energy investments
losses, corporate and bank-owned life insurance contracts, other
investment gains or losses, gains or losses from disposals, expense
reimbursements from our CIBC Mellon joint venture and other
income or loss. The income or loss from consolidated investment
management funds should be considered together with the net
income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, which
reflects the portion of the consolidated funds for which we do not
have an economic interest and is reflected below net income as a
separate line item on the consolidated income statement. Other
trading revenue or loss primarily includes the impact of marketrisk hedging activity related to our seed capital investments in
investment management funds, non-foreign currency derivative
BNY Mellon 9
and fixed income trading, and other hedging activity. Investments
in renewable energy generate losses in other income that are more
than offset by benefits and credits recorded to the provision for
income taxes. Other investment gains or losses includes fair value
changes of non-readily marketable equity securities,
private equity and other investments. Expense reimbursements
from our CIBC Mellon joint venture relate to expenses incurred by
BNY Mellon on behalf of the CIBC Mellon joint venture. Other
income or loss includes various miscellaneous revenues.
The following table provides the components of investment and other income.

(b) Includes gains (losses) on investments in BNY Mellon funds which hedge deferred incentive awards.
(c) Includes strategic equity, private equity and other investments.
Investment and other income was $89 million in the second quarter
of 2021 compared with $132 million in the second quarter of 2020
and $9 million in the first quarter of 2021. The decrease compared
with the second quarter of 2020 primarily reflects lower gains
related to seed capital investments reflected in the income from
consolidated investment management funds and seed capital gains
(losses) line items. The increase compared with the first quarter of
2021 primarily reflects the $39 million impairment related to a
renewable energy investment recorded in the first quarter of 2021,
gains from other investments and disposals and higher other
income.
Year-to-date 2021 compared with year-to-date 2020
Fee revenue increased 2% compared with the first six months of
2020, primarily reflecting higher investment management and
performance fees and
asset servicing fees, partially offset by lower foreign exchange
revenue and financing-related fees. The 8% increase in investment
management and performance fees primarily reflects higher market
values, the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar, equity
investment gains and net inflows, partially offset by higher money
market fee waivers. The 3% increase in asset servicing fees
primarily reflects higher client activity, market values and the
favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar, partially offset by money
market fee waivers.
The decrease in other revenue primarily reflects one-time fees in
the Asset Servicing and Pershing businesses recorded in the first
six months of 2020, an impairment related to a renewable energy
investment recorded in the first quarter of 2021 and lower
derivative and fixed income trading results, partially offset by
higher gains related to seed capital.

N/M – Not meaningful.
bps – basis points.
Net interest revenue decreased 17% compared with the second
quarter of 2020 and 2% compared with the first quarter of 2021.
The decrease compared with the second quarter of 2020 primarily
reflects lower interest rates on interest-earning assets, partially
offset by the benefit of lower funding and deposit rates, lower debt
balances, a larger securities portfolio and higher deposit balances.
The decrease compared with the first quarter of 2021 was primarily
driven by lower interest rates on interest-earning assets, partially
offset by the benefit of lower funding and deposit rates.
Net interest margin decreased 21 basis points compared with the
second quarter of 2020 and increased 1 basis point compared with
the first quarter of 2021. The decrease compared with the second
quarter of 2020 primarily reflects the factors mentioned above.
Average interest-earning assets increased 9% compared with the
second quarter of 2020 and decreased 2% compared with the first
quarter of 2021. The increase compared with the second quarter of
2020 primarily reflects higher interest-bearing deposits with the
Federal Reserve and other central banks, a larger securities
portfolio and higher loan balances. The decrease compared with
the first quarter of 2021 primarily reflects lower interest-bearing
deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks, partially
offset by higher loan balances.
Average non-U.S. dollar deposits comprised approximately 25% of
our average total deposits in the second quarter of 2021.
Approximately 40% of the average non-U.S. dollar deposits in the
second quarter of 2021 were euro denominated.
Net interest revenue in future periods will depend on the level and
mix of client deposits and deposit rates, as well as the level and
shape of the yield curve, which may result in lower yields on
interest-earning assets.
Due to lower interest rates, net interest revenue has been trending
lower and we expect net interest revenue to decrease in 2021
compared with 2020.
Year-to-date 2021 compared with year-to-date 2020
Net interest revenue decreased 18% compared with the first six
months of 2020, primarily driven by lower interest rates on
interest-earning assets, partially offset by the benefit of lower
deposit and funding rates, a larger securities portfolio, higher
deposit balances and lower debt balances. The decrease in the net
interest margin primarily reflects the factors mentioned above.
Average interest-earning assets increased 15% compared with the
first six months of 2020. The increase primarily reflects higher
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central
banks and a larger securities portfolio.

(a) Includes the average impact of of setting under enforceable netting agreements of approximately $41 billion for the second quarter of 2021, $37 billion for the first quarter of 2021 and $67
billion for the second quarter of 2020. On a Non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of of setting, the yield on federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements would have
been 0.15% for the second quarter of 2021, 0.19% for the first quarter of 2021 and 0.26% for the second quarter of 2020. On a Non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of of setting, the rate on
federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements would have been (0.04)% for the second quarter of 2021, (0.02)% for the first quarter of 2021 and 0.00% for the

(b) In the second quarter of 2021, we reclassified the impact of hedging within the categories comprising total investment securities to align the impact of hedging with the securities being hedged
and reclassified prior periods to be comparable. The change reduced the income and average rates previously reported for U.S. government obligations and U.S. government agency obligations
and increased the income and average rates for Other securities.

Full-time employees at period end 48,800 48,000 48,300 2 % 1 % 48,800 48,300 1 %
Total noninterest expense increased 3% compared with the second
quarter of 2020 and decreased 3% compared with the first quarter
of 2021. The increase compared with the second quarter of 2020
primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar,
investments in efficiency and growth initiatives and higher
revenue-related expenses. The investments in efficiency and
growth initiatives are primarily included in staff, software and
equipment, and professional, legal and other purchased services
expenses. The decrease compared with the first quarter of 2021
primarily reflects lower staff expense driven by increased expense
for awards to retirement eligible employees recorded in the first
quarter of 2021.
We expect total reported noninterest expense to increase
approximately 3% for the full-year 2021 compared to 2020. This is
driven by an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates,
incremental investments in growth and efficiency opportunities and
higher volume- and revenue-related expenses, partially offset by
the impact of 2020 notable items, which were litigation expense,
severance and real estate charges. Notable items comprised 1% of
total noninterest expense in 2020. Noninterest expense could be
impacted if foreign exchange rates change from June 30, 2021
levels, volume- and revenue-related expenses increase or there are
unexpected charges or expenses.
Year-to-date 2021 compared with year-to-date 2020
Noninterest expense increased 4% compared with the first six
months of 2020, primarily reflecting investments in efficiency and
growth initiatives, the unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar
and higher revenue-related expenses, partially offset by lower
distribution and servicing, net occupancy and business
development (travel and marketing) expenses.
Income taxes
BNY Mellon recorded an income tax provision of $241 million
(19.0% effective tax rate) in the second quarter of 2021, $216
million (18.3% effective tax rate) in the second quarter of 2020 and
$221 million (19.2% effective tax rate) in the first quarter of 2021.

Review of businesses
We have an internal information system that produces performance
data along product and service lines for our two principal
businesses, Investment Services and Investment and Wealth
Management, and the Other segment.
Business accounting principles
Our business data has been determined on an internal management
basis of accounting, rather than the generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”) used for consolidated financial reporting.
These measurement principles are designed so that reported results
of the businesses will track their economic performance.
For information on the accounting principles of our businesses, see
Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For
information on the primary products and services in each line of
business, the primary types of revenue by business and how our
businesses are presented and analyzed, see Note 24 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2020 Annual Report.
Business results are subject to reclassification when organizational
changes are made, or for refinements in revenue and expense
allocation methodologies. Refinements are typically reflected on a
prospective basis. There were no reclassification or organizational
changes in the second quarter of 2021.
The results of our businesses may be influenced by client and other
activities that vary by quarter. In the first quarter, staff expense
typically increases reflecting the vesting of long-term stock awards
for retirement-eligible employees. In the third quarter, Depositary
Receipts revenue is typically higher due to an increased level of
client dividend payments. Also in the third quarter, volume-related
fees may decline
due to reduced client activity, and staff expense typically increases
reflecting the annual employee merit increase. In the fourth quarter,
we typically incur higher business development and marketing
expenses; however, 2020 was an exception given the impact of the
coronavirus pandemic. In our Investment and Wealth Management
business, performance fees are typically higher in the fourth and
first quarters, as those quarters represent the end of the
measurement period for many of the performance fee-eligible
relationships.
The results of our businesses may also be impacted by the
translation of financial results denominated in foreign currencies to
the U.S. dollar. We are primarily impacted by activities
denominated in the British pound and the euro. On a consolidated
basis and in our Investment Services business, we typically have
more foreign currency-denominated expenses than revenues.
However, our Investment and Wealth Management business
typically has more foreign currency-denominated revenues than
expenses. Overall, currency fluctuations impact the year-over-year
growth rate in the Investment and Wealth Management business
more than the Investment Services business. However, currency
fluctuations, in isolation, are not expected to significantly impact
net income on a consolidated basis.
Fee revenue in Investment and Wealth Management, and to a lesser
extent in Investment Services, is impacted by the value of market
indices. At June 30, 2021, we estimated that a 5% change in global
equity markets, spread evenly throughout the year, would impact
fee revenue by less than 1% and diluted earnings per common
share by $0.04 to $0.07.
See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
the consolidating schedules which show the contribution of our
businesses to our overall profitability.

Review of financial results
AUC/A of $45.0 trillion increased 21% compared with June 30,
2020, primarily reflecting higher market values, net new business
and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. AUC/A consisted
of 38% equity securities and 62% fixed-income securities at June
30, 2021 and 33% equity securities and 67% fixed-income
securities at June 30, 2020.
Total revenue of $3.0 billion decreased 4% compared with the
second quarter of 2020 and decreased slightly compared with the
first quarter of 2021. The drivers of total revenue by line of
business are indicated below.
Asset Servicing revenue of $1.4 billion decreased 6% compared
with the second quarter of 2020 and 3% compared with the first
quarter of 2021. The decrease compared with the second quarter of
2020 includes lower net interest revenue, higher money market fee
waivers and lower foreign exchange revenue, partially offset by
higher client activity and market values. The decrease compared
with the first quarter of 2021 primarily reflects lower foreign
exchange revenue and higher money market fee waivers.
Pershing revenue of $590 million increased 2% compared with the
second quarter of 2020 and decreased 2% compared with the first
quarter of 2021. The increase compared with the second quarter of
2020 primarily reflects higher market values, client activity and
balances, partially offset by higher money market fee waivers. The
decrease compared with the first quarter of 2021 primarily reflects
lower
clearance volumes, partially offset by higher market values.
Issuer Services revenue of $405 million decreased 6% compared
with the second quarter of 2020 and increased 12% compared with
the first quarter of 2021. The decrease compared with the second
quarter of 2020 primarily reflects higher money market fee waivers
and lower net interest revenue in Corporate Trust, partially offset
by higher Depositary Receipts revenue. The increase compared
with the first quarter of 2021 primarily reflects higher Depositary
Receipts revenue, partially offset by higher money market fee
waivers in Corporate Trust.
Treasury Services revenue of $319 million decreased 6% compared
with the second quarter of 2020 and increased 1% compared with
the first quarter of 2021. The decrease compared with the second
quarter of 2020 primarily reflects lower interest rates and higher
money market fee waivers, partially offset by higher payment
volumes and deposits. The increase compared with the first quarter
of 2021 primarily reflects higher net interest revenue and net new
business, partially offset by higher money market fee waivers.
Clearance and Collateral Management revenue of $283 million
decreased 4% compared with the second quarter of 2020 and
increased 1% compared with the first quarter of 2021. The
decrease compared with the second quarter of 2020 primarily
reflects lower net interest revenue, intraday credit fees and
clearance volumes, partially offset by higher tri-party collateral
management balances. The increase compared with the first quarter
of 2021 primarily reflects higher tri-party collateral management
balances, partially offset by lower clearance volumes.
Market and regulatory trends are driving investable assets toward
lower fee asset management products at reduced margins for our
clients. These dynamics are also negatively impacting our
investment services fees. However, at the same time, these trends
are providing additional outsourcing opportunities as clients and
other market participants seek to comply with regulations and
reduce their operating costs.
Noninterest expense of $2.1 billion increased 3% compared with
the second quarter of 2020 and decreased 2% compared with the
first quarter of 2021. The increase compared with the second
quarter of 2020 primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of a
weaker U.S. dollar, investments in efficiency and
18 BNY Mellon
growth initiatives and higher revenue-related expenses. The
decrease compared with the first quarter of 2021 primarily reflects
lower staff and litigation expenses, partially offset by higher
revenue-related expenses.
Year-to-date 2021 compared with year-to-date 2020
Total revenue of $6.0 billion decreased 6% compared with the first
six months of 2020. Asset Servicing revenue of $2.8 billion
decreased 6%, primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue,
higher money market fee waivers and lower foreign exchange
revenue, partially offset by higher client activity and market
values. Pershing revenue of $1.2 billion decreased 3%, primarily
reflecting higher money market fee waivers, partially offset by
higher market values and client volumes. Issuer Services revenue
of
$768 million decreased 10%, primarily reflecting lower net interest
revenue and higher money market fee waivers in Corporate Trust.
Treasury Services revenue of $636 million decreased 6%, primarily
reflecting lower interest rates and higher money market fee
waivers, partially offset by higher payment volumes and deposits.
Clearance and Collateral Management revenue of $564 million
decreased 5%, primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue,
intra-day credit fees and clearance volumes.
Noninterest expense of $4.2 billion increased 4% compared with
the first six months of 2020 primarily reflects investments in
efficiency and growth initiatives, the unfavorable impact of a
weaker U.S. dollar, higher revenue-related expenses and litigation
expense.

distinct lines of business, Investment Management and Wealth
Management. Our investment firms deliver a highly diversified
portfolio of investment strategies independently, and through our
global distribution network, to institutional and retail clients
globally. BNY Mellon Wealth Management provides investment

pages 19 and 20 of our 2020 Annual Report for additional
information on our Investment and Wealth Management business.
Review of financial results
AUM increased 18% compared with June 30, 2020 primarily
reflecting higher market values, the favorable impact of a weaker
U.S. dollar (principally versus the British pound) and net inflows.
Net long-term strategy inflows were $12 billion in the second
quarter of 2021, driven by inflows of liability-driven and fixed
income investments, partially offset by outflows of index and
equity funds. Short-term strategy inflows were $13 billion in the
second quarter of 2021. Market and regulatory trends have resulted
in increased demand for lower fee asset management products and
for performance-based fees.
Total revenue of $999 million increased 13% compared with the
second quarter of 2020 and 1% compared with the first quarter of
2021.
Investment Management revenue of $700 million increased 13%
compared with the second quarter of 2020 and increased slightly
compared with the first quarter of 2021. The increase compared
with the second quarter of 2020 primarily reflects the impact of
higher market values, the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar,
higher performance fees and net inflows, partially offset by the
impact of money market fee waivers. The slight increase compared
BNY Mellon 21
with the first quarter of 2021 primarily reflects the impact of higher
market values, equity investment gains (net of hedges), including
seed capital, and net inflows, partially offset by the timing of
performance fees and higher money market fee waivers.
Wealth Management revenue of $299 million increased 13%
compared with the second quarter of 2020 and 2% compared with
the first quarter of 2021. Both increases primarily reflect the
impact of higher market values.
Revenue generated in the Investment and Wealth Management
business included 38% from non-U.S. sources in the second
quarter of 2021, compared with 40% in the second quarter of 2020
and 38% in the first quarter of 2021.
Noninterest expense of $677 million increased 3% compared with
the second quarter of 2020 and decreased 5% compared with the
first quarter of 2021. The increase compared with the second
quarter of 2020 primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of a
weaker U.S. dollar and higher staff expense, partially offset by
lower distribution and servicing expense. The decrease compared
with the first quarter of 2021 primarily reflects lower staff expense.
Year-to-date 2021 compared with year-to-date 2020
Total revenue of $2.0 billion increased 12% compared with the
first six months of 2020. Investment Management revenue of $1.4
billion increased 13% primarily reflecting higher market values,
the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar, and equity investment
gains (net of hedges), including seed capital, partially offset by
higher money market fee waivers. Wealth Management revenue of
$592 million increased 9%, primarily reflecting higher market
values.
Noninterest expense of $1.4 billion increased 2% compared with
the first six months of 2020, primarily reflecting the unfavorable
impact of a weaker U.S. dollar and higher staff expense, partially
offset by lower distribution and servicing expense.

on the Other segment.
Review of financial results
Total revenue includes corporate treasury and other investment
activity, including hedging activity which has an offsetting impact
in fee and other revenue and net interest expense.
Fee and other revenue decreased $16 million compared with the
second quarter of 2020 and increased $49 million compared with
the first quarter of 2021. The decrease compared with the second
quarter of 2020 was impacted by lower net securities gains. The
increase compared with the first quarter of 2021 primarily reflects
an impairment of a renewable energy investment recorded in the
first quarter of 2021.
22 BNY Mellon
Noninterest expense increased $10 million compared with the
second quarter of 2020 and $8 million compared with the first
quarter of 2021. Both increases primarily reflect higher staff
expense.
Year-to-date 2021 compared with year-to-date 2020
(Loss) before income taxes increased $82 million compared with
the first six months of 2020. Total fee and other revenue decreased
$73 million, primarily reflecting an impairment of a renewable
energy investment recorded in the first quarter of 2021 and lower
net securities gains. Noninterest expense increased $21 million
compared with the first six months of 2020, primarily reflecting
higher staff expense.
Critical accounting estimates
Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2020 Annual
Report. Our critical accounting estimates are those related to the
allowance for credit losses, fair value of financial instruments and
derivatives, goodwill and other intangibles and litigation and
regulatory contingencies, as referenced below.
Critical accounting estimates Reference
Allowance for credit losses 2020 Annual Report, pages 24-26, and
“Allowance for credit losses.”

Goodwill and other intangibles 2020 Annual Report, pages 28-29.
Also see below.
Litigation and regulatory
contingencies
“Legal proceedings” in Note 17 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
BNY Mellon’s business segments include six reporting units for
which goodwill impairment testing is performed on an annual
basis. The Investment Services segment is comprised of four
reporting units and the Investment and Wealth Management
segment is comprised of two reporting units.
In the second quarter of 2021, we performed our annual goodwill
impairment test on all six reporting units using an income approach
to estimate fair
values of each reporting unit. Estimated cash flows used in the
income approach were based on management’s projections as of
March 31, 2021. The discount rate applied to these cash flows was
10% and incorporated a 6% market equity risk premium. Estimated
cash flows extend far into the future, and, by their nature, are
difficult to estimate over such an extended time frame.
As a result of the annual goodwill impairment test of the six
reporting units, no goodwill impairment was recognized. The fair
values of all six of the Company’s reporting units were
substantially in excess of the respective reporting units’ carrying
value. The Investment Management reporting unit, with $7.3
billion of allocated goodwill, which is one of the two reporting
units in the Investment and Wealth Management segment,
exceeded its carrying value by approximately 25%. For the
Investment Management reporting unit, in the future, small
changes in the assumptions, such as changes in the level of AUM
and operating margin, could produce a non-cash goodwill
impairment. See “Critical accounting estimates” in our 2020
Annual Report for additional information on the annual goodwill
impairment test.
Consolidated balance sheet review
One of our key risk management objectives is to maintain a
balance sheet that remains strong throughout market cycles to meet
the expectations of our major stakeholders, including our
shareholders, clients, creditors and regulators.
We also seek to undertake overall liquidity risk, including intraday
liquidity risk, that stays within our risk appetite. The objective of
our balance sheet management strategy is to maintain a balance
sheet that is characterized by strong liquidity and asset quality,
ready access to external funding sources at competitive rates and a
strong capital structure that supports our risk-taking activities and
is adequate to absorb potential losses. In managing the balance
sheet, appropriate consideration is given to balancing the
competing needs of maintaining sufficient levels of liquidity and
complying with applicable regulations and supervisory
expectations while optimizing profitability.
At June 30, 2021, total assets were $467 billion, compared with
$470 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The decrease in total assets was
primarily driven by lower
BNY Mellon 23
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central
banks, partially offset by higher loans. Deposits totaled $339
billion at June 30, 2021, compared with $342 billion at Dec. 31,
2020. The decrease reflects lower interest-bearing deposits in both
non-U.S. and U.S. offices, partially offset by higher noninterestbearing deposits (principally U.S. offices). Total interest-bearing
deposits as a percentage of total interest-earning assets were 61%
at June 30, 2021 and 63% at Dec. 31, 2020.
At June 30, 2021, available funds totaled $183 billion, which
include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits with the
Federal Reserve and other central banks, interest-bearing deposits
with banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements. This compares with available funds of $196
billion at Dec. 31, 2020. Total available funds as a percentage of
total assets were 39% at June 30, 2021 and 42% at Dec. 31, 2020.
For additional information on our available funds, see “Liquidity
and dividends.”
Securities were $155.9 billion, or 33% of total assets, at June 30,
2021, compared with $156.4 billion, or 33% of total assets, at Dec.
31, 2020. The decrease primarily reflects lower agency residential
mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) and a decrease in
unrealized pre-tax gain, partially offset by an increase in U.S.
Treasury securities. For additional information on our securities
portfolio, see “Securities” and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Loans were $63.5 billion, or 14% of total assets, at June 30, 2021,
compared with $56.5 billion, or 12% of total assets, at Dec. 31,
2020. The increase was
primarily driven by higher margin loans and overdrafts. For
additional information on our loan portfolio, see “Loans” and Note
4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Long-term debt totaled $25.6 billion at June 30, 2021 and $26.0
billion at Dec. 31, 2020. Redemptions, a maturity and a decrease in
the fair value of hedged long-term debt were partially offset by
issuances. For additional information on long-term debt, see
“Liquidity and dividends.”
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total shareholders’
equity decreased to $45.3 billion at June 30, 2021 from $45.8
billion at Dec. 31, 2020. For additional information, see “Capital.”
Country risk exposure
The following table presents BNY Mellon’s top 10 exposures by
country (excluding the U.S.) as of June 30, 2021, as well as certain
countries with higher risk profiles, and is presented on an internal
risk management basis. We monitor our exposure to these and
other countries as part of our internal country risk management
process.
The country risk exposure below reflects the Company’s risk to an
immediate default of the counterparty or obligor based on the
country of residence of the entity which incurs the liability. If there
is credit risk mitigation, the country of residence of the entity
providing the risk mitigation is the country of risk. The country of
risk for securities is generally based on the domicile of the issuer of
the security.

(d) The top 10 country exposures comprise approximately 75% of our total non-U.S. exposure.
Events in recent years have resulted in increased focus on Italy and
Brazil. The country risk exposure to Italy primarily consists of
investment grade sovereign debt. The country risk exposure to
Brazil is primarily short-term trade finance loans extended to large
financial institutions. We also have operations in Brazil providing
investment services and investment management services.
Securities
In the discussion of our securities portfolio, we have included
certain credit ratings information because the information can
indicate the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed.
Significant changes in ratings classifications could indicate
increased credit risk for us and could be accompanied by an
increase in the allowance for credit losses and/or a reduction in the
fair value of our securities portfolio.

(i) Includes unrealized gains of $1,129 million at June 30, 2021 related to available-for-sale securities, net of hedges, and $594 million related to held-to-maturity securities.
The fair value of our securities portfolio, including related hedges,
was $155.6 billion at June 30, 2021, compared with $156.3 billion
at Dec. 31, 2020. The decrease primarily reflects lower agency
RMBS and a decrease in unrealized pre-tax gain, partially offset by
an increase in U.S. Treasury securities.
At June 30, 2021, the securities portfolio had a net unrealized gain,
including the impact of related hedges, of $1.7 billion, compared
with $3.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The decrease in the net
unrealized gain, including the impact of hedges, was primarily
driven by higher market interest rates.
The fair value of the available-for-sale securities totaled $102.7
billion at June 30, 2021, net of hedges, or 66% of the securities
portfolio, net of hedges. The fair value of the held-to-maturity
securities totaled $52.9 billion at June 30, 2021, or 34% of the
securities portfolio, net of hedges.
The unrealized gain (after-tax) on our available-for-sale securities
portfolio, net of hedges, included in accumulated other
comprehensive income was $854 million at June 30, 2021,
compared with $1.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The decrease in the
unrealized gain, net of tax, was primarily driven by higher market
interest rates.
At June 30, 2021, 96% of the securities in our portfolio were rated
AAA/AA-, compared with 95% at Dec. 31, 2020.

At June 30, 2021, total lending-related exposure of $112.9 billion
increased 6% compared with Dec. 31, 2020, primarily reflecting
higher margin loans, overdrafts and wealth management loans and
mortgages, partially offset by lower financial institutions exposure.
Our financial institutions and commercial portfolios comprise our
largest concentrated risk. These portfolios comprised 51% of our
total exposure at June 30, 2021 and 55% at Dec. 31, 2020.
Additionally, most of our overdrafts relate to financial institutions.

Total $ 10.7 $ 32.4 $ 43.1 96 % 87 % $ 11.2 $ 32.8 $ 44.0
The financial institutions portfolio exposure was $43.1 billion at
June 30, 2021, a decrease of 2% compared with Dec. 31, 2020,
primarily reflecting lower exposure to the securities industry and
banks portfolios, partially offset by higher exposure to the asset
managers portfolio.
Financial institution exposures are high-quality, with 96% of the
exposures meeting the investment grade equivalent criteria of our
internal credit rating classification at June 30, 2021. Each customer
is assigned an internal credit rating, which is mapped to an
equivalent external rating agency grade based upon a number of
dimensions, which are continually evaluated and may change over
time. For ratings of non-U.S. counterparties, our internal credit
rating is generally capped at a rating equivalent to the sovereign
rating of the country where the counterparty resides, regardless of
the internal credit rating assigned to the counterparty or the
underlying collateral.
The exposure to financial institutions is generally short-term, with
87% of the exposures expiring within one year. At June 30, 2021,
16% of the exposure to financial institutions had an expiration
within 90 days, compared with 18% at Dec. 31, 2020.
In addition, 71% of the financial institutions exposure is secured.
For example, securities industry clients and asset managers often
borrow against marketable securities held in custody.
At June 30, 2021, the secured intra-day credit provided to dealers
in connection with their tri-party repo activity totaled $17.2 billion
and was included in the securities industry portfolio. Dealers
secure the outstanding intraday credit with high-quality liquid
collateral having a market value in excess of the amount of the
outstanding credit.
The asset managers portfolio exposure is high-quality, with 98% of
the exposures meeting our investment grade equivalent ratings
criteria as of June 30, 2021. These exposures are generally shortterm liquidity facilities, with the majority to regulated mutual
funds.
Our banks exposure primarily relates to our global trade finance.
These exposures are short-term in nature, with 95% due in less
than one year. The investment grade percentage of our banks
exposure was 85% at both June 30, 2021 and Dec. 31, 2020. Our
non-investment grade exposures are primarily trade finance loans
in Brazil.

The commercial portfolio exposure was $14.0 billion at June 30,
2021, a decrease of 1% from Dec. 31, 2020, primarily driven by
lower exposure to the services and other portfolio.
We have $676 million of total direct exposure to the oil and gas
industry at June 30, 2021, most of which is reflected in the energy
and utilities portfolio in the table above. This exposure is to
exploration and production, refining and integrated companies and
was 65% investment grade at June 30, 2021 and 66% at Dec. 31,
2020.
Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade clients that are
active users of our non-credit services. The following table

Wealth management loans and mortgages
Our wealth management exposure was $18.6 billion at June 30,
2021, compared with $17.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. Wealth
management loans and mortgages primarily consist of loans to
high-net-worth individuals, which are secured by marketable
securities and/or residential property. Wealth management
mortgages are primarily interest-only, adjustable-rate mortgages
with a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio of 62% at origination.
Less than 1% of the mortgages were past due at June 30, 2021.
At June 30, 2021, the wealth management mortgage portfolio
consisted of the following geographic concentrations: California –
22%; New York – 16%; Massachusetts – 9%; Florida – 9%; and
other – 44%.

Our commercial real estate exposure totaled $9.6 billion at June 30,
2021 and $9.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. Our income-producing
commercial real estate facilities are focused on experienced owners
and are structured with moderate leverage based on existing cash
flows. Our commercial real estate lending activities also include
construction and renovation facilities. Our client base consists of
experienced developers and long-term holders of real estate assets.
Loans are approved on the basis of existing or projected cash flows
and supported by appraisals and knowledge of local market
conditions. Development loans are structured with moderate
leverage, and in many instances, involve some level of recourse to
the developer.
At June 30, 2021, the unsecured portfolio consisted of real estate
investment trusts (“REITs”) and real estate operating companies,
which are both primarily investment grade.
At June 30, 2021, our commercial real estate portfolio consisted of
the following concentrations: New York metro – 35%; REITs and
real estate operating companies – 40%; and other – 25%.
Lease financings
The lease financings portfolio exposure totaled $0.9 billion at June
30, 2021 and $1.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. At June 30, 2021,
approximately 98% of leasing exposure was investment grade, or
investment grade equivalent and consisted of exposures backed by
well-diversified assets, primarily real estate and large-ticket
transportation equipment. The largest component of our lease
residual value exposure is
freight-related rail cars. Assets are both domestic and foreignbased, with primary concentrations in the Germany and the U.S.
Other residential mortgages
The other residential mortgages portfolio primarily consists of 1-4
family residential mortgage loans and totaled $339 million at June
30, 2021 and $389 million at Dec. 31, 2020. Included in this
portfolio at June 30, 2021 were $59 million of mortgage loans
purchased in 2005, 2006 and the first quarter of 2007.
Overdrafts
Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities clearance
clients and are generally repaid within two business days.
Other loans
Other loans primarily include loans to consumers that are fully
collateralized with equities, mutual funds and fixed-income
securities.
Margin loans
Margin loan exposure of $20.0 billion at June 30, 2021 and $15.5
billion at Dec. 31, 2020 was collateralized with marketable
securities. Borrowers are required to maintain a daily collateral
margin in excess of 100% of the value of the loan. Margin loans
included $7.3 billion at June 30, 2021 and $4.6 billion at Dec. 31,
2020 related to a term loan program that offers fully collateralized
loans to broker-dealers.

Allowance for credit losses
Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade clients who are active users of our non-credit services. Our primary exposure to the credit risk
of a customer consists of funded loans, unfunded contractual commitments to lend, standby letters of credit and overdrafts associated with our
custody and securities clearance businesses.
The following table details changes in our allowance for credit losses.

Allowance for loan losses and lending-related commitments as a percentage of non-margin loans 0.73 0.93 1.17 1.07
(a) Includes allowance for credit losses on federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements, available-for-sale securities, held-to-maturity securities,
accounts receivable, cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits with banks.
The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $86 million in the
second quarter of 2021, primarily driven by an improved
macroeconomic forecast.
We had $19.9 billion of secured margin loans on our balance sheet
at June 30, 2021 compared with $15.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. We
have rarely suffered a loss on these types of loans. As a result, we
believe that the ratio of allowance for loan losses and lendingrelated commitments as a percentage of non-margin loans is a more
appropriate metric to measure the adequacy of the reserve.
The allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-related
commitments represent management’s estimate of lifetime
expected losses in our credit portfolio. This evaluation process is
subject to numerous estimates and judgments. To the extent actual
results differ from forecasts or management’s judgment, the
allowance for credit losses may be greater or less than future
charge-offs.
Based on an evaluation of the allowance for credit losses as
discussed in “Critical accounting estimates,” in our 2020 Annual
Report, we have allocated our allowance for loans and lendingrelated commitments as presented below.

(a) Includes the allowance for credit losses on wealth management mortgages.
The allocation of the allowance for credit losses is inherently
judgmental, and the entire allowance for credit losses is available
to absorb credit losses regardless of the nature of the losses.
Our allowance for credit losses is sensitive to a number of inputs,
most notably the credit ratings assigned to each borrower, as well
as macroeconomic forecast assumptions that are incorporated in
our estimate of credit losses through the expected life of the loan
portfolio. Thus, as the macroeconomic environment and related
forecasts change, the allowance for credit losses may change
materially. The following sensitivity analyses do not represent
management’s expectations of the deterioration of our portfolios or
the economic environment, but are provided as hypothetical
scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses
to changes in key inputs. If each credit were rated one grade better,
the quantitative allowance would have decreased by $84 million,
and if each credit were rated one grade worse, the quantitative
allowance would have increased by $112 million. Our multiscenario based macroeconomic forecast used in determining the
June 30, 2021 allowance for credit losses consisted of three
scenarios. The baseline scenario reflects moderate and flat GDP
growth and unemployment recovery but with declining commercial
real estate prices that begin to recover later in 2021. The upside
scenario reflects faster GDP growth and unemployment recovery
and less severe commercial real estate declines than the baseline.
The downside scenario contemplates negative GDP growth and
increasing unemployment throughout 2021 and steeper declines in
commercial real estate prices than the baseline. Consistent with the
first quarter of 2021, we placed the most weight on our baseline
scenario, with the remaining weighting resulting in slightly more
weight placed on
the downside scenario than the upside scenario. From a sensitivity
perspective, at June 30, 2021, if we had applied 100% weighting to
the downside scenario, the quantitative allowance for credit losses
would have been approximately $150 million higher.
Nonperforming assets

Total allowance for credit

Nonperforming assets increased slightly compared with Dec. 31,
2020, reflecting higher commercial real estate loans, offset by
lower other residential mortgages and wealth management loans
and mortgages.
Lost interest
Interest revenue would have increased by $1 million in the second
quarter of 2021, first quarter of 2021, second quarter of 2020, $2
million in the first six months of 2021 and $3 million in the first
six months of 2020, if nonperforming loans at period-end had been
performing for the entire respective periods.
Loan modifications
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, there have been two forms of
relief provided for classifying loans as troubled debt restructurings
(“TDRs”): The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security
Act (the “CARES Act”), the relevant provisions of which were
extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, and the
Interagency Guidance. See Note 1
32 BNY Mellon
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2020
Annual Report for additional details on this guidance. Financial
institutions may account for eligible loan modifications either
under the CARES Act or the Interagency Guidance and we have
elected to apply both, as applicable, in providing borrowers with
loan modification relief in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
We modified loans of $3 million in the second quarter of 2021,
$282 million in the second quarter of 2020 and $6 million in the
first quarter of 2021. Nearly all of the modifications were shortterm loan payment forbearances or modified principal and/or
interest payments. These loans were primarily residential mortgage
and commercial real estate loans. We did not identify any of the
modifications as TDRs. At June 30, 2021, the unpaid principal
balance of the loans modified under the CARES Act or Interagency
Guidance was $77 million.
Deposits
Total deposits were $338.7 billion at June 30, 2021, a decrease of
1%, compared with $341.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The decrease
reflects lower interest-bearing deposits in both non-U.S. and U.S.
offices, partially offset by higher noninterest-bearing deposits
(principally U.S. offices).
Noninterest-bearing deposits were $94.1 billion at June 30, 2021
compared with $83.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. Interest-bearing
deposits were $244.6 billion at June 30, 2021, compared with
$257.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2020.
Short-term borrowings
We fund ourselves primarily through deposits and, to a lesser
extent, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Short-term
borrowings consist of federal funds purchased and securities sold
under repurchase agreements, payables to customers and brokerdealers, commercial paper and other borrowed funds. Certain
short-term borrowings, for example, securities sold under
repurchase agreements, require the delivery of securities as
collateral.
Information related to federal funds purchased and securities sold
under repurchase agreements is presented below.

of 2020. On a Non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of offsetting, the
weighted-average rates would have been (0.04)% for the second quarter of
2021, (0.02)% for the first quarter of 2021 and 0.00% for the second quarter
of 2020. We believe providing the rates excluding the impact of netting is
useful to investors as it is more reflective of the actual rates paid.
(b) Includes the impact of offsetting under enforceable netting agreements of
$41,122 million at June 30, 2021, $33,544 million at March 31, 2021 and
$48,615 million at June 30, 2020.
Fluctuations of federal funds purchased and securities sold under
repurchase agreements reflect changes in overnight borrowing
opportunities. The decrease of the weighted-average rates
compared with June 30, 2020 primarily reflects lower interest rates
and repurchase agreement activity with the Fixed Income Clearing
Corporation (the “FICC”), where we record interest expense gross,
but the ending and average balances reflect the impact of offsetting
under enforceable netting agreements. This activity primarily
relates to government securities collateralized resale and
repurchase agreements executed with clients that are novated to
and settle with the FICC.

first quarter of 2021 and $18,742 million in the second quarter of 2020.
Payables to customers and broker-dealers represent funds awaiting
reinvestment and short sale proceeds payable on demand. Payables
to customers and broker-dealers are driven by customer trading
activity and market volatility.

not redeemable prior to maturity or subject to voluntary
prepayment. The decrease in the commercial paper compared with
June 30, 2020 primarily reflects the continuation of elevated
deposit levels.

Other borrowed funds primarily include overdrafts of subcustodian account balances in our Investment Services businesses,
finance lease liabilities and borrowings under lines of credit by our
Pershing subsidiaries. Borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank
of Boston under the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility
(the “MMLF”) program are also included in other borrowed funds
at June 30, 2020. Overdrafts typically relate to timing differences
for settlements. The decrease in other borrowed funds compared
with June 30, 2020 reflects a decline in borrowings from the
Federal Reserve Bank of Boston under the MMLF program. The
increase in other borrowed funds compared with March 31, 2021
reflects higher overdrafts of sub-custodian account balances in our
Investment Services businesses.
Liquidity and dividends
BNY Mellon defines liquidity as the ability of the Parent and its
subsidiaries to access funding or convert assets to cash quickly and
efficiently, or to roll over or issue new debt, especially during
periods of market stress, at a reasonable cost, and in order to meet
its short-term (up to one year) obligations. Funding liquidity risk is
the risk that BNY Mellon cannot meet its cash and collateral
obligations at a reasonable cost for both expected and unexpected
cash flow and collateral needs without adversely affecting daily
operations or our financial condition. Funding liquidity risk can
arise from funding mismatches, market constraints from the
inability to convert assets into cash, the inability to hold or raise
cash, low overnight deposits, deposit run-off or contingent liquidity
events.
Changes in economic conditions or exposure to credit, market,
operational, legal and reputational
34 BNY Mellon
risks also can affect BNY Mellon’s liquidity risk profile and are
considered in our liquidity risk framework. For additional
information, see “Risk Management – Liquidity Risk” in our 2020
Annual Report.
The Parent’s policy is to have access to sufficient unencumbered
cash and cash equivalents at each quarter-end to cover maturities
and other forecasted debt redemptions, net interest payments and
net tax payments for the following 18-month period, and to provide
sufficient collateral to satisfy transactions subject to Section 23A of
the Federal Reserve Act. As of June 30, 2021, the Parent was in
compliance with this policy.
We monitor and control liquidity exposures and funding needs
within and across significant legal entities, branches, currencies
and business lines, taking into account, among other factors, any
applicable restrictions on the transfer of liquidity among entities.
BNY Mellon also manages potential intraday liquidity risks. We
monitor and manage intraday liquidity against existing and
expected intraday liquid resources (such as cash balances,
remaining intraday credit capacity, intraday contingency funding
and available collateral) to enable BNY Mellon to meet its intraday
obligations under normal and reasonably severe stressed
conditions.
We define available funds for internal liquidity management
purposes as cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits
with the Federal Reserve and other central banks, interest-bearing
deposits with banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased
under resale agreements. The following table presents our total
available funds at period end and on an average basis.

Total available funds were $182.5 billion at June 30, 2021,
compared with $196.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The decrease was
primarily due to lower interest-bearing deposits with the Federal
Reserve and other central banks, partially offset by higher interestbearing deposits with banks.
Average non-core sources of funds, such as federal funds
purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements, trading
liabilities, other borrowed funds and commercial paper were $17.1
billion for the first six months of 2021 and $18.2 billion the first
six months of 2020. The decrease primarily reflects lower other
borrowed funds and commercial paper, partially offset by higher
federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements and trading liabilities.
Average foreign deposits, primarily from our European-based
Investment Services business, were $114.5 billion for the first six
months of 2021,
compared with $103.1 billion for the first six months of 2020.
Average interest-bearing domestic deposits were $127.7 billion for
the first six months of 2021 and $101.0 billion for the first six
months of 2020. The increase primarily reflects increased client
activity.
Average payables to customers and broker-dealers were $17.2
billion for the first six months of 2021 and $17.6 billion for the
first six months of 2020. Payables to customers and broker-dealers
are driven by customer trading activity and market volatility.
Average long-term debt was $25.7 billion for the first six months
of 2021 and $27.7 billion for the first six months of 2020.
Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased to $84.6 billion for
the first six months of 2021 from $66.5 billion for the first six
months of 2020, primarily reflecting client activity.
BNY Mellon 35
A significant reduction in our Investment Services business would
reduce our access to deposits. See “Asset/liability management”
for additional factors that could impact our deposit balances.
Sources of liquidity
The Parent’s major sources of liquidity are access to the debt and
equity markets, dividends from its
subsidiaries, and cash on hand and cash otherwise made available
in business-as-usual circumstances to the Parent through a
committed credit facility with our intermediate holding company
(“IHC”).
Our ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms, or at
all, is partially dependent on our credit ratings, which are as
follows:
Credit ratings at June 30, 2021

Long-term debt totaled $25.6 billion at June 30, 2021 and $26.0
billion at Dec. 31, 2020. Redemptions of $2.3 billion, a maturity of
$500 million and a decrease in the fair value of hedged long-term
debt were partially offset by issuances of $2.7 billion. The Parent
has $1.5 billion of long-term debt that will mature in the remainder
of 2021.
In July 2021, the Parent issued $500 million of fixed rate senior
notes maturing in 2026 at an annual interest rate of 1.05% and
$500 million of fixed rate senior notes maturing in 2031 at an
annual interest rate of 1.80%.
The Bank of New York Mellon may issue notes and CDs. At June
30, 2021 and Dec. 31, 2020, $30 million of notes were outstanding.
There were no CDs outstanding at June 30, 2021 and $100 million
was outstanding at Dec. 31, 2020.
The Bank of New York Mellon also issues commercial paper that
matures within 397 days from the date of issue and is not
redeemable prior to maturity or subject to voluntary prepayment.
There was no commercial paper outstanding at June 30, 2021 and
Dec. 31, 2020. The average commercial paper outstanding was
$886 million for the first six months of 2020.
Subsequent to June 30, 2021, our U.S. bank subsidiaries could
declare dividends to the Parent of approximately $1.6 billion,
without the need for a regulatory waiver. In addition, at June 30,
2021, non-bank subsidiaries of the Parent had liquid assets of
approximately $3.3 billion. Restrictions on our ability to obtain
funds from our subsidiaries are discussed in more detail in
“Supervision and Regulation – Capital Planning and Stress Testing
– Payment of Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Other Capital
Distributions” and in Note 19 of the Notes to
36 BNY Mellon
Consolidated Financial Statements, both in our 2020 Annual
Report.
Pershing LLC has uncommitted lines of credit in place for liquidity
purposes which are guaranteed by the Parent. Pershing LLC has
two separate uncommitted lines of credit amounting to $350
million in aggregate. There were no borrowings under these lines
in the second quarter of 2021. Pershing Limited, an indirect UKbased subsidiary of BNY Mellon, has two separate uncommitted
lines of credit amounting to $269 million in aggregate. Average
borrowings under these lines were $14 million, in aggregate, in the
second quarter of 2021.
The double leverage ratio is the ratio of our equity investment in
subsidiaries divided by our consolidated Parent company equity,
which includes our noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. In
short, the double leverage ratio measures the extent to which equity
in subsidiaries is financed by Parent company debt. As the double
leverage ratio increases, this can reflect greater demands on a
company’s cash flows in order to service interest payments and
debt maturities. BNY Mellon’s double leverage ratio is managed in
a range considering the high level of unencumbered available
liquid assets held in its principal subsidiaries (such as central bank
deposit placements and government securities), the Company’s
cash generating fee-based business model, with fee revenue
representing 81% of total revenue in the second quarter of 2021,
and the dividend capacity of our banking subsidiaries. Our double
leverage ratio was 114.4% at June 30, 2021 and 114.3% at Dec. 31,
2020, and within the range targeted by management.
Uses of funds
The Parent’s major uses of funds are repurchases of common stock,
payment of dividends, principal and interest payments on its
borrowings, acquisitions and additional investments in its
subsidiaries.
In May 2021, a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per common share was
paid to common shareholders. Our common stock dividend payout
ratio was 27% for the second quarter of 2021.
In July 2021, our Board of Directors approved a 10% increase in
the quarterly cash dividend on common stock, from $0.31 to $0.34
per share. This increased quarterly cash dividend will be paid on
Aug. 9, 2021.
In the second quarter of 2021, we repurchased 12.8 million
common shares at an average price of $48.17 per common share,
for a total cost of $618 million.
In June 2021, our Board of Directors approved the repurchase of
up to $6.0 billion of common stock starting in the third quarter of
2021 and continuing through the fourth quarter of 2022.
See “Recent regulatory developments” for additional information
on the 2021 CCAR. Also see “Supervision and Regulation –
Capital Planning and Stress Testing – Payment of Dividends, Stock
Repurchases and Other Capital Distributions” in our 2020 Annual
Report for additional information related to the 2020 CCAR.
Liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”)
U.S. regulators have established an LCR that requires certain
banking organizations, including BNY Mellon, to maintain a
minimum amount of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets
(“HQLA”) sufficient to withstand the net cash outflow under a
hypothetical standardized acute liquidity stress scenario for a 30-
day time horizon.
The following table presents BNY Mellon’s consolidated HQLA at
June 30, 2021, and the average HQLA and average LCR for the
second quarter of 2021.
Consolidated HQLA and LCR June 30, 2021
(dollars in billions)
Securities (a) $ 121
Cash (b) 126
Total consolidated HQLA (c) $ 247
Total consolidated HQLA – average (c) $ 236
Average LCR 110 %
(a) Primarily includes securities of U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, U.S.
Treasury, sovereign securities, U.S. agency and investment-grade corporate
debt.
(b) Primarily includes cash on deposit with central banks.
(c) Consolidated HQLA presented before adjustments. After haircuts and the
impact of trapped liquidity, consolidated HQLA totaled $170 billion at June
30, 2021 and averaged $160 billion for the second quarter of 2021.
BNY Mellon and each of our affected domestic bank subsidiaries
were compliant with the U.S. LCR requirements of at least 100%
throughout the second quarter of 2021.

Statement of cash flows
The following summarizes the activity reflected on the
consolidated statement of cash flows. While this information may
be helpful to highlight certain macro trends and business strategies,
the cash flow analysis may not be as relevant when analyzing
changes in our net earnings and net assets. We believe that in
addition to the traditional cash flow analysis, the discussion related
to liquidity and dividends and asset/liability management herein
may provide more useful context in evaluating our liquidity
position and related activity.
Net cash used for operating activities was $345 million in the six
months ended June 30, 2021, compared with net cash provided by
operations of $5.1 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2020. In
the six months ended June 30, 2021 cash flows used for operations
primarily resulted from changes in accruals, partially offset by
earnings. In the six months ended June 30, 2020, cash flows
provided by operations primarily resulted from earnings and
changes in accruals.
Net cash provided by investing activities was $3.9 billion in the six
months ended June 30, 2021, compared with net cash used for
investing activities of $58.7 billion in the six months ended June
30,
2020. In the six months ended June 30, 2021, net cash provided by
investing activities primarily reflects change in interest-bearing
deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks, partially
offset by net changes in loans and changes in interest-bearing
deposits with banks. In the six months ended June 30, 2020, net
cash used for investing activities primarily reflects net changes in
securities, change in interest-bearing deposits with the Federal
Reserve and other central banks and changes in federal funds sold
and securities purchased under resale agreements.
Net cash used for financing activities was $3.5 billion in the six
months ended June 30, 2021, compared with net cash provided by
financing activities of $53.4 billion in the six months ended June
30, 2020. In the six months ended June 30, 2021, net cash used for
financing activities primarily reflects repayments of long-term
debt, changes in deposits, changes in payables to customers and
broker-dealers and treasury stock acquired, partially offset by net
proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and change in federal
funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements.
In the six months ended June 30, 2020, net cash provided by
financing activities primarily reflects changes in deposits and
payables to customers and broker-dealers, partially offset by
changes in commercial paper.

38 BNY Mellon
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total shareholders’
equity decreased to $45.3 billion at June 30, 2021 from $45.8
billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The decrease primarily reflects common
stock repurchases, dividend payments and unrealized losses on
securities available-for-sale, partially offset by earnings.
The unrealized gain (after-tax) on our available-for-sale securities
portfolio, net of hedges, included in accumulated other
comprehensive income was $854 million at June 30, 2021,
compared with $1.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The decrease in the
unrealized gain, net of tax, was primarily driven by higher market
interest rates.
In the first six months of 2021, we repurchased 29.6 million
common shares at an average price of $44.49 per common share
for a total of $1.3 billion under the share repurchase program that
was in place through the second quarter of 2021.
In December 2020, the Federal Reserve released the results of the
second round of CCAR stress tests during 2020 and extended the
restriction on common stock dividends and open market common
stock repurchases applicable to participating CCAR BHCs,
including us, to the first quarter of 2021, with certain
modifications. In March 2021, the Federal Reserve extended these
restrictions through the second quarter of 2021. The temporary
restrictions on dividends and share repurchases ended for BNY
Mellon after June 30, 2021. Starting in the third quarter of 2021,
BNY Mellon will continue to be subject to the normal constraints
under the stress capital buffer (“SCB”) framework.
In June 2021, the Federal Reserve released the results of its stress
tests for 2021. Our Board of Directors subsequently authorized the
repurchase of up to $6.0 billion of common shares over the six
quarters
beginning in the third quarter of 2021 and continuing through the
fourth quarter of 2022. This new share repurchase plan replaces all
previously authorized share repurchase plans. See “Recent
regulatory developments” for additional information on the 2021
CCAR results.
Capital adequacy
Regulators establish certain levels of capital for BHCs and banks,
including BNY Mellon and our bank subsidiaries, in accordance
with established quantitative measurements. For the Parent to
maintain its status as a financial holding company (“FHC”), our
U.S. bank subsidiaries and BNY Mellon must, among other things,
qualify as “well capitalized.” As of June 30, 2021 and Dec. 31,
2020, BNY Mellon and our U.S. bank subsidiaries were “well
capitalized.” Failure to satisfy regulatory standards, including
“well capitalized” status or capital adequacy rules more generally,
could result in limitations on our activities and adversely affect our
financial condition. See the discussion of these matters in
“Supervision and Regulation – Regulated Entities of BNY Mellon
and Ancillary Regulatory Requirements” and “Risk Factors –
Operational Risk – Failure to satisfy regulatory standards,
including “well capitalized” and “well managed” status or capital
adequacy and liquidity rules more generally, could result in
limitations on our activities and adversely affect our business and
financial condition,” both of which are in our 2020 Annual Report.
The U.S. banking agencies’ capital rules are based on the
framework adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision (“BCBS”), as amended from time to time. For
additional information on these capital requirements, see
“Supervision and Regulation” in our 2020 Annual Report.

(a) Minimum requirements for June 30, 2021 include minimum thresholds plus currently applicable buffers. The U.S. global systemically important banks (“G-SIB”) surcharge
of 1.5% is subject to change. The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set to 0%. The stress capital buffer (“SCB”) requirement is 2.5%, equal to the regulatory
minimum for Standardized Approach capital ratios.
(b) For our CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, our effective capital ratios under U.S. capital rules are the lower of the ratios as calculated under the Standardized
and Advanced Approaches. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is based on Tier 1 capital and quarterly average total assets.
(c) The Federal Reserve’s regulations do not establish well capitalized thresholds for these measures for BHCs.
(d) The SLR is based on Tier 1 capital and total leverage exposure, which includes certain off-balance sheet exposures.
(e) The consolidated SLR at March 31, 2021 and Dec. 31, 2020 reflects the temporary exclusion of U.S. Treasury securities from total leverage exposure which increased our
consolidated SLR by 68 basis points and 72 basis points, respectively. The temporary exclusion ceased to apply beginning April 1, 2021.
Our CET1 ratio under the Standardized Approach was 12.6% at
June 30, 2021 and was 13.1% at Dec. 31, 2020 under the Advanced
Approaches. The decrease was primarily driven by common stock
repurchases, unrealized losses on securities available-for-sale,
dividend payments and an increase in RWAs, partially offset by
capital generated through earnings.
Capital ratios vary depending on the size of the balance sheet at
period-end and the levels and types of investments in assets. The
balance sheet size fluctuates from period to period based on levels
of customer and market activity. In general, when servicing clients
are more actively trading securities, deposit balances and the
balance sheet as a whole are higher. In addition, when markets
experience significant volatility or stress, our balance sheet size
may increase considerably as client deposit levels increase.
Our capital ratios are necessarily subject to, among other things,
anticipated compliance with all necessary enhancements to model
calibration, approval by regulators of certain models used as part of
RWA calculations, other refinements, further implementation
guidance from regulators, market practices and standards and any
changes BNY Mellon may make to its businesses. As a
consequence of these factors, our capital ratios may materially
change, and may be volatile over time and from period to period.
Under the Advanced Approaches, our operational loss risk model is
informed by external losses, including fines and penalties levied
against institutions in the financial services industry, particularly
those that relate to businesses in which we operate, and as a result
external losses have impacted and could in the future impact the
amount of capital that we are required to hold.

BNY Mellon 41
From April 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, BHCs were permitted
to temporarily exclude U.S. Treasury securities from total leverage
exposure used in the SLR calculation. This temporary exclusion
increased our consolidated SLR by 68 basis points at March 31,
2021 and 72 basis points at Dec. 31, 2020. The temporary
exclusion also impacted the TLAC and LTD calculations. BNY
Mellon and The Bank of New York Mellon, as custody banks, will
continue to be able to exclude certain central bank placements from
the total leverage exposure used in the SLR calculation, consistent
with the amendments to the SLR finalized by the U.S. banking
agencies in 2019 pursuant to the Economic Growth, Regulatory
Relief, and Consumer Protection Act.
Stress capital buf er
In August 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that BNY
Mellon’s SCB requirement would be 2.5%, equal to the regulatory
floor, effective as of Oct. 1, 2020. The SCB replaces the current
2.5% capital conservation buffer for Standardized Approach capital
ratios for CCAR BHCs. The SCB does not apply to bank
subsidiaries, which remain subject to the static 2.5% capital
conservation buffer. See “Recent regulatory developments” for
additional information on the SCB.
The SCB final rule generally eliminates the requirement for prior
approval of common stock repurchases in excess of the
distributions in a firm’s capital plan, provided that such
distributions are consistent with applicable capital requirements
and buffers, including the SCB. In conjunction with the release of
the 2020 CCAR results, the Federal Reserve imposed restrictions
on capital distributions as described earlier in “Capital.”
Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (“TLAC”)
The final TLAC rule establishing external TLAC, external longterm debt (“LTD”) and related requirements for U.S. G-SIBs,
including BNY Mellon, at the top-tier holding company level
became effective on Jan. 1, 2019. The following summarizes the
minimum requirements for BNY Mellon’s external TLAC and
external LTD ratios, plus currently applicable buffers.

(b) Buffer to be met using only CET1.
(c) Buffer to be met using only Tier 1 capital.
External TLAC consists of the Parent’s Tier 1 capital and eligible
unsecured LTD issued by it that has a remaining term to maturity
of at least one year and satisfies certain other conditions. Eligible
LTD consists of the unpaid principal balance of eligible unsecured
debt securities, subject to haircuts for amounts due to be paid
within two years, that satisfy certain other conditions. Debt issued
prior to Dec. 31, 2016 has been permanently grandfathered to the
extent these instruments otherwise would be ineligible only due to
containing impermissible acceleration rights or being governed by
foreign law.
The following table presents our external TLAC and external LTD
ratios.

If BNY Mellon maintains risk-based ratio or leverage TLAC
measures above the minimum required level, but with a risk-based
ratio or leverage below the minimum level with buffers, we will
face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and discretionary
executive compensation based on the amount of the shortfall and
eligible retained income.

Trading activities and risk management
Our trading activities are focused on acting as a market-maker for
our customers, facilitating customer trades and risk-mitigating
hedging in compliance with the Volcker Rule. The risk from
market-making activities for customers is managed by our traders
and limited in total exposure through a system of position limits,
value-at-risk (“VaR”) methodology and other market sensitivity
measures. VaR is the potential loss in value due to adverse market
movements over a defined time horizon with a specified
confidence level. The calculation of our VaR used by management
and presented below assumes a one-day holding period, utilizes a
99% confidence level and incorporates non-linear product
characteristics. VaR facilitates comparisons across portfolios of
different risk characteristics. VaR also captures the diversification
of aggregated risk at the firm-wide level.
VaR represents a key risk management measure and it is important
to note the inherent limitations to VaR, which include:
• VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer time
horizons where moves may be extreme;
• VaR does not take account of potential variability of market
liquidity; and
• Previous moves in market risk factors may not produce accurate
predictions of all future market moves.
See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information on the VaR methodology.
The following tables indicate the calculated VaR amounts for the
trading portfolio for the designated periods using the historical
simulation VaR model.

The interest rate component of VaR represents instruments whose
values are predominantly driven by interest rate levels. These
instruments include, but are not limited to, U.S. Treasury
securities, swaps, swaptions, forward rate agreements, exchangetraded futures and options, and other interest rate derivative
products.
BNY Mellon 43
The foreign exchange component of VaR represents instruments
whose values predominantly vary with the level or volatility of
currency exchange rates or interest rates. These instruments
include, but are not limited to, currency balances, spot and forward
transactions, currency options and other currency derivative
products.
The equity component of VaR consists of instruments that
represent an ownership interest in the form of domestic and foreign
common stock or other equity-linked instruments. These
instruments include, but are not limited to, common stock,
exchange-traded funds, preferred stock, listed equity options (puts
and calls), OTC equity options, equity total return swaps, equity
index futures and other equity derivative products.
The credit component of VaR represents instruments whose values
are predominantly driven by credit spread levels, i.e., idiosyncratic
default risk. These instruments include, but are not limited to,
securities with exposures from corporate and municipal credit
spreads.
The diversification component of VaR is the risk reduction benefit
that occurs when combining portfolios and offsetting positions, and
from the correlated behavior of risk factor movements.
During the second quarter of 2021, interest rate risk generated 33%
of average gross VaR, foreign exchange risk generated 39% of
average gross VaR, equity risk generated 1% of average gross VaR
and credit risk generated 27% of average gross VaR. During the
second quarter of 2021, our daily trading loss exceeded our
calculated VaR amount of the overall portfolio on one occasion.
The following table of total daily trading revenue or loss illustrates
the number of trading days in which our trading revenue or loss fell
within particular ranges during the past five quarters.

(a) Trading revenue (loss) includes realized and unrealized gains and losses primarily
related to spot and forward foreign exchange transactions, derivatives and securities
trades for our customers and excludes any associated commissions, underwriting fees
and net interest revenue.
Trading assets include debt and equity instruments and derivative
assets, primarily interest rate and foreign exchange contracts, not
designated as hedging instruments. Trading assets were $15.5
billion at June 30, 2021 and $15.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2020.
Trading liabilities include debt and equity instruments and
derivative liabilities, primarily interest rate and foreign exchange
contracts, not designated as hedging instruments. Trading liabilities
were $6.5 billion at June 30, 2021 and $6.0 billion at Dec. 31,
2020.
Under our fair value methodology for derivative contracts, an
initial “risk-neutral” valuation is performed on each position
assuming time-discounting based on a AA credit curve. In addition,
we consider credit risk in arriving at the fair value of our
derivatives.
We reflect external credit ratings as well as observable credit
default swap spreads for both ourselves and our counterparties
when measuring the fair value of our derivative positions.
Accordingly, the valuation of our derivative positions is sensitive
to the current changes in our own credit spreads, as well as those of
our counterparties.
At June 30, 2021, our OTC derivative assets, including those in
hedging relationships, of $4.8 billion included a credit valuation
adjustment (“CVA”) deduction of $28 million. Our OTC derivative
liabilities, including those in hedging relationships, of $3.3 billion
included a debit valuation adjustment (“DVA”) of $1 million
related to our own credit spread. Net of hedges, the CVA decreased
$1 million and the DVA increased by less than $1 million in the
second quarter of 2021, which increased other trading revenue by
$1 million. The net impact decreased other trading revenue by $1
44 BNY Mellon
million in the first quarter of 2021 and $2 million in the second
quarter of 2020.
The table below summarizes the distribution of credit ratings for
our foreign exchange and interest rate derivative counterparties
over the past five quarters, which indicates the level of
counterparty credit associated with these trading activities.
Significant changes in counterparty credit ratings could alter the
level of credit risk faced by BNY Mellon.

Asset/liability management
Our diversified business activities include processing securities,
accepting deposits, investing in securities, lending, raising money
as needed to fund assets and other transactions. The market risks
from these activities include interest rate risk and foreign exchange
risk. Our primary market risk is exposure to movements in U.S.
dollar interest rates and certain foreign currency interest rates. We
actively manage interest rate sensitivity and use earnings
simulation and discounted cash flow models to identify interest
rate exposures.
An earnings simulation model is the primary tool used to assess
changes in pre-tax net interest revenue. The model incorporates
management’s assumptions regarding interest rates, market
spreads, changes in the prepayment behavior of loans and
securities and the impact of derivative financial instruments used
for interest rate risk management purposes. These assumptions
have been developed through a combination of historical analysis
and future expected pricing behavior and are inherently uncertain.
Actual results may differ materially from projected results due to
timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, and
changes in market conditions and management’s strategies, among
other factors.
In the table below, we use the earnings simulation model to run
various interest rate ramp scenarios from a baseline scenario. The
interest rate ramp scenarios examine the impact of large interest
rate movements. In each scenario, all currencies’ interest rates are
shifted higher or lower. Typically, the baseline scenario uses the
average deposit balances of the last month of the quarter. The 100
basis point ramp scenario assumes rates change 25 basis points
above or below the yield curve in each of the next four quarters
and the 200 basis point ramp scenario assumes a 50 basis point per
quarter change. Interest rate sensitivity is quantified by calculating
the change in pre-tax net interest revenue between the scenarios
over a 12-month measurement period. The net interest revenue
sensitivity methodology assumes static deposit levels and also
assumes that no management actions will be taken to mitigate the
effects of interest rate changes.
The following table shows net interest revenue sensitivity for BNY
Mellon.

(a) In the parallel rate ramp, both short-term and long-term rates move in four
equal quarterly increments.
(b) Long-term is equal to or greater than one year.
The decreases in the ramp up sensitivities compared with March
31, 2021 are primarily driven by a decrease in deposit levels and
the impact of hedging long-term debt.
While the net interest revenue sensitivity scenarios calculations
assume static deposit balances to facilitate consistent period-overperiod comparisons, it is likely that a portion of the recent
monetary policy-driven deposit inflows would run-off in rising rate
environments, such as the up 100 bps and up 200 bps parallel
ramps. Noninterest-bearing deposits are particularly sensitive to
changes in short-term rates.
BNY Mellon 45
To illustrate the net interest revenue sensitivity to deposit runoff,
we note that a $5 billion instantaneous reduction of U.S. dollar
denominated noninterest-bearing deposits would reduce the net
interest revenue sensitivity results in the ramp up 100 basis point
and 200 basis point scenarios in the table above by approximately
$30 million and approximately $65 million, respectively. The
impact would be smaller if
the runoff was assumed to be a mixture of interest-bearing and
noninterest-bearing deposits.
For a discussion of factors impacting the growth or contraction of
deposits, see “Risk Factors – Our business, financial condition and
results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not
effectively manage our liquidity,” in our 2020 Annual Report.

Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP and
Non-GAAP financial measures
BNY Mellon has included in this Form 10-Q certain Non-GAAP
financial measures on a tangible basis as a supplement to GAAP
information, which exclude goodwill and intangible assets, net of
deferred tax liabilities. We believe that the return on tangible
common equity – Non-GAAP is additional useful information for
investors because it presents a measure of those assets that can
generate income, and the tangible book value per common share –
Non-GAAP is additional useful information because it presents the
level of tangible assets in relation to shares of common stock
outstanding.
The presentation of the growth rates of investment management
and performance fees on a constant currency basis permits
investors to assess the significance of changes in foreign currency
exchange
rates. Growth rates on a constant currency basis were determined
by applying the current period foreign currency exchange rates to
the prior period revenue. We believe that this presentation, as a
supplement to GAAP information, gives investors a clearer picture
of the related revenue results without the variability caused by
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
BNY Mellon has also included the adjusted pre-tax operating
margin – Non-GAAP, which is the pre-tax operating margin for the
Investment and Wealth Management business, net of distribution
and servicing expense that was passed to third parties who
distribute or service our managed funds. We believe that this
measure is useful when evaluating the performance of the
Investment and Wealth Management business relative to industry
competitors.

Recent regulatory developments
For a summary of additional regulatory matters relevant to our
operations, see “Recent regulatory developments” in our Form 10-
Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 and “Supervision and
Regulation” in our 2020 Annual Report. The following discussions
summarize certain regulatory, legislative and other developments
that may affect BNY Mellon.
CCAR 2021 Results
On June 24, 2021, the Federal Reserve released the results of its
stress tests for 2021. The Federal Reserve also notified BNY
Mellon that its indicative SCB requirement for the present stress
test cycle will be 2.5%, which equals the regulatory floor. BNY
Mellon expects that its final SCB will be confirmed later in 2021.
The SCB will be effective on Oct. 1, 2021.
The temporary restrictions on dividends and share repurchases
imposed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic ended for BNY
Mellon after June 30, 2021. Starting in the third quarter of 2021,
BNY Mellon will continue to be subject to the normal constraints
under the SCB framework. For additional information regarding
the SCB, see “Supervision and Regulation – Capital Planning and
Stress Testing” in our 2020 Annual Report.
Consistent with the SCB framework, BNY Mellon increased its
quarterly common stock dividend to $0.34 per share in the third
quarter of 2021 and our Board has authorized the repurchase of up
to $6.0 billion of common shares over the six quarters beginning in
the third quarter of 2021 and continuing through the fourth quarter
of 2022. This new share repurchase plan replaces all previously
authorized share repurchase plans.
NSFR Compliance Date
The final NSFR rule became effective on July 1, 2021. Under the
final rule, the NSFR is expressed as a ratio of available stable
funding to the required stable funding amount. BNY Mellon is
required to maintain an NSFR of 1.0 and is in compliance with the
NSFR. NSFR disclosure requirements will be effective in 2023.
EU/UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement
The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (“EU-UK
Agreement”) entered into force and became provisionally effective
on Jan. 1, 2021. The EU-UK Agreement was ratified by the
European Parliament in April 2021 and became fully effective.
Under the EU-UK Agreement, the EU and UK have agreed to
make their best endeavors to ensure that internationally agreed
standards in the financial services sector for regulation and
supervision are implemented and applied in their territory and
establish a framework for structured regulatory cooperation on
financial services. For more information regarding the impact of
Brexit on the UK regulatory framework and related developments,
see “Supervision and Regulation – Effects of ‘Brexit’ on UK
Regulatory Framework” in the 2020 Annual Report.
Financial Services Act 2021 (UK)
The Financial Services Act 2021 (previously the Financial Services
Bill 2020) received royal assent and entered into force in April
2021. The Financial Services Act 2021 makes several changes to
the UK financial services regulatory framework. This includes
providing the framework for implementation of the elements of the
EU Capital Requirements Regulation 2 (“CRR2”) that do not
already form part of EU retained law in the UK, and the framework
for implementation of the EU Investment Firms Directive /
Regulation (“IFD/IFR”) in the UK (modified for the UK
environment as “UK IFPR”).
The Financial Services Act 2021 grants rulemaking powers to the
Prudential Regulatory Authority (“PRA”) with respect to UK
capital requirements directive/regulation matters, and the Financial
Conduct Authority (“FCA”), with respect to UK IFPR matters. The
Financial Services Act 2021 also enables Her Majesty’s Treasury to
set commencement dates for various UK CRR2/UK IFPR
provisions. Pursuant to this authority, Her Majesty’s Treasury has
confirmed that the UK’s version of the CRR2 (“UK CRR2”) and
the UK IFPR will come into effect on Jan. 1, 2022. For more
information regarding the CRR2 and the UK IFPR, see
“Supervision and Regulation – Operations and Regulations Outside
the United States” and “Supervision and Regulation – Effects of
‘Brexit’ on UK Regulatory Framework” in the 2020 Annual
Report.

EU Leverage Ratio
On June 28, 2021, the CRR2 leverage ratio became a binding
requirement for EU credit institutions, such as The Bank of New
York Mellon SA/NV. The European Central Bank (“ECB”) granted
an optional exclusion for central bank deposits from the leverage
ratio calculation that came into effect on the same date and will
expire on March 31, 2022. It replaces the central bank deposits
exclusion granted by the ECB in April 2020 in relation to the
leverage ratio reporting requirements. The Bank of New York
Mellon SA/NV is planning to use the exclusion.
Other matters
On March 5, 2021, the administrator of LIBOR announced that it
would cease the publication of non-U.S. dollar London Interbank
Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) settings and one-week and two-month
U.S. dollar LIBOR settings on Dec. 31, 2021 and would cease the
publication of the other U.S. dollar LIBOR settings on June 30,
2023. On the same day, the UK Financial Conduct Authority
(“FCA”) made a related announcement regarding when LIBOR
settings will cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer
be representative. The International Swaps and Derivatives
Association (“ISDA”) also announced that the FCA’s
announcement was an index cessation event under its fallbacks
protocol for all LIBOR settings and that consequently, the fallback
spread adjustment was fixed as of the date of the announcement.
In April 2021, New York state adopted legislation that provides a
statutory fallback mechanism to replace LIBOR with a benchmark
rate based on SOFR for New York-law governed contracts that
reference U.S. dollar LIBOR and either have no fallback
provisions or provisions that are based on LIBOR. The New York
legislation also has a safe harbor regarding the selection and use of
that SOFR-based benchmark rate.
The U.S. bank regulators have issued guidance strongly
encouraging banking organizations to cease using U.S. dollar
LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts as soon as practicable
and in any event by Dec. 31, 2021. We are continuing to work to
facilitate an orderly transition from interbank offered rates,
including LIBOR, to alternative reference rates for us and our
clients.
