Overview
Established in 1784 by Alexander Hamilton, we were the first
company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: BK).
With a history of more than 235 years, BNY Mellon is a global
company that manages and services assets for financial institutions,
corporations and individual investors in 35 countries.
BNY Mellon has two business segments, Investment Services and
Investment and Wealth Management, which offer a comprehensive
set of capabilities and deep expertise across the investment
lifecycle, enabling the Company to provide solutions to buy-side
and sell-side market participants, as well as leading institutional
and wealth management clients globally.
The diagram below presents our two business segments and lines
of business, with the remaining operations in the Other segment.
Key third quarter 2021 events
Share repurchase program and increase in cash dividend on
common stock
In June 2021, our Board of Directors approved the repurchase of
up to $6.0 billion of common stock starting in the third quarter of
2021 and continuing through the fourth quarter of 2022.
Additionally, in July, our Board of Directors approved a 10%
increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock, from
$0.31 to $0.34 per share. This increased quarterly cash dividend
was paid on Aug. 9, 2021.

Highlights of third quarter 2021 results
Net income applicable to common shareholders was $881 million,
or $1.04 per diluted common share, in the third quarter of 2021.
Net income applicable to common shareholders was $876 million,
or $0.98 per diluted common share, in the third quarter of 2020.
The highlights below are based on the third quarter of 2021
compared with the third quarter of 2020, unless otherwise noted.
• Total revenue of $4.0 billion increased 5%, primarily reflecting:
• Fee and other revenue increased 8%, primarily reflecting:
• Fee revenue increased 6%, primarily reflecting the
positive impact of higher markets, higher client volumes
and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar,
partially offset by higher money market fee waivers.
(See “Fee and other revenue” beginning on page 7.)
• Other revenue increased primarily reflecting strategic
equity investment gains. (See “Fee and other revenue”
beginning on page 7.)
• Net interest revenue decreased 9%, primarily reflecting
lower interest rates on interest-earning assets and the impact
of hedging activities (primarily offset in fee and other
revenue). This was partially offset by the benefit of lower
funding and deposit rates and higher deposit and loan
balances. (See “Net interest revenue” on page 11.)
• Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $45 million
primarily driven by an improvement in the macroeconomic
forecast. (See “Consolidated balance sheet review – Allowance
for credit losses” beginning on page 29.)
• Noninterest expense increased 9%, 3% of which was due to
higher litigation reserves. The remainder of the increase
primarily reflects higher revenue-related expenses, investments
in growth,
infrastructure and efficiency initiatives and the unfavorable
impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. (See “Noninterest expense” on
page 14.)
• Effective tax rate of 18.8%. (See “Income taxes” on page 14.)
Capital and liquidity
• CET1 ratio was 11.7% at Sept. 30, 2021, compared with 12.6%
at June 30, 2021. The decrease primarily reflects capital
deployed through common stock repurchases and dividends,
partially offset by capital generated through earnings. (See
“Capital” beginning on page 36.)
• Tier 1 leverage was 5.7% at Sept. 30, 2021, compared with
6.0% at June 30, 2021. The decrease reflects lower Tier 1
common equity driven by common share repurchases, partially
offset by lower average assets. (See “Capital” beginning on
page 36.)
• Repurchased 38.1 million common shares for $2.0 billion.
Highlights of our principal businesses
Investment Services
• Total revenue increased 3%.
• Income before income taxes decreased 9%.
• AUC/A of $45.3 trillion increased 17%, primarily reflecting
higher market values, client inflows and net new business.
Investment and Wealth Management
• Total revenue increased 12%.
• Income before income taxes increased 42%.
• AUM of $2.3 trillion increased 13%, primarily reflecting higher
market values, net inflows and the favorable impact of a weaker
U.S. dollar.

Impact of coronavirus pandemic on our business
See “Impact of coronavirus pandemic on our business” in our 2020
Annual Report for the areas of our business that have been
impacted and could continue to be impacted by the coronavirus
pandemic and its effect on the global macroeconomic environment.
The following updates those disclosures.
Short-term interest rates have remained low through the first nine
months of 2021, which resulted in lower net interest revenue and
continued money market fee waivers. This has been partially offset
by higher average deposit balances and higher money market
balances compared with 2020.
Equity market levels have continued to improve in the first nine
months of 2021, resulting in increased asset-based fees in
Investment Services and Investment and Wealth Management.
The macroeconomic outlook continued to improve through the first
three quarters of 2021, resulting in decreases in the allowance for
credit losses and benefits to the provision for credit losses.
The restrictions on common stock dividends and share repurchases
ended on June 30, 2021. In the third quarter of 2021, BNY Mellon
increased the
quarterly cash dividend on common stock, from $0.31 to $0.34 per
share, and repurchased 38.1 million common shares at an average
price of $52.55 per common share for a total of $2.0 billion.
It is difficult to forecast the impact of the coronavirus, together
with related public health measures, on our results with certainty
because so much depends on how the health crisis evolves and its
impact on the global economy, as well as actions taken by central
banks and governments to support the economy and the
availability, use and effectiveness of vaccines.
The current macroeconomic environment has also resulted in
responses by governmental and regulatory bodies. See
“Supervision and Regulation – Pandemic-Related Measures” in our
2020 Annual Report for additional information on legislative and
regulatory developments in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
For further discussion of the current and potential impact of the
coronavirus pandemic, see “Risk Factors – The coronavirus
pandemic is adversely affecting us and creates significant risks and
uncertainties for our business, and the ultimate impact of the
pandemic on us will depend on future developments, which are
highly uncertain and cannot be predicted,” in our 2020 Annual
Report.

N/M – Not meaningful.
Fee revenue increased 6% compared with the third quarter of 2020
and 1% compared with the second quarter of 2021. The increase
compared with the third quarter of 2020 primarily reflects higher
investment management and performance fees, asset servicing
fees, clearing services fees and foreign exchange revenue, partially
offset by higher money market fee waivers. The increase compared
with the second quarter of 2021 primarily reflects higher asset
servicing fees, investment management and performance fees and
lower money market fee waivers, partially offset by lower clearing
services fees. Excluding money market fee waivers, fee revenue
increased 11% (Non-GAAP). See “Supplemental information –
Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures”
beginning on page 45 for the reconciliation of Non-GAAP
measures.
Other revenue increased $59 million compared with the third
quarter of 2020 and $38 million compared with the second quarter
of 2021. Both increases primarily reflect strategic equity
investment gains.
Money market fee waivers
Given the continued low short-term interest rates, money market
mutual fund fees and other similar fees are being waived to protect
investors from negative returns. The fee waivers have primarily
impacted fee revenues in Pershing and Investment Management,
but also resulted in lower distribution and servicing expense. The
fee waivers also began to impact fee revenues in our other
businesses in the second half of 2020. Money market fee waivers
are highly sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates and are
difficult to predict. Assuming no change in money market
BNY Mellon 7
balances, we expect to recover over 50% of the pre-tax income
related to fee waivers with a 25 basis point increase in the Fed
Funds rate and we expect to recover nearly 100% of the pre-tax
income related to fee waivers when the Fed Funds rate increases
100 basis points.
The following table presents the impact of money market fee
waivers on our consolidated fee revenue, net of distribution and
servicing expense. In the third quarter of 2021, the net impact of
money market fee waivers was $233 million, down from $252
million in the second quarter of 2021, driven by slightly higher
short-term interest rates.

We expect the impact from money market fee waivers, net of
distribution and servicing expense, for the fourth quarter of 2021 to
approximate the third quarter of 2021, based on implied forward
rates and money market balances as of the end of the third quarter
of 2021. Fee waivers in subsequent periods will continue to be
dependent on short-term interest rates and the level of money
market balances.
Investment services fees
Investment services fees increased 4% compared with the third
quarter of 2020 and 1% compared with the second quarter of 2021,
reflecting the following:
• Asset servicing fees increased 5% compared with the third
quarter of 2020 and 2% compared with the second quarter of
2021. The increase compared with the third quarter of 2020
primarily reflects higher market values and higher client
activity, partially offset by higher money market fee waivers.
The increase compared with the second quarter of 2021
primarily reflects higher market values and client activity.
• Clearing services fees increased 7% compared with the third
quarter of 2020 and decreased 3% compared with the second
quarter of 2021. The increase compared with the third quarter
of 2020 primarily reflects higher market values, client activity
and balances, partially offset by higher money market fee
waivers. The decrease compared with the second quarter of
2021 reflects lower clearance volumes, partially offset by
higher market values.
• Issuer services fees decreased 5% compared with the third
quarter of 2020 and were essentially unchanged compared with
the second quarter of 2021. The decrease compared with the
third quarter of 2020 primarily reflects higher money market
fee waivers and lower Corporate Trust revenue, partially offset
by higher Depositary Receipts revenue. Compared with the
second quarter of 2021, lower Corporate Trust revenue was
offset by seasonally higher Depositary Receipts revenue.
8 BNY Mellon
• Treasury services fees increased 9% compared with the third
quarter of 2020 and 3% compared with the second quarter of
2021. Both increases primarily reflect higher payment
volumes.
See “Investment Services business” in “Review of businesses” for
additional details.
Investment management and performance fees
Investment management and performance fees increased 9%
compared with the third quarter of 2020 and 3% compared with the
second quarter of 2021. The increase compared with the third
quarter of 2020 primarily reflects higher market values and equity
income, the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar and higher
performance fees, partially offset by higher money market fee
waivers. The increase compared with the second quarter of 2021
primarily reflects higher market values and performance fees and
lower money market fee waivers. Performance fees were $21
million in the third quarter of 2021, $7 million in the third quarter
of 2020 and $14 million in the second quarter of 2021. On a
constant currency basis (Non-GAAP), investment management and
performance fees increased 7% compared with the third quarter of
2020. See “Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP and
Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on page 45 for the
reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures.
AUM was $2.3 trillion at Sept. 30, 2021, an increase of 13%
compared with Sept. 30, 2020, primarily reflecting higher market
values, net inflows and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S.
dollar.
See “Investment and Wealth Management business” in “Review of
businesses” for additional details regarding the drivers of
investment management and performance fees, AUM and AUM
flows.
Foreign exchange revenue
Foreign exchange revenue is primarily driven by the volume of
client transactions and the spread realized
on these transactions, both of which are impacted by market
volatility, the impact of foreign currency hedging activities and
foreign currency remeasurement gain (loss). Foreign exchange
revenue increased 24% compared with the third quarter of 2020
and 1% compared with the second quarter of 2021. The increase
compared with the third quarter of 2020 primarily reflects higher
volumes. Foreign exchange revenue is primarily reported in the
Investment Services business and, to a lesser extent, the Investment
and Wealth Management business and the Other segment.
Investment and other income
Investment and other income includes income or loss from
consolidated investment management funds, seed capital gains or
losses, other trading revenue or loss, renewable energy investments
losses, income from corporate and bank-owned life insurance
contracts, other investment gains or losses, gains or losses from
disposals, expense reimbursements from our CIBC Mellon joint
venture and other income or loss. The income or loss from
consolidated investment management funds should be considered
together with the net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling
interests, which reflects the portion of the consolidated funds for
which we do not have an economic interest and is reflected below
net income as a separate line item on the consolidated income
statement. Other trading revenue or loss primarily includes the
impact of market-risk hedging activity related to our seed capital
investments in investment management funds, non-foreign
currency derivative and fixed income trading, and other hedging
activity. Investments in renewable energy generate losses in other
income that are more than offset by benefits and credits recorded to
the provision for income taxes. Other investment gains or losses
includes fair value changes of non-readily marketable equity
securities, private equity and other investments. Expense
reimbursements from our CIBC Mellon joint venture relate to
expenses incurred by BNY Mellon on behalf of the CIBC Mellon
joint venture. Other income or loss includes various miscellaneous
revenues.

Investment and other income was $127 million in the third quarter
of 2021 compared with $61 million in the third quarter of 2020 and
$89 million in the second quarter of 2021. The increases compared
with the third quarter of 2020 and second quarter of 2021 primarily
reflect strategic equity investment gains.
Year-to-date 2021 compared with year-to-date 2020
Fee revenue increased 4% compared with the first nine months of
2020, primarily reflecting higher investment management and
performance fees and asset servicing fees. The 8% increase in
investment management and performance fees primarily reflects
higher market values and the favorable impact of a
weaker U.S. dollar, partially offset by higher money market fee
waivers. The 3% increase in asset servicing fees primarily reflects
higher market values, client activity and the favorable impact of a
weaker U.S. dollar, partially offset by higher money market fee
waivers.
The decrease in other revenue primarily reflects one-time fees in
the Asset Servicing and Pershing businesses in the first nine
months of 2020, an impairment related to a renewable energy
investment recorded in the first quarter of 2021 and lower fixed
income trading results, partially offset by strategic equity
investment and disposal gains.

income.
N/M – Not meaningful.
bps – basis points.
Net interest revenue decreased 9% compared with the third quarter
of 2020 and 1% compared with the second quarter of 2021. The
decrease compared with the third quarter of 2020 primarily reflects
lower interest rates on interest-earning assets and the impact of
hedging activities (primarily offset in fee and other revenue). This
was partially offset by the benefit of lower funding and deposit
rates and higher deposit and loan balances. The decrease compared
with the second quarter of 2021 primarily reflects a decline in
interest-earning assets driven by lower deposits.
Net interest margin decreased 12 basis points compared with the
third quarter of 2020 and was unchanged compared with the
second quarter of 2021. The decrease compared with the third
quarter of 2020 primarily reflects the factors mentioned above.
Average interest-earning assets increased 7% compared with the
third quarter of 2020 and decreased 2% compared with the second
quarter of 2021. The increase compared with the third quarter of
2020 primarily reflects higher interest-bearing deposits with the
Federal Reserve and other central banks and margin loan balances.
The decrease compared with the second quarter of 2021 primarily
reflects lower interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve
and other central banks.
Average non-U.S. dollar deposits comprised approximately 25% of
our average total deposits in the third quarter of 2021.
Approximately 40% of the average non-U.S. dollar deposits in the
third quarter of 2021 were euro denominated.
Net interest revenue in future periods will depend on the level and
mix of client deposits and deposit rates, as well as the level and
shape of the yield curve, which may result in lower yields on
interest-earning assets.
Due to lower interest rates, net interest revenue has been trending
lower and we expect net interest revenue to decrease in 2021
compared with 2020.
Year-to-date 2021 compared with year-to-date 2020
Net interest revenue decreased 15% compared with the first nine
months of 2020, primarily driven by lower interest rates on
interest-earning assets, partially offset by the benefit of lower
funding and deposit rates, a larger securities portfolio, higher
deposit balances and lower debt balances. The decrease in the net
interest margin primarily reflects the factors mentioned above.
Average interest-earning assets increased 12% compared with the
first nine months of 2020. The increase primarily reflects higher
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central
banks, a larger securities portfolio and higher loan balances.

(a) Includes the average impact of of setting under enforceable netting agreements of approximately $47 billion for the third quarter of 2021, $41 billion for the second quarter of 2021 and $43
billion for the third quarter of 2020. On a Non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of of setting, the yield on federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements would have been
0.17% for the third quarter of 2021, 0.15% for the second quarter of 2021 and 0.26% for the third quarter of 2020. On a Non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of of setting, the rate on federal
funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements would have been 0.02% for the third quarter of 2021, (0.04)% for the second quarter of 2021 and 0.04% for the third quarter
of 2020. We believe providing the rates excluding the impact of netting is useful to investors as it is more reflective of the actual rates earned and paid.
(b) In the second quarter of 2021, we reclassified the impact of hedging within the categories comprising total investment securities to align the impact of hedging with the securities being hedged
and reclassified prior periods to be comparable. The change reduced the income and average rates previously reported for U.S. government obligations and U.S. government agency obligations
and increased the income and average rates for Other securities.

Full-time employees at period end 48,900 48,800 48,600 — % 1 % 48,900 48,600 1 %
Total noninterest expense increased 9% compared with the third
quarter of 2020 and 5% compared with the second quarter of 2021.
The increase compared with the third quarter of 2020 primarily
reflects higher revenue-related expenses and litigation reserves,
investments in growth, infrastructure and efficiency initiatives and
the unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. The investments in
growth, infrastructure and efficiency initiatives are primarily
included in staff, software and equipment, and professional, legal
and other purchased services expenses. The increase compared
with the second quarter of 2021 primarily reflects higher litigation
reserves, investments in growth, infrastructure and efficiency
initiatives and higher revenue-related expenses.
We expect total reported noninterest expense to increase
approximately 4% for the full-year 2021 compared to 2020. This is
driven by an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates,
incremental investments in growth, infrastructure and efficiency
opportunities and higher volume- and revenue-related expenses,
partially offset by the 1% year-over-year impact of notable items.
Notable items include increased litigation reserves in both years
and in 2020 also included severance and real estate charges.
Noninterest expense could be impacted if foreign exchange rates
change from Sept. 30, 2021 levels, volume- and revenue-related
expenses increase or there are unexpected charges or expenses.
Year-to-date 2021 compared with year-to-date 2020
Noninterest expense increased 6% compared with the first nine
months of 2020, primarily reflecting investments in growth,
infrastructure and efficiency initiatives, the unfavorable impact of a
weaker U.S. dollar and higher revenue-related expenses and
litigation reserves.
Income taxes
BNY Mellon recorded an income tax provision of $219 million
(18.8% effective tax rate) in the third quarter of 2021, $213 million
(18.4% effective tax rate) in the third quarter of 2020 and $241
million (19.0% effective tax rate) in the second quarter of 2021.

Review of businesses
We have an internal information system that produces performance
data along product and service lines for our two principal
businesses, Investment Services and Investment and Wealth
Management, and the Other segment.
Business accounting principles
Our business data has been determined on an internal management
basis of accounting, rather than the generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”) used for consolidated financial reporting.
These measurement principles are designed so that reported results
of the businesses will track their economic performance.
For information on the accounting principles of our businesses, see
Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For
information on the primary products and services in each line of
business, the primary types of revenue by business and how our
businesses are presented and analyzed, see Note 24 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2020 Annual Report.
Business results are subject to reclassification when organizational
changes are made, or for refinements in revenue and expense
allocation methodologies. Refinements are typically reflected on a
prospective basis. There were no reclassification or organizational
changes in the third quarter of 2021.
The results of our businesses may be influenced by client and other
activities that vary by quarter. In the first quarter, staff expense
typically increases reflecting the vesting of long-term stock awards
for retirement-eligible employees. In the third quarter, Depositary
Receipts revenue is typically higher due to an increased level of
client dividend payments. Also in the third quarter, volume-related
fees may decline
due to reduced client activity, and staff expense typically increases
reflecting the annual employee merit increase. In the fourth quarter,
we typically incur higher business development and marketing
expenses; however, 2020 was an exception given the impact of the
coronavirus pandemic. In our Investment and Wealth Management
business, performance fees are typically higher in the fourth and
first quarters, as those quarters represent the end of the
measurement period for many of the performance fee-eligible
relationships.
The results of our businesses may also be impacted by the
translation of financial results denominated in foreign currencies to
the U.S. dollar. We are primarily impacted by activities
denominated in the British pound and the euro. On a consolidated
basis and in our Investment Services business, we typically have
more foreign currency-denominated expenses than revenues.
However, our Investment and Wealth Management business
typically has more foreign currency-denominated revenues than
expenses. Overall, currency fluctuations impact the year-over-year
growth rate in the Investment and Wealth Management business
more than the Investment Services business. However, currency
fluctuations, in isolation, are not expected to significantly impact
net income on a consolidated basis.
Fee revenue in Investment and Wealth Management, and to a lesser
extent in Investment Services, is impacted by the value of market
indices. At Sept. 30, 2021, we estimated that a 5% change in global
equity markets, spread evenly throughout the year, would impact
fee revenue by less than 1% and diluted earnings per common
share by $0.04 to $0.07.
See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
the consolidating schedules which show the contribution of our
businesses to our overall profitability.

Review of financial results
AUC/A of $45.3 trillion increased 17% compared with Sept. 30,
2020, primarily reflecting higher market values, client inflows and
net new business. AUC/A consisted of 37% equity securities and
63% fixed-income securities at Sept. 30, 2021 and 34% equity
securities and 66% fixed-income securities at Sept. 30, 2020.
Total revenue of $3.0 billion increased 3% compared with the third
quarter of 2020 and 1% compared with the second quarter of 2021.
The drivers of total revenue by line of business are indicated
below.
Asset Servicing revenue of $1.4 billion increased 6% compared
with the third quarter of 2020 and 4% compared with the second
quarter of 2021. The increase compared with the third quarter of
2020 primarily reflects higher market values, strategic equity
investment gains, higher client activity and foreign exchange
revenue, partially offset by higher money market fee waivers and
lower net interest revenue. The increase compared with the second
quarter of 2021 primarily reflects strategic equity investment gains
and higher market levels and client activity.
Pershing revenue of $566 million increased 5% compared with the
third quarter of 2020 and decreased 4% compared with the second
quarter of 2021. The increase compared with the third quarter of
2020 primarily reflects higher market values, client balances and
activity, partially offset by higher money market fee waivers. The
decrease compared with the second quarter of 2021 reflects lower
clearance volumes and net interest revenue, partially offset by
higher market values.
Issuer Services revenue of $400 million decreased 8% compared
with the third quarter of 2020 and 1% compared with the second
quarter of 2021. The decrease compared with the third quarter of
2020 primarily reflects higher money market fee waivers and lower
fees and net interest revenue in Corporate Trust, partially offset by
higher Depositary Receipts revenue. The decrease compared with
the second quarter of 2021 primarily reflects lower fees and net
interest revenue in Corporate Trust, partially offset by seasonally
higher Depositary Receipts revenue.
Treasury Services revenue of $326 million increased 1% compared
with the third quarter of 2020 and 2% compared with the second
quarter of 2021. The increase compared with the third quarter of
2020 primarily reflects higher payment volumes and higher net
interest revenue driven by higher deposit balances, partially offset
by higher money market fee waivers. The increase compared with
the second quarter of 2021 primarily reflects higher net interest
revenue and payment volumes.
Clearance and Collateral Management revenue of $281 million
increased 1% compared with the third quarter of 2020 and
decreased 1% compared with the second quarter of 2021. The
increase compared with the third quarter of 2020 primarily reflects
higher non-U.S. collateral management fees driven by balances and
higher clearance volumes, partially offset by lower intraday credit
fees and net interest revenue.
Market and regulatory trends are driving investable assets toward
lower fee asset management products at reduced margins for our
clients. These dynamics are also negatively impacting our
investment services fees. However, at the same time, these trends
are providing additional outsourcing opportunities as clients and
other market participants seek to comply with regulations and
reduce their operating costs.
Noninterest expense of $2.2 billion increased 9% compared with
the third quarter of 2020 and 8% compared with the second quarter
of 2021. Both increases primarily reflect higher litigation reserves,
higher revenue-related expenses and investments in growth,
infrastructure and efficiency initiatives.
18 BNY Mellon
Year-to-date 2021 compared with year-to-date 2020
Total revenue of $9.0 billion decreased 3% compared with the first
nine months of 2020. Asset Servicing revenue of $4.2 billion
decreased 2%, primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue and
higher money market fee waivers, partially offset by higher market
values and client activity. Pershing revenue of $1.8 billion
decreased slightly, primarily reflecting higher money market fee
waivers and lower clearance volumes, partially offset by higher
market values and client balances and activity. Issuer Services
revenue of $1.2 billion decreased 9%, primarily reflecting lower
interest rates and higher money market fee waivers in Corporate
Trust. Treasury Services
revenue of $962 million decreased 4%, primarily reflecting lower
interest rates and higher money market fee waivers, partially offset
by higher payment volumes and deposits. Clearance and Collateral
Management revenue of $845 million decreased 3%, primarily
reflecting lower net interest revenue, lower intra-day credit fees
and clearance volumes.
Noninterest expense of $6.4 billion increased 6% compared with
the first nine months of 2020 primarily reflecting investments in
growth, infrastructure and efficiency initiatives, higher litigation
reserves and revenue-related expenses and the unfavorable impact
of a weaker U.S. dollar.

Business description
Our Investment and Wealth Management business consists of two
distinct lines of business, Investment Management and Wealth
Management. Our investment firms deliver a highly diversified
portfolio of investment strategies independently, and through our
global distribution network, to institutional and retail clients
globally. BNY Mellon Wealth Management provides investment
management, custody, wealth and estate planning, private banking
services, investment servicing and information management. See
pages 19 and 20 of our 2020 Annual Report for additional
information on our Investment and Wealth Management business.
Review of financial results
AUM increased 13% compared with Sept. 30, 2020 primarily
reflecting higher market values, net inflows and the favorable
impact of a weaker U.S. dollar.
Net long-term strategy inflows were $7 billion in the third quarter
of 2021, driven by liability-driven investments, partially offset by
equity funds. Short-term strategy inflows were $7 billion in the
third quarter of 2021. Market and regulatory trends have resulted in
increased demand for lower fee asset management products and for
performance-based fees.
Total revenue of $1.0 billion increased 12% compared with the
third quarter of 2020 and 3% compared with the second quarter of
2021.
Investment Management revenue of $727 million increased 13%
compared with the third quarter of 2020 and 4% compared with the
second quarter of 2021. The increase compared with the third
quarter of 2020 primarily reflects higher market values and equity
income, strategic equity investment gains, the favorable impact of
a weaker U.S. dollar and higher performance fees, partially offset
by money market fee waivers. The increase compared with the
second quarter of 2021 primarily reflects higher market
20 BNY Mellon
values, lower money market fee waivers and higher performance
fees.
Wealth Management revenue of $305 million increased 10%
compared with the third quarter of 2020 and 2% compared with the
second quarter of 2021. Both increases primarily reflect higher
market values.
Revenue generated in the Investment and Wealth Management
business included 38% from non-U.S. sources in the third quarter
of 2021, compared with 41% in the third quarter of 2020 and 38%
in the second quarter of 2021.
Noninterest expense of $691 million increased 5% compared with
the third quarter of 2020 and 2% compared with the second quarter
of 2021. Both increases primarily reflect higher revenue-related
expenses and investments in growth initiatives. The increase
compared with the third quarter of 2020 also reflects the
unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S.
dollar, partially offset by lower distribution and servicing expense.
Year-to-date 2021 compared with year-to-date 2020
Total revenue of $3.0 billion increased 12% compared with the
first nine months of 2020. Investment Management revenue of $2.1
billion increased 13% primarily reflecting higher market values,
the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar, higher equity income
and seed capital gains, partially offset by higher money market fee
waivers. Wealth Management revenue of $897 million increased
9%, primarily reflecting higher market values.
Noninterest expense of $2.1 billion increased 3% compared with
the first nine months of 2020, primarily reflecting higher revenuerelated expenses, investments in growth initiatives and the
unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar, partially offset by
lower distribution and servicing expense.

See page 21 of our 2020 Annual Report for additional information
on the Other segment.
Review of financial results
Total revenue includes corporate treasury and other investment
activity, including hedging activity which has an offsetting impact
between fee and other revenue and net interest expense.
Total revenue increased $2 million compared with the third quarter
of 2020 and increased $20 million
compared with the second quarter of 2021. The increase compared
with the second quarter of 2021 primarily reflects investment and
disposal gains.
Noninterest expense increased $16 million compared with the third
quarter of 2020 and decreased $33 million compared with the
second quarter of 2021. The increase compared with the third
quarter of 2020 primarily reflects higher staff expense. The
decrease compared with the second quarter of 2021 primarily
reflects lower staff expense and professional, legal and other
purchased services.
BNY Mellon 21
Year-to-date 2021 compared with year-to-date 2020
(Loss) before income taxes increased $86 million compared with
the first nine months of 2020. Total fee and other revenue
decreased $58 million, primarily reflecting an impairment of a
renewable energy investment recorded in the first quarter of 2021
and lower net securities gains. Noninterest expense increased $37
million compared with the first nine months of 2020, primarily
reflecting higher staff expense.
Critical accounting estimates
Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2020 Annual
Report. Our critical accounting estimates are those related to the
allowance for credit losses, fair value of financial instruments and
derivatives, goodwill and other intangibles and litigation and
regulatory contingencies, as referenced below.

contingencies

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Consolidated balance sheet review
One of our key risk management objectives is to maintain a
balance sheet that remains strong throughout market cycles to meet
the expectations of our major stakeholders, including our
shareholders, clients, creditors and regulators.
We also seek to undertake overall liquidity risk, including intraday
liquidity risk, that stays within our risk appetite. The objective of
our balance sheet management strategy is to maintain a balance
sheet that is characterized by strong liquidity and asset quality,
ready access to external funding sources at competitive rates and a
strong capital structure that supports our risk-taking activities and
is adequate to absorb potential losses. In managing the balance
sheet, appropriate consideration is given to balancing the
competing needs of maintaining sufficient levels of liquidity and
complying with applicable regulations and supervisory
expectations while optimizing profitability.
At Sept. 30, 2021, total assets were $471 billion, compared with
$470 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The increase in total assets was
primarily driven by higher loans and other assets, partially offset
by lower interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and
other central banks. Deposits totaled $343 billion at Sept. 30, 2021,
compared with $342 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The increase reflects
higher noninterest-bearing deposits (principally U.S. offices),
partially offset by lower interest-bearing deposits in both non-U.S.
and U.S. offices. Total interest-bearing deposits as a percentage of
total interest-earning assets were 60% at Sept. 30, 2021 and 63% at
Dec. 31, 2020.
At Sept. 30, 2021, available funds totaled $182 billion, which
include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits with the
Federal Reserve and other central banks, interest-bearing deposits
with banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements. This compares with available funds of $196
billion at Dec. 31, 2020. Total available funds as a percentage of
total assets were 39% at Sept. 30, 2021 and 42% at Dec. 31, 2020.
For additional information on our available funds, see “Liquidity
and dividends.”
Securities were $157 billion, or 33% of total assets, at Sept. 30,
2021, compared with $156 billion, or 33% of total assets, at Dec.
31, 2020. The increase primarily reflects investments in U.S.
Treasury securities and agency commercial mortgage-backed
securities (“MBS”), partially offset by decreases in agency
residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) and unrealized
pre-tax gains. For additional information on our securities
portfolio, see “Securities” and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Loans were $64 billion, or 14% of total assets, at Sept. 30, 2021,
compared with $56 billion, or 12% of total assets, at Dec. 31, 2020.
The increase was primarily driven by higher margin loans,
overdrafts and wealth management loans and mortgages exposure,
partially offset by lower financial institutions exposure. For
additional information on our loan portfolio, see “Loans” and Note
4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
22 BNY Mellon
Long-term debt totaled $25 billion at Sept. 30, 2021 and $26
billion at Dec. 31, 2020. Redemptions and maturities and a
decrease in the fair value of hedged long-term debt were partially
offset by issuances. For additional information on long-term debt,
see “Liquidity and dividends.”
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total shareholders’
equity decreased to $44 billion at Sept. 30, 2021 from $46 billion
at Dec. 31, 2020. For additional information, see “Capital.”
Country risk exposure
The following table presents BNY Mellon’s top 10 exposures by
country (excluding the U.S.) as of Sept.
30, 2021, as well as certain countries with higher risk profiles, and
is presented on an internal risk management basis. We monitor our
exposure to these and other countries as part of our internal country
risk management process.
The country risk exposure below reflects the Company’s risk to an
immediate default of the counterparty or obligor based on the
country of residence of the entity which incurs the liability. If there
is credit risk mitigation, the country of residence of the entity
providing the risk mitigation is the country of risk. The country of
risk for securities is generally based on the domicile of the issuer of
the security.

(c) Other exposures include over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivative and securities financing transactions, net of collateral.
(d) The top 10 country exposures comprise approximately 75% of our total non-U.S. exposure.
Events in recent years have resulted in increased focus on Italy and
Brazil. The country risk exposure to Italy primarily consists of
investment grade sovereign debt. The country risk exposure to
Brazil is primarily short-term trade finance loans extended to large
financial institutions. We also have operations in Brazil providing
investment services and investment management services.
Securities
In the discussion of our securities portfolio, we have included
certain credit ratings information because the information can
indicate the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed.
Significant changes in ratings classifications could indicate
increased credit risk for us and could be accompanied by an
increase in the allowance for credit losses and/or a reduction in the
fair value of our securities portfolio.

(i) Includes unrealized gains of $927 million at Sept. 30, 2021 related to available-for-sale securities, net of hedges, and $441 million related to held-to-maturity securities.
The fair value of our securities portfolio, including related hedges,
was $157.0 billion at Sept. 30, 2021, compared with $156.3 billion
at Dec. 31, 2020. The increase primarily reflects investments in
U.S. Treasury securities and agency commercial MBS, partially
offset by decreases in agency RMBS and unrealized pre-tax gains.
At Sept. 30, 2021, the securities portfolio had a net unrealized gain,
including the impact of related hedges, of $1.4 billion, compared
with $3.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The decrease in the net
unrealized gain, including the impact of hedges, was primarily
driven by higher market interest rates.
The fair value of the available-for-sale securities totaled $100.3
billion at Sept. 30, 2021, net of hedges, or 64% of the securities
portfolio, net of hedges. The fair value of the held-to-maturity
securities totaled $56.7 billion at Sept. 30, 2021, or 36% of the
securities portfolio, net of hedges.
The unrealized gain (after-tax) on our available-for-sale securities
portfolio, net of hedges, included in accumulated other
comprehensive income was $703 million at Sept. 30, 2021,
compared with $1.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The decrease in the
unrealized gain, net of tax, was primarily driven by higher market
interest rates.
At Sept. 30, 2021, 96% of the securities in our portfolio were rated
AAA/AA-, compared with 95% at Dec. 31, 2020.

increased 6% compared with Dec. 31, 2020, primarily reflecting
higher margin loans, overdrafts and wealth management and
mortgages exposure, partially offset by lower financial institutions
exposure.
Our financial institutions and commercial portfolios comprise our
largest concentrated risk. These portfolios comprised 49% of our
total exposure at Sept. 30, 2021 and 55% at Dec. 31, 2020.
Additionally, most of our overdrafts relate to financial institutions.

The financial institutions portfolio exposure was $41.5 billion at
Sept. 30, 2021, a decrease of 6% compared with Dec. 31, 2020,
primarily reflecting lower exposure to the securities industry and
bank portfolios, partially offset by higher exposure to the asset
managers, insurance and other portfolios.
Financial institution exposures are high-quality, with 96% of the
exposures meeting the investment grade equivalent criteria of our
internal credit rating classification at Sept. 30, 2021. Each
customer is assigned an internal credit rating, which is mapped to
an equivalent external rating agency grade based upon a number of
dimensions, which are continually evaluated and may change over
time. For ratings of non-U.S. counterparties, our internal credit
rating is generally capped at a rating equivalent to the sovereign
rating of the country where the counterparty resides, regardless of
the internal credit rating assigned to the counterparty or the
underlying collateral.
The exposure to financial institutions is generally short-term, with
84% of the exposures expiring within one year. At Sept. 30, 2021,
56% of the exposure to financial institutions had an expiration
within 90 days, compared with 18% at Dec. 31, 2020.
Secured intraday credit facilities represent approximately 40% of
the exposure in the financial institutions portfolio and are reviewed
and reapproved annually.
In addition, 68% of the financial institutions exposure is secured.
For example, securities industry clients and asset managers often
borrow against marketable securities held in custody.
At Sept. 30, 2021, the secured intra-day credit provided to dealers
in connection with their tri-party repo activity totaled $17.7 billion
and was included in the securities industry portfolio. Dealers
secure the outstanding intraday credit with high-quality liquid
collateral having a market value in excess of the amount of the
outstanding credit.
The asset managers portfolio exposure is high-quality, with 98% of
the exposures meeting our investment grade equivalent ratings
criteria as of Sept. 30, 2021. These exposures are generally shortterm liquidity facilities, with the majority to regulated mutual
funds.
Our banks exposure primarily relates to our global trade finance.
These exposures are short-term in nature, with 88% due in less
than one year. The investment grade percentage of our banks
exposure was 86% at Sept. 30, 2021 and 85% at Dec. 31, 2020.
Our non-investment grade exposures are primarily trade finance
loans in Brazil.

The commercial portfolio exposure was $13.6 billion at Sept. 30,
2021, a decrease of 4% from Dec. 31, 2020, primarily driven by
lower exposure to the services and other portfolio.
We have $563 million of total direct exposure to the oil and gas
industry at Sept. 30, 2021, most of which is reflected in the energy
and utilities portfolio in the table above. This exposure is to
exploration and production, refining and integrated companies and
was 58% investment grade at Sept. 30, 2021 and 66% at Dec. 31,
2020.

Wealth management loans and mortgages
Our wealth management exposure was $19.3 billion at Sept. 30,
2021, compared with $17.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. Wealth
management loans and mortgages primarily consist of loans to
high-net-worth individuals, which are secured by marketable
securities and/or residential property. Wealth management
mortgages are primarily interest-only, adjustable-rate mortgages
with a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio of 62% at origination.
Less than 1% of the mortgages were past due at Sept. 30, 2021.
At Sept. 30, 2021, the wealth management mortgage portfolio
consisted of the following geographic concentrations: California –
22%; New York – 16%; Florida – 9%; Massachusetts – 9%; and

Our commercial real estate exposure totaled $10.0 billion at Sept.
30, 2021 and $9.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. Our income-producing
commercial real estate facilities are focused on experienced owners
and are structured with moderate leverage based on existing cash
flows. Our commercial real estate lending activities also include
construction and renovation facilities. Our client base consists of
experienced developers and long-term holders of real estate assets.
Loans are approved on the basis of existing or projected cash flows
and supported by appraisals and knowledge of local market
conditions. Development loans are structured with moderate
leverage, and in many instances, involve some level of recourse to
the developer.
At Sept. 30, 2021, the unsecured portfolio consisted of real estate
investment trusts (“REITs”) and real estate operating companies,
which are both primarily investment grade.
At Sept. 30, 2021, our commercial real estate portfolio consisted of
the following concentrations: New York metro – 33%; REITs and
real estate operating companies – 42%; and other – 25%.
Lease financings
The lease financings portfolio exposure totaled $0.8 billion at Sept.
30, 2021 and $1.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. At Sept. 30, 2021,
approximately 98% of leasing exposure was investment grade, or
investment grade equivalent and consisted of exposures backed by
well-diversified assets, primarily real estate and large-ticket
transportation equipment. The largest components of our lease
residual value exposure
relate to aircraft and freight-related rail cars. Assets are both
domestic and foreign-based, with primary concentrations in the
Germany and the U.S.
Other residential mortgages
The other residential mortgages portfolio primarily consists of 1-4
family residential mortgage loans and totaled $317 million at Sept.
30, 2021 and $389 million at Dec. 31, 2020. Included in this
portfolio at Sept. 30, 2021 were $54 million of mortgage loans
purchased in 2005, 2006 and the first quarter of 2007.
Overdrafts
Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities clearance
clients and are generally repaid within two business days.
Other loans
Other loans primarily include loans to consumers that are fully
collateralized with equities, mutual funds and fixed-income
securities.
Margin loans
Margin loan exposure of $20.9 billion at Sept. 30, 2021 and $15.5
billion at Dec. 31, 2020 was collateralized with marketable
securities. Borrowers are required to maintain a daily collateral
margin in excess of 100% of the value of the loan. Margin loans
included $7.1 billion at Sept. 30, 2021 and $4.6 billion at Dec. 31,
2020 related to a term loan program that offers fully collateralized
loans to broker-dealers.
28 BNY Mellon
Allowance for credit losses
Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade clients who are active users of our non-credit services. Our primary exposure to the credit risk
of a customer consists of funded loans, unfunded contractual commitments to lend, standby letters of credit and overdrafts associated with our
custody and securities clearance businesses.
The following table details changes in our allowance for credit losses.

Allowance for loan losses and lending-related commitments as a percentage of non-margin loans 0.63 0.73 1.17 1.10
(a) Includes allowance for credit losses on federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements, available-for-sale securities, held-to-maturity securities,
accounts receivable, cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits with banks.
The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $45 million in the
third quarter of 2021, primarily driven by an improved
macroeconomic forecast.
We had $20.8 billion of secured margin loans on our balance sheet
at Sept. 30, 2021 compared with $15.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. We
have rarely suffered a loss on these types of loans. As a result, we
believe that the ratio of allowance for loan losses and lendingrelated commitments as a percentage of non-margin loans is a more
appropriate metric to measure the adequacy of the reserve.
The allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-related
commitments represent management’s estimate of lifetime
expected losses in our credit portfolio. This evaluation process is
subject to numerous estimates and judgments. To the extent actual
results differ from forecasts or management’s judgment, the
allowance for credit losses may be greater or less than future
charge-offs.
Based on an evaluation of the allowance for credit losses as
discussed in “Critical accounting estimates,” in our 2020 Annual
Report, we have allocated our allowance for loans and lendingrelated commitments as presented below.

(a) Includes the allowance for credit losses on wealth management mortgages.
The allocation of the allowance for credit losses is inherently
judgmental, and the entire allowance for credit losses is available
to absorb credit losses regardless of the nature of the losses.
Our allowance for credit losses is sensitive to a number of inputs,
most notably the credit ratings assigned to each borrower, as well
as macroeconomic forecast assumptions that are incorporated in
our estimate of credit losses through the expected life of the loan
portfolio. Thus, as the macroeconomic environment and related
forecasts change, the allowance for credit losses may change
materially. The following sensitivity analyses do not represent
management’s expectations of the deterioration of our portfolios or
the economic environment, but are provided as hypothetical
scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses
to changes in key inputs. If each credit were rated one grade better,
the quantitative allowance would have decreased by $67 million,
and if each credit were rated one grade worse, the quantitative
allowance would have increased by $125 million. Our multiscenario based macroeconomic forecast used in determining the
Sept. 30, 2021 allowance for credit losses consisted of three
scenarios. The baseline scenario reflects moderate and flat GDP
growth and unemployment recovery and stable commercial real
estate prices through mid-2022 that begin to increase in the second
half of 2022. The upside scenario reflects faster GDP growth and
unemployment recovery and higher commercial real estate prices
compared with the baseline. The downside scenario contemplates
negative GDP growth throughout 2021 and increasing
unemployment through 2022 and lower commercial real estate
prices than the baseline. Consistent with the first and second
quarters of 2021, we placed the most weight on our baseline
scenario,
with the remaining weighting resulting in slightly more weight
placed on the downside scenario than the upside scenario. From a
sensitivity perspective, at Sept. 30, 2021, if we had applied 100%
weighting to the downside scenario, the quantitative allowance for
credit losses would have been approximately $110 million higher.

Nonperforming assets increased $19 million compared with Dec.
31, 2020, reflecting higher commercial real estate loans and others
loans, partially offset by lower other residential mortgages and
wealth management loans and mortgages.
Lost interest
Interest revenue would have increased by $1 million in the third
quarter of 2021, second quarter of 2021 and third quarter of 2020,
$3 million in the first nine months of 2021 and $4 million in the
first nine months of 2020, if nonperforming loans at period-end
had been performing for the entire respective periods.
Loan modifications
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, there have been two forms of
relief provided for classifying loans as troubled debt restructurings
(“TDRs”): The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security
Act
30 BNY Mellon
(the “CARES Act”), the relevant provisions of which were
extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, and the
Interagency Guidance. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements of our 2020 Annual Report for additional
details on this guidance. Financial institutions may account for
eligible loan modifications either under the CARES Act or the
Interagency Guidance and we have elected to apply both, as
applicable, in providing borrowers with loan modification relief in
response to the coronavirus pandemic. We modified loans of $23
million in the third quarter of 2021, $106 million in the third
quarter of 2020 and $3 million in the second quarter of 2021.
Nearly all of the modifications were short-term loan payment
forbearances or modified principal and/or interest payments. These
loans were primarily residential mortgage and commercial real
estate loans. We also modified loans of $56 million in the third
quarter of 2020, a majority of which were commercial real estate
loans, by providing long-term loan payment modifications and an
extension of maturity. We did not identify any of the modifications
as TDRs. There were no long-term loan modifications in the third
quarter of 2021 and second quarter of 2021. At Sept. 30, 2021, the
unpaid principal balance of the loans modified under the CARES
Act or Interagency Guidance was $94 million.
Deposits
Total deposits were $343.1 billion at Sept. 30, 2021, an increase,
compared with $341.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The increase
primarily reflects higher noninterest-bearing deposits (principally
U.S. offices), partially offset by lower interest-bearing deposits in
both non-U.S. and U.S. offices.
Noninterest-bearing deposits were $100.5 billion at Sept. 30, 2021
compared with $83.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. Interest-bearing
deposits were $242.6 billion at Sept. 30, 2021, compared with
$257.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2020.
Short-term borrowings
We fund ourselves primarily through deposits and, to a lesser
extent, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Short-term
borrowings consist of federal
funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements,
payables to customers and broker-dealers, commercial paper and
other borrowed funds. Certain short-term borrowings, for example,
securities sold under repurchase agreements, require the delivery of
securities as collateral.
Information related to federal funds purchased and securities sold
under repurchase agreements is presented below.

2020. On a Non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of offsetting, the
weighted-average rates would have been 0.02% for the third quarter of 2021,
(0.04)% for the second quarter of 2021 and 0.04% for the third quarter of
2020. We believe providing the rates excluding the impact of netting is useful
to investors as it is more reflective of the actual rates paid.

Fluctuations of federal funds purchased and securities sold under
repurchase agreements reflect changes in overnight borrowing
opportunities. The decrease of the weighted-average rates
compared with Sept. 30, 2020 primarily reflects lower interest rates
and repurchase agreement activity with the Fixed Income Clearing
Corporation (the “FICC”), where we record interest expense gross,
but the ending and average balances reflect the impact of offsetting
under enforceable netting agreements. This activity primarily
relates to government securities collateralized resale and
repurchase agreements executed with clients that are novated to
and settle with the FICC.

Sept. 30, 2020 primarily reflects the continuation of elevated
deposit levels.

Other borrowed funds primarily include overdrafts of subcustodian account balances in our Investment Services businesses,
finance lease liabilities and borrowings under lines of credit by our
Pershing subsidiaries. Borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank
of Boston under the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility
(the “MMLF”) program are also included in other borrowed funds
at Sept. 30, 2020. Overdrafts typically relate to timing differences
for settlements. The increase in other borrowed funds compared
with Sept. 30, 2020 and June 30, 2021 primarily reflects higher
overdrafts of sub-custodian account balances in our Investment
Services business and borrowings under lines of credit by our
Pershing subsidiaries. The increase compared to Sept. 30, 2020
was partially offset by lower borrowings from the Federal Reserve
Bank of Boston under the MMLF program.
Liquidity and dividends
BNY Mellon defines liquidity as the ability of the Parent and its
subsidiaries to access funding or convert assets to cash quickly and
efficiently, or to roll over or issue new debt, especially during
periods of market stress, at a reasonable cost, and in order to meet
its short-term (up to one year) obligations. Funding liquidity risk is
the risk that BNY Mellon cannot meet its cash and collateral
obligations at a reasonable cost for both expected and unexpected
cash flow and collateral needs without adversely affecting daily
operations or our financial condition. Funding liquidity risk can
arise from funding mismatches, market constraints from the
inability to convert assets into cash, the inability to hold or raise
cash, low overnight deposits, deposit run-off or contingent liquidity
events.
32 BNY Mellon
Changes in economic conditions or exposure to credit, market,
operational, legal and reputational risks also can affect BNY
Mellon’s liquidity risk profile and are considered in our liquidity
risk framework. For additional information, see “Risk Management
– Liquidity Risk” in our 2020 Annual Report.
The Parent’s policy is to have access to sufficient unencumbered
cash and cash equivalents at each quarter-end to cover maturities
and other forecasted debt redemptions, net interest payments and
net tax payments for the following 18-month period, and to provide
sufficient collateral to satisfy transactions subject to Section 23A of
the Federal Reserve Act. As of Sept. 30, 2021, the Parent was in
compliance with this policy.
We monitor and control liquidity exposures and funding needs
within and across significant legal entities, branches, currencies
and business lines,
taking into account, among other factors, any applicable
restrictions on the transfer of liquidity among entities.
BNY Mellon also manages potential intraday liquidity risks. We
monitor and manage intraday liquidity against existing and
expected intraday liquid resources (such as cash balances,
remaining intraday credit capacity, intraday contingency funding
and available collateral) to enable BNY Mellon to meet its intraday
obligations under normal and reasonably severe stressed
conditions.
We define available funds for internal liquidity management
purposes as cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits
with the Federal Reserve and other central banks, interest-bearing
deposits with banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased
under resale agreements. The following table presents our total
available funds at period end and on an average basis.
Available funds

Total available funds as a percentage of total
assets 39 % 42 % 37 % 38 % 35 % 38 % 35 %
Total available funds were $182.3 billion at Sept. 30, 2021,
compared with $196.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The decrease was
primarily due to lower interest-bearing deposits with the Federal
Reserve and other central banks and federal funds sold and
securities purchased under resale agreements, partially offset by
higher interest-bearing deposits with banks.
Average non-core sources of funds, such as federal funds
purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements, trading
liabilities, other borrowed funds and commercial paper were $16.9
billion for the first nine months of 2021 and $19.7 billion for the
first nine months of 2020. The decrease reflects lower commercial
paper, other borrowed funds and federal funds purchased and
securities sold under repurchase agreements, partially offset by
higher trading liabilities.
Average foreign deposits, primarily from our European-based
Investment Services business, were $112.9 billion for the first nine
months of 2021, compared with $105.0 billion for the first nine
months of 2020. Average interest-bearing domestic deposits were
$126.4 billion for the first nine months of 2021 and $101.6 billion
for the first nine months of 2020. The increase primarily reflects
client activity.
Average payables to customers and broker-dealers were $17.0
billion for the first nine months of 2021 and $17.9 billion for the
first nine months of 2020. Payables to customers and brokerdealers are driven by customer trading activity and market
volatility.
Average long-term debt was $25.7 billion for the first nine months
of 2021 and $27.3 billion for the first nine months of 2020.
BNY Mellon 33
Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased to $84.9 billion for
the first nine months of 2021 from $66.9 billion for the first nine
months of 2020, primarily reflecting client activity.
A significant reduction in our Investment Services business would
reduce our access to deposits. See “Asset/liability management”
for additional factors that could impact our deposit balances.
Sources of liquidity
The Parent’s major sources of liquidity are access to the debt and
equity markets, dividends from its subsidiaries, and cash on hand
and cash otherwise made available in business-as-usual
circumstances to the Parent through a committed credit facility
with our intermediate holding company (“IHC”).
Our ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms, or at
all, is partially dependent on our credit ratings, which are as
follows:
Credit ratings at Sept. 30, 2021
Moody’s S&P Fitch DBRS
Parent:

NR – Not rated.
Long-term debt totaled $25.0 billion at Sept. 30, 2021 and $26.0
billion at Dec. 31, 2020. Redemptions and maturities of $4.3
billion and a decrease in the fair value of hedged long-term debt
were partially offset by issuances of $3.7 billion. The Parent has no
long-term debt maturing in the remainder of 2021.
In October 2021, the Parent issued $700 million of fixed rate senior
notes maturing in 2024 at an annual interest rate of 0.85%, $400
million of floating rate senior notes maturing in 2024 at an annual
interest rate of the compounded secured overnight financing rate
(“SOFR”) plus 20 basis points and $400 million of fixed rate
senior notes maturing in 2029 at an annual interest rate of 1.90%.
The Bank of New York Mellon may issue notes and CDs. At Sept.
30, 2021 and Dec. 31, 2020, $30
million of notes were outstanding. There were no CDs outstanding
at Sept. 30, 2021 and $100 million was outstanding at Dec. 31,
2020.
The Bank of New York Mellon also issues commercial paper that
matures within 397 days from the date of issue and is not
redeemable prior to maturity or subject to voluntary prepayment.
There was no commercial paper outstanding at Sept. 30, 2021 and
Dec. 31, 2020. The average commercial paper outstanding was $4
million for the first nine months of 2021 and $1.4 billion for the
first nine months of 2020.
Subsequent to Sept. 30, 2021, our U.S. bank subsidiaries could
declare dividends to the Parent of approximately $1.5 billion,
without the need for a regulatory waiver. In addition, at Sept. 30,
2021,
34 BNY Mellon
non-bank subsidiaries of the Parent had liquid assets of
approximately $3.9 billion. Restrictions on our ability to obtain
funds from our subsidiaries are discussed in more detail in
“Supervision and Regulation – Capital Planning and Stress Testing
– Payment of Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Other Capital
Distributions” and in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, both in our 2020 Annual Report.
Pershing LLC has uncommitted lines of credit in place for liquidity
purposes which are guaranteed by the Parent. Pershing LLC has
two separate uncommitted lines of credit amounting to $350
million in aggregate. Average borrowings under these lines were $4
million in the third quarter of 2021. Pershing Limited, an indirect
UK-based subsidiary of BNY Mellon, has two separate
uncommitted lines of credit amounting to $266 million in
aggregate. Average borrowings under these lines were $30 million,
in aggregate, in the third quarter of 2021.
The double leverage ratio is the ratio of our equity investment in
subsidiaries divided by our consolidated Parent company equity,
which includes our noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. In
short, the double leverage ratio measures the extent to which equity
in subsidiaries is financed by Parent company debt. As the double
leverage ratio increases, this can reflect greater demands on a
company’s cash flows in order to service interest payments and
debt maturities. BNY Mellon’s double leverage ratio is managed in
a range considering the high level of unencumbered available
liquid assets held in its principal subsidiaries (such as central bank
deposit placements and government securities), the Company’s
cash generating fee-based business model, with fee revenue
representing 81% of total revenue in the third quarter of 2021, and
the dividend capacity of our banking subsidiaries. Our double
leverage ratio was 117.7% at Sept. 30, 2021 and 114.3% at Dec.
31, 2020, and within the range targeted by management.
Uses of funds
The Parent’s major uses of funds are repurchases of common stock,
payment of dividends, principal and interest payments on its
borrowings, acquisitions and additional investments in its
subsidiaries.
In August 2021, a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per common share
was paid to common shareholders. Our common stock dividend
payout ratio was 33% for the third quarter of 2021.
In the third quarter of 2021, we repurchased 38.1 million common
shares at an average price of $52.55 per common share, for a total
cost of $2.0 billion.
Liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”)
U.S. regulators have established an LCR that requires certain
banking organizations, including BNY Mellon, to maintain a
minimum amount of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets
(“HQLA”) sufficient to withstand the net cash outflow under a
hypothetical standardized acute liquidity stress scenario for a 30-
day time horizon.
The following table presents BNY Mellon’s consolidated HQLA at
Sept. 30, 2021, and the average HQLA and average LCR for the
third quarter of 2021.
Consolidated HQLA and LCR Sept. 30, 2021
(dollars in billions)
Securities (a) $ 121
Cash (b) 127
Total consolidated HQLA (c) $ 248
Total consolidated HQLA – average (c) $ 229
Average LCR 111 %
(a) Primarily includes securities of U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, U.S.
Treasury, sovereign securities, U.S. agency and investment-grade corporate
debt.
(b) Primarily includes cash on deposit with central banks.
(c) Consolidated HQLA presented before adjustments. After haircuts and the
impact of trapped liquidity, consolidated HQLA totaled $174 billion at Sept.
30, 2021 and averaged $156 billion for the third quarter of 2021.
BNY Mellon and each of our affected domestic bank subsidiaries
were compliant with the U.S. LCR requirements of at least 100%
throughout the third quarter of 2021.
Statement of cash flows
The following summarizes the activity reflected on the
consolidated statement of cash flows. While this information may
be helpful to highlight certain macro trends and business strategies,
the cash flow analysis may not be as relevant when analyzing
changes in our net earnings and net assets. We believe that in
addition to the traditional cash flow analysis, the
BNY Mellon 35
discussion related to liquidity and dividends and asset/liability
management herein may provide more useful context in evaluating
our liquidity position and related activity.
Net cash used for operating activities was $291 million in the nine
months ended Sept. 30, 2021, compared with net cash provided by
operations of $5.9 billion in the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2020.
In the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2021 cash flows used for
operations primarily resulted from changes in trading assets and
liabilities, partially offset by earnings. In the nine months ended
Sept. 30, 2020, cash flows provided by operations primarily
resulted from earnings and changes in trading assets and liabilities.
Net cash used for investing activities was $259 million in the nine
months ended Sept. 30, 2021, compared with $44.3 billion in the
nine months ended Sept. 30, 2020. In the nine months ended Sept.
30, 2021, net cash used for investing activities primarily reflects
the net change in loans and securities, offset
by changes in interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve
and other central banks. In the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2020,
net cash used for investing activities primarily reflects net changes
in securities and changes in interest-bearing deposits with the
Federal Reserve and other central banks.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $2.2 billion in the
nine months ended Sept. 30, 2021, compared with $38.1 billion in
the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2020. In the nine months ended
Sept. 30, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities primarily
reflects changes in deposits, issuances of long-term debt and
changes in payables to customers and broker-dealers, partially
offset by repayments of long-term debt and common stock
repurchases. In the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2020, net cash
provided by financing activity reflects changes in deposits,
payables to customers and broker-dealers and federal funds
purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements,
partially offset by changes in commercial paper.

36 BNY Mellon
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total shareholders’
equity decreased to $43.6 billion at Sept. 30, 2021 from $45.8
billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The decrease primarily reflects common
stock repurchases, dividend payments and unrealized losses on
securities available-for-sale, partially offset by earnings.
The unrealized gain (after-tax) on our available-for-sale securities
portfolio, net of hedges, included in accumulated other
comprehensive income was $703 million at Sept. 30, 2021,
compared with $1.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The decrease in the
unrealized gain, net of tax, was primarily driven by higher market
interest rates.
In the first nine months of 2021, we repurchased 67.7 million
common shares at an average price of $49.03 per common share
for a total of $3.3 billion.
In December 2020, the Federal Reserve released the results of the
second round of CCAR stress tests during 2020 and extended the
restriction on common stock dividends and open market common
stock repurchases applicable to participating CCAR BHCs,
including us, to the first quarter of 2021, with certain
modifications. In March 2021, the Federal Reserve extended these
restrictions through the second quarter of 2021. The temporary
restrictions on dividends and share repurchases ended for BNY
Mellon after June 30, 2021. After these temporary restrictions were
lifted, BNY Mellon continued to be subject to the stress capital
buffer (“SCB”) framework, which would impose restrictions on
capital distributions on an incremental basis if BNY Mellon’s riskbased capital ratios decline into the buffer zone.
In June 2021, the Federal Reserve released the results of its stress
tests for 2021. Our Board of Directors subsequently authorized the
repurchase of up to $6.0
billion of common shares over the six quarters beginning in the
third quarter of 2021 and continuing through the fourth quarter of
2022. This new share repurchase plan replaced all previously
authorized share repurchase plans.
Capital adequacy
Regulators establish certain levels of capital for BHCs and banks,
including BNY Mellon and our bank subsidiaries, in accordance
with established quantitative measurements. For the Parent to
maintain its status as a financial holding company (“FHC”), our
U.S. bank subsidiaries and BNY Mellon must, among other things,
qualify as “well capitalized.” As of Sept. 30, 2021 and Dec. 31,
2020, BNY Mellon and our U.S. bank subsidiaries were “well
capitalized.” Failure to satisfy regulatory standards, including
“well capitalized” status or capital adequacy rules more generally,
could result in limitations on our activities and adversely affect our
financial condition. See the discussion of these matters in
“Supervision and Regulation – Regulated Entities of BNY Mellon
and Ancillary Regulatory Requirements” and “Risk Factors –
Operational Risk – Failure to satisfy regulatory standards,
including “well capitalized” and “well managed” status or capital
adequacy and liquidity rules more generally, could result in
limitations on our activities and adversely affect our business and
financial condition,” both of which are in our 2020 Annual Report.
The U.S. banking agencies’ capital rules are based on the
framework adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision (“BCBS”), as amended from time to time. For
additional information on these capital requirements, see
“Supervision and Regulation” in our 2020 Annual Report.

(a) Minimum requirements for Sept. 30, 2021 include minimum thresholds plus currently applicable buffers. The U.S. global systemically important banks (“G-SIB”)
surcharge of 1.5% is subject to change. The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set to 0%. The stress capital buffer (“SCB”) requirement is 2.5%, equal to the
regulatory minimum for Standardized Approach capital ratios.
(b) For our CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, our effective capital ratios under U.S. capital rules are the lower of the ratios as calculated under the Standardized
and Advanced Approaches. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is based on Tier 1 capital and quarterly average total assets.
(c) The Federal Reserve’s regulations do not establish well capitalized thresholds for these measures for BHCs.
(d) The SLR is based on Tier 1 capital and total leverage exposure, which includes certain off-balance sheet exposures.
(e) The consolidated SLR at Dec. 31, 2020 reflects the temporary exclusion of U.S. Treasury securities from total leverage exposure which increased our consolidated SLR by
72 basis points. The temporary exclusion ceased to apply beginning April 1, 2021.
Our CET1 ratio under the Standardized Approach was 11.7% at
Sept. 30, 2021 and 13.1% at Dec. 31, 2020 under the Advanced
Approaches. The decrease was primarily driven by common stock
repurchases, dividend payments, unrealized losses on securities
available-for-sale and an increase in RWAs, partially offset by
capital generated through earnings.
Tier 1 leverage was 5.7% at Sept. 30, 2021, compared with 6.0% at
June 30, 2021. The decrease reflects lower Tier 1 common equity
driven by common share repurchases, partially offset by lower
average assets.
Capital ratios vary depending on the size of the balance sheet at
period-end and the levels and types of investments in assets. The
balance sheet size fluctuates from period to period based on levels
of customer and market activity. In general, when servicing clients
are more actively trading securities, deposit balances and the
balance sheet as a whole are higher. In addition, when markets
experience
significant volatility or stress, our balance sheet size may increase
considerably as client deposit levels increase.
Our capital ratios are necessarily subject to, among other things,
anticipated compliance with all necessary enhancements to model
calibration, approval by regulators of certain models used as part of
RWA calculations, other refinements, further implementation
guidance from regulators, market practices and standards and any
changes BNY Mellon may make to its businesses. As a
consequence of these factors, our capital ratios may materially
change, and may be volatile over time and from period to period.
Under the Advanced Approaches, our operational loss risk model is
informed by external losses, including fines and penalties levied
against institutions in the financial services industry, particularly
those that relate to businesses in which we operate, and as a
38 BNY Mellon
result external losses have impacted and could in the future impact
the amount of capital that we are required to hold.

From April 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, BHCs were permitted
to temporarily exclude U.S. Treasury securities from total leverage
exposure used in the SLR calculation. This temporary exclusion
increased our consolidated SLR by 72 basis points at Dec. 31,
2020. The temporary exclusion also impacted the TLAC and LTD
calculations. BNY Mellon and The Bank of New York Mellon, as
custody banks, will continue to be able to exclude certain central
bank placements from the total leverage exposure used in the SLR
calculation, consistent with the amendments to the SLR finalized
by the U.S. banking agencies in 2019 pursuant to the Economic
Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act.
Stress capital buf er
In August 2021, the Federal Reserve announced that BNY
Mellon’s SCB requirement would be 2.5%, equal to the regulatory
floor, effective as of Oct. 1, 2021. The SCB replaced the static
2.5% capital conservation buffer for Standardized Approach capital
ratios for CCAR BHCs. The SCB does not apply to bank
subsidiaries, which remain subject to the static 2.5% capital
conservation buffer. See “Recent regulatory developments” for
additional information on the SCB.
The SCB final rule generally eliminates the requirement for prior
approval of common stock repurchases in excess of the
distributions in a firm’s capital plan, provided that such
distributions are consistent with applicable capital requirements
and buffers, including the SCB.
Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (“TLAC”)
The final TLAC rule establishing external TLAC, external longterm debt (“LTD”) and related requirements for U.S. G-SIBs,
including BNY Mellon, at the top-tier holding company level
became effective on Jan. 1, 2019. The following summarizes the
minimum requirements for BNY Mellon’s external TLAC and

(b) Buffer to be met using only CET1.
(c) Buffer to be met using only Tier 1 capital.
External TLAC consists of the Parent’s Tier 1 capital and eligible
unsecured LTD issued by it that has a remaining term to maturity
of at least one year and satisfies certain other conditions. Eligible
LTD consists of the unpaid principal balance of eligible unsecured
debt securities, subject to haircuts for amounts due to be paid
within two years, that satisfy certain other conditions. Debt issued
prior to Dec. 31, 2016 has been permanently grandfathered to the
extent these instruments otherwise would be ineligible only due to
containing impermissible acceleration rights or being governed by
foreign law.

ratios.

If BNY Mellon maintains risk-based ratio or leverage TLAC
measures above the minimum required level, but with a risk-based
ratio or leverage below the minimum level with buffers, we will
face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and discretionary
executive compensation based on the amount of the shortfall and
eligible retained income.

Trading activities and risk management
Our trading activities are focused on acting as a market-maker for
our customers, facilitating customer trades and risk-mitigating
hedging in compliance with the Volcker Rule. The risk from
market-making activities for customers is managed by our traders
and limited in total exposure through a system of position limits,
value-at-risk (“VaR”) methodology and other market sensitivity
measures. VaR is the potential loss in value due to adverse market
movements over a defined time horizon with a specified
confidence level. The calculation of our VaR used by management
and presented below assumes a one-day holding period, utilizes a
99% confidence level and incorporates non-linear product
characteristics. VaR facilitates comparisons across portfolios of
different risk characteristics. VaR also captures the diversification
of aggregated risk at the firm-wide level.
VaR represents a key risk management measure and it is important
to note the inherent limitations to VaR, which include:
• VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer time
horizons where moves may be extreme;
• VaR does not take account of potential variability of market
liquidity; and
• Previous moves in market risk factors may not produce accurate
predictions of all future market moves.
See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information on the VaR methodology.
The following tables indicate the calculated VaR amounts for the
trading portfolio for the designated periods using the historical
simulation VaR model.

The interest rate component of VaR represents instruments whose
values are predominantly driven by interest rate levels. These
instruments include, but are not limited to, U.S. Treasury
securities, swaps, swaptions, forward rate agreements, exchangetraded futures and options, and other interest rate derivative
products.
BNY Mellon 41
The foreign exchange component of VaR represents instruments
whose values predominantly vary with the level or volatility of
currency exchange rates or interest rates. These instruments
include, but are not limited to, currency balances, spot and forward
transactions, currency options and other currency derivative
products.
The equity component of VaR consists of instruments that
represent an ownership interest in the form of domestic and foreign
common stock or other equity-linked instruments. These
instruments include, but are not limited to, common stock,
exchange-traded funds, preferred stock, listed equity options (puts
and calls), OTC equity options, equity total return swaps, equity
index futures and other equity derivative products.
The credit component of VaR represents instruments whose values
are predominantly driven by credit spread levels, i.e., idiosyncratic
default risk. These instruments include, but are not limited to,
securities with exposures from corporate and municipal credit
spreads.
The diversification component of VaR is the risk reduction benefit
that occurs when combining portfolios and offsetting positions, and
from the correlated behavior of risk factor movements.
During the third quarter of 2021, interest rate risk generated 35%
of average gross VaR, foreign exchange risk generated 38% of
average gross VaR, equity risk generated 2% of average gross VaR
and credit risk generated 25% of average gross VaR. During the
third quarter of 2021, our daily trading loss exceeded our
calculated VaR amount of the overall portfolio on one occasion.
The following table of total daily trading revenue or loss illustrates
the number of trading days in which our trading revenue or loss fell

(a) Trading revenue (loss) includes realized and unrealized gains and losses primarily
related to spot and forward foreign exchange transactions, derivatives and securities
trades for our customers and excludes any associated commissions, underwriting fees
and net interest revenue.
Trading assets include debt and equity instruments and derivative
assets, primarily interest rate and foreign exchange contracts, not
designated as hedging instruments. Trading assets were $17.9
billion at Sept. 30, 2021 and $15.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2020.
Trading liabilities include debt and equity instruments and
derivative liabilities, primarily interest rate and foreign exchange
contracts, not designated as hedging instruments. Trading liabilities
were $5.2 billion at Sept. 30, 2021 and $6.0 billion at Dec. 31,
2020.
Under our fair value methodology for derivative contracts, an
initial “risk-neutral” valuation is performed on each position
assuming time-discounting based on a AA credit curve. In addition,
we consider credit risk in arriving at the fair value of our
derivatives.
We reflect external credit ratings as well as observable credit
default swap spreads for both ourselves and our counterparties
when measuring the fair value of our derivative positions.
Accordingly, the valuation of our derivative positions is sensitive
to the current changes in our own credit spreads, as well as those of
our counterparties.
At Sept. 30, 2021, our OTC derivative assets, including those in
hedging relationships, of $4.4 billion included a credit valuation
adjustment (“CVA”) deduction of $27 million. Our OTC derivative
liabilities, including those in hedging relationships, of $3.1 billion
included a debit valuation adjustment (“DVA”) of $2 million
related to our own credit spread. Net of hedges, the CVA increased
less than $1 million and the DVA was unchanged in the third
quarter of 2021, which decreased other trading revenue by less
than $1 million. The net impact increased other trading
42 BNY Mellon
revenue by $1 million in the second quarter of 2021 and $3 million
in the third quarter of 2020.
The table below summarizes the distribution of credit ratings for
our foreign exchange and interest rate derivative counterparties
over the past five quarters, which indicates the level of
counterparty credit associated with these trading activities.
Significant changes in counterparty credit ratings could alter the

Asset/liability management
Our diversified business activities include processing securities,
accepting deposits, investing in securities, lending, raising money
as needed to fund assets and other transactions. The market risks
from these activities include interest rate risk and foreign exchange
risk. Our primary market risk is exposure to movements in U.S.
dollar interest rates and certain foreign currency interest rates. We
actively manage interest rate sensitivity and use earnings
simulation and discounted cash flow models to identify interest
rate exposures.
An earnings simulation model is the primary tool used to assess
changes in pre-tax net interest revenue between a baseline scenario
and hypothetical interest rate scenarios. Interest rate sensitivity is
quantified by calculating the change in pre-tax net interest revenue
between the scenarios over a 12-month measurement period.
The baseline scenario incorporates the market’s forward rate
expectations and management’s assumptions regarding client
deposit rates, credit spreads, changes in the prepayment behavior
of loans and securities and the impact of derivative financial
instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes. These
assumptions have been developed
through a combination of historical analysis and future expected
pricing behavior and are inherently uncertain. Actual results may
differ materially from projected results due to timing, magnitude
and frequency of interest rate changes, and changes in market
conditions and management’s strategies, among other factors.
Client deposit levels and mix are key assumptions impacting net
interest revenue in the baseline as well as the hypothetical interest
rate scenarios. The earnings simulation model assumes static
deposit levels and mix and it also assumes that no management
actions will be taken to mitigate the effects of interest rate changes.
Typically, the baseline scenario uses the average deposit balances
of the quarter.
In the table below, we use the earnings simulation model to assess
the impact of various hypothetical interest rate scenarios compared
to the baseline scenario. Beginning in the third quarter of 2021, we
have refined our scenario analysis by replacing gradual rate ramp
scenarios with scenarios that reflect the impact of instantaneous
interest rate shock movements. In each of the new scenarios, all
currencies’ interest rates are instantaneously shifted higher or
lower. The scenarios assume instantaneous rate changes at the start
of the forecast. Long-term interest rates are defined as all tenors
equal to or greater than three years and short-term interest rates are
defined as all tenors equal to or less than three months. Interim
term points are interpolated where applicable. The refined
scenarios are intended to provide information on a basis that is
consistent with industry practice.
The following table shows net interest revenue sensitivity for BNY
Mellon. Prior periods have been updated to reflect the impact of
instantaneous interest rate shock movements.

The slight decreases in certain of the rising rate sensitivities
compared with June 30, 2021 are driven by slightly lower client
deposits.
While the net interest revenue sensitivity scenario calculations
assume static deposit balances to facilitate consistent period-overperiod comparisons, it is likely that a portion of the recent
monetary policy-driven deposit inflows would run-off in a rising
short-term rate environment. Noninterest-bearing deposits are
particularly sensitive to changes in short-term rates.
To illustrate the net interest revenue sensitivity to deposit runoff,
we note that a $5 billion instantaneous reduction of U.S. dollar
denominated noninterest-bearing deposits would reduce the net
interest revenue sensitivity results in the up 100 basis point
scenario in the table above by approximately $60 million. The
impact would be smaller if the run-off was assumed to be a mixture
of interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits.
Additionally, given the continued low short-term interest rates,
money market mutual fund fees and other similar fees are being
waived to protect investors from negative returns. See “Fee and
other revenue” beginning on page 7 for additional details on the
impact of money market fee waivers on fee revenues.
For a discussion of factors impacting the growth or contraction of
deposits, see “Risk Factors – Our business, financial condition and
results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not
effectively manage our liquidity,” in our 2020 Annual Report.

Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP and
Non-GAAP financial measures
BNY Mellon has included in this Form 10-Q certain Non-GAAP
financial measures on a tangible basis as a supplement to GAAP
information, which exclude goodwill and intangible assets, net of
deferred tax liabilities. We believe that the return on tangible
common equity – Non-GAAP is additional useful information for
investors because it presents a measure of those assets that can
generate income, and the tangible book value per common share –
Non-GAAP is additional useful information because it presents the
level of tangible assets in relation to shares of common stock
outstanding.
BNY Mellon has presented the measure of fee revenue, excluding
money market fee waivers – Non-GAAP. We believe that this
measure is useful information for investors for evaluating the
impact of current interest rates and market conditions on fee
revenue growth rates and the performance of our business.
The presentation of the growth rates of investment management
and performance fees on a constant currency basis permits
investors to assess the significance of changes in foreign currency
exchange rates. Growth rates on a constant currency basis were
determined by applying the current period foreign currency
exchange rates to the prior period revenue. We believe that this
presentation, as a supplement to GAAP information, gives
investors a clearer picture of the related revenue results without the
variability caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates.
BNY Mellon has also included the adjusted pre-tax operating
margin – Non-GAAP, which is the pre-tax operating margin for the
Investment and Wealth Management business, net of distribution
and servicing expense that was passed to third parties who
distribute or service our managed funds. We believe that this
measure is useful when evaluating the performance of the
Investment and Wealth Management business relative to industry
competitors.

Recent regulatory developments
For a summary of additional regulatory matters relevant to our
operations, see “Recent regulatory developments” in our Form 10-

“Supervision and Regulation” in our 2020 Annual Report.
Other matters
On March 5, 2021, the administrator of LIBOR announced that it
would cease the publication of non-U.S. dollar London Interbank
Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) settings and one-week and two-month
U.S. dollar LIBOR settings on Dec. 31, 2021 and would cease the
publication of the other U.S. dollar LIBOR settings on June 30,
2023. On the same day, the UK Financial Conduct Authority
(“FCA”) made a related announcement regarding when LIBOR
settings will cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer
be representative. The International Swaps and Derivatives
Association (“ISDA”) also announced that the FCA’s
announcement was an index cessation event under its fallbacks
protocol for all LIBOR settings and that consequently, the fallback
spread adjustment was fixed as of the date of the announcement.
In April 2021, New York state adopted legislation that provides a
statutory fallback mechanism to replace LIBOR with a benchmark
rate based on SOFR for New York-law governed contracts that
reference U.S. dollar LIBOR and either have no fallback
provisions or provisions that are based on LIBOR. The New York
legislation also has a safe
harbor regarding the selection and use of that SOFR-based
benchmark rate.
The U.S. bank regulators have issued guidance strongly
encouraging banking organizations to cease using U.S. dollar
LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts as soon as practicable
and in any event by Dec. 31, 2021. We are continuing to work to
facilitate an orderly transition from interbank offered rates,
including LIBOR, to alternative reference rates for us and ourclients.
