The following should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated
Financial Statements included in this report. Investors should also
read the section titled “Forward-looking Statements.”
Overview
Established in 1784 by Alexander Hamilton, we were the first
company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: BK).
With a history of more than 235 years, BNY Mellon is a global
company that manages and services assets for financial institutions,
corporations and individual investors in 35 countries.
BNY Mellon has two business segments, Investment Services and
Investment and Wealth Management, which offer a comprehensive
set of capabilities and deep expertise across the investment
lifecycle, enabling the Company to provide solutions to buy-side
and sell-side market participants, as well as leading institutional
and wealth management clients globally.
The diagram below presents our two business segments and lines
of business, with the remaining operations in the Other segment.
Highlights of first quarter 2021 results
Net income applicable to common shareholders was $858 million,
or $0.97 per diluted common share, in the first quarter of 2021. Net
income applicable to common shareholders was $944 million, or
$1.05 per diluted common share, in the first quarter of 2020. The
highlights below are based on the first quarter of 2021 compared
with the first quarter of 2020, unless otherwise noted.
• Total revenue of $3.9 billion decreased 5%, primarily reflecting:
• Fee revenue increased 1%, primarily reflecting the positive
impact of higher markets, higher client volumes and
balances and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar,
partially offset by higher money market fee waivers. (See
“Fee and other revenue” beginning on page 7.)
4 BNY Mellon
• Other revenue includes a $39 million impairment for a
renewable energy investment. (See “Fee and other revenue”
beginning on page 7.)
• Net interest revenue decreased 20%, primarily reflecting
lower interest rates on interest-earning assets. This was
partially offset by the benefit of lower deposit and funding
rates, higher deposit balances and a larger securities
portfolio. (See “Net interest revenue” on page 10.)
• Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $83 million
primarily driven by an improvement in the macroeconomic
forecast. (See “Consolidated balance sheet review – Allowance
for credit losses” beginning on page 27.)
• Noninterest expense increased 5%, primarily reflecting higher
staff expense, the unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar
and higher technology-related expenses, partially offset by
lower business development (travel and marketing) and
distribution and servicing expenses. (See “Noninterest expense”
on page 12.)
• Effective tax rate of 19.2%. (See “Income taxes” on page 12.)
Capital and liquidity
• CET1 ratio was 12.6% under the Standardized Approach at
March 31, 2021, compared with 13.1% under the Advanced
Approaches at Dec.
31, 2020. The decrease in the CET1 ratio primarily reflects
unrealized losses on securities available-for-sale, capital
deployed through common stock repurchases and dividends and
an increase in risk-weighted assets (“RWAs”) under the
Standardized Approach, partially offset by capital generated
through earnings. (See “Capital” beginning on page 34.)
• Repurchased 16.8 million common shares for $699 million.
Highlights of our principal businesses
Investment Services
• Total revenue decreased 8%.
• Income before income taxes decreased 12%.
• AUC/A of $41.7 trillion increased 18%, primarily reflecting
higher market values, net new business and the favorable
impact of a weaker U.S. dollar.
Investment and Wealth Management
• Total revenue increased 10%.
• Income before income taxes increased 43%.
• AUM of $2.2 trillion increased 23%, primarily reflecting higher
market values, the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar
(principally versus the British pound) and net inflows.

Impact of coronavirus pandemic on our business
See “Impact of coronavirus pandemic on our business” in our 2020
Annual Report for the areas of our business that have been
impacted and could continue to be impacted by the coronavirus
pandemic and its effect on the global macroeconomic environment.
The following updates those disclosures.
Short-term interest rates have remained low through the first
quarter of 2021, which has continued to result in lower net interest
revenue and higher money market fee waivers. This has been
partially offset by higher deposit balances and higher money
market balances.
Equity markets and activity improved in the first quarter of 2021,
resulting in increased volumes compared to the fourth quarter of
2020 in most of our Investment Services businesses and increased
asset-based fees in Investment Services and Investment and Wealth
Management.
The macroeconomic outlook also improved as of the end of the
first quarter of 2021, resulting in a decrease in the allowance for
credit losses and a benefit of $83 million to the provision for credit
losses.
We suspended common stock repurchases for most of 2020,
beginning in March 2020, while maintaining our quarterly
common stock dividend of $0.31 per share. In June 2020, the
Federal Reserve announced that participating Comprehensive
Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) bank holding companies
(“BHCs”), including us, must update and resubmit their capital
plans and that, as a result, CCAR BHCs were not permitted to
conduct open market common stock repurchases in the third
quarter of 2020, a
restriction subsequently extended through the fourth quarter of
2020. For the first and second quarters of 2021, the Federal
Reserve permitted common stock dividends and repurchases
subject to the limitations that the aggregate amounts per quarter not
exceed average net income over the prior four quarters and that
common stock dividends not be increased. If a CCAR BHC ceases
to be subject to temporary restrictions on distributions beginning in
the third quarter of 2021, it will continue to be subject to the
normal constraints under the stress capital buffer (“SCB”)
framework. See “Recent regulatory developments” for additional
information related to the temporary restrictions on capital
distributions.
It is difficult to forecast the impact of the coronavirus, together
with related public health measures, on our results with certainty
because so much depends on how the health crisis evolves and its
impact on the global economy, as well as actions taken by central
banks and governments to support the economy and the
availability, use and effectiveness of vaccines.
The current macroeconomic environment has also resulted in
responses by governmental and regulatory bodies. See
“Supervision and Regulation – Pandemic-Related Measures” in our
2020 Annual Report for additional information on legislative and
regulatory developments in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
For further discussion of the current and potential impact of the
coronavirus pandemic, see “Risk Factors – The coronavirus
pandemic is adversely affecting us and creates significant risks and
uncertainties for our business, and the ultimate impact of the
pandemic on us will depend on future developments, which are
highly uncertain and cannot be predicted,” in our 2020 Annual
Report.

N/M – Not meaningful.
Fee revenue increased 1% compared with the first quarter of 2020
and 5% compared with the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase
compared with the first quarter of 2020 primarily reflects higher
investment management and performance fees, asset servicing
fees, clearing services fees and the favorable impact of a weaker
U.S. dollar, partially offset by higher money market fee waivers
and lower foreign exchange revenue. The increase compared with
the fourth quarter of 2020 primarily reflects higher asset servicing
fees, clearing services fees, foreign exchange revenue and
investment management and performance fees, partially offset by
higher money market fee waivers.
Other revenue decreased $47 million compared with the first
quarter of 2020. The decrease primarily reflects a $39 million
impairment related to a renewable energy investment.
Money market fee waivers
Given the recent levels of short-term interest rates, money market
mutual fund fees and other similar fees are being waived to protect
investors from negative returns. The fee waivers have primarily
impacted fee revenues in Pershing and Investment Management,
but also resulted in lower distribution and servicing expense. The
fee waivers also began to impact fee revenues in our other
businesses in the second half of 2020. Money market fee waivers
are highly sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates and are
difficult to predict. Assuming no change in money market
balances, we expect to recover over 50% of the pre-tax income
related to fee waivers with a 25 basis point increase in the Fed
Funds rate and we expect to recover nearly 100% of the pre-tax
income related to fee waivers when the Fed Funds rate increases
100 basis points.
BNY Mellon 7
The following table presents the impact of money market fee
waivers on our consolidated fee revenue, net of distribution and
servicing expense. In the first quarter of 2021, the net impact of
money market fee waivers was $188 million, up from $134 million
in the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by low short-term interest
rates and higher money market balances.

We expect the impact from money market fee waivers, net of
distribution and servicing expense, to approximate $220 million in
the second quarter of 2021, based on implied forward rates and
money market balances as of the end of the first quarter of 2021.
Fee waivers in subsequent periods will continue to be dependent on
the level of short-term interest rates and money market balances.
Investment services fees
Investment services fees increased 1% compared with the first
quarter of 2020 and 4% compared with the fourth quarter of 2020,
reflecting the following:
• Asset servicing fees increased 3% compared with the first
quarter of 2020 and 5% compared with the fourth quarter of
2020. The increase compared with the first quarter of 2020
primarily
reflects higher client volumes and market values, partially
offset by higher money market fee waivers. The increase
compared with the fourth quarter of 2020 primarily reflects
higher client volumes, partially offset by higher money market
fee waivers.
• Clearing services fees decreased 3% compared with the first
quarter of 2020 and increased 9% compared with the fourth
quarter of 2020. The decrease compared with the first quarter
of 2020 primarily reflects the impact of money market fee
waivers, partially offset by higher market values and client
volumes. The increase compared with the fourth quarter of
2020 primarily reflects higher clearance volumes and market
values.
• Issuer services fees decreased 7% compared with the first
quarter of 2020 and 5% compared with the fourth quarter of
2020. Both decreases primarily reflect higher money market
fee waivers in Corporate Trust and lower Depositary Receipts
revenue.
• Treasury services fees increased 5% compared with the first
quarter of 2020 and 1% compared with the fourth quarter of
2020. The increase compared with the first quarter of 2020
primarily reflects higher payment volumes.
See “Investment Services business” in “Review of businesses” for
additional details.
Investment management and performance fees
Investment management and performance fees increased 3%
compared with the first quarter of 2020 and 1% compared with the
fourth quarter of 2020. Both increases primarily reflect the impact
of higher market values and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S.
dollar, partially offset by the impact of money market fee waivers.
Performance fees were $40 million in the first quarter of 2021, $50
million in the first quarter of 2020 and $45 million in the fourth
quarter of 2020. On a constant currency basis (Non-GAAP),
investment management and performance fees increased 1%
compared with the first quarter of 2020.
AUM was $2.2 trillion at March 31, 2021, an increase of 23%
compared with March 31, 2020, primarily reflecting higher market
values, the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar (principally
versus the British pound) and net inflows.
8 BNY Mellon
See “Investment and Wealth Management business” in “Review of
businesses” for additional details regarding the drivers of
investment management and performance fees, AUM and AUM
flows.
Foreign exchange revenue
Foreign exchange revenue is primarily driven by the volume of
client transactions and the spread realized on these transactions,
both of which are impacted by market volatility, the impact of
foreign currency hedging activities and foreign currency
remeasurement gain (loss). In the first quarter of 2021, foreign
exchange revenue totaled $231 million, a decrease of 6% compared
with the first quarter of 2020 and an increase of 24% compared
with the fourth quarter of 2020. The decrease compared with the
first quarter of 2020 primarily reflects lower volatility, partially
offset by the positive impact of foreign currency hedging. The
increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2020 primarily
reflects higher volumes. Foreign exchange revenue is primarily
reported in the Investment Services business and, to a lesser extent,
the Investment and Wealth Management business and the Other
segment.
Financing-related fees
Financing-related fees, which are primarily reported in the
Investment Services business, include capital market fees, loan
commitment fees and credit-related fees. Financing-related fees
totaled $51 million in the first quarter of 2021, $59 million in the
first quarter of 2020 and $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.
The decrease compared with the first quarter of 2020 primarily
reflects lower underwriting fees. The increase compared with the
fourth quarter of 2020 primarily reflects higher underwriting fees.
Investment and other income
Investment and other income includes income or loss from
consolidated investment management funds, seed capital gains or
losses, other trading revenue or loss, renewable energy investments
losses, corporate and bank-owned life insurance contracts, other
investment gains or losses, gains or losses from disposals, expense
reimbursements from our CIBC Mellon joint venture and other
income or loss. The income or loss from consolidated investment
management funds should be considered together with the net
income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, which
reflects the portion of
the consolidated funds for which we do not have an economic
interest and is reflected below net income as a separate line item on
the consolidated income statement. Other trading revenue or loss
primarily includes the impact of market-risk hedging activity
related to our seed capital investments in investment management
funds, non-foreign currency derivative and fixed income trading,
and other hedging activity. Investments in renewable energy
generate losses in other income that are more than offset by
benefits and credits recorded to the provision for income taxes.
Other investment gains or losses includes fair value changes of
non-readily marketable equity securities, private equity and other
investments. Expense reimbursements from our CIBC Mellon joint
venture relate to expenses incurred by BNY Mellon on behalf of
the CIBC Mellon joint venture. Other income or loss includes
various miscellaneous revenues.
The following table provides the components of investment and
other income.

Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
(b) Includes gains (losses) on investments in BNY Mellon funds which hedge deferred
incentive awards.
(c) Includes strategic equity, private equity and other investments.
Investment and other income was $9 million in the first quarter of
2021 compared with $47 million in the first quarter of 2020 and
$43 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. The decrease compared
with the first quarter of 2020 and fourth quarter of 2020 primarily
reflects the $39 million impairment related to a renewable energy
investment. The decrease compared with the first quarter of 2020
also reflects lower derivative and fixed income trading results and
a one-time fee in Pershing recorded in the first quarter of 2020,
partially offset by higher investment income
BNY Mellon 9
(from consolidated investment management funds, seed capital and
other investments), net of hedging reflected in other trading
revenue.
The decrease compared with the fourth quarter of 2020 also
reflects lower investment income (from
consolidated investment management funds, seed capital,
corporate/bank-owned life insurance and other investments), net of
hedging reflected in other trading revenue, partially offset by losses
on business sales recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020.

income.
N/M – Not meaningful.
bps – basis points.
Net interest revenue decreased 20% compared with the first quarter
of 2020 and 4% compared with the fourth quarter of 2020. The
decrease compared with the first quarter of 2020 primarily reflects
lower interest rates on interest-earning assets, partially offset by the
benefit of lower deposit and funding rates, higher deposit balances
and a larger securities portfolio. The decrease compared with the
fourth quarter of 2020 was primarily driven by lower interest rates
on interest-earning assets, partially offset by the benefit of lower
deposit and funding rates, and higher deposit and loan balances.
Net interest margin decreased 35 basis points compared with the
first quarter of 2020 and 6 basis points compared with the fourth
quarter of 2020. The decreases primarily reflect the factors
mentioned above.
Average interest-earning assets increased 23% compared with the
first quarter of 2020 and 5% compared with the fourth quarter of
2020. The increase compared with the first quarter of 2020
primarily reflects higher interest-bearing deposits
with the Federal Reserve and other central banks and a larger
securities portfolio. The increase compared with the fourth quarter
of 2020 primarily reflects higher interest-bearing deposits with the
Federal Reserve and other central banks, interest-bearing deposits
with banks (primarily foreign banks) and margin loans.
Average non-U.S. dollar deposits comprised approximately 25% of
our average total deposits in the first quarter of 2021.
Approximately 40% of the average non-U.S. dollar deposits in the
first quarter of 2021 were euro denominated.
Net interest revenue in future periods will depend on the level and
mix of client deposits and deposit rates, as well as the level and
shape of the yield curve, which may result in lower yields on
interest-earning assets.
Due to lower interest rates, net interest revenue has been trending
lower and we expect net interest revenue to decrease in 2021
compared with 2020.

(a) Includes the average impact of of setting under enforceable netting agreements of approximately $37 billion for the first quarter of 2021, $41 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020 and $80
billion for the first quarter of 2020. On a Non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of of setting, the yield on federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements would have been
0.19% for the first quarter of 2021, 0.23% for the fourth quarter of 2020 and 1.39% for the first quarter of 2020. On a Non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of of setting, the rate on federal
funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements would have been (0.02)% for the first quarter of 2021, 0.00% for the fourth quarter of 2020 and 1.18% for the first quarter of
2020. We believe providing the rates excluding the impact of netting is useful to investors as it is more reflective of the actual rates earned and paid.
(b) Average rates were calculated on an FTE basis, at tax rates of approximately 21%.

Total noninterest expense increased 5% compared with the first
quarter of 2020 and decreased 3% compared with the fourth
quarter of 2020. The increase compared with the first quarter of
2020 primarily reflects higher staff expense, the unfavorable
impact of a weaker U.S. dollar and higher technology-related
expenses, partially offset by lower business development (travel
and marketing) and distribution and servicing expenses. Staff
expense includes the impact of an incentive reversal in the first
quarter of 2020, the impact of a higher share price on share-based
awards and increased expense for awards to retirement eligible
employees. The technology-related expenses are included in staff,
software and equipment, and professional, legal and other
purchased services expenses. The decrease compared with the
fourth quarter of 2020 primarily reflects lower severance, litigation
and professional, legal and other purchased services expenses and
real estate charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020, partially
offset by higher other staff expense.
As we continue to manage overall expenses, we expect total
reported noninterest expense to increase slightly for the full-year
2021 compared to 2020. This includes an unfavorable impact of
foreign exchange rates which is expected to offset the impact of
2020 notable items, which were litigation expense, severance and
real estate charges. Expenses could be impacted if foreign
exchange rates change from March 31, 2021 levels, revenuerelated or volume-related expenses increase or there are
unexpected charges or expenses.
Income taxes
BNY Mellon recorded an income tax provision of $221 million
(19.2% effective tax rate) in the first quarter of 2021, $265 million
(21.6% effective tax rate) in the first quarter of 2020 and $148
million (16.4% effective tax rate) in the fourth quarter of 2020. For
additional information, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated

Review of businesses
We have an internal information system that produces performance
data along product and service lines for our two principal
businesses, Investment Services and Investment and Wealth
Management, and the Other segment.
Business accounting principles
Our business data has been determined on an internal management
basis of accounting, rather than the generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”) used for consolidated financial reporting.
These measurement principles are designed so that reported results
of the businesses will track their economic performance.
For information on the accounting principles of our businesses, see
Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For
information on the primary products and services in each line of
business, the primary types of revenue by business and how our
businesses are presented and analyzed, see Note 24 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2020 Annual Report.
Business results are subject to reclassification when organizational
changes are made, or for refinements in revenue and expense
allocation methodologies. Refinements are typically reflected on a
prospective basis. There were no reclassification or organization
changes in the first quarter of 2021.
The results of our businesses may be influenced by client and other
activities that vary by quarter. In the first quarter, staff expense
typically increases reflecting the vesting of long-term stock awards
for retirement-eligible employees. In the third quarter, Depositary
Receipts revenue is typically higher due to an increased level of
client dividend payments. Also in the third quarter, volume-related
fees may decline
due to reduced client activity, and staff expense typically increases
reflecting the annual employee merit increase. In the fourth quarter,
we typically incur higher business development and marketing
expenses; however, 2020 was an exception given the impact of the
coronavirus pandemic. In our Investment and Wealth Management
business, performance fees are typically higher in the fourth and
first quarters, as those quarters represent the end of the
measurement period for many of the performance fee-eligible
relationships.
The results of our businesses may also be impacted by the
translation of financial results denominated in foreign currencies to
the U.S. dollar. We are primarily impacted by activities
denominated in the British pound and the euro. On a consolidated
basis and in our Investment Services business, we typically have
more foreign currency-denominated expenses than revenues.
However, our Investment and Wealth Management business
typically has more foreign currency-denominated revenues than
expenses. Overall, currency fluctuations impact the year-over-year
growth rate in the Investment and Wealth Management business
more than the Investment Services business. However, currency
fluctuations, in isolation, are not expected to significantly impact
net income on a consolidated basis.
Fee revenue in Investment and Wealth Management, and to a lesser
extent in Investment Services, is impacted by the value of market
indices. At March 31, 2021, we estimated that a 5% change in
global equity markets, spread evenly throughout the year, would
impact fee revenue by less than 1% and diluted earnings per
common share by $0.03 to $0.06.
See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
the consolidating schedules which show the contribution of our
businesses to our overall profitability.

Review of financial results
AUC/A of $41.7 trillion increased 18% compared with March 31,
2020, primarily reflecting higher market values, net new business
and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. AUC/A consisted
of 38% equity securities and 62% fixed-income securities at March
31, 2021 and 31% equity securities and 69% fixed-income
securities at March 31, 2020.
Total revenue of $3.0 billion decreased 8% compared with the first
quarter of 2020 and increased 3% compared with the fourth quarter
of 2020. The drivers of total revenue by line of business are
indicated below.
Asset Servicing revenue of $1.4 billion decreased 7% compared
with the first quarter of 2020 and increased 5% compared with the
fourth quarter of 2020. The decrease compared with the first
quarter of 2020 primarily reflects lower interest rates and foreign
exchange revenue and higher money market fee waivers, partially
offset by higher client volumes and market values. The increase
compared with the fourth quarter of 2020 primarily reflects higher
client and foreign exchange volumes, partially offset by higher
money market fee waivers.
Pershing revenue of $605 million decreased 7% compared with the
first quarter of 2020 and increased 7% compared with the fourth
quarter of 2020. The decrease compared with the first quarter of
2020
primarily reflects the impact of money market fee waivers and a
one-time fee recorded in the first quarter of 2020, partially offset
by higher market values and client volumes. The increase
compared with the fourth quarter of 2020 primarily reflects higher
clearance volumes and market values.
Issuer Services revenue of $363 million decreased 13% compared
with the first quarter of 2020 and 6% compared with the fourth
quarter of 2020. Both decreases primarily reflect lower interest
rates and higher money market fee waivers in Corporate Trust and
lower Depositary Receipts revenue.
Treasury Services revenue of $317 million decreased 6% compared
with the first quarter of 2020 and 2% compared with the fourth
quarter of 2020. Both decreases primarily reflect lower interest
rates and higher money market fee waivers. The decrease
compared with the first quarter of 2020 was partially offset by
higher payment volumes and deposit levels.
Clearance and Collateral Management revenue of $281 million
decreased 6% compared with the first quarter of 2020 and
increased 2% compared with the fourth quarter of 2020. The
decrease compared with the first quarter of 2020 primarily reflects
lower interest rates and intraday credit fees. The increase compared
with the fourth quarter of 2020 primarily reflects higher clearance
volumes.
Market and regulatory trends are driving investable assets toward
lower fee asset management products at reduced margins for our
clients. These dynamics are also negatively impacting our
investment services fees. However, at the same time, these trends
are providing additional outsourcing opportunities as clients and
other market participants seek to comply with regulations and
reduce their operating costs.
Noninterest expense of $2.1 billion increased 6% compared with
the first quarter of 2020 and decreased 3% compared with the
fourth quarter of 2020. The increase compared with the first
quarter of 2020 was primarily driven by technology-related
expense, higher staff, volume-related and litigation expenses and
the unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. The decrease
compared with the fourth quarter of 2020 primarily reflects lower
litigation and severance expenses.

Business description
Our Investment and Wealth Management business consists of two
distinct lines of business, Investment Management and Wealth
Management. Our investment firms deliver a highly diversified
portfolio of investment strategies independently, and through our
global distribution network, to institutional and retail clients
globally. BNY Mellon Wealth Management provides investment

pages 19 and 20 of our 2020 Annual Report for additional
information on our Investment and Wealth Management business.
Review of financial results
AUM increased 23% compared with March 31, 2020 primarily
reflecting higher market values, the favorable impact of a weaker
U.S. dollar (principally versus the British pound) and net inflows.
Net long-term strategy inflows were $17 billion in the first quarter
of 2021, driven by fixed income and liability-driven investments.
Short-term strategy inflows were $19 billion in the first quarter of
2021. Market and regulatory trends have resulted in increased
demand for lower fee asset management products and for
performance-based fees.
Total revenue of $991 million increased 10% compared with the
first quarter of 2020 and increased slightly compared with the
fourth quarter of 2020.
Investment Management revenue of $698 million increased 13%
compared with the first quarter of 2020 and decreased 2%
compared with the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase compared
with the first quarter of 2020 primarily reflects the impact of higher
market values, equity investment gains, including seed capital, and
the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar, partially offset by the
impact of money market fee waivers. The decrease compared with
the fourth quarter of 2020 primarily reflects the impact of money
market fee waivers and lower equity
18 BNY Mellon
investment gains, including seed capital, partially offset by higher
market values and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar.
Wealth Management revenue of $293 million increased 5%
compared with the first quarter of 2020 and 6% compared with the
fourth quarter of 2020. Both increases reflect the impact of higher
market values. The increase compared with the fourth quarter of
2020 also reflects a loss on a business sale recorded in the fourth
quarter of 2020.
Revenue generated in the Investment and Wealth Management
business included 38% from non-U.S.
sources in the first quarter of 2021, compared with 42% in the first
quarter of 2020 and 41% in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Noninterest expense of $709 million increased 2% compared with
the first quarter of 2020 and 3% compared with the fourth quarter
of 2020. The increase compared with the first quarter of 2020
primarily reflects higher staff expense and the unfavorable impact
of a weaker dollar, partially offset by lower distribution and
servicing and other expenses. The increase compared with the
fourth quarter of 2020 primarily reflects timing of other staff
expense, partially offset by lower severance expense.

Review of financial results
Total revenue includes corporate treasury and other investment
activity, including hedging activity which offsets between fee and
other revenue and net interest expense.
Other revenue decreased $60 million compared with the first
quarter of 2020 and $8 million compared with the fourth quarter of
2020. Both decreases
primarily reflect an impairment of a renewable energy investment.
The decrease compared with the fourth quarter of 2020 was
partially offset by a loss on a sale of a business recorded in the
fourth quarter of 2020.
Noninterest expense increased $11 million compared with the first
quarter of 2020, primarily reflecting higher staff expense.
Noninterest expense decreased $23 million compared with the
fourth quarter of 2020, primarily reflecting real estate charges and
severance expense both recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020,
partially offset by higher other staff expense.

Consolidated balance sheet review
One of our key risk management objectives is to maintain a
balance sheet that remains strong throughout market cycles to meet
the expectations of our major stakeholders, including our
shareholders, clients, creditors and regulators.
We also seek to undertake overall liquidity risk, including intraday
liquidity risk, that stays within our risk appetite. The objective of
our balance sheet management strategy is to maintain a balance
sheet that is characterized by strong liquidity and asset quality,
ready access to external funding sources at competitive rates and a
strong capital structure that supports our risk-taking activities and
is adequate to absorb potential losses. In managing the balance
sheet, appropriate consideration is given to balancing the
competing needs of maintaining sufficient levels of liquidity and
complying with applicable regulations and supervisory
expectations while optimizing profitability.
At March 31, 2021, total assets were $465 billion, compared with
$470 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The decrease in total assets was
primarily driven by lower interest-bearing deposits with the
Federal Reserve and other central banks. Deposits totaled $337
billion at March 31, 2021, compared with $342 billion at
Dec. 31, 2020. The decrease reflects lower interest-bearing
deposits in non-U.S. offices, partially offset by higher noninterestbearing deposits (principally U.S. offices). Total interest-bearing
deposits as a percentage of total interest-earning assets were 60%
at March 31, 2021 and 63% at Dec. 31, 2020.
At March 31, 2021, available funds totaled $184 billion, which
include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits with the
Federal Reserve and other central banks, interest-bearing deposits
with banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements. This compares with available funds of $196
billion at Dec. 31, 2020. Total available funds as a percentage of
total assets were 39% at March 31, 2021 and 42% at Dec. 31,
2020. For additional information on our available funds, see
“Liquidity and dividends.”
Securities were $155.8 billion, or 34% of total assets, at March 31,
2021, compared with $156.4 billion, or 33% of total assets, at Dec.
31, 2020. The decrease primarily reflects lower agency residential
mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”), foreign government
agency, and U.S. government agency securities and a decrease in
unrealized pre-tax gain, partially offset by increases in U.S.
treasury and sovereign debt/sovereign guaranteed securities. For
additional information on our securities portfolio, see “Securities”
and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Loans were $60.7 billion, or 13% of total assets, at March 31,
2021, compared with $56.5 billion, or 12% of total assets, at Dec.
31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by higher margin
loans and overdrafts. For additional information on our loan
portfolio, see “Loans” and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Long-term debt totaled $25.4 billion at March 31, 2021 and $26.0
billion at Dec. 31, 2020. A redemption, maturity and a decrease in
the fair value of hedged long-term debt were partially offset by
issuances. For additional information on long-term debt, see
“Liquidity and dividends.”
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total shareholders’
equity decreased to $45.0 billion at March 31, 2021 from $45.8
billion at Dec. 31, 2020. For additional information, see “Capital.”

Country risk exposure
The following table presents BNY Mellon’s top 10 exposures by
country (excluding the U.S.) as of March 31, 2021, as well as
certain countries with higher risk profiles, and is presented on an
internal risk management basis. We monitor our exposure to these
and other countries as part of our internal country risk management
process.
The country risk exposure below reflects the Company’s risk to an
immediate default of the counterparty or obligor based on the
country of residence of the entity which incurs the liability. If there
is credit risk mitigation, the country of residence of the entity
providing the risk mitigation is the country of risk. The country of
risk for securities is generally based on the domicile of the issuer of
the security.

(c) Other exposures include over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivative and securities financing transactions, net of collateral.
(d) The top 10 country exposures comprise approximately 75% of our total non-U.S. exposure.
Events in recent years have resulted in increased focus on Italy and
Brazil. The country risk exposure to Italy primarily consists of
investment grade sovereign debt. The country risk exposure to
Brazil is primarily short-term trade finance loans extended to large
financial institutions. We also have operations in Brazil providing
investment services and investment management services.
Securities
In the discussion of our securities portfolio, we have included
certain credit ratings information because the information can
indicate the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed.
Significant changes in ratings classifications could indicate
increased credit risk for us and could be accompanied by an
increase in the allowance for credit losses and/or a reduction in the
fair value of our securities portfolio.

(i) Includes unrealized gains of $1,022 million at March 31, 2021 related to available-for-sale securities, net of hedges, and $457 million related to held-to-maturity securities.
The fair value of our securities portfolio, including related hedges,
was $155.7 billion at March 31, 2021, compared with $156.3
billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The decrease primarily reflects lower
agency RMBS, foreign government agency, and U.S. government
agency securities and a decrease in unrealized pre-tax gain,
partially offset by increases in U.S. treasury and sovereign
debt/sovereign guaranteed securities.
At March 31, 2021, the securities portfolio had a net unrealized
gain, including the impact of related hedges, of $1.5 billion,
compared with $3.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The decrease in the
net unrealized gain was primarily driven by higher market interest
rates.
The fair value of the available-for-sale securities totaled $107.2
billion at March 31, 2021, net of hedges, or 69% of the securities
portfolio, net of hedges. The fair value of the held-to-maturity
securities totaled $48.5 billion at March 31, 2021, or 31% of the
securities portfolio, net of hedges.
The unrealized gain (after-tax) on our available-for-sale securities
portfolio, net of hedges, included in accumulated other
comprehensive income was $776 million at March 31, 2021,
compared with $1.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The decrease in the
unrealized gain, net of tax, was primarily driven by higher market
interest rates.
At March 31, 2021, 95% of the securities in our portfolio were
rated AAA/AA-, unchanged compared with Dec. 31, 2020.

increased 4% compared with Dec. 31, 2020, primarily reflecting
higher margin loans and overdrafts.
Our financial institutions and commercial portfolios comprise our
largest concentrated risk. These portfolios comprised 52% of our
total exposure at March 31, 2021 and 55% at Dec. 31, 2020.
Additionally, most of our overdrafts relate to financial institutions.

The financial institutions portfolio exposure was $43.8 billion at
March 31, 2021, a slight decrease compared with Dec. 31, 2020,
primarily reflecting lower loans to the banks portfolio and lower
unfunded commitments to the securities industry portfolio,
partially offset by a higher unfunded commitments to the insurance
portfolio.
Financial institution exposures are high-quality, with 96% of the
exposures meeting the investment grade equivalent criteria of our
internal credit rating classification at March 31, 2021. Each
customer is assigned an internal credit rating, which is mapped to
an equivalent external rating agency grade based upon a number of
dimensions, which are continually evaluated and may change over
time. For ratings of non-U.S. counterparties, our internal credit
rating is generally capped at a rating equivalent to the sovereign
rating of the country where the counterparty resides, regardless of
the internal credit rating assigned to the counterparty or the
underlying collateral.
In addition, 73% of the financial institutions exposure is secured.
For example, securities industry clients and asset managers often
borrow against marketable securities held in custody.
The exposure to financial institutions is generally short-term, with
89% of the exposures expiring within one year. At both March 31,
2021 and Dec. 31, 2020, 18% of the exposure to financial
institutions had an expiration within 90 days.
At March 31, 2021 and Dec. 31, 2020, the secured intraday credit
provided to dealers in connection with their tri-party repo activity
totaled $18.2 billion and was included in the securities industry
portfolio. Dealers secure the outstanding intraday credit with highquality liquid collateral having a market value in excess of the
amount of the outstanding credit.
Our banks exposure primarily relates to our global trade finance.
These exposures are short-term in nature, with 96% due in less
than one year. The investment grade percentage of our banks
exposure was 85% at both March 31, 2021 and Dec. 31, 2020. Our
non-investment grade exposures are primarily trade finance loans
in Brazil.
The asset managers portfolio exposure is high-quality, with 98% of
the exposures meeting our investment grade equivalent ratings
criteria as of March 31, 2021. These exposures are generally shortterm liquidity facilities, with the majority to regulated mutual
funds.

The commercial portfolio exposure was $13.7 billion at March 31,
2021, a decrease of 3% from Dec. 31, 2020, primarily driven by
lower exposure to the manufacturing and services and other
portfolios.
We have $725 million of total direct exposure to the oil and gas
industry at March 31, 2021, most of which is reflected in the
energy and utilities portfolio in the table above. This exposure is to
exploration and production, refining and integrated companies and
was 66% investment grade at March 31, 2021 and Dec. 31, 2020.

Wealth management loans and mortgages
Our wealth management exposure was $18.0 billion at March 31,
2021, compared with $17.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. Wealth
management loans and mortgages primarily consist of loans to
high-net-worth individuals, which are secured by marketable
securities and/or residential property. Wealth management
mortgages are primarily interest-only, adjustable-rate mortgages
with a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio of 62% at origination.
Less than 1% of the mortgages were past due at March 31, 2021.
At March 31, 2021, the wealth management mortgage portfolio
consisted of the following geographic concentrations: California –
22%; New York – 16%; Massachusetts – 10%; Florida – 8%; and
other – 44%.

Our commercial real estate exposure totaled $9.4 billion at March
31, 2021 and $9.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. Our income-producing
commercial real estate facilities are focused on experienced owners
and are structured with moderate leverage based on existing cash
flows. Our commercial real estate lending activities also include
construction and renovation facilities. Our client base consists of
experienced developers and long-term holders of real estate assets.
Loans are approved on the basis of existing or projected cash flows
and supported by appraisals and knowledge of local market
conditions. Development loans are structured with moderate
leverage, and in many instances, involve some level of recourse to
the developer.
At March 31, 2021, the unsecured portfolio consisted of real estate
investment trusts (“REITs”) and real estate operating companies,
which are both primarily investment grade.
At March 31, 2021, our commercial real estate portfolio consisted
of the following concentrations: New York metro – 39%; REITs
and real estate operating companies – 37%; and other – 24%.
Lease financings
The lease financings portfolio exposure totaled $1.0 billion at both
March 31, 2021 and Dec. 31, 2020. At March 31, 2021,
approximately 98% of leasing exposure was investment grade, or
investment grade equivalent and consisted of exposures backed by
well-diversified assets, primarily large-ticket transportation
equipment and real estate. The largest component of our lease
residual value exposure is
freight-related rail cars. Assets are both domestic and foreignbased, with primary concentrations in the U.S. and Germany.
Other residential mortgages
The other residential mortgages portfolio primarily consists of 1-4
family residential mortgage loans and totaled $364 million at
March 31, 2021 and $389 million at Dec. 31, 2020. Included in this
portfolio at March 31, 2021 were $63 million of mortgage loans
purchased in 2005, 2006 and the first quarter of 2007.
Overdrafts
Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities clearance
clients and are generally repaid within two business days.
Other loans
Other loans primarily include loans to consumers that are fully
collateralized with equities, mutual funds and fixed-income
securities.
Margin loans
Margin loan exposure of $18.0 billion at March 31, 2021 and $15.5
billion at Dec. 31, 2020 was collateralized with marketable
securities. Borrowers are required to maintain a daily collateral
margin in excess of 100% of the value of the loan. Margin loans
included $6.1 billion at March 31, 2021 and $4.6 billion at Dec. 31,
2020 related to a term loan program that offers fully collateralized
loans to broker-dealers.

Allowance for credit losses
Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade clients who are active users of our non-credit services. Our primary exposure to the credit risk
of a customer consists of funded loans, unfunded contractual commitments to lend, standby letters of credit and overdrafts associated with our
custody and securities clearance businesses.
The following table details changes in our allowance for credit losses.

(a) In 2020, we adopted new accounting guidance included in ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.
Includes the reclassification of credit-related reserves on accounts receivable of $4 million.
(b) Includes allowance for credit losses on federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements, available-for-sale securities, held-to-maturity securities,
accounts receivable, cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits with banks.
N/A – Not applicable.
The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $83 million in the
first quarter of 2021, primarily driven by an improved
macroeconomic forecast.
We had $17.9 billion of secured margin loans on our balance sheet
at March 31, 2021 compared with $15.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2020.
We have rarely suffered a loss on these types of loans. As a result,
we believe that the ratio of allowance for loan losses and lendingrelated commitments as a percentage of non-margin loans is a more
appropriate metric to measure the adequacy of the reserve.
The allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-related
commitments represent management’s estimate of lifetime
expected losses in our credit portfolio. This evaluation process is
subject to numerous estimates and judgments. To the extent actual
results differ from forecasts or management’s judgment, the
allowance for credit losses may be greater or less than future
charge-offs.
Based on an evaluation of the allowance for credit losses as
discussed in “Critical accounting estimates,” in our 2020 Annual
Report, we have allocated our allowance for loans and lendingrelated commitments as presented below.

Wealth management (a) 2 2 3
Lease financings 1 1 5
Total 100 % 100 % 100 %
(a) Includes the allowance for credit losses on wealth management mortgages.
The allocation of the allowance for credit losses is inherently
judgmental, and the entire allowance for credit losses is available
to absorb credit losses regardless of the nature of the losses.
Our allowance for credit losses is sensitive to a number of inputs,
most notably the credit ratings assigned to each borrower, as well
as macroeconomic forecast assumptions that are incorporated in
our estimate of credit losses through the expected life of the loan
portfolio. Thus, as the macroeconomic environment and related
forecasts change, the allowance for credit losses may change
materially. The following sensitivity analyses do not represent
management’s expectations of the deterioration of our portfolios or
the economic environment, but are provided as hypothetical
scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses
to changes in key inputs. If each credit were rated one grade better,
the quantitative allowance would have decreased by $123 million,
and if each credit were rated one grade worse, the quantitative
allowance would have increased by $139 million. Our multiscenario based macroeconomic forecast used in determining the
March 31, 2021 allowance for credit losses consisted of three
scenarios. The baseline scenario reflects moderate and flat GDP
growth and unemployment recovery but with declining commercial
real estate prices that begin to recover later in 2021. The upside
scenario reflects faster GDP growth and unemployment recovery
and less severe commercial real estate declines than the baseline.
The downside scenario contemplates negative GDP growth and
increasing unemployment throughout 2021 and steeper declines in
commercial real estate prices than the baseline. Consistent with the
fourth quarter of 2020, we placed the most weight on our baseline
scenario, with the remaining weighting resulting in slightly more
weight placed on the downside scenario than the upside scenario.
From a sensitivity perspective, at March 31, 2021, if we had
applied 100% weighting to the downside scenario, the quantitative
allowance for credit losses would have been approximately
$190 million higher.
Nonperforming assets
The table below presents our nonperforming assets.

Total allowance for credit
losses/nonperforming assets 357.1 538.2
Nonperforming assets increased $23 million compared with Dec.
31, 2020, primarily reflecting an increase in nonperforming loans
in the commercial real estate portfolio.
Lost interest
Interest revenue would have increased by $1 million in the first
quarter of 2021, fourth quarter of 2020 and first quarter of 2020, if
nonperforming loans at period-end had been performing for the
entire respective periods.
Loan modifications
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, there have been two forms of
relief provided for classifying loans as troubled debt restructurings
(“TDRs”): The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security
Act (the “CARES Act”), the relevant provisions of which were
extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, and the
Interagency Guidance. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements of our 2020 Annual Report for additional
details on this guidance. Financial institutions may account for
eligible loan modifications either under the CARES
28 BNY Mellon
Act or the Interagency Guidance and we have elected to apply
both, as applicable, in providing borrowers with loan modification
relief in response to the coronavirus pandemic. We modified loans
of $6 million in the first quarter of 2021, less than $1 million in the
first quarter of 2020 and $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Nearly all of the modifications were short-term loan payment
forbearances or modified principal and/or interest payments. These
loans were primarily residential mortgage and commercial real
estate loans. We also modified $14 million of commercial real
estate loans in the first quarter of 2021 by providing payment
modifications and an extension of maturity. We did not identify any
of the modifications as TDRs. At March 31, 2021, the unpaid
principal balance of the loans modified under the CARES Act or
Interagency Guidance was $91 million.
Deposits
Total deposits were $336.8 billion at March 31, 2021, a decrease of
1%, compared with $341.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The decrease
primarily reflects lower interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S.
offices, partially offset by higher noninterest-bearing deposits
(principally U.S. offices).
Noninterest-bearing deposits were $95.3 billion at March 31, 2021
compared with $83.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. Interest-bearing
deposits were $241.5 billion at March 31, 2021, compared with
$257.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2020.
Short-term borrowings
We fund ourselves primarily through deposits and, to a lesser
extent, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Short-term
borrowings consist of federal funds purchased and securities sold
under repurchase agreements, payables to customers and brokerdealers, commercial paper and other borrowed funds. Certain
short-term borrowings, for example, securities sold under
repurchase agreements, require the delivery of securities as
collateral.
Information related to federal funds purchased and securities sold
under repurchase agreements is presented below.

the fourth quarter of 2020 and $80,216 million in the first quarter of 2020.
On a Non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of offsetting, the weightedaverage rates would have been (0.02)% for the first quarter of 2021, 0.00%
for the fourth quarter of 2020 and 1.18% for the first quarter of 2020. We
believe providing the rates excluding the impact of netting is useful to
investors as it is more reflective of the actual rates paid.
(b) Includes the impact of offsetting under enforceable netting agreements of
$33,544 million at March 31, 2021, $59,561 million at Dec. 31, 2020 and
$80,203 million at March 31, 2020.
Fluctuations of federal funds purchased and securities sold under
repurchase agreements reflect changes in overnight borrowing
opportunities. The decrease of the weighted-average rates
compared with March 31, 2020 primarily reflects lower interest
rates and repurchase agreement activity with the Fixed Income
Clearing Corporation (the “FICC”), where we record interest
expense gross, but the ending and average balances reflect the
impact of offsetting under enforceable netting agreements. This
activity primarily relates to government securities collateralized
resale and repurchase agreements executed with clients that are
novated to and settle with the FICC.

fourth quarter of 2020 and $16,386 million in the first quarter of 2020.
Payables to customers and broker-dealers represent funds awaiting
reinvestment and short sale proceeds payable on demand. Payables
to customers and broker-dealers are driven by customer trading
activity and market volatility.

March 31, 2020 primarily reflects the continuation of elevated
deposit levels.

Other borrowed funds primarily include overdrafts of subcustodian account balances in our Investment Services businesses,
finance lease liabilities, borrowings under lines of credit by our
Pershing subsidiaries and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan
Bank. Borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston under
the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (the “MMLF”)
program are also included in other borrowed funds at Dec. 31,
2020 and March 31, 2020. Overdrafts typically relate to timing
differences for settlements. The decreases in other borrowed funds
compared with March 31, 2020 and Dec. 31, 2020 reflect lower
overdrafts of sub-custodian account balances in our Investment
Services businesses. The decrease in other borrowed funds
compared with March 31, 2020 also reflects a decline in
borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston under the
MMLF program and the Federal Home Loan Bank.
Liquidity and dividends
BNY Mellon defines liquidity as the ability of the Parent and its
subsidiaries to access funding or convert assets to cash quickly and
efficiently, or to roll over or issue new debt, especially during
periods of market stress, at a reasonable cost, and in order to meet
its short-term (up to one year) obligations. Funding liquidity risk is
the risk that BNY Mellon cannot meet its cash and collateral
obligations at a reasonable cost for both expected and unexpected
cash flow and collateral needs without adversely affecting daily
operations or our financial condition. Funding liquidity risk can
arise from funding mismatches, market constraints from the
inability to convert assets into cash, the inability to hold or raise
cash, low overnight deposits, deposit run-off or contingent liquidity
events.
30 BNY Mellon
Changes in economic conditions or exposure to credit, market,
operational, legal and reputational risks also can affect BNY
Mellon’s liquidity risk profile and are considered in our liquidity
risk framework. For additional information, see “Risk Management
– Liquidity Risk” in our 2020 Annual Report.
The Parent’s policy is to have access to sufficient unencumbered
cash and cash equivalents at each quarter-end to cover maturities
and other forecasted debt redemptions, net interest payments and
net tax payments for the following 18-month period, and to provide
sufficient collateral to satisfy transactions subject to Section 23A of
the Federal Reserve Act. As of March 31, 2021, the Parent was in
compliance with this policy.
We monitor and control liquidity exposures and funding needs
within and across significant legal entities, branches, currencies
and business lines,
taking into account, among other factors, any applicable
restrictions on the transfer of liquidity among entities.
BNY Mellon also manages potential intraday liquidity risks. We
monitor and manage intraday liquidity against existing and
expected intraday liquid resources (such as cash balances,
remaining intraday credit capacity, intraday contingency funding
and available collateral) to enable BNY Mellon to meet its intraday
obligations under normal and reasonably severe stressed
conditions.
We define available funds for internal liquidity management
purposes as cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits
with the Federal Reserve and other central banks, interest-bearing
deposits with banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased
under resale agreements. The following table presents our total
available funds at period end and on an average basis.
Available funds

Total available funds as a percentage of total assets 39 % 42 % 40 % 38 % 35 %
Total available funds were $183.5 billion at March 31, 2021,
compared with $196.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The decrease was
primarily due to lower interest-bearing deposits with the Federal
Reserve and other central banks.
Average non-core sources of funds, such as federal funds
purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements, trading
liabilities, commercial paper and other borrowed funds, were $17.8
billion for both the first three months of 2021 and the first three
months of 2020.
Average foreign deposits, primarily from our European-based
Investment Services business, were $116.6 billion for the first three
months of 2021, compared with $97.7 billion for the first three
months of 2020. Average interest-bearing domestic deposits were
$128.5 billion for the first three months of 2021 and $99.9 billion
for the first three months of 2020.
The increase primarily reflects increased client activity.
Average payables to customers and broker-dealers were $17.7
billion for the first three months of 2021 and $16.4 billion for the
first three months of 2020. Payables to customers and brokerdealers are driven by customer trading activity and market
volatility.
Average long-term debt was $26.2 billion for the first three months
of 2021 and $27.2 billion for the first three months of 2020.
Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased to $83.4 billion for
the first three months of 2021 from $60.6 billion for the first three
months of 2020, primarily reflecting client activity.
A significant reduction in our Investment Services business would
reduce our access to deposits. See
BNY Mellon 31
“Asset/liability management” for additional factors that could
impact our deposit balances.
Sources of liquidity
The Parent’s major sources of liquidity are access to the debt and
equity markets, dividends from its subsidiaries, and cash on hand
and cash otherwise
made available in business-as-usual circumstances to the Parent
through a committed credit facility with our intermediate holding
company (“IHC”).
Our ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms, or at
all, is partially dependent on our credit ratings, which are as
follows:
Credit ratings at March 31, 2021
Moody’s S&P Fitch DBRS

(a) Represents senior debt issuer default rating.
NR – Not rated.
Long-term debt totaled $25.4 billion at March 31, 2021 and $26.0
billion at Dec. 31, 2020. A redemption of $1.0 billion, a maturity of
$500 million and a decrease in the fair value of hedged long-term
debt were partially offset by issuances of $1.2 billion. The Parent
has $2.75 billion of long-term debt that will mature in the
remainder of 2021.
In April 2021, the Parent redeemed $1.25 billion of the outstanding
2.050% senior notes due May 2021 at par plus accrued and unpaid
interest.
In April 2021, the Parent issued $600 million of fixed rate senior
notes maturing in 2024 at an annual interest rate of 0.50%, $500
million of fixed rate senior notes maturing in 2028 at an annual
interest rate of 1.65% and $400 million of floating rate senior notes
maturing in 2024 at an annual interest rate of the compounded
secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) plus 26 basis points.
The Bank of New York Mellon may issue notes and CDs. At
March 31, 2021 and Dec. 31, 2020, $30 million of notes were
outstanding. There were no CDs outstanding at March 31, 2021
and $100 million outstanding at Dec. 31, 2020.
The Bank of New York Mellon also issues commercial paper that
matures within 397 days from the date of issue and is not
redeemable prior to maturity or subject to voluntary prepayment.
There was no commercial paper outstanding at March 31, 2021 and
Dec. 31, 2020. The average commercial paper outstanding was
$1.6 billion for the first three months of 2020.
Subsequent to March 31, 2021, our U.S. bank subsidiaries could
declare dividends to the Parent of approximately $1.9 billion,
without the need for a regulatory waiver. In addition, at March 31,
2021, non-bank subsidiaries of the Parent had liquid assets of
approximately $3.6 billion. Restrictions on our ability to obtain
funds from our subsidiaries are
32 BNY Mellon
discussed in more detail in “Supervision and Regulation – Capital
Planning and Stress Testing – Payment of Dividends, Stock
Repurchases and Other Capital Distributions” and in Note 19 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, both in our 2020
Annual Report.
Pershing LLC has uncommitted lines of credit in place for liquidity
purposes which are guaranteed by the Parent. Pershing LLC has
two separate uncommitted lines of credit amounting to $350
million in aggregate. There were no borrowings under these lines
in the first quarter of 2021. Pershing Limited, an indirect UK-based
subsidiary of BNY Mellon, has two separate uncommitted lines of
credit amounting to $267 million in aggregate. Average borrowings
under these lines were $71 million, in aggregate, in the first quarter
of 2021.
The double leverage ratio is the ratio of our equity investment in
subsidiaries divided by our consolidated Parent company equity,
which includes our noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. In
short, the double leverage ratio measures the extent to which equity
in subsidiaries is financed by Parent company debt. As the double
leverage ratio increases, this can reflect greater demands on a
company’s cash flows in order to service interest payments and
debt maturities. BNY Mellon’s double leverage ratio is managed in
a range considering the high level of unencumbered available
liquid assets held in its principal subsidiaries (such as central bank
deposit placements and government securities), the Company’s
cash generating fee-based business model, with fee revenue
representing 83% of total revenue in the first quarter of 2021, and
the dividend capacity of our banking subsidiaries. Our double
leverage ratio was 115.7% at March 31, 2021 and 114.3% at Dec.
31, 2020, and within the range targeted by management.
Uses of funds
The Parent’s major uses of funds are repurchases of common stock,
payment of dividends, principal and interest payments on its
borrowings, acquisitions and additional investments in its
subsidiaries.
In February 2021, a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per common share
was paid to common shareholders. Our common stock dividend
payout ratio was 32% for the first quarter of 2021.
In the first quarter of 2021, we repurchased 16.8 million common
shares at an average price of $41.68 per common share, for a total
cost of $699 million.
See “Recent regulatory developments” for additional information
on the modified restrictions on common stock repurchases and
common stock dividends applicable to the first and second quarters
of 2021. Also see “Supervision and Regulation – Capital Planning
and Stress Testing – Payment of Dividends, Stock Repurchases and
Other Capital Distributions” in our 2020 Annual Report for
additional information related to the 2020 CCAR.
Liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”)
U.S. regulators have established an LCR that requires certain
banking organizations, including BNY Mellon, to maintain a
minimum amount of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets
(“HQLA”) sufficient to withstand the net cash outflow under a
hypothetical standardized acute liquidity stress scenario for a 30-
day time horizon.
The following table presents BNY Mellon’s consolidated HQLA at
March 31, 2021, and the average HQLA and average LCR for the
first quarter of 2021.
Consolidated HQLA and LCR March 31, 2021
(dollars in billions)
Securities (a) $ 120
Cash (b) 126
Total consolidated HQLA (c) $ 246
Total consolidated HQLA – average (c) $ 243
Average LCR 110 %
(a) Primarily includes securities of U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, U.S.
Treasury, sovereign securities, U.S. agency and investment-grade corporate
debt.
(b) Primarily includes cash on deposit with central banks.
(c) Consolidated HQLA presented before adjustments. After haircuts and the
impact of trapped liquidity, consolidated HQLA totaled $182 billion at
March 31, 2021 and averaged $176 billion for the first quarter of 2021.
BNY Mellon and each of our affected domestic bank subsidiaries
were compliant with the U.S. LCR requirements of at least 100%
throughout the first quarter of 2021.

Statement of cash flows
The following summarizes the activity reflected on the
consolidated statement of cash flows. While this information may
be helpful to highlight certain macro trends and business strategies,
the cash flow analysis may not be as relevant when analyzing
changes in our net earnings and net assets. We believe that in
addition to the traditional cash flow analysis, the discussion related
to liquidity and dividends and asset/liability management herein
may provide more useful context in evaluating our liquidity
position and related activity.
Net cash used for operating activities was $3.2 billion in the three
months ended March 31, 2021, compared with $1.7 billion in the
three months ended March 31, 2020. In the three months ended
March 31, 2021 cash flows used for operations primarily resulted
from changes in trading assets and liabilities and change in
accruals and other, net, partially offset by earnings. In the three
months ended March 31, 2020, cash flows used for operations
primarily resulted from changes in accruals and other, net, partially
offset by earnings and changes in trading assets and liabilities.
Net cash provided by investing activities was $4.7 billion in the
three months ended March 31, 2021,
compared with net cash used for investing activities of $78.6
billion in the three months ended March 31, 2020. In the three
months ended March 31, 2021, net cash provided by investing
activities primarily reflects changes in interest-bearing deposits
with the Federal Reserve and other central banks, partially offset
by changes in interest-bearing deposits with banks and net change
in loans. In the three months ended March 31, 2020, net cash used
for investing activities primarily reflects changes in interestbearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks
and net changes in securities, loans and interest-bearing deposits
with banks.
Net cash used for financing activities was $1.5 billion in the three
months ended March 31, 2021, compared with net cash provided
by financing activities of $82.9 billion in the three months ended
March 31, 2020. In the three months ended March 31, 2021, net
cash used for financing activities primarily reflects changes in
deposits, repayments of long-term debt and changes in payables to
customers and broker-dealers, partially offset by changes in federal
funds purchased and securities sold under repurchased agreements.
In the three months ended March 31, 2020, net cash provided by
financing activities primarily reflects changes in deposits.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total shareholders’
equity decreased to $45.0 billion at March 31, 2021 from $45.8
billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The decrease primarily reflects unrealized
losses on securities available-for-sale, common stock repurchases
and dividends, partially offset by earnings.
The unrealized gain (after-tax) on our available-for-sale securities
portfolio, net of hedges, included in accumulated other
comprehensive income was $776 million at March 31, 2021,
compared with $1.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2020. The decrease in the
unrealized gain, net of tax, was primarily driven by higher market
interest rates.
In the first quarter of 2021, we repurchased 16.8 million common
shares at an average price of $41.68 per common share for a total
of $699 million under the current program.
In December 2020, the Federal Reserve released the results of the
second round of CCAR stress tests during 2020 and extended the
restriction on common stock dividends and open market common
stock repurchases applicable to participating CCAR BHCs,
including us, to the first quarter of 2021, with certain
modifications. In March 2021, the Federal Reserve extended these
restrictions through the second quarter of 2021. Under the modified
restrictions, we are authorized to conduct open market common
stock repurchases in an amount up to approximately $600 million
in the second quarter of 2021. See “Recent regulatory
developments” for additional information on the restrictions on
capital distributions.
Capital adequacy
Regulators establish certain levels of capital for BHCs and banks,
including BNY Mellon and our bank subsidiaries, in accordance
with established quantitative measurements. For the Parent to
maintain its status as a financial holding company (“FHC”), our
U.S. bank subsidiaries and BNY Mellon must, among other things,
qualify as “well capitalized.” As of March 31, 2021 and Dec. 31,
2020, BNY Mellon and our U.S. bank subsidiaries were “well
capitalized.” Failure to satisfy regulatory standards, including
“well capitalized” status or capital adequacy rules more generally,
could result in limitations on our activities and adversely affect our
financial condition. See the discussion of these matters in
“Supervision and Regulation – Regulated Entities of BNY Mellon
and Ancillary Regulatory Requirements” and “Risk Factors –
Operational Risk – Failure to satisfy regulatory standards,
including “well capitalized” and “well managed” status or capital
adequacy and liquidity rules more generally, could result in
limitations on our activities and adversely affect our business and
financial condition,” both of which are in our 2020 Annual Report.
The U.S. banking agencies’ capital rules are based on the
framework adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision (“BCBS”), as amended from time to time. For
additional information on these capital requirements, see
“Supervision and Regulation” in our 2020 Annual Report.

(a) Minimum requirements for March 31, 2021 include minimum thresholds plus currently applicable buffers. The U.S. global systemically important banks (“G-SIB”)
surcharge of 1.5% is subject to change. The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set to 0%. The stress capital buffer (“SCB”) requirement is 2.5%, equal to the
regulatory minimum for Standardized Approach capital ratios.
(b) For our CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, our effective capital ratios under U.S. capital rules are the lower of the ratios as calculated under the Standardized
and Advanced Approaches. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is based on Tier 1 capital and quarterly average total assets.
(c) The Federal Reserve’s regulations do not establish well capitalized thresholds for these measures for BHCs.
(d) The SLR is based on Tier 1 capital and total leverage exposure, which includes certain off-balance sheet exposures.
(e) The consolidated SLR at March 31, 2021 and Dec. 31, 2020 reflects the temporary exclusion of U.S. Treasury securities from total leverage exposure which increased our
consolidated SLR by 68 basis points and 72 basis points, respectively. The temporary exclusion ceased to apply beginning April 1, 2021.
Our CET1 ratio was 12.6% at March 31, 2021 determined under
the Standardized Approach and was 13.1% at Dec. 31, 2020 under
the Advanced Approaches. The decrease primarily reflects
unrealized losses on securities available-for-sale, capital deployed
through common stock repurchases and dividends and an increase
in RWAs under the Standardized Approach, partially offset by
capital generated through earnings.
Capital ratios vary depending on the size of the balance sheet at
period-end and the levels and types of investments in assets. The
balance sheet size fluctuates from period to period based on levels
of customer and market activity. In general, when servicing clients
are more actively trading securities, deposit balances and the
balance sheet as a whole are higher. In addition, when markets
experience significant volatility or stress, our balance sheet size
may increase considerably as client deposit levels increase.
Our capital ratios are necessarily subject to, among other things,
anticipated compliance with all necessary enhancements to model
calibration, approval by regulators of certain models used as part of
RWA calculations, other refinements, further implementation
guidance from regulators, market practices and standards and any
changes BNY Mellon may make to its businesses. As a
consequence of these factors, our capital ratios may materially
change, and may be volatile over time and from period to period.
Under the Advanced Approaches, our operational loss risk model is
informed by external losses, including fines and penalties levied
against institutions in the financial services industry, particularly
those that relate to businesses in which we operate, and as a result
external losses have impacted and could in the future impact the
amount of capital that we are required to hold.

Effective April 1, 2020 and lasting through March 31, 2021, BHCs
were permitted to temporarily exclude U.S. Treasury securities
from total leverage exposure used in the SLR calculation. This
temporary exclusion increased our consolidated SLR by 68 basis
points at March 31, 2021 and 72 basis points at Dec. 31, 2020. The
temporary exclusion also impacted the TLAC and LTD
calculations. BNY Mellon and The Bank of New York Mellon, as
custody banks, will continue to be able to exclude certain central
bank placements from the total leverage exposure used in the SLR
calculation, consistent with the amendments to the SLR finalized
by the U.S. banking agencies in 2019 pursuant to the Economic
Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. See
“Recent regulatory developments” for additional information.
Stress capital buf er
In August 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that BNY
Mellon’s SCB requirement would be 2.5%, equal to the regulatory
floor, effective as of Oct. 1, 2020. The SCB replaces the current
2.5% capital conservation buffer for Standardized Approach capital
ratios for CCAR BHCs. The SCB does not apply to bank
subsidiaries, which remain subject to the static 2.5% capital
conservation buffer.
The SCB final rule generally eliminates the requirement for prior
approval of common stock repurchases in excess of the
distributions in a firm’s capital plan, provided that such
distributions are consistent with applicable capital requirements
and buffers, including the SCB. In conjunction with the release of
the 2020 CCAR results, the Federal Reserve imposed restrictions
on capital distributions as described earlier in “Capital” and
“Recent regulatory developments.”
Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (“TLAC”)
The final TLAC rule establishing external TLAC, external longterm debt (“LTD”) and related requirements for U.S. G-SIBs,
including BNY Mellon, at the top-tier holding company level
became effective on Jan. 1, 2019. The following summarizes the
minimum requirements for BNY Mellon’s external TLAC and
external LTD ratios, plus currently applicable buffers.

(b) Buffer to be met using only CET1.
(c) Buffer to be met using only Tier 1 capital.
External TLAC consists of the Parent’s Tier 1 capital and eligible
unsecured LTD issued by it that has a remaining term to maturity
of at least one year and satisfies certain other conditions. Eligible
LTD consists of the unpaid principal balance of eligible unsecured
debt securities, subject to haircuts for amounts due to be paid
within two years, that satisfy certain other conditions. Debt issued
prior to Dec. 31, 2016 has been permanently grandfathered to the
extent these instruments otherwise would be ineligible only due to
containing impermissible acceleration rights or being governed by
foreign law.
The following table presents our external TLAC and external LTD
ratios.

N/A – Not applicable.
If BNY Mellon maintains risk-based ratio or leverage TLAC
measures above the minimum required level, but with a risk-based
ratio or leverage below the minimum level with buffers, we will
face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and discretionary
executive compensation based on the amount of the shortfall and
eligible retained income.

Trading activities and risk management
Our trading activities are focused on acting as a market-maker for
our customers, facilitating customer trades and risk-mitigating
hedging in compliance with the Volcker Rule. The risk from
market-making activities for customers is managed by our traders
and limited in total exposure through a system of position limits,
value-at-risk (“VaR”) methodology and other market sensitivity
measures. VaR is the potential loss in value due to adverse market
movements over a defined time horizon with a specified
confidence level. The calculation of our VaR used by management
and presented below assumes a one-day holding period, utilizes a
99% confidence level and incorporates non-linear product
characteristics. VaR facilitates comparisons across portfolios of
different risk characteristics. VaR also captures the diversification
of aggregated risk at the firm-wide level.
VaR represents a key risk management measure and it is important
to note the inherent limitations to VaR, which include:
• VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer time
horizons where moves may be extreme;
• VaR does not take account of potential variability of market
liquidity; and
• Previous moves in market risk factors may not produce accurate
predictions of all future market moves.
See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information on the VaR methodology.
The following tables indicate the calculated VaR amounts for the
trading portfolio for the designated periods using the historical
simulation VaR model.

The interest rate component of VaR represents instruments whose
values are predominantly driven by interest rate levels. These
instruments include, but are not limited to, U.S. Treasury
securities, swaps, swaptions, forward rate agreements, exchangetraded futures and options, and other interest rate derivative
products.
The foreign exchange component of VaR represents instruments
whose values predominantly vary with the level or volatility of
currency exchange rates or interest rates. These instruments
include, but are not limited to, currency balances, spot and forward
transactions, currency options and other currency derivative
products.
The equity component of VaR consists of instruments that
represent an ownership interest in the form of domestic and foreign
common stock or other equity-linked instruments. These
instruments include, but are not limited to, common stock,
exchange-traded funds, preferred stock, listed equity options (puts
and calls), OTC equity options, equity total return swaps, equity
index futures and other equity derivative products.
The credit component of VaR represents instruments whose values
are predominantly driven by credit spread levels, i.e., idiosyncratic
default risk. These instruments include, but are not limited to,
securities
BNY Mellon 39
with exposures from corporate and municipal credit spreads.
The diversification component of VaR is the risk reduction benefit
that occurs when combining portfolios and offsetting positions, and
from the correlated behavior of risk factor movements.
During the first quarter of 2021, interest rate risk generated 31% of
average gross VaR, foreign exchange risk generated 40% of
average gross VaR, equity risk generated 2% of average gross VaR
and credit risk generated 27% of average gross VaR. During the
first quarter of 2021, our daily trading loss did not exceed our
calculated VaR amount of the overall portfolio.
The following table of total daily trading revenue or loss illustrates

(a) Trading revenue (loss) includes realized and unrealized gains and losses primarily
related to spot and forward foreign exchange transactions, derivatives and securities
trades for our customers and excludes any associated commissions, underwriting fees
and net interest revenue.
Trading assets include debt and equity instruments and derivative
assets, primarily interest rate and foreign exchange contracts, not
designated as hedging instruments. Trading assets were $16.9
billion at March 31, 2021 and $15.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2020.
Trading liabilities include debt and equity instruments and
derivative liabilities, primarily interest rate and foreign exchange
contracts, not designated as hedging instruments. Trading liabilities
were $4.6 billion at March 31, 2021 and $6.0 billion at Dec. 31,
2020.
Under our fair value methodology for derivative contracts, an
initial “risk-neutral” valuation is
performed on each position assuming time-discounting based on a
AA credit curve. In addition, we consider credit risk in arriving at
the fair value of our derivatives.
We reflect external credit ratings as well as observable credit
default swap spreads for both ourselves and our counterparties
when measuring the fair value of our derivative positions.
Accordingly, the valuation of our derivative positions is sensitive
to the current changes in our own credit spreads, as well as those of
our counterparties.
At March 31, 2021, our OTC derivative assets, including those in
hedging relationships, of $3.5 billion included a credit valuation
adjustment (“CVA”) deduction of $24 million. Our OTC derivative
liabilities, including those in hedging relationships, of $2.9 billion
included a debit valuation adjustment (“DVA”) of $2 million
related to our own credit spread. Net of hedges, the CVA increased
$1 million and the DVA decreased by less than $1 million in the
first quarter of 2021, which decreased other trading revenue by $1
million. The net impact increased other trading revenue by less
than $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 and increased other
trading revenue by $4 million in the first quarter of 2020.
The table below summarizes the distribution of credit ratings for
our foreign exchange and interest rate derivative counterparties
over the past five quarters, which indicates the level of
counterparty credit associated with these trading activities.
Significant changes in counterparty credit ratings could alter the

Asset/liability management
Our diversified business activities include processing securities,
accepting deposits, investing in securities, lending, raising money
as needed to fund assets and other transactions. The market risks
from these activities include interest rate risk and foreign exchange
risk. Our primary market risk is exposure to movements in U.S.
dollar interest rates and certain foreign currency interest rates. We
actively manage interest rate sensitivity and use earnings
simulation and discounted cash flow models to identify interest
rate exposures.
An earnings simulation model is the primary tool used to assess
changes in pre-tax net interest revenue. The model incorporates
management’s assumptions regarding interest rates, market
spreads, changes in the prepayment behavior of loans and
securities and the impact of derivative financial instruments used
for interest rate risk management purposes. These assumptions
have been developed through a combination of historical analysis
and future expected pricing behavior and are inherently uncertain.
Actual results may differ materially from projected results due to
timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, and
changes in market conditions and management’s strategies, among
other factors.
In the table below, we use the earnings simulation model to run
various interest rate ramp scenarios from a baseline scenario. The
interest rate ramp scenarios examine the impact of large interest
rate movements. In each scenario, all currencies’ interest rates are
shifted higher or lower. Typically, the baseline scenario uses the
average deposit balances of the last month of the quarter. However,
during the months of December 2020 and March 2020, we
experienced a significant increase in deposits and a corresponding
increase in central bank placements. To normalize the analysis, we
used the fourth and first quarter 2020 averages, respectively, for
these balances. The 100 basis point ramp scenario assumes rates
change 25 basis points above or below the yield curve in each of
the next four quarters and the 200 basis point ramp scenario
assumes a 50 basis point per quarter change. Interest rate
sensitivity is quantified by calculating the change in pre-tax net
interest revenue between the scenarios over a 12-month
measurement period. The net interest revenue sensitivity
methodology assumes static deposit levels
and also assumes that no management actions will be taken to
mitigate the effects of interest rate changes.
The following table shows net interest revenue sensitivity for BNY
Mellon.

The increases in the scenarios compared with Dec. 31, 2020 and
March 31, 2020 are primarily driven by increased deposits.
While the net interest revenue sensitivity scenarios calculations
assume static deposit balances to facilitate consistent period-overperiod comparisons, it is likely that a portion of the recent
monetary policy-driven deposit inflows would run-off in rising rate
environments, such as the up 100 bps and up 200 bps parallel
ramps. Noninterest-bearing deposits are particularly sensitive to
changes in short-term rates.
To illustrate the net interest revenue sensitivity to deposit runoff,
we note that a $5 billion instantaneous reduction of U.S. dollar
denominated noninterest-bearing deposits would reduce the net
interest revenue sensitivity results in the ramp up 100 basis point
and 200 basis point scenarios in the table above by approximately
$30 million and approximately $65 million, respectively. The
impact would be smaller if the runoff was assumed to be a mixture
of interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits.
For a discussion of factors impacting the growth or contraction of
deposits, see “Risk Factors – Our business, financial condition and
results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not
effectively manage our liquidity,” in our 2020 Annual Report.

Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP and
Non-GAAP financial measures
BNY Mellon has included in this Form 10-Q certain Non-GAAP
financial measures on a tangible basis as a supplement to GAAP
information, which exclude goodwill and intangible assets, net of
deferred tax liabilities. We believe that the return on tangible
common equity is additional useful information for investors
because it presents a measure of those assets that can generate
income, and the tangible book value per common share is
additional useful information because it presents the level of
tangible assets in relation to shares of common stock outstanding.
The presentation of the growth rates of investment management
and performance fees on a constant currency basis permits
investors to assess the significance of changes in foreign currency
exchange rates. Growth rates on a constant currency basis were
determined by applying the current period foreign currency
exchange rates to the prior period revenue. We believe that this
presentation, as a supplement to GAAP information, gives
investors a clearer picture of the related revenue results without the
variability caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates.
BNY Mellon has also included the adjusted pre-tax operating
margin – Non-GAAP, which is the pre-tax operating margin for the
Investment and Wealth Management business, net of distribution
and servicing expense that was passed to third parties who
distribute or service our managed funds. We believe that this
measure is useful when evaluating the performance of the
Investment and Wealth Management business relative to industry
competitors.

Recent regulatory developments
For a summary of additional regulatory matters relevant to our
operations, see “Supervision and Regulation” in our 2020 Annual
Report. The following discussions summarize certain regulatory,
legislative and other developments that may affect BNY Mellon.
End of Temporary Restrictions on Capital Distributions
On March 25, 2021, the Federal Reserve announced that the
temporary restrictions on the dividends and share repurchases of
certain BHCs that are subject to CCAR currently in effect will end
after June 30, 2021 for the CCAR BHCs that remain above all of
their minimum risk-based capital requirements after completion of
the current round of stress tests. For the first quarter of 2021,
CCAR BHCs, such as BNY Mellon, were generally authorized to
repurchase stock in connection with employee benefit plans; pay
dividends and make share repurchases that, in the aggregate, do not
exceed an amount equal to the firm’s average net income for the
four preceding quarters, provided that common stock dividends
would not be increased; and redeem and make scheduled payments
on additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments. The Federal
Reserve has announced that these restrictions will remain in place
for the second quarter of 2021. The Federal Reserve has also
announced that after June 30, 2021, the CCAR BHCs that are no
longer subject to these temporary restrictions will continue to be
subject to the normal constraints under the SCB framework. For
additional information regarding the SCB framework, capital
planning and stress testing, see “Supervision and Regulation –
Capital Planning and Stress Testing” in our 2020 Annual Report.
Expiration of Certain Temporary Relief Measures and Facilities
On March 19, 2021, the Federal Reserve announced that the
temporary exclusions of on-balance sheet amounts of U.S.
Treasury securities from the SLR calculations for certain BHCs
and depository institutions which were put in place by the U.S.
banking agencies in 2020 expired as scheduled on March 31, 2021.
BNY Mellon and The Bank of New York Mellon, as custody
banks, will continue to be able to exclude certain central bank
placements from the total leverage exposure used in the SLR
calculation, consistent with the amendments to the
SLR finalized by the U.S. banking agencies in 2019 pursuant to the
Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection
Act.
Also on March 31, 2021, the MMLF program, which was designed
to provide indirect liquidity to money market mutual funds, expired
as scheduled. For additional information regarding these and other
temporary measures, see “Supervision and Regulation – PandemicRelated Measures” in our 2020 Annual Report.
Other matters
On March 5, 2021, the administrator of LIBOR announced that it
would cease the publication of non-U.S. dollar London Interbank
Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) settings and one-week and two-month
U.S. dollar LIBOR settings on Dec. 31, 2021 and would cease the
publication of the other U.S. dollar LIBOR settings on June 30,
2023. On the same day, the UK Financial Conduct Authority
(“FCA”) made a related announcement regarding when LIBOR
settings will cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer
be representative. The International Swaps and Derivatives
Association (“ISDA”) also announced that the FCA’s
announcement was an index cessation event under its fallbacks
protocol for all LIBOR settings and that consequently, the fallback
spread adjustment was fixed as of the date of the announcement.
In April 2021, New York adopted legislation that provides a
statutory fallback mechanism to replace LIBOR with a benchmark
rate based on SOFR for New York-law governed contracts that
reference LIBOR and either have no fallback provisions or
provisions that are based on LIBOR. The New York legislation also
has a safe harbor regarding the selection and use of that SOFRbased benchmark rate.
The U.S. bank regulators have issued guidance strongly
encouraging banking organizations to cease using U.S. dollar
LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts as soon as practicable
and in any event by Dec. 31, 2021. We are continuing to work to
facilitate an orderly transition from interbank offered rates,
including LIBOR, to alternative reference rates for us and our
clients.
