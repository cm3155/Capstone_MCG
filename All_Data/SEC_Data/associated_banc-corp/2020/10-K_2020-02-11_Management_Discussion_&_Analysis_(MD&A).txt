 ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ##TABLE_END

The following discussion is management&#8217;s analysis to assist in the understanding and evaluation of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Corporation. It should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report. Within the tables presented, certain columns and rows may not sum due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. 

The detailed financial discussion that follows focuses on 2019 results compared to 2018. For a discussion of 2018 results compared to 2017 see the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 . 

Overview 

The Corporation is a bank holding company headquartered in Wisconsin, providing a broad array of banking and nonbanking products and services to businesses and consumers primarily within our three-state footprint. The Corporation&#8217;s primary sources of revenue, through the Bank, are net interest income (predominantly from loans and investment securities) and noninterest income (principally fees and other revenue from financial services provided to customers or ancillary services tied to loans and deposits). 

Performance Summary and 2020 Outlook 

&#8226; Diluted earnings per common share of $1.91 in 2019 increased $0.02, or 1%, from 2018. 

&#8226; Average loans of $23.1 billion for 2019 increased $405 million, or 2%, from a year ago. Average deposits of $24.7 billion for 2019 increased $664 million, or 3%, from a year ago, driven by the Huntington branch acquisition. For 2020, the Corporation expects 2%-4% annual average loan growth. 

&#8226; Net interest income of $836 million in 2019 decreased $44 million, or 5%, from 2018. Net interest margin of 2.86% in 2019 decreased 11 bp from 2.97% in 2018. The decrease was driven primarily by lower prepayments and accretion related to the Bank Mutual acquisition in 2018. The decrease was additionally driven by compression in LIBOR rates outpacing reductions in funding costs resulting from Federal Reserve rate cuts. The Corporation expects 2020 net interest margin to be between 2.80% and 2.85%, assuming a stable interest rate environment. 

&#8226; Provision for credit losses was $16 million in 2019, compared to zero in 2018. For 2020, the Corporation expects the provision for credit losses to adjust with changes to risk grade, other indications of credit quality, and loan volume. On January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted ASU 2016-13 (CECL). The initial CECL impact is expected to result in a $70 million to $80 million after-tax charge and a corresponding 21 bp to 24 bp decrease in the tangible common equity ratio. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Corporation's impact of adoption. 

&#8226; Noninterest income of $381 million in 2019 increased $25 million, or 7%, from 2018. For 2020, the Corporation expects to earn between $375 million and $385 million of noninterest income. 

&#8226; Noninterest expenses of $794 million in 2019 decreased $28 million, or 3%, from 2018, primarily due to a $22 million decrease in acquisition related costs. For 2020, the Corporation expects noninterest expense will be between $790 million and $795 million.

(a) Beginning in 2018, the yield on tax-exempt loans and securities is computed on a fully tax-equivalent basis using a tax rate of 21% and is net of the effects of certain disallowed interest deductions. Prior to 2018, the yield on tax-exempt loans and securities was computed on a fully tax-equivalent basis using a tax rate of 35% and was net of the effects of certain disallowed interest deductions. 

(b) Nonaccrual loans and loans held for sale have been included in the average balances. 

(c) Interest income includes amortization of net deferred loan origination costs and net accreted purchase loan discount. 

(d) During the third quarter of 2019, the Corporation made a change in accounting policy to offset derivative assets and liabilities and cash collateral with the same counterparty where it has a legally enforceable master netting agreement in place. Adoption of this change was voluntary and has been adopted retrospectively with all prior periods presented herein revised. 

Net interest income is the primary source of the Corporation&#8217;s revenue. Net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the interest expense on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings used to fund interest-earning and other assets or activities. Net interest income is affected by the amount and composition of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the sensitivity of the balance sheet to changes in interest rates, including characteristics such as the fixed or variable nature of the financial instruments, contractual maturities, re-pricing frequencies, loan prepayment behavior, and the use of interest rate derivative financial instruments. 

Interest rate spread and net interest margin are utilized to measure and explain changes in net interest income. Interest rate spread is the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities that fund those assets. The net interest margin is expressed as the percentage of net interest income to average earning assets. The net interest margin exceeds the interest rate spread because net free funds, principally noninterest-bearing demand deposits and stockholders&#8217; equity, also support earning assets. To compare tax-exempt asset yields to taxable yields, the yield on tax-exempt loans and investment securities is computed on a fully tax-equivalent basis. Net interest income, interest rate spread, and net interest margin are discussed on a fully tax-equivalent basis. 

Table 2 provides average balances of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the associated interest income and expense, and the corresponding interest rates earned and paid, as well as net interest income, interest rate spread, and net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017. Table 3 presents additional information to facilitate the review and discussion of fully tax-equivalent net interest income, interest rate spread, and net interest margin. 

Notable Contributions to the Change in 2019 Net Interest Income 

&#8226; Net interest income on the consolidated statements of income (which excludes the fully tax-equivalent adjustment) was $836 million in 2019 compared to $880 million in 2018. The decrease was driven primarily by lower prepayments and accretion related to the Bank Mutual acquisition in 2018. The decrease was additionally driven by compression in LIBOR rates outpacing reductions in funding costs. See sections Interest Rate Risk and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a discussion of interest rate risk and market risk. 

&#8226; Fully tax-equivalent net interest income of $852 million for 2019 was $41 million lower than 2018. 

&#8226; Average earning assets of $29.8 billion in 2019 were $229 million, or 1%, lower than 2018. The decrease in average earning assets was driven by a $633 million, or 9%, decrease in average investments and other short-term investments, partially offset by a $405 million, or 2%, increase in average loans. The yield on investment securities and other short-term investments increased 24 bp to 2.82%. 

&#8226; Average interest-bearing liabilities of $23.5 billion in 2019 were down $165 million, or 1%, versus 2018. On average, interest-bearing deposits increased $682 million, or 4%. Average short- and long-term funding decreased $846 million from 2018 primarily driven by FHLB advances decreasing $866 million. 

&#8226; The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 1.43% in 2019, 27 bp higher than 2018. The increase was due to a 28 bp increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits to 1.22% and a 46 bp increase in the cost of short- and long-term funding to 2.48%. This is primarily due to the full year impact of the 2018 Federal Funds rate increases partially offset by the impact of the three Federal Funds rate cuts in the second half of 2019. 

&#8226; The Federal Reserve decreased the target Federal Funds rate on October 31, 2019 to a range of 1.50% to 1.75% compared to a range of 2.25% to 2.50% at the end of 2018. The Federal Reserve has indicated it will closely assess economic data and be patient before moving ahead with any additional changes in the Federal Funds rate. Therefore, the timing and magnitude of any such changes are uncertain and will depend on domestic and global economic conditions.

(a) The change in interest due to both rate and volume has been allocated in proportion to the relationship to the dollar amounts of the change in each. 

(b) Beginning in 2018, the yield on tax-exempt loans and securities is computed on a fully tax-equivalent basis using a tax rate of 21% and is net of the effects of certain disallowed 

interest deductions. Prior to 2018, the yield on tax-exempt loans and securities was computed on a fully tax-equivalent basis using a tax rate of 35% and was net of the effects of certain disallowed interest deductions. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses is predominantly a function of the Corporation&#8217;s reserving methodology and judgments as to other qualitative and quantitative factors used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded commitments, which focuses on changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio, changes in levels of impaired and other nonaccrual loans, historical losses and delinquencies in each portfolio category, the level of loans sold or transferred to held for sale, the risk inherent in specific loans, concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries, existing economic conditions, the fair value of underlying collateral, and other factors which could affect potential credit losses. See additional discussion under sections: Loans, Credit Risk, Nonperforming Assets, and Allowance for Credit Losses. 

&#8226; The provision for credit losses (which includes the provision for loan losses and the provision for unfunded commitments) was $16 million for 2019, compared to no provision for credit losses in 2018. 

&#8226; Net charge offs were $55 million, representing 0.24% of average loans, for 2019, compared to $30 million, representing 0.13% of average loans, for 2018. 

&#8226; The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was 0.88% and 1.04% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Notable Contributions to the Change in 2019 Noninterest Income 

&#8226; Mortgage banking, net was $32 million in 2019, an increase of $12 million, or 60%, compared to 2018. The increase was driven by higher mortgage banking revenues due to increased settlements and gain on sale, mostly resulting from higher refinance activity in 2019 and the portfolio mortgage sale that occurred during the third quarter of 2019. 

&#8226; Investment securities gains (losses), net was up $8 million from 2018 as a result of the ongoing portfolio restructuring and balance sheet deleveraging strategy. 

&#8226; Asset gains (losses), net was up $4 million compared to 2018. During 2018, the Corporation recognized a $2 million loss on the sale of a profit participation agreement that was received in partial satisfaction of a loan obligation. In addition, 2019 benefited from higher income and distributions from alternative investments.

Notable Contributions to the Change in 2019 Noninterest Expense 

&#8226; Acquisition costs decreased $22 million, or 75%, from 2018, due to higher Bank Mutual acquisition related costs in 2018 compared to Huntington branch and First Staunton acquisition related costs in 2019. 

&#8226; FDIC assessment expenses decreased $14 million, or 46%, from 2018, driven by the removal of the FDIC surcharge assessment in late 2018. 

&#8226; Technology expense of $82 million increased $10 million, or 13%, compared to 2018, driven by investments in solutions to enhance operational efficiency and the customer experience. 

&#8226; Personnel costs increased $4 million from 2018, primarily driven by a $3 million increase in restructuring and severance charges. 

Income Taxes 

The Corporation recognized income tax expense of $80 million for both 2018 and 2019. Income tax expense decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to a drop in income before taxes, an increase in tax exempt interest, and the expense from the settlement of litigation in Minnesota which was booked in 2018. However, this decrease was offset by the reductions in the benefits of Tax Act planning actions in 2019 relative to 2018. The effective tax rate was 19.6% for 2019, compared to an effective tax rate of 19.3% for 2018. 

See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the Corporation&#8217;s income tax accounting policy and section Critical Accounting Policies. Income tax expense recorded on the consolidated statements of income involves the interpretation and application of certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax laws and regulations, and is therefore considered a critical accounting policy. The Corporation is subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Examination by taxing authorities may impact the amount of tax expense and / or the reserve for uncertainty in income taxes if their interpretations differ from those of management, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations. See Note 13 Income Taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information.

(a) During the third quarter of 2019, the Corporation sold approximately $240 million of portfolio mortgages as well as $33 million of nonaccrual and performing restructured loans. 

(b) Includes $2 million and $5 million of purchased credit-impaired loans at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. 

The Corporation has long-term guidelines relative to the proportion of Commercial and Business, Commercial Real Estate, and Consumer loans within the overall loan portfolio, with each targeted to represent 30-40% of the overall loan portfolio. The targeted long-term guidelines were unchanged during 2019 and 2018. Furthermore, certain sub-asset classes within the respective portfolios were further defined and dollar limitations are placed on these sub-portfolios. These guidelines and limits are reviewed quarterly and approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors. These guidelines and limits are designed to create balance and diversification within the loan portfolios. 

The Corporation's loan distribution and interest rate sensitivity as of December 31, 2019 is summarized in the following table:

Credit Risk 

An active credit risk management process is used for commercial loans to ensure that sound and consistent credit decisions are made. Credit risk is controlled by detailed underwriting procedures, comprehensive loan administration, and periodic review of borrowers&#8217; outstanding loans and commitments. Borrower relationships are formally reviewed and graded on an ongoing basis for early identification of potential problems. Further analysis by customer, industry, and geographic location are performed to monitor trends, financial performance, and concentrations. See Note 4 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on managing overall credit quality. 

The loan portfolio is widely diversified by types of borrowers, industry groups, and market areas within the Corporation's branch footprint. Significant loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to numerous borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. At December 31, 2019, no significant concentrations existed in the Corporation&#8217;s loan portfolio in excess of 10% of total loans. 

Commercial and business lending: The commercial and business lending classification primarily includes commercial loans to large corporations, middle market companies, small businesses, and lease financing. 

Table 9 Largest Commercial and Business Lending Industry Group Exposures 

##TABLE_START December 31, 2019 % of Total Loans % of Total Commercial and Business Lending Manufacturing and Wholesale Trade 8 % 21 % Power and Utilities 7 % 19 % Real Estate 5 % 14 % ##TABLE_END

The remaining commercial and business lending portfolio is spread over a diverse range of industries, none of which exceed 5% of total loans. 

The credit risk related to commercial loans is largely influenced by general economic conditions and the resulting impact on a borrower&#8217;s operations or on the value of underlying collateral, if any. Currently, a higher risk segment of the commercial and business lending portfolio is loans to borrowers supporting oil and gas exploration and production, which are further discussed under section oil and gas lending below. 

Oil and gas lending: The Corporation provides reserve based loans to oil and gas exploration and production firms. At December 31, 2019, the oil and gas portfolio was comprised of 40 credits, totaling $484 million of outstanding balances, or 2%, of total loans. 

The Corporation's oil and gas lending team is based in Houston and focuses on serving the funding needs of small and mid-sized companies in the upstream oil and gas business. The oil and gas loans are first lien, reserve-based, and borrowing base dependent lines of credit. The portfolio is diversified across several major U.S. geographic basins and is diversified by product line with approximately 61% in oil and 39% in gas at December 31, 2019. Borrowing base re-determinations for the portfolio are generally completed at least twice a year and are based on detailed engineering reports and discounted cash flow analysis. 

The following table summarizes information about the Corporation's oil and gas loan portfolio:

Credit risk is managed in a similar manner to commercial and business lending by employing sound underwriting guidelines, lending primarily to borrowers in local markets and businesses, periodically evaluating the underlying collateral, and formally reviewing the borrower&#8217;s financial soundness and relationship on an ongoing basis. 

Real estate construction: Real estate construction loans are primarily short-term or interim loans that provide financing for the acquisition or development of commercial income properties, multi-family projects or residential development, both single family and condominium. Real estate construction loans are made to developers and project managers who are generally well known to the Corporation and have prior successful project experience. The credit risk associated with real estate construction loans is generally confined to specific geographic areas but is also influenced by general economic conditions. The Corporation controls the credit risk on these types of loans by making loans in familiar markets to established developers, reviewing the merits of individual projects, controlling loan structure, and monitoring project progress and construction advances. 

The Corporation&#8217;s current lending standards for commercial real estate and real estate construction lending are determined by property type and specifically address many criteria, including: maximum loan amounts, maximum LTV, requirements for pre-leasing and / or presales, minimum borrower equity, and maximum loan-to-cost. Currently, the maximum standard for LTV is 80%, with lower limits established for certain higher risk types, such as raw land that has a 50% LTV maximum. The Corporation&#8217;s LTV guidelines are in compliance with regulatory supervisory limits. In most cases, for real estate construction loans, the loan amounts include interest reserves, which are built into the loans and sized to fund loan payments through construction and lease up and / or sell out. 

Residential mortgages: Residential mortgage loans are primarily first lien home mortgages with a maximum loan-to-collateral value without credit enhancement (e.g., private mortgage insurance) of 80%. The residential mortgage portfolio is focused primarily in the Corporation's three-state branch footprint, with approximately 88% of the outstanding loan balances in the Corporation's branch footprint at December 31, 2019. The majority of the on balance sheet residential mortgage portfolio consists of hybrid, adjustable rate mortgage loans with initial fixed-rate terms of 3, 5, 7, or 10 years. 

The Corporation generally retains certain fixed-rate residential real estate mortgages in its loan portfolio, including retail and private banking jumbo mortgages and CRA-related mortgages. As part of management's historical practice of originating and servicing residential mortgage loans, generally the Corporation's 30 year, agency conforming, fixed-rate residential real estate mortgage loans have been sold in the secondary market with the servicing rights retained. Subject to management's analysis of the current interest rate environment, among other market factors, the Corporation may choose to retain 30 year mortgage loan production on its consolidated balance sheets. During the third quarter of 2019, the Corporation sold approximately $240 million of fixed-rate portfolio mortgages and $30 million in nonaccrual and performing restructured loans as part of the Corporation's deleveraging strategy which enabled the Corporation to pay down higher cost funding. The sale also reduced interest rate risk by lowering the Corporation's asset sensitivity and freed up capital in advance of the adoption of CECL in the first quarter of 2020. See section Loans for additional information on loans. 

The Corporation&#8217;s underwriting and risk-based pricing guidelines for residential mortgage loans include minimum borrower FICO score and maximum LTV of the property securing the loan. Residential mortgage products generally are underwritten using FHLMC and FNMA secondary marketing guidelines. 

Home equity: Home equity consists of both home equity lines of credit and closed-end home equity loans. The Corporation&#8217;s credit risk monitoring guidelines for home equity is based on an ongoing review of loan delinquency status, as well as a quarterly review of FICO score deterioration and property devaluation. The Corporation does not routinely obtain appraisals on performing loans to update LTV ratios after origination; however, the Corporation monitors the local housing markets by reviewing the various home price indices and incorporates the impact of the changing market conditions in its ongoing credit monitoring process. For junior lien home equity loans, the Corporation is unable to track the performance of the first lien loan if it does not own or service the first lien loan. However, the Corporation obtains a refreshed FICO score on a quarterly basis and monitors this as part of its assessment of the home equity portfolio. 

The Corporation&#8217;s underwriting and risk-based pricing guidelines for home equity lines and loans consist of a combination of both borrower FICO score and the original cumulative LTV against the property securing the loan. Currently, the Corporation's policy sets the maximum acceptable LTV at 90% and the minimum acceptable FICO score at 670. The Corporation's current home equity line of credit offering is priced based on floating rate indices and generally allows 10 years of interest-only payments followed by a 20-year amortization of the outstanding balance. The Corporation has significantly curtailed its offerings of fixed-rate, closed-end home equity loans. The loans in the Corporation's portfolio generally have an original term of 20 years with principal and interest payments required. During the third quarter of 2019, the Corporation sold approximately $3 million of home equity nonaccrual and performing restructured loans as part of the Corporation's deleveraging strategy which enabled the Corporation to pay down higher cost funding. The sale also reduced interest rate risk by lowering the Corporation's asset sensitivity and freed up capital in advance of the adoption of CECL in the first quarter of 2020. See section Loans for additional information on loans. 

Other consumer: Other consumer consists of student loans, short-term and other personal installment loans, and credit cards. The Corporation had $136 million and $162 million of student loans at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, the majority of which are government guaranteed. Credit risk for non-government guaranteed student, short-term, personal installment loans, and credit cards is influenced by general economic conditions, the characteristics of individual borrowers, and the nature of the loan collateral. Risks of loss are generally on smaller average balances per loan spread over many borrowers. Once charged off, there is usually less opportunity for recovery of these smaller consumer loans. Credit risk is primarily controlled by reviewing the creditworthiness of the borrowers, monitoring payment histories, and taking appropriate collateral and guarantee positions. The student loan portfolio is in run-off and no new student loans are being originated. 

Nonperforming Assets 

Management is committed to a proactive nonaccrual and problem loan identification philosophy. This philosophy is implemented through the ongoing monitoring and review of all pools of risk in the loan portfolio to ensure that problem loans are identified quickly and the risk of loss is minimized. The following table provides detailed information regarding nonperforming assets, which include nonaccrual loans, OREO, and other nonperforming assets:

(a) During the third quarter of 2019, the Corporation sold $33 million of residential mortgages and home equity loans, of which $21 million were performing restructured loans, $12 million were nonaccrual loans, and approximately $200,000 were accruing loans 30-89 days past due. Of the $12 million nonaccrual loans, $7 million were restructured loans. 

Nonaccrual loans: Nonaccrual loans are considered to be one indicator of potential future loan losses. See management&#8217;s accounting policy for nonaccrual loans in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 4 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional nonaccrual loan disclosures. See also sections Credit Risk and Allowance for Credit Losses. During the third quarter of 2019, the Corporation sold $12 million of nonaccrual loans, of which $11 million were residential mortgage loans and $1 million were home equity loans, as part of the Corporation's deleveraging strategy which enabled the Corporation to pay down higher cost funding. The sale also reduced interest rate risk by lowering the Corporation's asset sensitivity and freed up capital in advance of the adoption of CECL in the first quarter of 2020. 

Accruing loans past due 90 days or more: Loans past due 90 days or more but still accruing interest are classified as such where the underlying loans are both well secured (the collateral value is sufficient to cover principal and accrued interest) and in the process of collection. 

Restructured loans: Loans are considered restructured loans if concessions have been granted to borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty. See also Note 4 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional restructured loans disclosures. During the third quarter of 2019, the Corporation sold $21 million of performing restructured loans, of which $18 million were residential mortgage loans and $3 million were home equity loans, as part of the Corporation's deleveraging strategy which enabled the Corporation to pay down higher cost funding. The sale also reduced interest rate risk by lowering the Corporation's asset sensitivity and freed up capital in advance of the adoption of CECL in the first quarter of 2020. 

Potential problem loans: The level of potential problem loans is another predominant factor in determining the relative level of risk in the loan portfolio and in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. Potential problem loans are generally defined by management to include loans rated as substandard by management but that are not considered impaired (i.e., nonaccrual loans and accruing troubled debt restructurings); however, there are circumstances present to create doubt as to the ability of the borrower to comply with present repayment terms. The decision of management to include performing loans in 

potential problem loans does not necessarily mean that the Corporation expects losses to occur, but that management recognizes a higher degree of risk associated with these loans. 

OREO: Management actively seeks to ensure OREO properties held are monitored to minimize the Corporation's risk of loss. OREO properties increased $9 million, or 76%, from December 31, 2018, primarily driven by recently consolidated Huntington branches pending disposition. 

Other nonperforming assets: The amounts shown in the table above for 2017 and 2016 represented the Corporation's ownership interest in a profit participation agreement in an entity created to own certain oil and gas assets obtained as a result of the bankruptcy and liquidation of a borrower in partial satisfaction of their loan. During the third quarter of 2019, the Bank accepted a partial settlement of a debt by receiving units of ownership interest in an oil and gas limited liability company. 

Foregone Loan Interest: The following table shows, for those loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis and restructured loans for the years ended as indicated, the approximate gross interest that would have been recorded if the loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and the amount of interest income that was included in interest income for the period:

Allowance for Credit Losses 

Credit risks within the loan portfolio are inherently different for each loan type. Credit risk is controlled and monitored through the use of lending standards, a thorough review of potential borrowers, and ongoing review of loan payment performance. Active asset quality administration, including early problem loan identification and the timely resolution of problems, aids in the management of credit risk and minimization of loan losses. Credit risk management for each loan type is discussed in the section entitled Credit Risk. See Note 4 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures on the allowance for credit losses. 

The allowance for credit losses is comprised of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded commitments. The level of the allowance for loan losses represents management&#8217;s estimate of an amount appropriate to provide for probable credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities (including unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit) and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. 

The Corporation&#8217;s allowance for loan losses methodology considers an estimate of the historical loss emergence period (which is the period of time between the event that triggers a loss and the confirmation and / or charge off of that loss), probability of default, and loss given default for each loan portfolio segment. The methodology applied by the Corporation, designed to assess the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses, is based upon credit report refreshes and management&#8217;s ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio into criticized loan categories (defined as specific loans warranting either specific allocation, or a criticized status of special mention, substandard, doubtful, or loss). The methodology also focuses on the evaluation of many factors, including but not limited to: evaluation of facts and issues related to specific loans, management&#8217;s ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio, credit report refreshes, consideration of historical loan loss and delinquency experience on each portfolio category, trends in past due and nonaccrual loans, the level of potential problem loans, the risk characteristics of the various classifications of loan segments, changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio, concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries, existing economic conditions, the fair value of underlying collateral, and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. Assessing these factors involves significant judgment. Because each of the criteria used is subject to change, the allowance for loan losses is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future loan losses in any particular segment. Therefore, management considers the allowance for loan losses a critical accounting policy (see section Critical Accounting Policies). See section Nonperforming Assets for a detailed discussion on asset quality. See also management&#8217;s allowance for loan losses accounting policy in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and see Note 4 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional allowance for loan losses disclosures. Table 6 provides information on loan growth and composition, Tables 14 and 16 provide additional information regarding activity in the allowance for loan losses, and Table 12 provides additional information regarding nonperforming assets. 

The methodology used for the determination of the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 was generally comparable. The allocation methodology consists of the following components: First, a valuation allowance estimate is established for specifically identified commercial and consumer loans determined by the Corporation to be impaired, using discounted cash flows, estimated fair value of underlying collateral, and / or other data available. Second, management allocates the allowance for loan losses with loss factors by loan segment. Loans are segmented for criticized loan pools by loan type as well as for non-criticized loan pools by loan type, primarily based on historical loss rates after considering loan type, historical loss and delinquency experience, credit quality, and industry classifications. Loans that have been criticized are considered to have a higher risk of default than non-criticized loans, as circumstances were present to support the lower loan grade, warranting higher loss factors. The loss factors applied in the methodology are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted to reflect changes in historical loss levels or other risks. Additionally, management allocates allowance for loan losses to absorb losses that may not be provided for by the other components due to qualitative factors evaluated by management, such as limitations within the credit risk grading process, known current economic or business conditions that may not yet show in trends, industry or other concentrations with current issues that impose higher inherent risks than are reflected in the loss factors, and other relevant considerations. The total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the loan portfolio.

Notable Contributions to the Change in the Allowance for Credit Losses 

&#8226; At December 31, 2019, net charge offs of $55 million included $44 million of oil and gas charge offs and $11 million of net charge offs from all other portfolio categories. See Tables 14, 15 and 16 for additional information regarding the activity in the allowance for loan losses. See also oil and gas lending within the Credit Risk section for additional information. 

&#8226; Total loans decreased $119 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2018, primarily driven by the sale of approximately $240 million of portfolio mortgages during the third quarter of 2019, which was partially offset by $116 million in loans acquired during the second quarter of 2019 from the Huntington branch acquisition. See section Loans for additional information on the changes in the loan portfolio and see section Credit Risk for discussion about credit risk management for each loan type. 

&#8226; Total nonaccrual loans decreased $10 million from December 31, 2018, primarily driven by a $12 million nonaccrual loan sale that occurred during the third quarter of 2019. See also Note 4 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements and section Nonperforming Assets for additional disclosures on the changes in asset quality. 

&#8226; The allowance for loan losses attributable to oil and gas related credits (included within the commercial and industrial allowance for loan losses) was $12 million for both December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.

(a) Allowance for loan losses category as a percentage of total loans by category. 

Consolidated net income and stockholders&#8217; equity could be affected if management&#8217;s estimate of the allowance for loan losses is subsequently materially different, requiring additional or less provision for loan losses to be recorded. Management carefully considers numerous detailed and general factors, its assumptions, and the likelihood of materially different conditions that could alter its assumptions. While management uses currently available information to recognize losses on loans, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on newly received appraisals, updated commercial customer financial statements, rapidly deteriorating customer cash flow, and changes in economic conditions that affect our customers. Additionally, larger credit relationships do not inherently create more risk, but can create wider fluctuations in net charge offs and asset quality measures. As an integral part of their examination processes, various federal and state regulatory agencies also review the allowance for loan losses. These agencies may require additions to the allowance for loan losses or may require that certain loan balances be charged off or downgraded into criticized loan categories when their credit evaluations differ from those of management, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations. 

Investment Securities Portfolio 

Management of the investment securities portfolio involves the maximization of income while actively monitoring the portfolio's liquidity, market risk, quality of the investment securities, and its role in balance sheet and capital management. The Corporation classifies its investment securities as available for sale, held to maturity, or equity securities on the consolidated balance sheets at the time of purchase or adoption of a new accounting standard. Securities classified as available for sale may be sold from time to time in order to help manage interest rate risk, liquidity, credit quality, capital levels, or to take advantage of relative value opportunities in the marketplace. Investment securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets, while investment securities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost on the consolidated balance sheets. Investment securities classified as equity securities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value immediately reflected in earnings for periods after December 31, 2017.

(a) As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-01 effective January 1, 2018, equity securities are no longer presented within available for sale securities and are now presented as equity securities. 

At December 31, 2019, the Corporation&#8217;s investment securities portfolio did not contain securities of any single non-government or non-GSE issuer that were payable from and secured by the same source of revenue or taxing authority where the aggregate carrying value of such securities exceeded 5% of stockholders&#8217; equity or approximately $196 million. 

The Corporation did not recognize any credit-related other-than-temporary impairment write-downs during 2019, 2018, or 2017. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for management's accounting policy for investment securities and Note 3 Investment Securities of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional investment securities disclosures.

&#8226; Deposits are the Corporation's largest source of funds. 

&#8226; Total deposits decreased $1.1 billion, or 4%, from December 31, 2018 in conjunction with the Corporation's deleveraging strategy. On June 14, 2019, the Corporation assumed $725 million in deposits from the Huntington branch acquisition. As a result of the acquisition, the Corporation was able to reduce higher cost brokered CDs and network deposits. 

&#8226; Non-maturity deposit accounts comprised of savings, money market, and demand (both interest and non-interest bearing demand) accounts, accounted for 89% of our total deposits at December 31, 2019. 

&#8226; Included in the above amounts were $1.3 billion of network deposits, a decrease of $940 million, or 41%, from December 31, 2018. These deposits are primarily sourced from other financial institutions and intermediaries. Network deposits represented 6% of our deposits at December 31, 2019, which was down from 9% of our deposits at December 31, 2018.

Other Funding Sources 

Short-Term Funding: Short-term funding is comprised of federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and commercial paper. Many short-term funding sources are expected to be reissued and, therefore, do not represent an immediate need for cash. Short-term funding sources at December 31, 2019 were $465 million, an increase of $308 million from December 31, 2018. The increase in short-term funding was primarily due to an increase in federal funds purchased. 

Long-Term Funding: Long-term funding is comprised of senior notes, subordinated notes, and finance leases. Long-term funding at December 31, 2019 was $549 million, a decrease of $246 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to the redemption of $250 million of senior notes on October 15, 2019. 

FHLB Advances: FHLB advances are comprised of short-term FHLB advances (with original contractual maturities of one year or less) and long-term FHLB advances (with original contractual maturities greater than one year). FHLB advances at December 31, 2019 were $3.2 billion, down $393 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to a decrease in short-term FHLB advances. 

See Note 9 Short- and Long-Term Funding of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on short-term funding, long-term funding, and FHLB advances. See Table 2 for additional information on average funding and rates. 

Liquidity 

The objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that the Corporation has the ability to generate sufficient cash or cash equivalents in a timely and cost effective manner to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers and to meet its other commitments as they become due. The Corporation&#8217;s liquidity risk management process is designed to identify, measure, and manage the Corporation&#8217;s funding and liquidity risk to meet its daily funding needs in the ordinary course of business, as well as to address expected and unexpected changes in its funding requirements. The Corporation engages in various activities to manage its liquidity risk, including diversifying its funding sources, stress testing, and holding readily-marketable assets which can be used as a source of liquidity, if needed. 

The Corporation performs dynamic scenario analysis in accordance with industry best practices. Measures have been established to ensure the Corporation has sufficient high quality short-term liquidity to meet cash flow requirements under stressed scenarios. In addition, the Corporation also reviews static measures such as deposit funding as a percent of total assets and liquid asset levels. Strong capital ratios, credit quality, and core earnings are also essential to maintaining cost effective access to wholesale funding markets. At December 31, 2019, the Corporation was in compliance with its internal liquidity objectives and has sufficient asset based liquidity to meet its obligations even under a stressed scenario. 

The Corporation maintains diverse and readily available liquidity sources, including: 

&#8226; Investment securities, which are an important tool to the Corporation&#8217;s liquidity objective and can be pledged or sold to enhance liquidity, if necessary. See Note 3 Investment Securities of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Corporation's investment securities portfolio, including pledged investment securities. 

&#8226; Pledgeable loan collateral, which is eligible collateral with both the Federal Reserve Bank and the FHLB under established lines of credit. Based on the amount of collateral pledged, the FHLB established a collateral value from which the Bank may draw advances against the collateral. The collateral is also used to enable the FHLB to issue letters of credit in favor of public fund depositors of the Bank. As of December 31, 2019, the Bank had $4.3 billion available for future advances. The Federal Reserve Bank also establishes a collateral value of assets to support borrowings from the discount window. As of December 31, 2019, the Bank had $1.2 billion available for discount window borrowings. 

&#8226; A $200 million Parent Company commercial paper program, of which $32 million was outstanding at December 31, 2019. 

&#8226; Dividends and service fees from subsidiaries, as well as the proceeds from issuance of capital, are also funding sources for the Parent Company. 

&#8226; Equity issuances by the Parent Company; the Corporation has filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC under which the Parent Company may, from time to time, offer shares of the Corporation&#8217;s common stock in connection with acquisitions of businesses, assets, or securities of other companies. 

&#8226; Other issuances by the Parent Company; the Corporation also has filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC, under which the Parent Company may offer the following securities, either separately or in units: debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, and warrants. 

&#8226; Bank issuances; the Bank may also issue institutional certificates of deposit, network transaction deposits, and brokered certificates of deposit. 

&#8226; Global Bank Note Program issuances; the Bank has implemented the program pursuant to which it may from time to time offer up to $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of its unsecured senior and subordinated notes. In August 2018, the Bank issued $300 million of senior notes, due August 2021, and callable July 2021. 

Credit ratings relate to the Corporation&#8217;s ability to issue debt securities and the cost to borrow money, and should not be viewed as an indication of future stock performance or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. Adverse changes in these factors could result in a negative change in credit ratings and impact not only the ability to raise funds in the capital markets but also the cost of these funds. The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Bank at December 31, 2019 are displayed below:

For the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by operating and investing activities was $574 million and $1.6 billion, respectively, while financing activities used net cash of $2.5 billion, for a net decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $288 million since year-end 2018. During 2019, total assets decreased to $32.4 billion, down $1.2 billion, or 4%, compared to year-end 2018, primarily due to net decreases of $1.2 billion in investment securities. On the funding side, deposits decreased $1.1 billion while funding, including short-term, long-term, and FHLB advances, was down $332 million. On June 14, 2019, the Corporation assumed $725 million of deposits from the Huntington branch acquisition. As a result of the acquisition, the Corporation was able to reduce higher cost brokered CDs and network deposits. The decrease in short-term, long-term, and FHLB advances was driven by the Corporation's redemption of $250 million in senior notes on October 15, 2019. 

For the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by operating and financing activities was $497 million and $45 million, respectively, while investing activities used net cash of $381 million, for a net increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $161 million since year-end 2017. During 2018, total assets increased to $33.6 billion, up $3.2 billion, or 10%, compared to year-end 2017, primarily due to a $2.2 billion net increase in loans, of which $1.9 billion was from the Bank Mutual acquisition. On the funding side, deposits increased $2.1 billion while funding, including short-term, long-term, and FHLB advances, was up $453 million, of which $1.8 billion and $432 million were from the Bank Mutual acquisition, respectively. 

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Market risk and interest rate risk are managed centrally. Market risk is the potential for loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of fixed-income securities, equity securities, other earning assets, and derivative financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates or other factors. Interest rate risk is the potential for reduced net interest income resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates. As a financial institution that engages in transactions involving an array of financial products, the Corporation is exposed to both market risk and interest rate risk. In addition to market risk, interest rate risk is measured and managed through a number of methods. The Corporation uses financial modeling simulation techniques that measure the sensitivity of future earnings due to changing rate environments to measure interest rate risk. 

Policies established by the Corporation&#8217;s ALCO and approved by the Board of Directors are intended to limit these risks. The Board has delegated day-to-day responsibility for managing market and interest rate risk to ALCO. The primary objectives of market risk management is to minimize any adverse effect that changes in market risk factors may have on net interest income and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets recorded at fair value. 

Interest Rate Risk 

The primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by the Board of Directors. These limits and guidelines reflect the Corporation's risk appetite for interest rate risk over both short-term and long-term horizons. No interest rate limit breaches occurred during 2019. 

The major sources of the Corporation's non-trading interest rate risk are timing differences in the maturity and re-pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities, changes in the shape of the yield curve, and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options. We measure these risks and their impact by identifying and quantifying exposures through the use of sophisticated simulation and valuation models which are employed by management to understand NII at risk, interest rate sensitive EAR, and MVE at risk. The Corporation&#8217;s interest rate risk profile is such that a higher or steeper yield curve adds to income while a flatter yield curve is relatively neutral, and a lower or inverted yield curve generally has a negative impact on earnings. The Corporation's EAR profile is slightly asset sensitive at December 31, 2019. 

MVE and EAR are complementary interest rate risk metrics and should be viewed together. Net interest income and EAR sensitivity capture asset and liability re-pricing mismatches for the first year inclusive of forecast balance sheet changes and are considered shorter term measures, while MVE sensitivity captures mismatches within the period end balance sheets through the financial instruments&#8217; respective maturities and is considered a longer term measure. 

A positive NII and EAR sensitivity in a rising rate environment indicates that over the forecast horizon of one year, asset based income will increase more quickly than liability based expense due to the balance sheet composition. A negative MVE sensitivity in a rising rate environment indicates that the value of financial assets will decrease more than the value of financial liabilities. 

One of the primary methods that we use to quantify and manage interest rate risk is simulation analysis, which we use to model NII and rate sensitive noninterest items from the Corporation&#8217;s balance sheet and derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios. As the future path of interest rates is not known with certainty, we use simulation analysis to project rate sensitive income under many scenarios including implied forward and deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios. The analyses may include rapid and gradual ramping of interest rates, rate shocks, basis risk analysis, and yield curve twists. Specific balance sheet management strategies are also analyzed to determine their impact on NII and EAR. 

Key assumptions in the simulation analysis (and in the valuation analysis discussed below) relate to the behavior of interest rates and pricing spreads, the changes in product balances, and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments. This analysis incorporates several assumptions, the most material of which relate to the re-pricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate or non-contractual maturities, and prepayment of loans and securities. 

The sensitivity analysis included below is measured as a percentage change in NII and EAR due to gradual moves in benchmark interest rates from a baseline scenario over 12 months. We evaluate the sensitivity using: 1) a dynamic forecast incorporating expected growth in the balance sheet, and 2) a static forecast where the current balance sheet is held constant. While a gradual shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under a probable scenario, an instantaneous shift in interest rates would have a much more significant impact. 

Table 22 Estimated % Change in Rate Sensitive EAR Over 12 Months 

##TABLE_START &#160; Dynamic Forecast December 31, 2019 Static Forecast December 31, 2019 Dynamic Forecast December 31, 2018 Static Forecast December 31, 2018 Gradual Rate Change 100 bp increase in interest rates 4.0 % 3.7 % 2.5 % 2.7 % 200 bp increase in interest rates 7.4 % 6.7 % 5.8 % 5.4 % ##TABLE_END

We also perform valuation analysis, which we use for discerning levels of risk present in the balance sheet and derivative positions that might not be taken into account in the NII simulation analysis. Whereas, NII and EAR simulation highlights exposures over a relatively short time horizon, valuation analysis incorporates all cash flows over the estimated remaining life of all balance sheet and derivative positions. The valuation of the balance sheet, at a point in time, is defined as the discounted present value of all asset cash flows and derivative cash flows, minus the discounted present value of all liability cash flows, the net of which is referred to as MVE. The sensitivity of MVE to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of the longer-term re-pricing risk and options risk embedded in the balance sheet. Unlike the NII simulation, MVE uses instantaneous changes in rates. Additionally, MVE values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the growth assumptions that are used in the NII and EAR simulations. As with NII and EAR simulations, assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in the MVE analysis. Particularly important are the assumptions driving prepayments and the expected changes in balances and pricing of the indeterminate deposit portfolios. At December 31, 2019, the MVE profile 

indicates a decline in net balance sheet value due to instantaneous upward changes in rates. MVE sensitivity is reported in both upward and downward rate shocks. 

Table 23 Market Value of Equity Sensitivity 

##TABLE_START December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Instantaneous Rate Change 100 bp increase in interest rates (0.5) % (2.0) % 200 bp increase in interest rates (2.2) % (4.5) % ##TABLE_END

The decrease in MVE sensitivity from December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to the lower rate environment. Since MVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in MVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, MVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changes in product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. 

The above NII, EAR, and MVE measures do not include all actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in response to anticipated changes in interest rates.

(a) Undiscounted operating lease liability 

Through the normal course of operations, the Corporation has entered into certain contractual obligations and other commitments, including but not limited to those most usually related to funding of operations through deposits or funding, commitments to extend credit, derivative contracts to assist management of interest rate exposure, and to a lesser degree leases for premises and equipment. Further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in the referenced note to the consolidated financial statements. 

The Corporation also has obligations under its retirement plans as described in Note 12 Retirement Plans of the notes to consolidated financial statements. 

As of December 31, 2019, the net liability for uncertainty in income taxes, including associated interest and penalties, was $2 million. This liability represents an estimate of tax positions that the Corporation has taken in its tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, this estimated liability has been excluded from Table 24. See Note 13 Income Taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information and disclosure related to uncertainty in income taxes. 

The Corporation may have a variety of financial transactions that, under GAAP, are either not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets or are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets in amounts that differ from the full contract or notional amounts. 

The Corporation routinely enters into lending-related commitments, including commitments to extend credit, interest rate lock commitments to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale (discussed further below), commercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. See Note 16 Commitments, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Legal Proceedings of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on lending-related commitments. 

The Corporation&#8217;s derivative financial instruments, under which the Corporation is required to either receive cash from or pay cash to counterparties depending on changes in interest rates applied to notional amounts, are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. Because neither the derivative assets and liabilities, nor their notional amounts, represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under these contracts, they are not included in Table 24. For further information and discussion of derivative contracts, see Note 14 Derivative and Hedging Activities of the notes to consolidated financial statements. 

The Corporation sells residential mortgage loans to investors in the normal course of business. Residential mortgage loans sold to others are predominantly conventional residential first lien mortgages originated under our usual underwriting procedures, and are most often sold on a nonrecourse basis primarily to the GSEs. See Note 16 Commitments, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Legal Proceedings of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on residential mortgage loans sold. 

The Corporation has principal investment commitments to provide capital-based financing to private and public companies and also invests in low-income housing, and various tax credit projects. See Note 16 Commitments, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Legal Proceedings of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on these investments. The Volcker Rule prohibits IDIs and their holding companies from engaging in proprietary trading except in limited circumstances, and prohibits them from owning equity interests in excess of three percent of Tier 1 Capital in private equity and hedge funds. Complying with the Volcker Rule is not expected to have a material impact on the Corporation. See Part I, Item 1, Business, for additional information on the Volcker Rule. 

Capital 

Management actively reviews capital strategies for the Corporation and each of its subsidiaries in light of perceived business risks, future growth opportunities, industry standards, and compliance with regulatory requirements. The assessment of overall capital adequacy depends on a variety of factors, including asset quality, liquidity, stability of earnings, changing competitive forces, economic condition in markets served, and strength of management. At December 31, 2019, the capital ratios of the Corporation and its banking subsidiaries were well in excess of regulatory minimum requirements. The Corporation&#8217;s capital ratios are summarized in the following table.

( a)The Federal Reserve establishes regulatory capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards for the Corporation. The Corporation follows Basel III, subject to certain transition provisions. These regulatory capital measurements are used by management, regulators, investors, and analysts to assess, monitor and compare the quality and composition of the Corporation's capital with the capital of other financial services companies. 

(b) During the third quarter of 2019, the Corporation made a change in accounting policy to offset derivative assets and liabilities and cash collateral with the same counterparty where it has a legally enforceable master netting agreement in place. The change had no impact on either earnings or equity. The Corporation believes that this change is a preferable method of accounting as it provides a better reflection of the assets and liabilities on the face of the consolidated balance sheets. Adoption of this change was voluntary and has been adopted retrospectively. 2019, 2018, and 2017 total assets, risk-weighted assets and capital ratios were restated for comparability.

(a) The ratio tangible common equity to tangible assets excludes goodwill and other intangible assets, net, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. This financial measure has been included as it is considered to be a critical metric with which to analyze and evaluate financial condition and capital strength. 

(b) The Federal Reserve establishes regulatory capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards for the Corporation. The Corporation follows Basel III, subject to certain transition provisions. These regulatory capital measurements are used by management, regulators, investors, and analysts to assess, monitor and compare the quality and composition of the Corporation's capital with the capital of other financial services companies. 

(c) During the third quarter of 2019, the Corporation made a change in accounting policy to offset derivative assets and liabilities and cash collateral with the same counterparty where it has a legally enforceable master netting agreement in place. The change had no impact on either earnings or equity. The Corporation believes that this change is a preferable method of accounting as it provides a better reflection of the assets and liabilities on the face of the consolidated balance sheets. Adoption of this change was voluntary. Total assets and average assets for 2019, 2018, and 2017 were restated for comparability. Total assets and average assets for 2016 and 2015 have not been restated. 

(d) The efficiency ratio as defined by the Federal Reserve guidance is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments) divided by the sum of net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains / losses, net. The fully tax-equivalent efficiency ratio is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments), excluding other intangible amortization, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains / losses, net. The adjusted efficiency ratio is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments), excluding other intangible amortization and acquisition related costs, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains / losses, net and acquisition related costs. Management believes the adjusted efficiency ratio, which adjusts net interest income for the tax-favored status of certain loans and investment securities and acquisition related costs, to be a meaningful measure as it enhances the comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources and excludes acquisition related costs. 

(e) 2019 includes Huntington branch and First Staunton acquisition related costs while 2018 includes Bank Mutual acquisition related costs.

Segment Review 

As discussed in Note 21 Segment Reporting of the notes to consolidated financial statements, the Corporation&#8217;s reportable segments have been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain strategic business units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes where the nature of the products and services, the type of customer, and the distribution of those products and services are similar. The reportable segments are Corporate and Commercial Specialty; Community, Consumer and Business; and Risk Management and Shared Services. The financial information of the Corporation&#8217;s segments was compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 21 Segment Reporting of the notes to consolidated financial statements. 

Funds Transfer Pricing is an important tool for managing the Corporation&#8217;s balance sheet structure and measuring risk-adjusted profitability. By appropriately allocating the cost of funding and contingent liquidity to business units, the FTP process improves product pricing which influences the volume and terms of new business and helps to optimize the risk / reward profile of the balance sheet. This process helps align the Corporation&#8217;s funding and contingent liquidity risk with its risk appetite and complements broader liquidity and interest rate risk management programs. FTP methodologies are designed to promote more resilient, sustainable business models and centralize the management of funding and contingent liquidity risks. Through FTP, the Corporation transfers these risks to a central management function that can take advantage of natural off-sets, centralized hedging activities, and a broader view of these risks across business units. The net FTP allocation is reflected as net intersegment interest income (expense) shown in Note 21 Segment Reporting of the notes to consolidated financial statements.

The ROCET1 for the Risk Management and Shared Services segment and the Consolidated Total is inclusive of the annualized effect of the preferred stock dividends. Please refer to Table 26 for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures. 

(b) For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Risk Management and Shared Services segment included approximately $7 million, $29 million and zero respectively, of acquisition related noninterest expense. 

Segment Review 2019 Compared to 2018 

The Corporate and Commercial Specialty segment consists of lending and deposit solutions to larger businesses, developers, not-for-profits, municipalities, financial institutions, and the support to deliver, fund, and manage such banking solutions. 

&#8226; The Corporate and Commercial Specialty segment had net income of $178 million in 2019, down $23 million compared to $201 million in 2018. 

&#8226; Segment revenue decreased $26 million to $428 million in 2019, compared to $454 million in 2018, driven by higher FTP charges without a corresponding increase in interest revenue due to lower prepayments and accretion income from the Bank Mutual portfolio in 2018. 

&#8226; Credit provision increased $8 million to $52 million in 2019, compared to $45 million in 2018, primarily due to oil and gas loans, partially offset by improving credit quality in other commercial loan portfolios. 

&#8226; Average loan balances were $12.3 billion for 2019, up $497 million from an average balance of $11.8 billion for 2018, largely due to growth in commercial and business lending loans. 

&#8226; Average deposit balances were $8.3 billion for 2019, up $153 million from average deposits of $8.1 billion in 2018. 

The Community, Consumer, and Business segment consists of lending and deposit solutions to individuals and small to mid-sized businesses, and also provides a variety of investment and fiduciary products and services. 

&#8226; The Community, Consumer, and Business segment had net income of $139 million in 2019, down $2 million compared to $141 million in 2018. 

&#8226; Segment revenue increased $3 million to $744 million in 2019 due to an increase in mortgage banking revenue, partially offset by a decrease in segment net interest income. 

&#8226; Average deposit balances were $14.4 billion in 2019, up $780 million from average deposits of $13.6 billion in 2018, primarily driven by the Huntington branch acquisition. 

The Risk Management and Shared Services segment includes key shared Corporate functions, Parent Company activity, intersegment eliminations, and residual revenues and expense. 

&#8226; The Risk Management and Shared Services segment had net income of $9 million in 2019, up $18 million compared to a net loss of $8 million in 2018. 

&#8226; Segment revenue increased $4 million to $45 million in 2019, primarily driven by gains on sales of securities as a result of the Corporation's ongoing investment securities portfolio restructuring and deleveraging strategy, partially offset by a decrease in segment net interest income. The decrease in segment net interest income was driven by higher FHLB advance and network transaction deposit costs. 

&#8226; Noninterest expense decreased $29 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower acquisition related costs and certain unallocated expenses. Acquisition related costs of $7 million related to the Huntington branch and First Staunton acquisitions were incurred during 2019, compared to acquisition related expenses of $29 million related to the Bank Mutual acquisition in 2018. 

&#8226; Average earning asset balances were $7.2 billion for 2019, down $671 million from an average balance of $7.9 billion in 2018, driven by the Corporation's ongoing investment securities portfolio restructuring and deleveraging strategy. 

&#8226; Average deposits were $2.1 billion in 2019, down $269 million fr om 2018, primarily driven by a decrease in network transaction deposits.

Critical Accounting Policies 

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and revenues and expenses for the period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the determination of the allowance for loan losses, goodwill impairment assessment, MSRs valuation, and income taxes. 

The consolidated financial statements of the Corporation are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates. This preparation requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, actual results could differ from the estimates, assumptions, and judgments reflected in the financial statements. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Management believes the following policies are both important to the portrayal of the Corporation&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments and, therefore, management considers the following to be critical accounting policies. The critical accounting policies are discussed directly with the Audit Committee of the Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors. 

Allowance for Loan Losses: Management&#8217;s evaluation process used to determine the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses is subject to the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments. The evaluation process combines many factors: management&#8217;s ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio, consideration of historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and nonaccrual loans, risk characteristics of the various classifications of loans, concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries, existing economic conditions, the fair value of underlying collateral, and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect probable credit losses. Because current economic conditions can change and future events are inherently difficult to predict, the anticipated amount of estimated loan losses, and therefore the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses, could change significantly. As an integral part of their examination process, various regulatory agencies also review the allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require additions to the allowance for loan losses or may require that certain loan balances be charged off or downgraded into criticized loan categories when their credit evaluations differ from those of management, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. The Corporation believes the level of the allowance for loan losses is appropriate. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 4 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements as well as the Allowance for Credit Losses section. 

Goodwill Impairment Assessment: Goodwill is not amortized but, instead, is subject to impairment tests on at least an annual basis, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Corporation conducted its most recent annual impairment test in May 2019, utilizing a qualitative assessment. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the Corporation's accounting policy on goodwill and see Note 5 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets of the 

notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of the factors considered by management in the qualitative assessment. Based on this assessment, management concluded that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value (including goodwill) for each reporting unit. Therefore, a step one quantitative analysis was not required. There were no events since the May 2019 impairment testing that have changed the Corporation's impairment assessment conclusion. There was no impairment charges recorded in 2019, 2018, or 2017. 

Mortgage Servicing Rights Valuation: The fair value of the Corporation&#8217;s MSRs asset is important to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements since the MSRs are carried on the consolidated balance sheets at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value. MSRs do not trade in an active open market with readily observable prices. As such, like other participants in the mortgage banking business, the Corporation relies on an independent valuation from a third party which uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of its MSRs. The use of a discounted cash flow model involves judgment, particularly of estimated prepayment speeds of underlying mortgages serviced and the overall level of interest rates. Loan type and note interest rate are the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans used to stratify capitalized MSRs for purposes of measuring impairment. The Corporation periodically reviews the assumptions underlying the valuation of MSRs. While the Corporation believes that the values produced by the discounted cash flow model are indicative of the fair value of its MSRs portfolio, these values can change significantly depending upon key factors, such as the then current interest rate environment, estimated prepayment speeds of the underlying mortgages serviced, and other economic conditions. The proceeds that might be received should the Corporation actually consider a sale of some or all of the MSRs portfolio could differ from the amounts reported at any point in time. 

To better understand the sensitivity of the impact of prepayment speeds and refinance rates on the value of the MSRs asset at December 31, 2019, (holding all other factors unchanged), if refinance rates were to decrease 50 bp, the estimated value of the MSRs asset would have been approximately $14 million, or 20%, lower. Conversely, if refinance rates were to increase 50 bp, the estimated value of the MSRs asset would have been approximately $15 million, or 20%, higher. However, the Corporation&#8217;s potential recovery recognition due to valuation improvement is limited to the balance of the MSRs valuation reserve, which was approximately $302,000 at December 31, 2019. The potential recovery recognition is constrained as the Corporation has elected to use the amortization method of accounting (rather than fair value measurement accounting). Under the amortization method, MSRs are carried at the lower of the initial capitalized amount, net of accumulated amortization, or estimated fair value. Therefore, the MSRs asset may only be marked up to the extent of the previously recognized valuation reserve. The Corporation believes the MSRs asset is properly recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets of the notes to consolidated financial statements. 

Income Taxes: The assessment of tax assets and liabilities involves the use of estimates, assumptions, interpretations, and judgment concerning certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax codes and regulations. There can be no assurance that future events, such as court decisions or positions of federal and state taxing authorities, will not differ from management&#8217;s current assessment, the impact of which could be significant to the consolidated results of operations and reported earnings. Quarterly assessments are performed to determine if valuation allowances are necessary against any portion of the Corporation&#8217;s DTAs. Assessing the need for, or sufficiency of, a valuation allowance requires management to evaluate all available evidence, both positive and negative, including the recent trend of quarterly earnings. Positive evidence necessary to overcome the negative evidence includes whether future taxable income in sufficient amounts and character within the carryback and carryforward periods is available under the tax law, including the use of tax planning strategies. When negative evidence (e.g., cumulative losses in recent years, history of operating loss or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused) exists, more positive evidence than negative evidence will be necessary. The Corporation has concluded that based on the level of positive evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized, net of the existing valuation allowances at December 31, 2019 and 2018. However, there is no guarantee that the tax benefits associated with the DTAs will be fully realized. The Corporation believes the tax assets and liabilities are properly recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 13 Income Taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements and section Income Taxes.
