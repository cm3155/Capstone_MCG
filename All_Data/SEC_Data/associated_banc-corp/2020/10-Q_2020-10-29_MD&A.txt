Factors that might cause actual results to differ from the results discussed in forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the risk factors in Item 1A, Risk Factors, in the Corporation&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, in the Corporation's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2020, in Item 1A of Part 2 herein, and as may be described from time to time in the Corporation&#8217;s subsequent SEC filings. 

Overview 

The following discussion and analysis is presented to assist in the understanding and evaluation of the Corporation&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. It is intended to complement the unaudited consolidated financial statements, footnotes, and supplemental financial data appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and should be read in conjunction therewith. Management continually evaluates strategic acquisition opportunities and various other strategic alternatives that could involve the sale or acquisition of branches or other assets, or the consolidation or creation of subsidiaries. Within the tables presented, certain columns and rows may not sum due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. 

Performance Summary 

&#8226; Average loans of $24.5 billion increased $1.3 billion, or 5%, compared to the first nine months of 2019, driven by an increase in PPP and CRE loans. 

&#8226; Average deposits of $25.8 billion increased $814 million, or 3%, from the first nine months of 2019, driven primarily by government stimulus related inflows. 

&#8226; Net interest income of $575 million decreased $61 million, or 10%, from the first nine months of 2019 and n et interest margin was 2.54% compared to 2.86% for the first nine months of 2019 primarily due to a lower interest rate environment. The Corporation expects the fourth quarter 2020 margin to be approximately 2.50%. 

&#8226; Provision for credit losses was $157 million, compared to provision of $16 million for the first nine months of 2019. 

&#8226; Noninterest income of $428 million was up $140 million, or 49%, from the first nine months of 2019, primarily due to a $163 million gain on the sale of ABRC during the second quarter of 2020 partially offset by decreased insurance revenue resulting from the sa le of the business. The Corporation expects to see a continued positive trend in fee revenue through the end of 2020. 

&#8226; Noninterest expense of $603 million increased $13 million, or 2%, from the first nine months of 2019 driven by the $45 million loss on prepayment of FHLB advances partially offset by a $32 million reduction in personnel expense. The Corporation expects noninterest expense of $175 million, including $3 million of restructuring costs, for the fourth quarter of 2020 and expects full year 2021 expenses to be $685 million.

(c) Interest income includes amortization of net deferred loan origination costs and net accreted purchase loan discount. 

Notable Contributions to the Change in Net Interest Income 

&#8226; Average loans of $24.5 billion increased $1.3 billion, or 5%, compared to the first nine months of 2019 primarily driven by PPP loan originations beginning in April, which increased average loans by $624 million. In addition, CRE loans increased $560 million, or 11%, from the first nine months of 2019 driven by the continued funding of loans previously in the pipeline and slowed loan payoffs. 

&#8226; Taxable investment securities decreased $1.2 billion, or 26%, as the Corporation repositioned its balance sheet in a lower rate environment. 

&#8226; Net interest income on the consolidated statements of income (which excludes the fully tax-equivalent adjustment) was $575 million for the first nine months of 2020 compared to $636 million for the first nine months of 2019. Fully tax-equivalent net interest income of $587 million for the first nine months of 2020 was $61 million, or 9%, lower than the first nine months of 2019. The net interest margin for the first nine months of 2020 was 2.54% compared to 2.86% for the first nine months of 2019. The decreases were attributable to a lower interest rate environment and increased liquidity primarily due to deposit growth related to government stimulus money. To lessen the impact of the lower rate environment, the Corporation began requiring LIBOR floors in all applicable loan restructurings, renewals of existing loan transactions, and any new loan transactions. See sections Interest Rate Risk and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a discussion of interest rate risk and market risk. 

&#8226; Average interest-bearing liabilities of $23.3 billion for the first nine months of 2020 were down $596 million, or 2%, versus the first nine months of 2019. On average, interest-bearing deposits decreased $671 million, or 3%, primarily driven by decreases in higher cost deposits such as network, time and money market accounts. Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits of $6.6 billion for the first nine months of 2020 were up $1.5 billion, or 29% versus the first nine months of 2019. This increase is primarily attributed to customers holding proceeds from government stimulus programs in their deposit accounts. On the funding side, PPPLF funding increased $599 million, partially offset by a decrease in long-term funding of $247 million, or 31%, primarily due to the redemption of $250 million of senior notes in October 2019. 

&#8226; The cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 0.72% for the first nine months of 2020, which was 78 bp lower than the first nine months of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a 87 bp decrease in the cost of average interest-bearing deposits to 0.42%, primarily attributed to the federal funds rate decreases over the last year. 

&#8226; The Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds target interest rate by 175 bp since the end of the third quarter of 2019, to a range of 0.00% to 0.25%, at the end of the third quarter of 2020, compared to a range of 1.75% to 2.00% at the end of the third quarter of 2019. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses is predominantly a function of the Corporation&#8217;s reserving methodology and judgments as to other qualitative and quantitative factors used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded commitments, which focuses on changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio, changes in levels of individually evaluated and other nonaccrual loans, historical losses and delinquencies in each portfolio category, the level of loans sold or transferred to held for sale, the risk inherent in specific loans, concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries, existing economic conditions and economic forecasts, the fair value of underlying collateral, and other factors which could affect potential credit losses. The forecast the Corporation used for September 30, 2020 was the Moody's baseline scenario from September 2020 over a 1 year reasonable and supportable period with immediate reversion to historical losses. See additional discussion under the sections titled, Loans, Credit Risk, Nonperforming Assets, and Allowance for Credit Losses.

Notable Contributions to the Change in Noninterest Income 

&#8226; Insurance commission and fees was down $24 million, or 35% from the first nine months of 2019, driven by the sale of ABRC during the second quarter of 2020. 

&#8226; Asset gains (losses), net was up $155 million from the first nine months of 2019, driven by a gain of $163 million from the sale of ABRC. 

&#8226; Capital markets, net was up $10 million, or 81%, from the first nine months of 2019, driven by higher interest rate swap fees. 

&#8226; Mortgage banking, net was up $6 million, or 24%, from the first nine months of 2019. During the first nine months of 2020, there was a $32 million increase in gains and fair value adjustments on loans held for sale driven by higher refinance activity due to the lower rate environment, partially offset by an increase of $18 million in MSRs impairment driven by lower rates. 

&#8226; Service charges and deposit account fees was down $6 million, or 13%, from the first nine months of 2019 due to fee waivers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Corporation resumed charging these fees during the third quarter of 2020.

Notable Contributions to the Change in Noninterest Expense 

&#8226; Personnel expense decreased $32 million, or 9%, from the first nine months of 2019, primarily driven by a decrease in funding for the management incentive plan. 

&#8226; Business development and advertising expense decreased $8 million, or 39%, from the first nine months of 2019, primarily driven by reductions in travel and entertainment costs and special event sponsorships, largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

&#8226; Loan and foreclosure costs increased $3 million, or 58%, from the first nine months of 2019, driven by an increase in legal fees pertaining to loan collections due to fewer recoveries of previous expenses during 2020. 

&#8226; During the third quarter of 2020, the Corporation prepaid $950 million of long-term FHLB advances and incurred a loss of $45 million on the prepayment. 

Income Taxes 

The Corporation recognized income tax expense of $3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to income tax expense of $62 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The Corporation's effective tax rate was 1.37% for the first nine months of 2020, compared to an effective tax rate of 19.67% for the first nine months of 2019. The lower effective tax rate and income tax expense during the first nine months of 2020 was primarily driven by tax planning strategies which allowed for the recognition of built in capital losses and tax basis step-up yielding a tax benefit of $63 mill ion, partially offset by the gain on sale of ABRC. These tax planning strategies were successfully completed in the third quarter of 2020. With the successful completion of these tax planning strategies, we expect the full year 2020 effective tax rate to be in the low to mid-single digits. 

Income tax expense recorded on the consolidated statements of income involves the interpretation and application of certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax laws and regulations, and is, therefore, considered a critical accounting policy. The Corporation is subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Examination by taxing authorities may impact the amount of tax expense and / or reserve for uncertainty in income taxes if their interpretations differ from those of management, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations. See section Critical Accounting Policies, in the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on income taxes. 

Balance Sheet Analysis

&#8226; Lo ans of $25.0 billion at September 30, 2020 were up $2.2 billion, or 10%, from both December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019 partially driven by a $1.0 billion increase in PPP loans originated largely during the second quarter of 2020. In addition, the Corporation saw an increase in CRE loans. The Corporation added $370 million in loans from the First Staunton acquisition during the first quarter of 2020. See Note 7 Loans for additional details. 

&#8226; At September 30, 2020, total deposits of $26.7 billion were up $2.9 billion, or 12%, from December 31, 2019 and were up $2.3 billion , or 9%, from September 30, 2019. During the first quarter of 2020, the Corporation assumed $439 million of deposits from the First Staunton acquisition. In addition, the balance increases were primarily due to customers holding proceeds from government stimulus programs in their deposit accounts. S ee section Deposits and Customer Funding for additional information on deposits. 

&#8226; At September 30, 2020, FHLB advances of $1.7 billion decreased $1.5 billion, or 46%, from December 31, 2019 and $1.2 billion, or 41%, from September 30, 2019, primarily driven by the Corporation's prepayment of $950 million in long-term FHLB advances during the third quarter of 2020. In addition, the Corporation saw a decrease in short-term FHLB advances. See Note 9 Short and Long-Term Funding for additional details. 

&#8226; At September 30, 2020, PPPLF was $1.0 billion largely due to the funding of PPP loans during the second quarter of 2020. See Note 9 Short and Long-Term Funding for additional details. 

&#8226; On January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted ASU 2016-13 using the modified retrospective approach which resulted in an increase to the allowance for loan losses of $112 million and an increase to the allowance for unfunded commitments of $19 million for a total increase to the ACLL of $131 million. A corresponding after tax decrease to common equity of $98 million was recorded along with a deferred tax asset of $33 million. 

&#8226; At September 30, 2020, preferred equity was $354 million, up $97 million, or 38%, from both December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019. On June 9, 2020, the Corporation issued $100 million, or $97 million net of issuance costs, of 5.625% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series F.

The Corporation has long-term guidelines relative to the proportion of Commercial and Business, Commercial Real Estate, and Consumer loans within the overall loan portfolio, with each targeted to represent 30-40% of the overall loan portfolio. The targeted long-term guidelines were unchanged during 2019 and the first nine months of 2020. Furthermore, certain sub-asset classes within the respective portfolios are further defined and dollar limitations are placed on these sub-portfolios. These 

guidelines and limits are reviewed quarterly and approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors. These guidelines and limits are designed to create balance and diversification within the loan portfolios. 

The Corporation&#8217;s loan distribution and interest rate sensitivity as of September 30, 2020 are summarized in the following table:

Credit Risk 

An active credit risk management process is used for commercial loans to ensure that sound and consistent credit decisions are made. Credit risk is controlled by detailed underwriting procedures, comprehensive loan administration, and periodic review of borrowers&#8217; outstanding loans and commitments. Borrower relationships are formally reviewed and graded on an ongoing basis for early identification of potential problems. Further analysis by customer, industry, and geographic location are performed to monitor trends, financial performance, and concentrations. See Note 7 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on managing overall credit quality. 

The loan portfolio is widely diversified by types of borrowers, industry groups, and market areas within the Corporation's branch footprint. Significant loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to numerous borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. At September 30, 2020, no significant concentrations existed in the Corporation&#8217;s portfolio in excess of 10% of total loans. 

Commercial and business lending: The commercial and business lending classification primarily includes commercial loans to large corporations, middle market companies, small businesses, and lease financing.

September 30, 2020 % of Total Loans % of Total Commercial and Business Lending Power and Utilities 7 % 18 % Manufacturing and Wholesale Trade 7 % 17 % Finance and Insurance 7 % 17 % Real Estate 5 % 12 % 

The remaining commercial and business lending portfolio is spread over a diverse range of industries, none of which exceed 2% of total loans. 

The credit risk related to commercial loans is largely influenced by general economic conditions and the resulting impact on a borrower&#8217;s operations or on the value of underlying collateral, if any. Currently, a higher risk segment of the commercial and business lending portfolio is loans to borrowers supporting oil and gas exploration and production, which are further discussed under oil and gas lending below. 

Oil and gas lending: The Corporation provided reserve based loans to oil and gas exploration and production firms. The oil and gas portfolio is in run-off and no new oil and gas loans have been originated since February 2019. At September 30, 2020, the oil and gas portfolio was comprised of 30 credits, totaling $333 million of outstanding balances, which represents less than 2% of the Corporation's total loans. The decrease in balances from both December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019 continues to be driven by a purposeful reduction in exposure to the Corporation's higher-leveraged borrowers. 

The Corporation's oil and gas lending team is based in Houston and focuses on serving the funding needs of small and mid-sized companies in the upstream oil and gas business. The oil and gas loans are first lien, reserve-based, and borrowing base dependent lines of credit. The portfolio is diversified across all major U.S. geographic basins and is diversified by product line with approximately 58% in oil and 42% in gas at September 30, 2020. Borrowing base re-determinations for the portfolio are generally completed twice a year and are based on detailed engineering reports and discounted cash flow analysis. 

The following table summarizes information about the Corporation's oil and gas loan portfolio.

&#8226; The increase in the ACLL attributable to oil and gas related credits (included within the commercial and industrial ACLL) from both December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019 is driven by the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic within the economic models used in the new expected credit loss methodology. The decrease from June 30, 2020 was primarily due to runoff in the portfolio as the Corporation continues to reduce exposure to its higher-leveraged borrowers. 

The adoption impact of ASU 2016-13 for oil and gas loans was included within the commercial and industrial line item of the adoption table in Note 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The following table provides a summary of the changes in the ACLL in the Corporation's oil and gas loan portfolio as a result of adopting ASU 2016-13.

Credit risk is managed in a similar manner to commercial and business lending by employing sound underwriting guidelines, lending primarily to borrowers in local markets and businesses, periodically evaluating the underlying collateral, and formally reviewing the borrower&#8217;s financial soundness and relationship on an ongoing basis. 

Real estate construction: Real estate construction loans are primarily short-term or interim loans that provide financing for the acquisition or development of commercial income properties, multi-family projects or residential development, both single family and condominium. Real estate construction loans are made to developers and project managers who are generally well known to the Corporation and have prior successful project experience. The credit risk associated with real estate construction loans is generally confined to specific geographic areas but is also influenced by general economic conditions. The Corporation controls the credit risk on these types of loans by making loans in familiar markets to developers, reviewing the merits of individual projects, controlling loan structure, and monitoring project progress and construction advances.

September 30, 2020 % of Total Loans % of Total Real Estate Construction Multi-Family 3 % 34 % 

The remaining real estate construction portfolio is spread over various other property types, none of which exceed 2% of total loans. 

The Corporation&#8217;s current lending standards for commercial real estate and real estate construction lending are determined by property type and specifically address many criteria, including: maximum loan amounts, maximum LTV, requirements for pre-leasing and / or presales, minimum borrower equity, and maximum loan-to-cost. Currently, the maximum standard for LTV is 80%, with lower limits established for certain higher risk types, such as raw land that has a 50% LTV maximum. The Corporation&#8217;s LTV guidelines are in compliance with regulatory supervisory limits. In most cases, for real estate construction 

loans, the loan amounts include interest reserves, which are built into the loans and sized to fund loan payments through construction and lease up and / or sell out. 

Residential mortgages: Residential mortgage loans are primarily first lien home mortgages with a maximum loan-to-collateral value without credit enhancement (e.g. private mortgage insurance) of 80%. The residential mortgage portfolio is focused primarily in the Corporation's three-state branch footprint, with approximately 88% of the outstanding loan balances in the Corporation's branch footprint at September 30, 2020. The majority of the on balance sheet residential mortgage portfolio consists of LIBOR based, hybrid, adjustable rate mortgage loans with initial fixed rate terms of 3, 5, 7, or 10 years. The rates on these mortgages adjust based upon the movement in the underlying index which is then added to a margin and rounded to the nearest 0.125%. That result is then subjected to any periodic caps to produce the borrower's interest rate for the coming term. 

In 2014, the Financial Stability Oversight Council and Financial Stability Board raised concerns about the reliability and robustness of LIBOR and called for the development of alternative interest rate benchmarks. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, through authority from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, have selected the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as the alternative rate and developed a paced transition plan which addresses the risk that LIBOR may not exist beyond the end of 2021. There are still many components of this plan which have not been fully decided or implemented in the industry. As a result, the Corporation is reaching out to borrowers offering an opportunity to refinance or modify their loan to avoid any uncertainty around the LIBOR transition. Performing borrowers can modify or refinance to a fixed interest rate or an adjustable rate mortgage tied to the one-year treasury adjusted to a constant maturity of one-year with an appropriate margin. This provides the bank and borrower with greater certainty around the loan structure. 

The Corporation generally retains certain fixed-rate residential real estate mortgages in its loan portfolio, including retail and private banking jumbo mortgages and CRA-related mortgages. As part of management&#8217;s historical practice of originating and servicing residential mortgage loans, generally the Corporation&#8217;s 30 year, agency conforming, fixed-rate residential real estate mortgage loans have been sold in the secondary market with servicing rights retained. Subject to management&#8217;s analysis of the current interest rate environment, among other market factors, the Corporation may choose to retain 30 year mortgage loan production on its balance sheet. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the Corporation sold approximately $260 million of residential portfolio loans, in order to reduce the Corporation's exposure to prepayment risk in the current low rate environment. See section Loans for additional information on loans. 

The Corporation&#8217;s underwriting and risk-based pricing guidelines for residential mortgage loans include minimum borrower FICO and maximum LTV of the property securing the loan. Residential mortgage products generally are underwritten using FHLMC and FNMA secondary marketing guidelines. 

Home equity: Home equity consists of both home equity lines of credit and closed-end home equity loans. The Corporation&#8217;s credit risk monitoring guidelines for home equity is based on an ongoing review of loan delinquency status, as well as a quarterly review of FICO score deterioration and property devaluation. The Corporation does not routinely obtain appraisals on performing loans to update LTV ratios after origination; however, the Corporation monitors the local housing markets by reviewing the various home price indices and incorporates the impact of the changing market conditions in its ongoing credit monitoring process. For junior lien home equity loans, the Corporation is unable to track the performance of the first lien loan if it does not own or service the first lien loan. However, the Corporation obtains a refreshed FICO score on a quarterly basis and monitors this as part of its assessment of the home equity portfolio. 

The Corporation&#8217;s underwriting and risk-based pricing guidelines for home equity lines of credit and loans consist of a combination of both borrower FICO and the original cumulative LTV against the property securing the loan. During the second quarter of 2020, in the volatile economic environment, the Corporation reduced its exposure by reducing its maximum LTV on home equity lines of credit from 90% to 80%, among other changes, while maintaining the minimum acceptable FICO at 670. The Corporation's current home equity line of credit offering is priced based on floating rate indices and generally allows 10 years of interest-only payments followed by a 20-year amortization of the outstanding balance. During the third quarter of 2020, based upon an analysis of market conditions and uncertainty around the timing and scope of the anticipated economic recovery, the Corporation temporarily suspended new applications for home equity lines of credit. The Corporation has significantly curtailed its offerings of fixed-rate, closed-end home equity loans. The loans in the Corporation's portfolio generally have an original term of 20 years with principal and interest payments required. See section Loans for additional information on loans. 

Other consumer: Other consumer consists of student loans, short-term and other personal installment loans and credit cards. The Corporation had $121 million and $136 million of student loans at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, the majority of which are government guaranteed. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the passage of the CARES Act, government guaranteed student loans had been placed on an administrative forbearance through September 30, 2020. Subsequently, on August 8, 2020, President Donald Trump directed the Secretary of Education to continue to suspend 

loan payments, stop collections, and waive interest on U.S. Department of Education held federal student loans through December 31, 2020. Credit risk for non-government guaranteed student loans, short-term, personal installment loans, and credit cards is influenced by general economic conditions, the characteristics of individual borrowers, and the nature of the loan collateral. Risks of loss are generally on smaller average balances per loan spread over many borrowers. Once charged off, there is usually less opportunity for recovery of these smaller consumer loans. Credit risk is primarily controlled by reviewing the creditworthiness of the borrowers, monitoring payment histories, and taking appropriate collateral and guarantee positions. The student loan portfolio is in run-off and no new student loans are being originated. 

COVID-19 Update: 

Beginning on April 3, 2020, the Corporation began originating SBA loans under the PPP, which are included in commercial and business lending loans, to help businesses keep their workforce employed and cover other working capital needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. All complete eligible applications for the PPP have been processed in the order in which they have been received. The Corporation has fully funded the PPP loans by drawing from the PPPLF, established under the CARES Act. The Corporation began submitting PPP forgiveness applications to the SBA on behalf of our customers on September 14, 2020. Forgiveness payments from the SBA began to be received early in the fourth quarter. The Corporation believes we will receive a modest amount of forgiveness payments yet in 2020, with the majority to be received in 2021. 

The following table summarizes the balance segmentation of the PPP loans as of September 30, 2020:

For consumers, the Corporation suspended certain transaction and late fees; initiated consumer and mortgage loan payment deferral and credit card payment relief programs; and suspended foreclosures and repossessions. The Corporation began collecting these fees again during the third quarter of 2020.

Management is committed to a proactive nonaccrual and problem loan identification philosophy. This philosophy is implemented through the ongoing monitoring and review of all pools of risk in the loan portfolio to ensure that problem loans are identified quickly and the risk of loss is minimized.

(a) The Corporation&#8217;s policy is to assign risk ratings at the borrower level. PPP loans are 100% guaranteed by the SBA and therefore the Corporation considers these loans to have a risk profile similar to pass rated loans. 

Nonaccrual loans: Nonaccrual loans are considered to be one indicator of potential future loan losses. See Note 7 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional nonaccrual loan disclosures. See also Allowance for Credit Losses. 

Accruing loans past due 90 days or more: Loans past due 90 days or more but still accruing interest are classified as such where the underlying loans are both well secured (the collateral value is sufficient to cover principal and accrued interest) and are in the process of collection. 

Restructured loans: Loans are considered restructured loans if concessions have been granted to borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty. See also Note 7 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional restructured loans disclosures. 

Potential problem loans: The level of potential problem loans is another predominant factor in determining the relative level of risk in the loan portfolio and in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. Potential problem loans are generally defined by management to include loans rated as substandard by management but that are not individually evaluated (i.e., nonaccrual loans and accruing TDRs); however, there are circumstances present to create doubt as to the ability of the borrower to comply with present repayment terms. The decision of management to include performing loans in potential problem loans does not necessarily mean that the Corporation expects losses to occur, but that management recognizes a higher degree of risk associated with these loans. 

OREO: Management actively seeks to ensure OREO properties held are monitored to minimize the Corporation&#8217;s risk of loss. 

Other nonperforming assets: The asset balance as of September 30, 2020 represents the Bank's units of ownership interest in oil and gas limited liability companies as a result of a partial settlement of a debt. During the second quarter of 2020, the Corporation wrote the value for one of the ownership interests down to the fair market value, resulting in a $5 million asset loss. These investments are included in tax credit and other investments on the consolidated balance sheets. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans 

Credit risks within the loan portfolio are inherently different for each loan type. Credit risk is controlled and monitored through the use of lending standards, a thorough review of potential borrowers, and ongoing review of loan payment performance. Active asset quality administration, including early problem loan identification and timely resolution of problems, aids in the management of credit risk and the minimization of loan losses. Credit risk management for each loan type is discussed in the section entitled Credit Risk. See Note 7 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures on the ACLL. 

To assess the appropriateness of the ACLL, the Corporation focuses on the evaluation of many factors, including but not limited to: evaluation of facts and issues related to specific loans, management&#8217;s ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio, credit report refreshes, consideration of historical loan loss and delinquency experience on each portfolio category, trends in past due and nonaccrual loans, the level of potential problem loans, the risk characteristics of the various classifications of loan segments, changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio, concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries, existing economic conditions and economic forecasts, the fair value of underlying collateral, funding assumptions on lines and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. The Corporation utilized the Moody's baseline forecast for September 2020 in the allowance model. The forecast is applied over a 1 year reasonable and supportable period with immediate reversion to historical losses due to the length and depth of the pandemic. Assessing these factors involves significant judgment. Because each of the criteria used is subject to change, the ACLL is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future credit losses on loans in any particular segment. Therefore, management considers the ACLL a critical accounting policy, see section Critical Accounting Policies for additional information on the ACLL. See section Nonperforming Assets for a detailed discussion on asset quality. See also Note 7 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional ACLL disclosures. Table 5 provides information on loan growth and period end loan composition, Table 16 provides additional information regarding NPAs, and Table 17 and Table 18 provide additional information regarding activity in the ACLL. 

The loan segmentation used in calculating the ACLL at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was generally comparable. The methodology to calculate the ACLL consists of the following components: a valuation allowance estimate is established for commercial and consumer loans determined by the Corporation to be individually evaluated, using discounted cash flows, estimated fair value of underlying collateral, and / or other data available. Loans are segmented for criticized loan pools by loan type as well as for non-criticized loan pools by loan type, primarily based on historical loss rates after considering loan type, historical loss and delinquency experience, credit quality, and industry classifications. Loans that have been criticized are considered to have a higher risk of default than non-criticized loans, as circumstances were present to support the lower loan grade, warranting higher loss factors. The loss factors applied in the methodology are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted to reflect changes in historical loss levels or other risks. Additionally, management allocates ACLL to absorb losses that may not be provided for by the other components due to qualitative factors evaluated by management, such as limitations within the credit risk grading process, known current economic or business conditions that may not yet show in trends, industry or other concentrations with current issues that impose higher inherent risks than are reflected in the loss factors, and other relevant considerations. The total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the loan portfolio.

Notable Contributions to the Change in the Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans 

&#8226; Total loans increased $2.2 billion, or 10%, from both December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019, primarily driven by increases in PPP loans and commercial real estate lending. In addition, the Corporation added $370 million in loans from the First Staunton acquisition during the first quarter of 2020. See section Loans for additional information on the changes in the loan portfolio and see section Credit Risk for discussion about credit risk management for each loan type. 

&#8226; Potential problem loans increased $132 million, or 82%, from December 31, 2019 and increased $160 million, or 120%, from September 30, 2019, primarily due to increases in commercial and industrial and commercial real estate - investor 

loans, stemming in part from the effects of COVID-19. See Table 16 for additional information on the changes in potential problem loans. 

&#8226; Total nonaccrual loans increased $113 million, or 96%, from December 31, 2019 and increased $103 million, or 80%, from September 30, 2019. The increases were primarily due to an increase in nonaccrual commercial &#38; industrial loans and nonaccrual commercial real estate - investor loans, stemming in part from the effects of COVID-19. See Note 7 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements and Table 16 for additional disclosures on the changes in asset quality. 

&#8226; YTD net charge offs increased $32 million from September 30, 2019, primarily driven by oil and gas charge offs. See Table 8, Table 17, and Table 18 for additional information regarding the activity in the ACLL. 

Management believes the level of ACLL to be appropriate at September 30, 2020.

&#8226; Deposits are the Corporation&#8217;s largest source of funds. 

&#8226; Total deposits increased $2.9 billion, or 12%, from December 31, 2019 and increased $2.3 billion, or 9%, from September 30, 2019 driven by customers holding proceeds from government stimulus programs in their deposit accounts. In addition, on February 14, 2020, the Corporation assumed $439 million in deposits from the acquisition of First Staunton. 

&#8226; Noninterest-bearing deposits increased $2.0 billion, or 37%, from December 31, 2019, and increased $2.0 billion, or 36%, from September 30, 2019 and savings accounts increased $794 million, or 29%, from December 31, 2019 and increased $885 million, or 33%, from September 30, 2019. These increases were primarily due to government stimulus program inflows. 

&#8226; Time deposits decreased $596 million, or 23%, from December 31, 2019 and decreased $883 million, or 30%, from September 30, 2019 due to higher priced time deposits rolling off as they mature. 

&#8226; Non-maturity deposit accounts comprised of savings, money market, and demand (both interest and noninterest-bearing) accounts comprised 92% of the Corporation's total deposits at September 30, 2020. 

&#8226; Included in the above amounts were $1.4 billion of network deposits, primarily sourced from other financial institutions and intermediaries. These represented 5% of the Corporation's total deposits at September 30, 2020. Network deposits increased $54 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2019, but decreased $137 million, or 9%, from September 30, 2019. 

Liquidity 

The objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that the Corporation has the ability to generate sufficient cash or cash equivalents in a timely and cost effective manner to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers and to meet its other commitments as they become due. The Corporation&#8217;s liquidity risk management process is designed to identify, measure, and manage the Corporation&#8217;s funding and liquidity risk to meet its daily funding needs in the ordinary course of business, as well as to address expected and unexpected changes in its funding requirements. The Corporation engages in various activities to manage its liquidity risk, including diversifying its funding sources, stress testing, and holding readily-marketable assets which can be used as a source of liquidity, if needed. 

The Corporation performs dynamic scenario analysis in accordance with industry best practices. Measures have been established to ensure the Corporation has sufficient high quality short-term liquidity to meet cash flow requirements under stressed scenarios. In addition, the Corporation also reviews static measures such as deposit funding as a percentage of total assets and liquid asset levels. Strong capital ratios, credit quality, and core earnings are also essential to maintaining cost effective access to wholesale funding markets. At September 30, 2020, the Corporation was in compliance with its internal liquidity objectives and has sufficient asset-based liquidity to meet its obligations under a stressed scenario. 

The Corporation maintains diverse and readily available liquidity sources, including: 

&#8226; Investment securities, which are an important tool to the Corporation&#8217;s liquidity objective and can be pledged or sold to enhance liquidity, if necessary. See Note 6 Investment Securities of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Corporation's investment securities portfolio, including pledged investment securities. 

&#8226; Pledgeable loan collateral, which is eligible collateral with both the Federal Reserve Bank and the FHLB under established lines of credit. Based on the amount of collateral pledged, the FHLB established a collateral value from which the Bank may draw advances against the collateral. The collateral is also used to enable the FHLB to issue letters of credit in favor of public fund depositors of the Bank. As of September 30, 2020, the Bank had $5.1 billion available for future advances. The Federal Reserve Bank also establishes a collateral value of assets to support borrowings from the discount window. As of September 30, 2020, the Bank had $943 million available for discount window borrowings. 

&#8226; A $200 million Parent Company commercial paper program, of which $51 million was outstanding as of September 30, 2020. 

&#8226; Dividends and service fees from subsidiaries, as well as the proceeds from issuance of capital, which are also funding sources for the Parent Company. 

&#8226; Equity issuances by the Parent Company; the Corporation has filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC under which the Parent Company may, from time to time, offer shares of the Corporation&#8217;s common stock in connection with acquisitions of businesses, assets, or securities of other companies. 

&#8226; Other issuances by the Parent Company; the Corporation also has filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC, under which the Parent Company may offer the following securities, either separately or in units: debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, and warrants. 

&#8226; Bank issuances; the Bank may also issue institutional CDs, network transaction deposits, and brokered CDs. 

&#8226; Global Bank Note Program issuances; the Bank has implemented the program pursuant to which it may from time to time offer up to $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of its unsecured senior and subordinated notes. In August 2018, the Bank issued $300 million of senior notes, due August 2021, and callable July 2021. 

Credit ratings relate to the Corporation&#8217;s ability to issue debt securities and the cost to borrow money, and should not be viewed as an indication of future stock performance or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. Adverse changes in these factors could result in a negative change in credit ratings and impact not only the ability to raise funds in the capital markets but also the cost of these funds. The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Bank at September 30, 2020 are displayed below:

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, net cash provided by operating activities and financing activities was $423 million and $1.7 billion, respectively, while net cash used in investing activities was $1.6 billion for a net increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $525 million since year-end 2019. At September 30, 2020, assets of $34.7 billion increased $2.3 billion, or 7%, from year-end 2019, primarily driven by a $2.2 billion, or 10%, increase in loans. On February 14, 2020, the Corporation added $370 million in loans from the First Staunton acquisition and at September 30, 2020 the Corporation had $1.0 billion in PPP loans that were originated throughout the year, largely in the second quarter of 2020. On the funding side, deposits of $26.7 billion increased $2.9 billion, or 12%, from year-end. On February 14, 2020, the Corporation assumed $439 million of deposits from the First Staunton acquisition. In addition, the increase in balances was due to customers holding proceeds from government stimulus programs in their deposit accounts. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, net cash provided by operating activities, and investing activities was $470 million, and $1.6 billion, respectively, while financing activities used net cash of $2.2 billion for a net decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $117 million since year-end 2018. At September 30, 2019, assets of $32.6 billion decreased $1.0 billion, or 3%, from year-end 2018, primarily driven by a $511 million, or 13% decrease in available for sale investment securities, and a $540 million, or 20%, decrease in held to maturity securities. On June 14, 2019, the Corporation added $116 million in loans from the Huntington branch acquisition. On the funding side, deposits of $24.4 billion decreased $475 million, or 2%, from year-end. On June 14, 2019, the Corporation assumed $725 million of deposits from the Huntington branch acquisition. As a result of the acquisition, the Corporation was able to reduce higher cost brokered CDs and network deposits. FHLB advances of $2.9 billion decreased $697 million, or 19%, from year-end 2018. 

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Market risk and interest rate risk are managed centrally. Market risk is the potential for loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of fixed income securities, equity securities, other earning assets and derivative financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates or other factors. Interest rate risk is the potential for reduced net interest income resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates. As a financial institution that engages in transactions involving an array of financial products, the Corporation is exposed to both market risk and interest rate risk. In addition to market risk, interest rate risk is measured and managed through a number of methods. The Corporation uses financial modeling simulation techniques that measure the sensitivity of future earnings due to changing rate environments to measure interest rate risk. 

Policies established by the Corporation&#8217;s ALCO and approved by the Board of Directors are intended to limit these risks. The Board has delegated day-to-day responsibility for managing market and interest rate risk to ALCO. The primary objectives of market risk management is to minimize any adverse effect that changes in market risk factors may have on net interest income and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets recorded at fair value. 

Interest Rate Risk 

The primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by the Board of Directors. These limits and guidelines reflect the Corporation's risk appetite for interest rate risk over both short-term and long-term horizons. No interest rate limit breaches occurred during the first nine months of 2020. 

The major sources of the Corporation's non-trading interest rate risk are timing differences in the maturity and re-pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities, changes in the shape of the yield curve, and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options. We measure these risks and their impact by identifying and quantifying exposures through the use of sophisticated simulation and valuation models which are employed by management to understand NII at risk, interest rate 

sensitive EAR, and MVE at risk. The Corporation&#8217;s interest rate risk profile is such that a higher or steeper yield curve adds to income while a flatter yield curve is relatively neutral, and a lower or inverted yield curve generally has a negative impact on earnings. The Corporation's EAR profile is asset sensitive at September 30, 2020. 

For further discussion of the Corporation's interest rate risk and corresponding key assumptions, see the Interest Rate Risk section of Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The sensitivity analysis included below is measured as a percentage change in NII and EAR due to gradual moves in benchmark interest rates from a baseline scenario over 12 months. We evaluate the sensitivity using: 1) a dynamic forecast incorporating expected growth in the balance sheet, and 2) a static forecast where the current balance sheet is held constant. 

While a gradual shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under a probable scenario, an instantaneous shift in interest rates would have a much more significant impact. 

Table 22 Estimated % Change in Rate Sensitive Earnings at Risk Over 12 Months 

&#160; Dynamic Forecast September 30, 2020 Static Forecast September 30, 2020 Dynamic Forecast December 31, 2019 Static Forecast December 31, 2019 Gradual Rate Change 100 bp increase in interest rates 5.8 % 5.8 % 4.0 % 3.7 % 200 bp increase in interest rates 11.8 % 11.5 % 7.4 % 6.7 % 

At September 30, 2020, the MVE profile indicates an increase in net balance sheet value due to instantaneous upward changes in rates. 

Table 23 Market Value of Equity Sensitivity 

September 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 Instantaneous Rate Change 100 bp increase in interest rates 1.7 % (0.5) % 200 bp increase in interest rates 2.9 % (2.1) % 

Since MVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in MVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, MVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changes in product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. 

The above NII, EAR, and MVE measures do not include all actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in response to anticipated changes in interest rates.

Capital 

Management actively reviews capital strategies for the Corporation and each of its subsidiaries in light of perceived business risks, future growth opportunities, industry standards, and compliance with regulatory requirements. The assessment of overall capital adequacy depends on a variety of factors, including asset quality, liquidity, stability of earnings, changing competitive forces, economic condition in markets served, and strength of management. At September 30, 2020, the capital ratios of the Corporation and its banking subsidiaries were in excess of regulatory minimum requirements. The Corporation&#8217;s capital ratios are summarized in the following table.

See Part II, Item 2, Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds, for information on the shares repurchased during the third quarter of 2020, which consisted entirely of repurchases related to tax withholding on equity compensation with no open market purchases due to the suspension of the share repurchase program on March 13, 2020. 

During the second quarter of 2020, the Corporation completed the issuance of 4.0 million depositary shares each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of 5.625% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series F, for net proceeds of approximately $97 million. 

In February 2019, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule (the "2019 CECL Rule") that revised certain capital regulations to account for changes to credit loss accounting under GAAP. The rule included a transition option that allows banking organizations to phase in, over a three-year period, the day-one impact of CECL adoption on regulatory capital ratios. In March 2020, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that maintains the three-year transition option of the 2019 CECL Rule and also provides an option to delay for two years an estimate of the effect of CECL on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology's effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. The Corporation has elected to utilize the CECL Transition Provision granted by the banking regulators. Under these provisions, the Day 1 capital impact relating to the adoption of ASU 2016-13 and 25% of the difference between the period end ACL and the Day 1 ACL will be 100% deferred for 2 years, and then phased in over the next 3 years. At September 30, 2020, the Corporation had a modified CECL transitional amount of $120 million.

(a) The ratio tangible common equity to tangible assets excludes goodwill and other intangible assets, net. This financial measure has been included as it is considered to be a critical metric with which to analyze and evaluate financial condition and capital strength. 

(b) The Federal Reserve establishes regulatory capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards for the Corporation. The Corporation follows Basel III, subject to certain transition provisions. These regulatory capital measurements are used by management, regulators, investors, and analysts to assess, monitor and compare the quality and composition of the Corporation's capital with the capital of other financial services companies. 

(c) The efficiency ratio as defined by the Federal Reserve guidance is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments) divided by the sum of net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains / losses, net. The fully tax-equivalent efficiency ratio is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments), excluding other intangible amortization, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains / losses, net. The adjusted efficiency ratio is noninterest expense, which excludes the provision for unfunded commitments, other intangible amortization, acquisition related costs and 3Q 2020 initiatives, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains (losses), net, acquisition related costs, and asset gains (losses), net. Management believes the adjusted efficiency ratio is a meaningful measure as it enhances the comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources and provides a better measure as to how the Corporation is managing its expenses by adjusting for acquisition related costs, provision for unfunded commitments, 3Q 2020 initiatives, and asset gains (losses), net. 

(d) 2020 periods include First Staunton acquisition related costs, while 2019 periods include Huntington branch and First Staunton acquisition related costs. 

(e) 3Q 2020 initiatives consist of cost saving efforts that were executed during the quarter. These initiatives included a $45 million loss on prepayment of FHLB advances, $10 million in severance, and $5 million in write-downs related to branch sales and lease breakage related to announced branch consolidations. 

Sequential Quarter Results 

The Corporation reported net income of $45 million for the third quarter of 2020, compared to net income of $149 million for the second quarter of 2020. Net income available to common equity was $40 million for the third quarter of 2020, or $0.26 for both basic and diluted earnings per common share. Comparatively, net income available to common equity for the second quarter of 2020 was $145 million, or $0.94 for both basic and diluted earnings per common share (see Table 1). 

Fully tax-equivalent net interest income for the third quarter of 2020 was $186 million, $8 million, or 4%, lower than the second quarter of 2020. The net interest margin in the third quarter of 2020 was down 18 bp to 2.31%. Average earning assets increased $855 million, or 3%, to $32.1 billion in the third quarter of 2020 primarily driven by excess funds invested at the Federal Reserve Bank which negatively impacted margin. On the funding side, average interest-bearing deposits were up $211 million, or 1%, and noninterest bearing deposits were up $486 million, or 7%, primarily due to customers holding proceeds from government stimulus programs in their deposit accounts. In addition, PPPLF borrowings increased $244 million while FHLB advances decreased $361 million, or 13%, primarily driven by the prepayment of $950 million of FHLB advances during the third quarter of 2020 (see Table 2). 

The provision for credit losses was $43 million for the third quarter of 2020, compared to $61 million in the second quarter of 2020 (see Table 17). See discussion under sections: Provision for Credit Losses, Nonperforming Assets, and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans. 

Noninterest income for the third quarter of 2020 decreased $179 million from the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to a $163 million gain on sale of ABRC during the second quarter of 2020 and lower insurance revenue related to the sale of ABRC (see Table 3). 

Noninterest expense increased $44 million, or 24%, to $228 million , due to incurring a $45 million loss on the prepayment of FHLB advances during the third quarter. In addition, personnel expense decreased quarter over quarter from the sale of ABRC partially offset by elevated severance from the announced restructurings during the third quarter of 2020 (see Table 4). 

For the third quarter of 2020, the Corporation recognized an income tax benefit of $58 million, compared to income tax expense of $51 million for the second quarter of 2020. The lower income tax expense during the third quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2020 was primarily driven by less income before taxes as a result of the second quarter gain on sale of ABRC, and the execution of tax planning strategies which allowed for the recognition of built in capital losses and a tax basis step-up yielding a change in the tax benefit of $35 million quarter over quarter. See Income Taxes section for a detailed discussion on income taxes. 

Comparable Quarter Results 

The Corporation reported net income of $45 million for the third quarter of 2020, compared to $83 million for the third quarter of 2019. Net income available to common equity was $40 million for the third quarter of 2020, or $0.26 for both basic and diluted earnings per common share. Comparatively, net income available to common equity for the third quarter of 2019 was $80 million, or $0.50 for basic earnings per share and $0.49 for diluted earnings per common share (see Table 1). 

Fully tax-equivalent net interest income for the third quarter of 2020 was $186 million, $24 million, or 12%, lower than the third quarter of 2019. The net interest margin between the comparable quarters was down 50 bp, to 2.31% in the third quarter of 2020. The decrease in net interest income and net interest margin was due to a lower interest rate environment. Average earning assets increased $2.3 billion, or 8%, to $32.1 billion in the third quarter of 2020 as the Corporation added PPP loans during the second and third quarters of 2020. Additionally, excess funds invested at the Federal Reserve increased which negatively impacted net interest margin. On the funding side, average interest-bearing deposits decreased $449 million, or 2%, from the third quarter of 2019, due to decreases in higher cost deposits. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $2.1 billion, or 39% to $7.4 billion. Average short and long-term funding increased $578 million, or 16%, partially due to an increase in PPPLF borrowings offset partially by decreases in both FHLB advances and long-term funding (see Table 2). 

The provision for credit losses was $43 million for the third quarter of 2020, compared to $2 million for the third quarter of 2019 (see Table 17). See discussion under sections: Provision for Credit Losses, Nonperforming Assets, and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans. 

Noninterest income for the third quarter of 2020 was $76 million, down $25 million. or 25%, compared to the third quarter of 2019, primarily due to minimal insurance revenue due to the sale of ABRC in the second quarter of 2020 (see Table 3). 

Noninterest expense increased $27 million, or 13%, to $228 million for the third quarter of 2020, due to a $45 million loss on the prepayment of FHLB advances , partially offset by a $15 million, or 12%, decrease in personnel expense primarily related

to the sale of ABRC partially offset by elevated severance from the announced restructurings during the third quarter of 2020 (see Table 4). 

The Corporation recognized an income tax benefit of $58 million for the third quarter of 2020, compared to income tax expense of $21 million for the third quarter of 2019. Income tax expense is lower than the comparable quarter primarily driven by less income before taxes, and the execution of tax planning strategies which allowed for the recognition of built in capital losses and a tax basis step-up yielding a decrease in tax expense of $49 million during the third quarter of 2020. See section Income Taxes for a detailed discussion on income taxes. 

Segment Review 

As discussed in Note 15 Segment Reporting of the notes to consolidated financial statements, the Corporation&#8217;s reportable segments have been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain strategic business units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes where the nature of the products and services, the type of customer, and the distribution of those products and services are similar. The reportable segments are Corporate and Commercial Specialty; Community, Consumer and Business; and Risk Management and Shared Services.

(b) For the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Risk Management and Shared Services segment included approximately $218 thousand and $2 million respectively, of acquisition related noninterest expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Risk Management and Shared Services segment included approximately $2 million and $6 million respectively, of acquisition related noninterest expense. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, the Risk Management and Shared Services segment also incurred a $45 million loss on the prepayment of FHLB advances. 

(c) For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the Corporation recognized a $163 million asset gain related to the sale of ABRC. 

(d) The Corporation has recognized $63 million in tax benefits for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, and $49 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, primarily driven by tax planning strategies which allowed for the recognition of built in capital losses and tax basis step-up yielding this tax benefit. 

Notable Changes in Segment Financial Data 

The Corporate and Commercial Specialty segment consists of lending and deposit solutions to larger businesses, developers, not-for-profits, municipalities, and financial institutions, and the support to deliver, fund, and manage such banking solutions. In addition, this segment provides a variety of investment, fiduciary, and retirement planning products and services to individuals and small to mid-sized businesses. 

&#8226; Revenue increased $4 million, or 3%, from the three months ended September 30, 2019, and increased $13 million, or 3%, from the first nine months of 2019. The increase from the nine months ended 2019 was primarily driven by a $9 million increase in capital market fees, which were driven by higher interest rate swap fees. 

&#8226; Noninterest expense decreased $6 million, or 10%, from the three months ended September 30, 2019, and decreased $15 million, or 9%, from the first nine months of 2019. The decrease from the first nine months of 2019 was mainly driven by an $11 million decrease in personnel expense primarily related to a decrease in the funding for the management incentive plan. 

&#8226; Average loans increased $1.7 billion, or 13%, from the three months ended September 30, 2019, and increased $1.3 billion, or 10%, from the first nine months of 2019, primarily driven by PPP loans and growth in CRE loans. 

The Community, Consumer, and Business segment consists of lending, deposit solutions, and historically offered ancillary financial services, primarily insurance and risk consulting, to individuals and small to mid-sized businesses. 

&#8226; Revenue decreased $43 million, or 27%, from the three months ended September 30, 2019, and decreased $66 million, or 14%, from the first nine months of 2019. The decrease from the nine months ended 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in segment net interest income of $36 million which was largely driven by the current interest rate environment, along with a $24 million decrease in insurance commissions and fees which can be attributed to the sale of ABRC. 

&#8226; Noninterest expense decreased $16 million, or 14%, from the three months ended September 30, 2019, and decreased $10 million, or 3%, from the first nine months of 2019, primarily driven by a $10 million decrease in personnel expense, largely driven by a reduction in FTEs as a result of the sale of ABRC. 

&#8226; Average deposits increased $2.2 billion, or 17%, from the three months ended September 30, 2019, and increased $2.0 billion, or 16%, from the first nine months of 2019, primarily driven by customers holding proceeds from government stimulus programs in their deposit accounts. 

The Risk Management and Shared Services segment includes key shared Corporate functions, Parent Company activity, intersegment eliminations, and residual revenues and expenses. 

&#8226; Revenues decreased $10 million, or 64%, from the three months ended September 30, 2019, but increased $133 million from the first nine months of 2019, primarily driven by a $163 million asset gain on sale of ABRC. 

&#8226; Credit provision increased $37 million from the three months ended September 30, 2019, and increased $135 million from the first nine months of 2019, as a result of the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic within the economic models used in the new expected credit loss methodology. 

&#8226; Noninterest expense increased $49 million from the three months ended September 30, 2019, and increased $38 million, or 54%, from the first nine months of 2019. The increase from the first nine months of 2019 was mainly driven by a $45 million FHLB prepayment fee, which was partially offset by a $12 million decrease in personnel expense related to a decrease in the funding for the management incentive plan. 

&#8226; Income tax expense decreased $74 million from the three months ended September 30, 2019, and decreased $51 million from the first nine months of 2019. The lower tax expense from the first nine months of 2019 was due to tax planning strategies, which led to a $63 million tax benefit. 

&#8226; Average loans decreased $215 million, or 20%, from the three months ended September 30, 2019, and decreased $271 million, or 23%, from the first nine months of 2019. The decrease from the first nine months of 2019 was mainly driven by a decrease in oil and gas lending. 

&#8226; Average deposits decreased $216 million, or 12%, from the three months ended September 30, 2019, and decreased $635 million, or 28%, from the first nine months of 2019, primarily driven by a decrease in higher cost network and time deposit accounts. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and revenues and expenses for the period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the determination of the ACLL, goodwill impairment assessment, MSRs valuation, and income taxes. A discussion of these policies can be found in the Critical Accounting Policies section in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There has been one change in the Corporation's application of critical accounting policies since December 31, 2019 driven by the adoption of ASU 2016-13. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans: Management&#8217;s evaluation process used to determine the appropriateness of the ACLL is subject to the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments. The evaluation process combines many factors: management&#8217;s ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio using a dual risk rating system leveraging probability of default and loss given default, consideration of historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and nonaccrual loans, risk characteristics of the various classifications of loans, concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries, existing economic conditions and forecasts, the fair value of underlying collateral, and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect future credit losses. Because current economic conditions and forecasts can change and future events are inherently difficult to predict, the anticipated amount of estimated credit losses on loans, and therefore the appropriateness of the ACLL, could change significantly. The Corporation uses Moody's baseline economic forecast within its model. As an integral part of their examination process, various regulatory agencies also review the ACLL. Such agencies may require additions to the ACLL or may require that certain loan balances be charged off or downgraded into criticized loan categories when their credit evaluations differ from those of management, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. The Corporation believes the level of the ACLL is appropriate. See Note 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements as well as the Allowance for Credit Losses section. 

Recent Developments 

On October 8, 2020, the SBA released a streamlined loan forgiveness application for PPP loans totaling $50,000 or less. This release is expected to simplify the forgiveness application and allow for quicker receipt of paydowns of small balance PPP loans.
