Overview 

The following discussion and analysis is presented to assist in the understanding and evaluation of the Corporation&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. It is intended to complement the unaudited consolidated financial statements, footnotes, and supplemental financial data appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and should be read in conjunction therewith. Management continually evaluates strategic acquisition opportunities and various other strategic alternatives that could involve the sale or acquisition of branches or other assets, or the consolidation or creation of subsidiaries. Within the tables presented, certain columns and rows may not sum due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. 

On September 9, 2021, the Corporation presented a new growth focused and digital forward strategic vision which included taking the following actions or committing to future actions: 

Expanding our Lending Capabilities : 

&#8226; Diversifying our consumer portfolio by growing auto finance 

&#8226; Broadening current asset-based lending capabilities 

&#8226; Launching equipment finance vertical in our commercial business 

Growing our Core Businesses : 

&#8226; Accelerating core commercial middle market lending growth 

&#8226; Enhancing small business, consumer direct and home equity line of credit lending 

&#8226; Retooling our mass affluent strategy 

Investing in our Digital Transformation : 

&#8226; Redirecting $50 million of investment over the next five years to digital with incremental costs expected to be funded by the annual run-rate savings from the planned branch consolidations, back-office facilities consolidations, and the transformation of legacy IT infrastructure 

&#8226; Preparing to deploy new mobile and online systems in the next six months 

&#8226; Transforming our legacy IT infrastructure to deliver greater differentiation 

Optimizing Capital Proactively: 

&#8226; Optimizing tangible common equity to accelerate return on average tangible common equity expansion 

&#8226; Paying a dividend commensurate with performance 

&#8226; Reducing our preferred capital layers 

Performance Summary 

&#8226; Average loans of $24.1 billion decreased $343 million, or 1%, compared to the first nine months of 2020. The Corporation expects 2021 commercial loan growth, excluding PPP, of approximately 2%. 

&#8226; Average deposits of $27.5 billion increased $1.7 billion, or 7%, from the first nine months of 2020, driven primarily by government stimulus related inflows and changing savings habits by customers in response to the pandemic. 

&#8226; Net interest income of $539 million decreased $36 million, or 6%, from the first nine months of 2020, and n et interest margin was 2.38% compared to 2.54% for the first nine months of 2020. Both decreases were primarily due to a lower interest rate environment. The Corporation expects a full year margin of approximately 2.40%. 

&#8226; Provision for credit losses had a release of $82 million , compared to provision expense of $157 million for the first nine months of 2020. The Corporation expects fourth quarter provision to adjust with changes to risk grade, economic conditions, other indications of credit quality, and loan volume. 

&#8226; Noninterest income of $251 million decreased $177 million, or 41%, from the first nine months of 2020, primarily driven by the $163 million gain on the sale of ABRC in 2020 and the resulting reduction in related insurance revenues. The Corporation expects 2021 noninterest income to be at the upper end of the $315 million to $325 million range. 

&#8226; Noninterest expense of $528 million decreased $75 million , or 13%, from the first nine months of 2020, primarily due to a $45 million loss on prepayment of FHLB advances incurred during 2020 and a decrease in personnel expense of $15 million , or 5%, from 2020 which was primarily due to having fewer employees partially offset by an increase in funding for the management incentive plan. The Corporation expects 2021 noninterest expense of approximately $705 million to $711 million, including initiatives and proposed facilities exit costs.

Notable Contributions to the Change in Net Interest Income 

&#8226; Net interest income on the consolidated statements of income (which excludes the fully tax-equivalent adjustment) was $539 million for the first nine months of 2021 compared to $575 million for the first nine months of 2020. Fully tax-equivalent net interest income of $551 million for the first nine months of 2021 was $36 million, or 6%, lower than the first nine months of 2020. The net interest margin for the first nine months of 2021 was 2.38% compared to 2.54% for the first nine months of 2020. The decreases were attributable to a lower interest rate environment and increased liquidity being held in lower yielding interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions. See sections Interest Rate Risk and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a discussion of interest rate risk and market risk. 

&#8226; Average interest-bearing liabilities of $21.8 billion for the first nine months of 2021 were down $1.5 billion, or 7%, compared to the first nine months of 2020. On average, FHLB advances decreased $1.2 billion, or 43%, primarily driven by the Corporation's prepayment of $950 million in FHLB advances during the third quarter of 2020. Interest-bearing deposits increased $349 million, or 2%, primarily driven by an increase in low cost deposits partially offset by decreases in higher cost deposits. Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits of $8.0 billion for the first nine months of 2021 were up $1.3 billion, or 20%, versus the first nine months of 2020. 

&#8226; The cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 0.35% for the first nine months of 2021, which was a 37 bp drop from the first nine months of 2020, primarily attributable to the federal funds rate decreases which occurred in March 2020. 

&#8226; The Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds target interest to a range of 0.00% to 0.25% in March 2020, which has remained constant through the end of the third quarter of 2021. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses is predominantly a function of the Corporation&#8217;s reserving methodology and judgments as to other qualitative and quantitative factors used to determine the appropriate level of the ACLL, which focuses on changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio, changes in levels of individually evaluated and other nonaccrual loans, historical losses and delinquencies in each portfolio category, the risk inherent in specific loans, concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries, existing economic conditions and economic forecasts, the fair value of underlying collateral, and other factors which could affect potential credit losses. The forecast the Corporation used for September 30, 2021 was the Moody's baseline scenario from September 2021 over a 2 year reasonable and supportable period with straight-line reversion to historical losses over the second year of the period. See additional discussion under the sections titled, Loans, Credit Risk, Nonperforming Assets, and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans.

Notable Contributions to the Change in Noninterest Income 

&#8226; Mortgage banking, net increased $12 million from the first nine months of 2020 due to a $12 million recovery of MSRs impairment during 2021 as a result of market rates recovering, compared to impairment of $18 million during the first nine months of 2020 offset by decreased gains on sold loans due to lower mortgage settlements as well as contracting margins on the loans sold. 

&#8226; Asset gains (losses), net decreased $147 million from the first nine months of 2020, driven by a gain of $163 million from the sale of ABRC during the second quarter of 2020, offset by a gain of $2 million from the sale of Whitnell and higher gains from private equity investments during the first nine months of 2021. 

&#8226; Insurance commissions and fees decreased $45 million from the first nine months of 2020, driven by the sale of ABRC during the second quarter of 2020 which largely eliminated the source of noninterest income. 

&#8226; Service charges and deposit account fees increased $6 million from the first nine months of 2020 as a result of service charges that were waived during 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Notable Contributions to the Change in Noninterest Expense 

&#8226; Personnel expense decreased $15 million from the first nine months of 2020, primarily due to having fewer employees as a result of the sales of ABRC and Whitnell, corporate restructurings, and branch sales, partially offset by an increase in funding for the management incentive plan. 

&#8226; Business development and advertising expenses increased $3 million in the first nine months of 2021 as travel and advertising activity has resumed and begun to normalize from the pandemic lows. 

&#8226; During the third quarter of 2020, the Corporation prepaid $950 million of long-term FHLB advances and incurred a loss of $45 million on the prepayment. 

Income Taxes 

The Corporation recognized income tax expense of $70 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to income tax expense of $3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The Corporation's effective tax rate was 20.37% for the first nine months of 2021, compared to an effective tax rate of 1.37% for the first nine months of 2020. The increases in the effective tax rate and income tax expense during the first nine months of 2021 were primarily driven by tax planning strategies which occurred during the third quarter of 2020. The Corporation expects a full year effective tax rate of 19% to 21%, assuming no change in the statutory corporate tax rate. 

Income tax expense recorded on the consolidated statements of income involves the interpretation and application of certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax laws and regulations, and is, therefore, considered a critical accounting policy. The Corporation is subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Examination by taxing authorities may impact the amount of tax expense and / or reserve for uncertainty in income taxes if their interpretations differ from those of management, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations. See section Critical Accounting Policies, in the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on income taxes.

The Corporation has long-term guidelines relative to the proportion of Commercial and Business, CRE, and Consumer loan commitments within the overall loan portfolio, with each targeted to represent 30 to 40% of the overall loan portfolio. The targeted long-term guidelines were unchanged during 2020 and the first nine months of 2021. Furthermore, certain sub-asset classes within the respective portfolios are further defined and dollar limitations are placed on these sub-portfolios. These guidelines and limits are reviewed quarterly and approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors. These guidelines and limits are designed to create balance and diversification within the loan portfolios. 

The Corporation&#8217;s loan distribution and interest rate sensitivity as of September 30, 2021 are summarized in the following table:

Credit Risk 

An active credit risk management process is used for commercial loans to ensure that sound and consistent credit decisions are made. Credit risk is controlled by detailed underwriting procedures, comprehensive loan administration, and periodic review of borrowers&#8217; outstanding loans and commitments. Borrower relationships are formally reviewed and graded on an ongoing basis for early identification of potential problems. Further analysis by customer, industry, and geographic location are performed to monitor trends, financial performance, and concentrations. See Note 7 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on managing overall credit quality. 

The loan portfolio is widely diversified by types of borrowers, industry groups, and market areas within the Corporation's branch footprint. Significant loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to numerous borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. At September 30, 2021, no significant concentrations existed in the Corporation&#8217;s portfolio in excess of 10% of total loans. 

Commercial and business lending: The commercial and business lending classification primarily includes commercial loans to large corporations, middle market companies, small businesses, and lease financing.

The remaining commercial and business lending portfolio is spread over a diverse range of industries, none of which exceed 2% of total loans. 

The credit risk related to commercial loans is largely influenced by general economic conditions and the resulting impact on a borrower&#8217;s operations or on the value of underlying collateral, if any. 

Commercial real estate - investor: CRE-investor is comprised of loans secured by various non-owner occupied or investor income producing property types.

The remaining CRE-investor portfolio is spread over various other property types, none of which exceed 2% of total loans. 

Credit risk is managed in a similar manner to commercial and business lending by employing sound underwriting guidelines, lending primarily to borrowers in local markets and businesses, periodically evaluating the underlying collateral, and formally reviewing the borrower&#8217;s financial soundness and relationship on an ongoing basis. 

Real estate construction: Real estate construction loans are primarily short-term or interim loans that provide financing for the acquisition or development of commercial income properties, multi-family projects, or residential development, both single family and condominium. Real estate construction loans are made to developers and project managers who are generally well known to the Corporation and have prior successful project experience. The credit risk associated with real estate construction loans is generally confined to specific geographic areas but is also influenced by general economic conditions. The Corporation controls the credit risk on these types of loans by making loans in familiar markets to developers, reviewing the merits of individual projects, controlling loan structure, and monitoring project progress and construction advances. 

Table 9 Largest Real Estate Construction Property Type Exposures September 30, 2021 % of Total Loans % of Total Real Estate Construction Multi-Family 3 % 32 % 

The remaining real estate construction portfolio is spread over various other property types, none of which exceed 2% of total loans. 

The Corporation&#8217;s current lending standards for CRE and real estate construction lending are determined by property type and specifically address many criteria, including: maximum loan amounts, maximum LTV, requirements for pre-leasing and / or presales, minimum borrower equity, and maximum loan-to-cost. Currently, the maximum standard for LTV is 80%, with lower limits established for certain higher risk types, such as raw land that has a 50% LTV maximum. The Corporation&#8217;s LTV guidelines are in compliance with regulatory supervisory limits. In most cases, for real estate construction loans, the loan amounts include interest reserves, which are built into the loans and sized to fund loan payments through construction and lease up and / or sell out. 

Residential mortgages: Residential mortgage loans are primarily first lien home mortgages with a maximum loan-to-collateral value without credit enhancement (e.g. private mortgage insurance) of 80%. The residential mortgage portfolio is focused primarily in the Corporation's three-state branch footprint, with approximately 87% of the outstanding loan balances in the Corporation's branch footprint at September 30, 2021. The majority of the on balance sheet residential mortgage portfolio consists of LIBOR or constant maturity treasury based, hybrid, adjustable rate mortgage loans with initial fixed rate terms of 3, 5, 7, or 10 years. The rates on these mortgages adjust based upon the movement in the underlying index which is then added to a margin and rounded to the nearest 0.125%. That result is then subjected to any periodic caps to produce the borrower's interest rate for the coming term. 

In 2014, the Financial Stability Oversight Council and Financial Stability Board raised concerns about the reliability and robustness of LIBOR and called for the development of alternative interest rate benchmarks. The ARRC, through authority from the Federal Reserve, have selected the SOFR as the alternative rate and developed a paced transition plan which addresses the risk that LIBOR may not exist beyond the end of 2021. There are still many components of this plan which have not been fully decided or implemented in the industry. As a result, the Corporation is reaching out to certain borrowers offering an opportunity to refinance or modify their loans to avoid any uncertainty around the LIBOR transition. Performing borrowers can modify or refinance to a fixed interest rate or an adjustable rate mortgage tied to the one-year treasury adjusted to a constant maturity of one-year with an appropriate margin. This provides the Bank and borrower with greater certainty around the loan structure. The Bank has not booked a LIBOR adjustable rate mortgage since the first quarter of 2020. 

The Corporation generally retains certain fixed-rate residential real estate mortgages in its loan portfolio, including retail and private banking jumbo mortgages and CRA-related mortgages. As part of management&#8217;s historical practice of originating and servicing residential mortgage loans, generally the Corporation&#8217;s 30 year, agency conforming, fixed-rate residential real estate mortgage loans have been sold in the secondary market with servicing rights retained. Subject to management&#8217;s analysis of the current interest rate environment, among other market factors, the Corporation may choose to retain 30 year mortgage loan production on its balance sheet. See section Loans for additional information on loans. 

The Corporation&#8217;s underwriting and risk-based pricing guidelines for residential mortgage loans include minimum borrower FICO and maximum LTV of the property securing the loan. Residential mortgage products generally are underwritten using FHLMC and FNMA secondary marketing guidelines. 

Home equity: Home equity consists of both home equity lines of credit and closed-end home equity loans. The Corporation&#8217;s credit risk monitoring guidelines for home equity is based on an ongoing review of loan delinquency status, as well as a quarterly review of FICO score deterioration and property devaluation. The Corporation does not routinely obtain appraisals on performing loans to update LTV ratios after origination; however, the Corporation monitors the local housing markets by reviewing the various home price indices and incorporates the impact of the changing market conditions in its ongoing credit monitoring process. For junior lien home equity loans, the Corporation is unable to track the performance of the first lien loan if it does not own or service the first lien loan. However, the Corporation obtains a refreshed FICO score on a quarterly basis and monitors this as part of its assessment of the home equity portfolio. 

The Corporation&#8217;s underwriting and risk-based pricing guidelines for home equity lines of credit and loans consist of a combination of both borrower FICO and the original cumulative LTV against the property securing the loan. Currently, the Corporation's policy sets the maximum acceptable LTV at 90% and the minimum acceptable FICO at 670. The Corporation's current home equity line of credit offering is priced based on floating rate indices and generally allows 10 years of interest-only payments followed by a 20-year amortization of the outstanding balance. The loans in the Corporation's portfolio generally have an original term of 20 years with principal and interest payments required. See section Loans for additional information on loans. 

Other consumer: Other consumer consists of student loans, short-term personal installment loans, and credit cards. The Corporation had $107 million and $118 million of student loans at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, the majority of which are government guaranteed. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the passage of the CARES Act, and subsequent executive orders, the federal student loan relief was extended through January 31, 2022. Credit risk for non-government guaranteed student loans, short-term personal installment loans, and credit cards is influenced by general economic conditions, the characteristics of individual borrowers, and the nature of the loan collateral. Risks of loss are generally on smaller average balances per loan spread over many borrowers. Once charged off, there is usually less opportunity for recovery of these smaller consumer loans. Credit risk is primarily controlled by reviewing the creditworthiness of the borrowers, monitoring payment histories, and taking appropriate collateral and guarantee positions. The student loan portfolio is in run-off and no new student loans are being originated. 

SBA Loans under the PPP: 

The Corporation began submitting PPP forgiveness applications on behalf of our customers on September 14, 2020. On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid Act was signed into law, which included another round of PPP funding. The Corporation began originating the new round of PPP loans in January 2021 until the statutory end of the program in May 2021. 

The following table summarizes the balance segmentation of the PPP loans and associated deferred fees as of September 30, 2021:

PPP loans are 100% guaranteed by the SBA and therefore the Corporation considers these loans to have a &#160; risk profile similar to pass rated loans. 

Nonaccrual loans: Nonaccrual loans are considered to be one indicator of potential future loan losses. See Note 7 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional nonaccrual loan disclosures. See also sections Credit Risk and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans. 

Accruing loans past due 90 days or more: Loans past due 90 days or more but still accruing interest are classified as such where the underlying loans are both well secured (the collateral value is sufficient to cover principal and accrued interest) and are in the process of collection. 

Restructured loans: Loans are considered restructured loans if concessions have been granted to borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty. See also Note 7 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional restructured loans disclosures. 

Potential problem loans: The level of potential problem loans is another predominant factor in determining the relative level of risk in the loan portfolio and in determining the appropriate level of the ACLL. Potential problem loans are generally defined by management to include loans rated as substandard by management that are collectively evaluated (not nonaccrual loans or accruing TDRs); however, there are circumstances present to create doubt as to the ability of the borrower to comply with present repayment terms. The decision of management to include performing loans in potential problem loans does not necessarily mean that the Corporation expects losses to occur, but that management recognizes a higher degree of risk associated with these loans. 

OREO: Management actively seeks to ensure OREO properties held are monitored to minimize the Corporation&#8217;s risk of loss. 

Other nonperforming assets: During 2020, the Corporation wrote off the ownership interest in an oil and gas limited liability company it had received in partial settlement of a debt. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans 

Credit risks within the loan portfolio are inherently different for each loan type. Credit risk is controlled and monitored through the use of lending standards, a thorough review of potential borrowers, and ongoing review of loan payment performance. Active asset quality administration, including early problem loan identification and timely resolution of problems, aids in the management of credit risk and the minimization of loan losses. Credit risk management for each loan type is discussed in the section entitled Credit Risk. See Note 7 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures on the ACLL. 

To assess the appropriateness of the ACLL, the Corporation focuses on the evaluation of many factors, including but not limited to: evaluation of facts and issues related to specific loans, management&#8217;s ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio, credit report refreshes, consideration of historical loan loss and delinquency experience on each portfolio category, trends in past due and nonaccrual loans, the level of potential problem loans, the risk characteristics of the various classifications of loan segments, changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio, concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries, existing economic conditions and economic forecasts, the fair value of underlying collateral, funding assumptions on lines, and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. The Corporation utilized the Moody's baseline forecast for September 2021 in the allowance model. The forecast is applied over a 2 year reasonable and supportable period with straight-line reversion to historical losses over the second year of the period. Assessing these factors involves significant judgment. Because each of the criteria used is subject to change, the ACLL is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future credit losses on loans in any particular segment. Therefore, management considers the ACLL a critical accounting policy, see section Critical Accounting Policies for additional information on the ACLL. See section Nonperforming Assets for a detailed discussion on asset quality. See also Note 7 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional ACLL disclosures. Table 5 provides information on loan growth and period end loan composition, Table 11 provides additional information regarding NPAs, and Table 12 and Table 13 provide additional information regarding activity in the ACLL. 

The loan segmentation used in calculating the ACLL at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was generally comparable. The methodology to calculate the ACLL consists of the following components: a valuation allowance estimate is established for commercial and consumer loans determined by the Corporation to be individually evaluated, using discounted cash flows, estimated fair value of underlying collateral, and/or other data available. Loans are segmented for criticized loan pools by loan type as well as for non-criticized loan pools by loan type, primarily based on historical loss rates after considering loan type, historical loss and delinquency experience, credit quality, and industry classifications. Loans that have been criticized are considered to have a higher risk of default than non-criticized loans, as circumstances were present to support the lower loan grade, warranting higher loss factors. The loss factors applied in the methodology are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted to reflect changes in historical loss levels or other risks. Additionally, management allocates ACLL to absorb losses that may not be provided for by the other components due to qualitative factors evaluated by management, such as limitations within the credit risk grading process, known current economic or business conditions that may not yet show in trends, industry or other concentrations with current issues that impose higher inherent risks than are reflected in the loss factors, and other relevant considerations. The total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the loan portfolio.

Notable Contributions to the Change in the Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans 

&#8226; Potential problem loans decreased $31 million, or 11%, from December 31, 2020, and decreased $42 million, or 14%, from September 30, 2020. The decrease from December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by PPP loans, as they have been forgiven, along with a decrease in CRE-investor lending. The decrease from September 30, 2020 was primarily driven by decreases in CRE-investor, commercial and industrial lending, and PPP loans. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in real estate construction. See Table 11 for additional information regarding potential problem loans. 

&#8226; Total nonaccrual loans decreased $76 million, or 36%, from December 31, 2020, and decreased $97 million, or 42%, from September 30, 2020. The decrease from December 31, 2020 was primarily due to decreases in commercial and industrial lending along with CRE-investor lending. The decrease from September 30, 2020 was primarily driven by a decrease in commercial and industrial lending. As economic conditions trended downward in 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, nonaccrual loans increased. As economic conditions have been improving throughout 2021, nonaccrual loans have decreased. See Note 7 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements and Table 11 for additional disclosures on the changes in asset quality. 

&#8226; YTD net charge offs decreased $56 million, or 76%, from September 30, 2020, primarily driven by decreased charge off amounts in commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by higher charge off amounts in CRE-investor lending due to COVID-19 related impacts in that industry. See Table 12 and Table 13 for additional information on the activity in the ACLL. 

Management believes the level of ACLL to be appropriate at September 30, 2021.

&#8226; Total deposits, which are the Corporation's largest source of funds, increased $1.4 billion, or 5%, from December 31, 2020, and increased $1.1 billion, or 4%, from September 30, 2020, as government stimulus related inflows and customer savings habits have changed in response to the pandemic. 

&#8226; Time deposits decreased $346 million, or 20%, from December 31, 2020, and decreased $616 million, or 30%, from September 30, 2020, due to higher priced time deposits rolling off as they mature. 

&#8226; Included in the above amounts were $929 million of network deposits, primarily sourced from other financial institutions and intermediaries. These represented 3% of the Corporation's total deposits at September 30, 2021. Network deposits decreased $268 million, or 22%, from December 31, 2020, and decreased $462 million, or 33%, from September 30, 2020. 

Liquidity 

The objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that the Corporation has the ability to generate sufficient cash or cash equivalents in a timely and cost effective manner to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers and to meet its other commitments as they become due. The Corporation&#8217;s liquidity risk management process is designed to identify, measure, and manage the Corporation&#8217;s funding and liquidity risk to meet its daily funding needs in the ordinary course of business, as well as to address expected and unexpected changes in its funding requirements. The Corporation engages in various activities to manage its liquidity risk, including diversifying its funding sources, stress testing, and holding readily-marketable assets which can be used as a source of liquidity, if needed. 

The Corporation performs dynamic scenario analysis in accordance with industry best practices. Measures have been established to ensure the Corporation has sufficient high quality short-term liquidity to meet cash flow requirements under stressed scenarios. In addition, the Corporation also reviews static measures such as deposit funding as a percentage of total assets and liquid asset levels. Strong capital ratios, credit quality, and core earnings are also essential to maintaining cost effective access to wholesale funding markets. At September 30, 2021, the Corporation was in compliance with its internal liquidity objectives and had sufficient asset-based liquidity to meet its obligations under a stressed scenario. 

The Corporation maintains diverse and readily available liquidity sources, including: 

&#8226; Investment securities, which are an important tool to the Corporation&#8217;s liquidity objective and can be pledged or sold to enhance liquidity, if necessary. See Note 6 Investment Securities of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Corporation's investment securities portfolio, including pledged investment securities. 

&#8226; Pledgeable loan collateral, which is eligible collateral with both the Federal Reserve Bank and the FHLB under established lines of credit. Based on the amount of collateral pledged, the FHLB established a collateral value from which the Bank may draw advances, and issue letters of credit in favor of public fund depositors, against the collateral. As of September 30, 2021, the Bank had $5.1 billion available for future funding. The Federal Reserve Bank also establishes a 

collateral value of assets to support borrowings from the discount window. As of September 30, 2021, the Bank had $731 million available for discount window borrowings. 

&#8226; A $200 million Parent Company commercial paper program, of which $55 million was outstanding as of September 30, 2021. 

&#8226; Dividends and service fees from subsidiaries, as well as the proceeds from issuance of capital are also funding sources for the Parent Company. 

&#8226; Acquisition related equity issuances by the Parent Company; the Corporation has filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC under which the Parent Company may, from time to time, offer shares of the Corporation&#8217;s common stock in connection with acquisitions of businesses, assets, or securities of other companies. 

&#8226; Other issuances by the Parent Company; the Corporation maintains on file with the SEC a universal shelf registration statement, under which the Parent Company may offer the following securities, either separately or in units: debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, and warrants. 

&#8226; Bank issuances; the Bank may also issue institutional CDs, network transaction deposits, and brokered CDs. 

&#8226; Global Bank Note Program issuances; the Bank has implemented a program pursuant to which it may from time to time offer up to $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of its unsecured senior and subordinated notes. 

Credit ratings relate to the Corporation&#8217;s ability to issue debt securities and the cost to borrow money, and should not be viewed as an indication of future stock performance or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. Adverse changes in these factors could result in a negative change in credit ratings and impact not only the ability to raise funds in the capital markets but also the cost of these funds. The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Bank at September 30, 2021 are displayed below:

For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, net cash provided by operating activities and financing activities was $364 million and $768 million, respectively, while net cash used in investing activities was $162 million for a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of $970 million since year-end 2020. At September 30, 2021, assets of $34.4 billion increased $1.0 billion, or 3%, from year-end 2020, primarily driven by a $983 million increase in interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions and an increase of $808 million, or 26%, in investment securities AFS, at fair value, partially offset by a $830 million, or 3%, decrease in loans. On the funding side, deposits of $27.9 billion increased $1.4 billion, or 5%, from year-end related to deposit inflows from government stimulus programs and changing customer savings habits. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, net cash provided by operating and financing activities was $423 million and $1.7 billion, respectively, while net cash used in investing activities was $1.6 billion, for a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of $525 million from year-end 2019. At September 30, 2020, assets of $34.7 billion increased $2.3 billion, or 7%, from year-end 2019, primarily due to a $2.2 billion, or 10%, increase in loans, driven by the Corporation adding $1.0 billion in PPP loans and customers drawing on their lines to enhance their liquidity in response to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, on February 14, 2020, the Corporation added $370 million in loans from the First Staunton acquisition. On the funding side, deposits of $26.7 billion increased $2.9 billion, or 12%, from year-end 2019 as advances on customer's loans were deposited into their deposit accounts, increasing their liquidity. Additionally, on February 14, 2020, the Corporation assumed $439 million of deposits from the First Staunton acquisition. 

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Market risk and interest rate risk are managed centrally. Market risk is the potential for loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of fixed income securities, equity securities, other earning assets and derivative financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates or other factors. Interest rate risk is the potential for reduced net interest income resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates. As a financial institution that engages in transactions involving an array of financial products, the Corporation is exposed to both market risk and interest rate risk. In addition to market risk, interest rate risk is measured and managed through a number of methods. The Corporation uses financial modeling simulation techniques that measure the sensitivity of future earnings due to changing rate environments to measure interest rate risk. 

Policies established by the Corporation&#8217;s ALCO and approved by the Board of Directors are intended to limit these risks. The Board has delegated day-to-day responsibility for managing market and interest rate risk to ALCO. The primary objectives of market risk management are to minimize any adverse effect that changes in market risk factors may have on net interest income and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets recorded at fair value. 

Interest Rate Risk 

The primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by the Board of Directors. These limits and guidelines reflect the Corporation's risk appetite for interest rate risk over both short-term and long-term horizons. No interest rate limit breaches occurred during the first nine months of 2021. 

The major sources of the Corporation's non-trading interest rate risk are timing differences in the maturity and re-pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities, changes in the shape of the yield curve, and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options. We measure these risks and their impact by identifying and quantifying exposures through the use of sophisticated simulation and valuation models which are employed by management to understand NII at risk, interest rate sensitive EAR, and MVE at risk. The Corporation&#8217;s interest rate risk profile is such that a higher or steeper yield curve adds to income while a flatter yield curve is relatively neutral, and a lower or inverted yield curve generally has a negative impact on earnings. The Corporation's EAR profile is asset sensitive at September 30, 2021. 

For further discussion of the Corporation's interest rate risk and corresponding key assumptions, see the Interest Rate Risk section of Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The sensitivity analysis included below is measured as a percentage change in NII and EAR due to gradual moves in benchmark interest rates from a baseline scenario over 12 months. We evaluate the sensitivity using: 1) a dynamic forecast incorporating expected growth in the balance sheet, and 2) a static forecast where the current balance sheet is held constant. 

While a gradual shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under a probable scenario, an instantaneous shift in interest rates would have a much more significant impact. 

Table 16 Estimated % Change in Rate Sensitive Earnings at Risk Over 12 Months Sep 30, 2021 Dec 31, 2020 &#160; Dynamic Forecast Static Forecast Dynamic Forecast Static Forecast Gradual Rate Change 100 bp increase in interest rates 5.8 % 5.5 % 6.2 % 6.3 % 200 bp increase in interest rates 12.1 % 11.0 % 12.8 % 12.7 % 

At September 30, 2021, the MVE profile indicates a decrease in net balance sheet value due to instantaneous upward changes in rates. 

Table 17 Market Value of Equity Sensitivity Sep 30, 2021 Dec 31, 2020 Instantaneous Rate Change 100 bp increase in interest rates (1.2) % 1.9 % 200 bp increase in interest rates (2.6) % 2.8 % 

Since MVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in MVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, MVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changes in product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. 

The above NII, EAR, and MVE measures do not include all actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in response to anticipated changes in interest rates.

Capital 

Management actively reviews capital strategies for the Corporation and each of its subsidiaries in light of perceived business risks, future growth opportunities, industry standards, and compliance with regulatory requirements. The assessment of overall capital adequacy depends on a variety of factors, including asset quality, liquidity, stability of earnings, changing competitive forces, economic condition in markets served, and strength of management. At September 30, 2021, the capital ratios of the Corporation and its banking subsidiaries were in excess of regulatory minimum requirements. The Corporation&#8217;s capital ratios are summarized in the following table.

(a) The ratio tangible common equity to tangible assets excludes goodwill and other intangible assets, net. This financial measure has been included as it is considered to be a critical metric with which to analyze and evaluate financial condition and capital strength. 

(b) These capital measurements are used by management, regulators, investors, and analysts to assess, monitor and compare the quality and composition of our capital with the capital of other financial services companies. 

(c) The efficiency ratio as defined by the Federal Reserve guidance is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments) divided by the sum of net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains / losses, net. The fully tax-equivalent efficiency ratio is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments), excluding other intangible amortization, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains / losses, net. The adjusted efficiency ratio is noninterest expense, which excludes the provision for unfunded commitments, other intangible amortization, acquisition related costs, and announced initiatives, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains (losses), net, asset gains (losses), net, and gain on sale of branches, net. Management believes the adjusted efficiency ratio is a meaningful measure as it enhances the comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources and provides a better measure as to how the Corporation is managing its income and expenses by adjusting for acquisition related costs, provision for unfunded commitments, asset gains (losses), net, branch sales, and announced initiatives. 

Sequential Quarter Results 

The Corporation reported net income of $89 million for the third quarter of 2021, compared to net income of $91 million for the second quarter of 2021. Net income available to common equity was $85 million for the third quarter of 2021, or $0.56 for both basic and diluted earnings per common share. Comparatively, net income available to common equity for the second quarter of 2021 was $86 million, or $0.56 for both basic and diluted earnings per common share (see Table 1). 

Fully tax-equivalent net interest income for the third quarter of 2021 was $188 million, $4 million, or 2%, higher than the second quarter of 2021. The net interest margin in the third quarter of 2021 was up 1 bp to 2.38%. Average earning assets increased $348 million, or 1%, to $31.4 billion in the third quarter of 2021, with investments and other increasing $562 million, or 8%. Average loans decreased $215 million, or 1%. On the funding side, total interest-bearing deposits increased $532 million, or 3%, primarily driven by customers holding proceeds from government stimulus programs in their deposit accounts and changing savings habits in response to the pandemic.(see Table 2). 

The provision for credit losses had a release of $24 million for the third quarter of 2021, compared to a release of $35 million for the second quarter of 2021 (see Table 12). See discussion under sections: Provision for Credit Losses, Nonperforming Assets, and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans. 

Noninterest income for the third quarter of 2021 was $82 million, up $9 million, or 12%, from the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to gains on private equity investments of $5 million along with an increase of $3 million in mortgage banking, net, driven by a $2 million recovery of MSRs impairment during the third quarter of 2021 (see Table 3). 

Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2021 was $178 million, up $3 million, or 2%, from the second quarter of 2021 (see Table 4). 

For the third quarter of 2021, the Corporation recognized income tax expense of $23 million, compared to income tax expense of $22 million for the second quarter of 2021. See Income Taxes section for a detailed discussion on income taxes. 

Comparable Quarter Results 

The Corporation reported net income of $89 million for the third quarter of 2021, compared to $45 million for the third quarter of 2020. Net income available to common equity was $85 million for the third quarter of 2021, or $0.56 for both basic and diluted earnings per common share. Comparatively, net income available to common equity for the third quarter of 2020 was $40 million, or $0.26 for both basic and diluted earnings per share (see Table 1). 

Fully tax-equivalent net interest income for the third quarter of 2021 was $188 million, $2 million, or 1%, higher than the third quarter of 2020. The net interest margin between the comparable quarters was up 7 bp, to 2.38% in the third quarter of 2021. The increase in net interest income and net interest margin was due to lower interest bearing liability costs as excess liquidity was deployed to control those costs. Average earning assets decreased $726 million, or 2%, to $31.4 billion in the third quarter of 2021 as average loans decreased $1.1 billion, or 4%, partially offset by an increase of $353 million, or 5%, in investments and other, driven by higher interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions. On the funding side, average interest-bearing deposits increased $505 million, or 3%, from the third quarter of 2020, due to increases in lower cost deposits, partially offset by a decrease in higher cost deposits. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $730 million, or 10%, to $8.1 billion. Average short and long-term funding decreased $2.0 billion, or 48%, driven by decreases in PPPLF, which was paid in full in the fourth quarter of 2020, and the Corporation's prepayment of $950 million in long-term FHLB advances during the third quarter of 2020 (see Table 2). 

The provision for credit losses had a release of $24 million for the third quarter of 2021, compared to $43 million of provision expense for the third quarter of 2020, as a result of improving credit quality within the loan portfolio and an improving economic forecast (see Table 12). See discussion under sections: Provision for Credit Losses, Nonperforming Assets, and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans. 

Noninterest income for the third quarter of 2021 was $82 million, up $7 million, or 9%, compared to the third quarter of 2020, primarily due to gains on private equity investments of $5 million during the third quarter of 2021 (see Table 3). 

Noninterest expense decreased $50 million, or 22%, to $178 million for the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to the prepayment of $950 million of long-term FHLB advances during the third quarter of 2020 that incurred a loss of $45 million on the prepayment. (see Table 4). 

The Corporation recognized income tax expense of $23 million for the third quarter of 2021, compared to an income tax benefit of $58 million for the third quarter of 2020. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to tax planning strategies which occurred during the third quarter of 2020. See section Income Taxes for a detailed discussion on income taxes. 

Segment Review 

As discussed in Note 15 Segment Reporting of the notes to consolidated financial statements, the Corporation&#8217;s reportable segments have been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain strategic business units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes where the nature of the products and services, the type of customer, and the distribution of those products and services are similar. The reportable segments are Corporate and Commercial Specialty; Community, Consumer and Business; and Risk Management and Shared Services.

Notable Changes in Segment Financial Data 

The Corporate and Commercial Specialty segment consists of lending and deposit solutions to larger businesses, developers, not-for-profits, municipalities, and financial institutions, and the support to deliver, fund, and manage such banking solutions. In addition, this segment provides a variety of investment, fiduciary, and retirement planning products and services to individuals and small to mid-sized businesses. During the first quarter of 2021, the Corporation sold its wealth management subsidiary Whitnell. 

&#8226; Revenue increased $11 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and increased $7 million from the three months ended September 30, 2020, driven by higher asset gains. 

&#8226; Provision for credit losses increased $7 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as a result of the long term annual net charge off rates attributable to the current portfolio. 

&#8226; Noninterest expense increased $12 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2020 driven by an increase in personnel expense due to an increase in funding of the management incentive plan partially offset by lower salary expense as a result of fewer employees. 

&#8226; Average loans increased $456 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily driven by a $412 million increase in CRE loans. 

The Community, Consumer, and Business segment consists of lending, deposit solutions, and historically offered ancillary financial services, primarily insurance and risk consulting, to individuals and small to mid-sized businesses. 

&#8226; Revenue decreased $42 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily driven by the sale of ABRC during the second quarter of 2020, which lowered insurance commissions and fees by $45 million. Revenue increased $4 million from the three months ended September 30, 2020, primarily driven by an increase in service charges and deposit account fees. These fees were waived during 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

&#8226; Noninterest expense decreased $45 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2020, and decreased $7 million from the three months ended September 30, 2020, primarily driven by a decrease in personnel expense, which was largely due to a reduction in FTEs as a result of branch consolidations and the sale of ABRC, along with lower loan and foreclosure costs. 

&#8226; Average loans decreased $611 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily driven by a decrease in residential mortgages as a result of higher refinances, as well as decreases in home equity and other consumer portfolios. Average loans decreased $772 million from the three months ended September 30, 2020 driven by decreases across all loan categories. 

&#8226; Average deposits increased $1.9 billion from the nine months ended September 30, 2020, and increased $1.5 billion from the three months ended September 30, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by customers holding proceeds from government stimulus programs, and more recently driven by changes in consumer saving habits. 

The Risk Management and Shared Services segment includes key shared Corporate functions, Parent Company activity, intersegment eliminations, and residual revenues and expenses. 

&#8226; Revenues decreased $183 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily driven by the $163 million asset gain on sale of ABRC which occurred during the second quarter of 2020. 

&#8226; Provision for credit losses decreased $244 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2020, and decreased $65 million from the three months ended September 30, 2020, as a result of improving credit quality within the loan portfolio and an improving economic forecast. 

&#8226; Noninterest expense decreased $42 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and decreased $48 million from the three months ended September 30, 2020, primarily driven by a loss on the prepayment of FHLB advances incurred during the third quarter of 2020. 

&#8226; Average loans decreased $188 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and decreased $203 million from the three months ended September 30, 2020 primarily driven by a decrease in commercial and business lending. 

&#8226; Average deposits decreased $571 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2020, and decreased $640 million from the three months ended September 30, 2020. These decreases were primarily driven by a decrease in network deposits for both time periods. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and revenues and expenses for the period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the determination of the ACLL, goodwill impairment assessment, MSRs valuation, and income taxes. A discussion of these policies can be found in the Critical Accounting Policies section in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no changes in the Corporation's application of critical accounting policies since December 31, 2020.
