Performance Summary 

&#8226; Average loans of $24.5 billion increased $1.2 billion, or 5%, compared to the first three months of 2020, driven by an increase in PPP and CRE loans. The Corporation expects 2021 commercial loan growth, excluding PPP, of 2% to 4%. 

&#8226; Average deposits of $26.8 billion increased $2.5 billion, or 10%, from the first three months of 2020, driven primarily by government stimulus related inflows. 

&#8226; Net interest income of $176 million decreased $27 million, or 13%, from the first three months of 2020, and n et interest margin was 2.39% compared to 2.84% for the first three months of 2020, both decreases are primarily due to a lower interest rate environment. The Corporation expects a full year margin of 2.45% to 2.55%. 

&#8226; Provision for credit losses had a release of $23 million , compared to provision expense of $53 million for the first three months of 2020. The Corporation expects full year provision to be nominal. 

&#8226; Noninterest income of $95 million decreased $3 million , or 3%, from the first three months of 2020. The Corporation expects 2021 noninterest income of $310 million to $330 million, reflecting positive fee income trends which we expect will outpace margin pressure. In addition, mortgage banking revenue is expected to remain elevated in the second quarter of 2021 with potential further MSRs recoveries should rates move higher. 

&#8226; Noninterest expense of $175 million decreased $17 million , or 9%, from the first three months of 2020 due to a decrease in personnel expense of $10 million , or 9%, primarily due to having fewer employees. During the first quarter of 2021, the Corporation began hiring staff for the purpose of originating auto-secured loans indirectly through dealers beginning in the fall of 2021 and expects a total of 55-60 FTEs by year end. As a result of the new indirect auto lending initiative, additional mortgage commission, and incentive and compensation expenses, the Corporation expects 2021 noninterest expense of $690 million to $695 million.

Notable Contributions to the Change in Net Interest Income 

&#8226; Average loans of $24.5 billion increased $1.2 billion, or 5%, compared to the first three months of 2020, primarily driven by an increase of $842 million, or 16%, in CRE loans as loans in the pipeline continued to fund along with slower payoffs. PPP loan originations, which began last April, increased average loans by $807 million. Partially offsetting this growth was a decrease of $442 million, o r 5%, in residential mortgages as the lower rate environment has resulted in higher levels of refinances. 

&#8226; Net interest income on the consolidated statements of income (which excludes the fully tax-equivalent adjustment) was $176 million for the first three months of 2021 compared to $203 million for the first three months of 2020. Fully tax-equivalent net interest income of $180 million for the first three months of 2021 was $27 million, or 13%, lower than the first three months of 2020. The net interest margin for the first three months of 2021 was 2.39% compared to 2.84% for the first three months of 2020. The decreases were attributable to a lower interest rate environment and increased liquidity primarily related to monetary and fiscal stimulus programs. To lessen the impact of the lower rate environment, the Corporation began requiring LIBOR floors in applicable loan restructurings, renewals of existing loan transactions, and any new loan transactions. See sections Interest Rate Risk and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a discussion of interest rate risk and market risk. 

&#8226; Average interest-bearing liabilities of $21.5 billion for the first three months of 2021 were down $1.3 billion, or 6%, compared to the first three months of 2020. On average, FHLB advances decreased $1.6 billion, or 50%, primarily driven by the Corporation's prepayment of $950 million in FHLB advances during the third quarter of 2020. Interest-bearing deposits increased $353 million, or 2%, primarily driven by a combined increase of $1.7 billion, or 11%, in savings, money market and interest bearing demand deposits, partially offset by a combined decrease of $1.3 billion, or 33%, in higher cost network and time deposits. Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits of $7.7 billion for the first three months of 2021 were up $2.2 billion, or 39% versus the first three months of 2020. Government stimulus programs and a partially closed down economy has led to customers holding higher deposit balances. 

&#8226; The cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 0.40% for the first three months of 2021, which was a 66 bp drop from the first three months of 2020 primarily attributed to the federal funds rate decreases which occurred in March 2020. 

&#8226; The Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds target interest to a range of 0.00% to 0.25% in March 2020, which has remained constant through the end of the first quarter of 2021. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses is predominantly a function of the Corporation&#8217;s reserving methodology and judgments as to other qualitative and quantitative factors used to determine the appropriate level of the ACLL, which focuses on changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio, changes in levels of individually evaluated and other nonaccrual loans, historical losses and delinquencies in each portfolio category, the risk inherent in specific loans, concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries, existing economic conditions and economic forecasts, the fair value of underlying collateral, and other factors which could affect potential credit losses. The forecast the Corporation used for March 31, 2021 was the Moody's baseline scenario from March 2021 over a 2 year reasonable and supportable period with straight-line reversion to historical losses over the second year of the period. See additional discussion under the sections titled, Loans, Credit Risk, Nonperforming Assets, and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans.

Notable Contributions to the Change in Noninterest Income 

&#8226; Mortgage banking, net was up $18 million from the first three months of 2020 due to an $11 million recovery of MSRs impairment during the quarter, compared to impairment of $9 million during the first three months of 2020. 

&#8226; Insurance commission and fees was down $23 million, from the first three months of 2020, driven by the sale of ABRC during the second quarter of 2020, which largely eliminated insurance commissions and fees. 

&#8226; Asset gains (losses), net was up $5 million from the first three months of 2020, driven by a gain of $2 million from the sale of Whitnell and gains of $3 million from private equity investments. 

&#8226; Investment securities gains (losses), net was down $6 million from the first three of 2020 due to fewer securities being sold at a gain.

Notable Contributions to the Change in Noninterest Expense 

&#8226; Personnel expense decreased $10 million or 9% from the first three months of 2020, primarily due to having fewer employees as a result of the sale of ABRC, corporate restructurings and branch sales, offset by an increase in incentives and commission. 

Income Taxes 

The Corporation recognized income tax expense of $25 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to income tax expense of $10 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The Corporation's effective tax rate was 20.69% for the first three months of 2021, compared to an effective tax rate of 18.23% for the first three months of 2020. The higher income tax expense was driven primarily by an increase in income before tax. The Corporation expects a full year effective tax rate of 19% to 21%, assuming no change in the corporate tax rate. 

Income tax expense recorded on the consolidated statements of income involves the interpretation and application of certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax laws and regulations, and is, therefore, considered a critical accounting policy. The Corporation is subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Examination by taxing authorities may impact the amount of tax expense and / or reserve for uncertainty in income taxes if their interpretations differ from those of management, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations. See section Critical Accounting Policies, in the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on income taxes. 

Balance Sheet Analysis 

&#8226; At March 31, 2021, total assets were $34.6 billion, up $1.2 billion, or 3%, from December 31, 2020 and up $667 million, or 2%, from March 31, 2020. 

&#8226; Interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions were $1.6 billion at March 31, 2021, up $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion from December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively, primarily due to excess reserves being held at the Federal Reserve. 

&#8226; Lo ans of $24.2 billion at March 31, 2021 were down $289 million , or 1%, from December 31, 2020 and down $203 million, or 1% from March 31, 2020 . See Note 7 Loans for additional details.

The Corporation has long-term guidelines relative to the proportion of Commercial and Business, CRE, and Consumer loan commitments within the overall loan portfolio, with each targeted to represent 30-40% of the overall loan portfolio. The targeted long-term guidelines were unchanged during 2020 and the first three months of 2021. Furthermore, certain sub-asset classes within the respective portfolios are further defined and dollar limitations are placed on these sub-portfolios. These guidelines and limits are reviewed quarterly and approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors. These guidelines and limits are designed to create balance and diversification within the loan portfolios. 

The Corporation&#8217;s loan distribution and interest rate sensitivity as of March 31, 2021 are summarized in the following table:

Credit Risk 

An active credit risk management process is used for commercial loans to ensure that sound and consistent credit decisions are made. Credit risk is controlled by detailed underwriting procedures, comprehensive loan administration, and periodic review of borrowers&#8217; outstanding loans and commitments. Borrower relationships are formally reviewed and graded on an ongoing basis for early identification of potential problems. Further analysis by customer, industry, and geographic location are performed to monitor trends, financial performance, and concentrations. See Note 7 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on managing overall credit quality. 

The loan portfolio is widely diversified by types of borrowers, industry groups, and market areas within the Corporation's branch footprint. Significant loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to numerous borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. At March 31, 2021, no significant concentrations existed in the Corporation&#8217;s portfolio in excess of 10% of total loans. 

Commercial and business lending: The commercial and business lending classification primarily includes commercial loans to large corporations, middle market companies, small businesses, and lease financing.

March 31, 2021 % of Total Loans % of Total Commercial and Business Lending Finance and Insurance 7 % 19 % Utilities 7 % 18 % Manufacturing and Wholesale Trade 6 % 17 % Real Estate 5 % 12 % 

The remaining commercial and business lending portfolio is spread over a diverse range of industries, none of which exceed 2% of total loans. 

The credit risk related to commercial loans is largely influenced by general economic conditions and the resulting impact on a borrower&#8217;s operations or on the value of underlying collateral, if any. 

Commercial real estate - investor: CRE-investor is comprised of loans secured by various non-owner occupied or investor income producing property types.

The remaining CRE-investor portfolio is spread over various other property types, none of which exceed 2% of total loans. 

Credit risk is managed in a similar manner to commercial and business lending by employing sound underwriting guidelines, lending primarily to borrowers in local markets and businesses, periodically evaluating the underlying collateral, and formally reviewing the borrower&#8217;s financial soundness and relationship on an ongoing basis. 

Real estate construction: Real estate construction loans are primarily short-term or interim loans that provide financing for the acquisition or development of commercial income properties, multi-family projects, or residential development, both single family and condominium. Real estate construction loans are made to developers and project managers who are generally well known to the Corporation and have prior successful project experience. The credit risk associated with real estate construction loans is generally confined to specific geographic areas but is also influenced by general economic conditions. The Corporation controls the credit risk on these types of loans by making loans in familiar markets to developers, reviewing the merits of individual projects, controlling loan structure, and monitoring project progress and construction advances.

March 31, 2021 % of Total Loans % of Total Real Estate Construction Multi-Family 3 % 38 % 

The remaining real estate construction portfolio is spread over various other property types, none of which exceed 2% of total loans. 

The Corporation&#8217;s current lending standards for CRE and real estate construction lending are determined by property type and specifically address many criteria, including: maximum loan amounts, maximum LTV, requirements for pre-leasing and / or presales, minimum borrower equity, and maximum loan-to-cost. Currently, the maximum standard for LTV is 80%, with lower limits established for certain higher risk types, such as raw land that has a 50% LTV maximum. The Corporation&#8217;s LTV guidelines are in compliance with regulatory supervisory limits. In most cases, for real estate construction loans, the loan amounts include interest reserves, which are built into the loans and sized to fund loan payments through construction and lease up and / or sell out. 

Residential mortgages: Residential mortgage loans are primarily first lien home mortgages with a maximum loan-to-collateral value without credit enhancement (e.g. private mortgage insurance) of 80%. The residential mortgage portfolio is focused primarily in the Corporation's three-state branch footprint, with approximately 88% of the outstanding loan balances in the Corporation's branch footprint at March 31, 2021. The majority of the on balance sheet residential mortgage portfolio consists of LIBOR or constant maturity treasury based, hybrid, adjustable rate mortgage loans with initial fixed rate terms of 3, 5, 7, or 10 years. The rates on these mortgages adjust based upon the movement in the underlying index which is then added to a margin and rounded to the nearest 0.125%. That result is then subjected to any periodic caps to produce the borrower's interest rate for the coming term. 

In 2014, the Financial Stability Oversight Council and Financial Stability Board raised concerns about the reliability and robustness of LIBOR and called for the development of alternative interest rate benchmarks. The ARRC, through authority from the Federal Reserve, have selected the SOFR as the alternative rate and developed a paced transition plan which addresses the risk that LIBOR may not exist beyond the end of 2021. There are still many components of this plan which have not been fully decided or implemented in the industry. As a result, the Corporation is reaching out to certain borrowers offering an opportunity to refinance or modify their loans to avoid any uncertainty around the LIBOR transition. Performing borrowers can modify or refinance to a fixed interest rate or an adjustable rate mortgage tied to the one-year treasury adjusted to a constant maturity of one-year with an appropriate margin. This provides the Bank and borrower with greater certainty around the loan structure. 

The Corporation generally retains certain fixed-rate residential real estate mortgages in its loan portfolio, including retail and private banking jumbo mortgages and CRA-related mortgages. As part of management&#8217;s historical practice of originating and servicing residential mortgage loans, generally the Corporation&#8217;s 30 year, agency conforming, fixed-rate residential real estate mortgage loans have been sold in the secondary market with servicing rights retained. Subject to management&#8217;s analysis of the current interest rate environment, among other market factors, the Corporation may choose to retain 30 year mortgage loan production on its balance sheet. See section Loans for additional information on loans. 

The Corporation&#8217;s underwriting and risk-based pricing guidelines for residential mortgage loans include minimum borrower FICO and maximum LTV of the property securing the loan. Residential mortgage products generally are underwritten using FHLMC and FNMA secondary marketing guidelines. 

Home equity: Home equity consists of both home equity lines of credit and closed-end home equity loans. The Corporation&#8217;s credit risk monitoring guidelines for home equity is based on an ongoing review of loan delinquency status, as well as a quarterly review of FICO score deterioration and property devaluation. The Corporation does not routinely obtain appraisals on performing loans to update LTV ratios after origination; however, the Corporation monitors the local housing markets by reviewing the various home price indices and incorporates the impact of the changing market conditions in its ongoing credit monitoring process. For junior lien home equity loans, the Corporation is unable to track the performance of the first lien loan if it does not own or service the first lien loan. However, the Corporation obtains a refreshed FICO score on a quarterly basis and monitors this as part of its assessment of the home equity portfolio. 

The Corporation&#8217;s underwriting and risk-based pricing guidelines for home equity lines of credit and loans consist of a combination of both borrower FICO and the original cumulative LTV against the property securing the loan. During the second quarter of 2020, in the volatile economic environment, the Corporation reduced its exposure by reducing its maximum LTV on home equity lines of credit from 90% to 80%, among other changes, while maintaining the minimum acceptable FICO at 670. The Corporation's current home equity line of credit offering is priced based on floating rate indices and generally allows 10 years of interest-only payments followed by a 20-year amortization of the outstanding balance. During the third quarter of 2020, based upon an analysis of market conditions and uncertainty around the timing and scope of the anticipated economic recovery, the Corporation temporarily suspended new applications for home equity lines of credit. Due to improving economic conditions, the Corporation resumed applications for home equity lines of credit in the first quarter of 2021. The loans in the Corporation's portfolio generally have an original term of 20 years with principal and interest payments required. See section Loans for additional information on loans. 

Other consumer: Other consumer consists of student loans, short-term personal installment loans, and credit cards. The Corporation had $115 million and $118 million of student loans at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, the majority of which are government guaranteed. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the passage of the CARES Act, government guaranteed student loans had been placed on an administrative forbearance through September 30, 2020. Subsequently, on August 8, 2020, President Trump directed the Secretary of Education to continue to suspend loan payments, stop collections, and waive interest on U.S. Department of Education held federal student loans through December 31, 2020. On December 4, 2020, the relief measures were extended through January 31, 2021, and on January 20, 2021, President Biden extended the federal student loan relief through September 30, 2021. Credit risk for non-government guaranteed student loans, short-term personal installment loans, and credit cards is influenced by general economic conditions, the characteristics of individual borrowers, and the nature of the loan collateral. Risks of loss are generally on smaller average balances per loan spread over many borrowers. Once charged off, there is usually less opportunity for recovery of these smaller consumer loans. Credit risk is primarily controlled by reviewing the creditworthiness of the borrowers, monitoring payment histories, and taking appropriate collateral and guarantee positions. The student loan portfolio is in run-off and no new student loans are being originated. 

COVID-19 Update: 

Beginning on April 3, 2020, the Corporation began originating SBA loans under the PPP, which are included in commercial and business lending loans, to help businesses keep their workforce employed and cover other working capital needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. All complete eligible applications for the PPP have been processed in the order in which they have been received. The Corporation began submitting PPP forgiveness applications on behalf of our customers on September 14, 2020. Forgiveness payments from the SBA began to be received in the fourth quarter of 2020. The Corporation received approximately $248 million and $221 million of forgiveness payments in 2020 and 2021, respectively, with nearly all of the remaining loans expected to be forgiven throughout the remainder of 2021. On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid Act was signed into law, which included another round of PPP funding. The Corporation began originating the new round of PPP loans in January 2021. As of March 31, 2021, the Corporation had funded $293 million of PPP loans in this most recent round.

(a) The Corporation&#8217;s policy is to assign risk ratings at the borrower level. PPP loans are 100% guaranteed by the SBA and therefore the Corporation considers these loans to have a risk profile similar to pass rated loans. 

Nonaccrual loans: Nonaccrual loans are considered to be one indicator of potential future loan losses. See Note 7 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional nonaccrual loan disclosures. See also sections Credit Risk and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans. 

Accruing loans past due 90 days or more: Loans past due 90 days or more but still accruing interest are classified as such where the underlying loans are both well secured (the collateral value is sufficient to cover principal and accrued interest) and are in the process of collection. 

Restructured loans: Loans are considered restructured loans if concessions have been granted to borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty. See also Note 7 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional restructured loans disclosures. 

Potential problem loans: The level of potential problem loans is another predominant factor in determining the relative level of risk in the loan portfolio and in determining the appropriate level of the ACLL. Potential problem loans are generally defined by management to include loans rated as substandard by management that are collectively evaluated (not nonaccrual loans or accruing TDRs); however, there are circumstances present to create doubt as to the ability of the borrower to comply with present repayment terms. The decision of management to include performing loans in potential problem loans does not necessarily mean that the Corporation expects losses to occur, but that management recognizes a higher degree of risk associated with these loans. 

OREO: Management actively seeks to ensure OREO properties held are monitored to minimize the Corporation&#8217;s risk of loss. 

Other nonperforming assets: During the third quarter of 2019, the Bank accepted a partial settlement of a debt by receiving units of ownership interest in an oil and gas limited liability company, and during 2020, the Corporation wrote the value for the ownership interest down to zero. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans 

Credit risks within the loan portfolio are inherently different for each loan type. Credit risk is controlled and monitored through the use of lending standards, a thorough review of potential borrowers, and ongoing review of loan payment performance. Active asset quality administration, including early problem loan identification and timely resolution of problems, aids in the management of credit risk and the minimization of loan losses. Credit risk management for each loan type is discussed in the section entitled Credit Risk. See Note 7 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures on the ACLL. 

To assess the appropriateness of the ACLL, the Corporation focuses on the evaluation of many factors, including but not limited to: evaluation of facts and issues related to specific loans, management&#8217;s ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio, credit report refreshes, consideration of historical loan loss and delinquency experience on each portfolio category, trends in past due and nonaccrual loans, the level of potential problem loans, the risk characteristics of the various classifications of loan segments, changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio, concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries, existing economic conditions and economic forecasts, the fair value of underlying collateral, funding assumptions on lines, and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. The Corporation utilized the Moody's baseline forecast for March 2021 in the allowance model. The forecast is applied over a 2 year reasonable and supportable period with straight-line reversion to historical losses over the second year of the period. Assessing these factors involves significant judgment. Because each of the criteria used is subject to change, the ACLL is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future credit losses on loans in any particular segment. Therefore, management considers the ACLL a critical accounting policy, see section Critical Accounting Policies for additional information on the ACLL. See section Nonperforming Assets for a detailed discussion on asset quality. See also Note 7 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional ACLL disclosures. Table 5 provides information on loan growth and period end loan composition, Table 12 provides additional information regarding NPAs, and Table 13 and Table 14 provide additional information regarding activity in the ACLL. 

The loan segmentation used in calculating the ACLL at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was generally comparable. The methodology to calculate the ACLL consists of the following components: a valuation allowance estimate is established for commercial and consumer loans determined by the Corporation to be individually evaluated, using discounted cash flows, estimated fair value of underlying collateral, and/or other data available. Loans are segmented for criticized loan pools by loan type as well as for non-criticized loan pools by loan type, primarily based on historical loss rates after considering loan type, historical loss and delinquency experience, credit quality, and industry classifications. Loans that have been criticized are considered to have a higher risk of default than non-criticized loans, as circumstances were present to support the lower loan grade, warranting higher loss factors. The loss factors applied in the methodology are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted to reflect changes in historical loss levels or other risks. Additionally, management allocates ACLL to absorb losses that may not be provided for by the other components due to qualitative factors evaluated by management, such as limitations within the credit risk grading process, known current economic or business conditions that may not yet show in trends, industry or other concentrations with current issues that impose higher inherent risks than are reflected in the loss factors, and other relevant considerations. The total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the loan portfolio.

Notable Contributions to the Change in the Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans 

&#8226; Total loans decreased $289 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2020 and decreased $203 million, or 1%, from March 31, 2020. The decrease from March 31, 2020 was primarily driven by decreases in consumer lending, which was partially offset by an increase in CRE loans. See section Loans for additional information on the changes in the loan portfolio and see section Credit Risk for discussion about credit risk management for each loan type. 

&#8226; Potential problem loans decreased $17 million, or 6%, from December 31, 2020, but increased $31 million, or 13%, from March 31, 2020. The decrease from December 31, 2020 was primarily due to decreases in CRE and commercial and business lending, while the increase from March 31, 2020 was primarily driven by CRE loans. CRE loans were negatively impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic and saw an increase in potential problem loans throughout 2020. As economic conditions have improved throughout 2021, there have been decreases in CRE potential problem loans. See Table 12 for additional information regarding potential problem loans. 

&#8226; Total nonaccrual loans decreased $48 million, or 23%, from December 31, 2020, but increased $27 million, or 19%, from March 31, 2020. The decrease from December 31, 2020 was primarily due to decreases in commercial and industrial loans and CRE - investor loans, while the increase from March 31, 2020 was primarily driven by an increase in CRE lending, which was partially offset by a decrease in commercial and industrial lending. As economic conditions trended downward in 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, nonaccrual loans increased. As economic conditions have been improving throughout 2021, nonaccrual loans have decreased. See Note 7 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements and Table 12 for additional disclosures on the changes in asset quality. 

&#8226; Net charge offs decreased $12 million from March 31, 2020, primarily driven by decreased charge off amounts in commercial and industrial loans. See Table 13 and Table 14 for additional information on the activity in the ACLL. 

Management believes the level of ACLL to be appropriate at March 31, 2021.

&#8226; Total deposits, which are the Corporation's largest source of funds, increased $1.2 billion, or 5%, from December 31, 2020, and increased $2.0 billion, or 8%, from March 31, 2020, primarily driven by customers holding proceeds from government stimulus programs in their deposit accounts. 

&#8226; Noninterest-bearing deposits increased $834 million, or 11%, from December 31, 2020, and increased $2.4 billion, or 39%, from March 31, 2020. Savings accounts increased $383 million, or 10%, from December 31, 2020, and increased $1.0 billion, or 33%, from March 31, 2020. These increases were primarily due to government stimulus program inflows. 

&#8226; Time deposits decreased $196 million, or 11%, from December 31, 2020, and decreased $1.1 billion, or 41%, from March 31, 2020, due to higher priced time deposits rolling off as they mature. 

&#8226; Non-maturity deposit accounts, comprised of savings, money market, and demand (both interest and noninterest-bearing) accounts, comprised 94% of the Corporation's total deposits at March 31, 2021. 

&#8226; Included in the above amounts were $1.1 billion of network deposits, primarily sourced from other financial institutions and intermediaries. These represented 4% of the Corporation's total deposits at March 31, 2021. Network deposits decreased $142 million, or 12%, from December 31, 2020, and decreased $677 million, or 39%, from March 31, 2020. 

Liquidity 

The objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that the Corporation has the ability to generate sufficient cash or cash equivalents in a timely and cost effective manner to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers and to meet its other commitments as they become due. The Corporation&#8217;s liquidity risk management process is designed to identify, measure, and manage the Corporation&#8217;s funding and liquidity risk to meet its daily funding needs in the ordinary course of business, as well as to address expected and unexpected changes in its funding requirements. The Corporation engages in various activities to manage its liquidity risk, including diversifying its funding sources, stress testing, and holding readily-marketable assets which can be used as a source of liquidity, if needed. 

The Corporation performs dynamic scenario analysis in accordance with industry best practices. Measures have been established to ensure the Corporation has sufficient high quality short-term liquidity to meet cash flow requirements under stressed scenarios. In addition, the Corporation also reviews static measures such as deposit funding as a percentage of total assets and liquid asset levels. Strong capital ratios, credit quality, and core earnings are also essential to maintaining cost effective access to wholesale funding markets. At March 31, 2021, the Corporation was in compliance with its internal liquidity objectives and had sufficient asset-based liquidity to meet its obligations under a stressed scenario. 

The Corporation maintains diverse and readily available liquidity sources, including: 

&#8226; Investment securities, which are an important tool to the Corporation&#8217;s liquidity objective and can be pledged or sold to enhance liquidity, if necessary. See Note 6 Investment Securities of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Corporation's investment securities portfolio, including pledged investment securities. 

&#8226; Pledgeable loan collateral, which is eligible collateral with both the Federal Reserve Bank and the FHLB under established lines of credit. Based on the amount of collateral pledged, the FHLB established a collateral value from which the Bank may draw advances against the collateral. The collateral is also used to enable the FHLB to issue letters of credit in favor of public fund depositors of the Bank. As of March 31, 2021, the Bank had $5.7 billion available for future advances. The Federal Reserve Bank also establishes a collateral value of assets to support borrowings from the discount window. As of March 31, 2021, the Bank had $752 million available for discount window borrowings. 

&#8226; A $200 million Parent Company commercial paper program, of which $51 million was outstanding as of March 31, 2021. 

&#8226; Dividends and service fees from subsidiaries, as well as the proceeds from issuance of capital, which are also funding sources for the Parent Company. 

&#8226; Equity issuances by the Parent Company; the Corporation has filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC under which the Parent Company may, from time to time, offer shares of the Corporation&#8217;s common stock in connection with acquisitions of businesses, assets, or securities of other companies. 

&#8226; Other issuances by the Parent Company; the Corporation intends to file an updated universal shelf registration statement with the SEC, under which the Parent Company may offer the following securities, either separately or in units: debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, and warrants. 

&#8226; Bank issuances; the Bank may also issue institutional CDs, network transaction deposits, and brokered CDs. 

&#8226; Global Bank Note Program issuances; the Bank has implemented the program pursuant to which it may from time to time offer up to $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of its unsecured senior and subordinated notes. In August 2018, the Bank issued $300 million of senior notes, due August 2021, and callable July 2021. 

Credit ratings relate to the Corporation&#8217;s ability to issue debt securities and the cost to borrow money, and should not be viewed as an indication of future stock performance or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. Adverse changes in these factors could result in a negative change in credit ratings and impact not only the ability to raise funds in the capital markets but also the cost of these funds. The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Bank at March 31, 2021 are displayed below: 

Table 16 Credit Ratings

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, net cash provided by operating activities and financing activities was $158 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, while net cash used in investing activities was $12 million for a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of $1.2 billion since year-end 2020. At March 31, 2021, assets of $34.6 billion increased $1.2 billion, or 3%, from year-end 2020, primarily driven by a $1.3 billion increase in interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions, offset by a $289 million, or 1%, decrease in loans. On the funding side, deposits of $27.7 billion increased $1.2 billion, or 5%, from year-end related to deposit inflows from government stimulus programs. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities and investing activities was $20 million and $928 million, respectively, while net cash provided by financing activities was $1.0 billion for a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of $90 million since year-end 2019. At March 31, 2020, assets of $33.9 billion increased $1.5 billion, or 5%, from year-end 2019, primarily driven by a $1.5 billion, or 7%, increase in loans as customers drew on their lines to enhance their liquidity in response to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, on February 14, 2020, the Corporation added $370 million in loans from the First Staunton acquisition. On the funding side, deposits of $25.7 billion increased $1.9 billion, or 8%, from year-end as advances on customer's loans were deposited into their deposit account 

increasing their liquidity. Additionally, on February 14, 2020, the Corporation assumed $439 million of deposits from the First Staunton acquisition. 

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Market risk and interest rate risk are managed centrally. Market risk is the potential for loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of fixed income securities, equity securities, other earning assets and derivative financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates or other factors. Interest rate risk is the potential for reduced net interest income resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates. As a financial institution that engages in transactions involving an array of financial products, the Corporation is exposed to both market risk and interest rate risk. In addition to market risk, interest rate risk is measured and managed through a number of methods. The Corporation uses financial modeling simulation techniques that measure the sensitivity of future earnings due to changing rate environments to measure interest rate risk. 

Policies established by the Corporation&#8217;s ALCO and approved by the Board of Directors are intended to limit these risks. The Board has delegated day-to-day responsibility for managing market and interest rate risk to ALCO. The primary objectives of market risk management are to minimize any adverse effect that changes in market risk factors may have on net interest income and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets recorded at fair value. 

Interest Rate Risk 

The primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by the Board of Directors. These limits and guidelines reflect the Corporation's risk appetite for interest rate risk over both short-term and long-term horizons. No interest rate limit breaches occurred during the first three months of 2021. 

The major sources of the Corporation's non-trading interest rate risk are timing differences in the maturity and re-pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities, changes in the shape of the yield curve, and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options. We measure these risks and their impact by identifying and quantifying exposures through the use of sophisticated simulation and valuation models which are employed by management to understand NII at risk, interest rate sensitive EAR, and MVE at risk. The Corporation&#8217;s interest rate risk profile is such that a higher or steeper yield curve adds to income while a flatter yield curve is relatively neutral, and a lower or inverted yield curve generally has a negative impact on earnings. The Corporation's EAR profile is asset sensitive at March 31, 2021. 

For further discussion of the Corporation's interest rate risk and corresponding key assumptions, see the Interest Rate Risk section of Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The sensitivity analysis included below is measured as a percentage change in NII and EAR due to gradual moves in benchmark interest rates from a baseline scenario over 12 months. We evaluate the sensitivity using: 1) a dynamic forecast incorporating expected growth in the balance sheet, and 2) a static forecast where the current balance sheet is held constant. 

While a gradual shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under a probable scenario, an instantaneous shift in interest rates would have a much more significant impact. 

Table 17 Estimated % Change in Rate Sensitive Earnings at Risk Over 12 Months 

&#160; Dynamic Forecast March 31, 2021 Static Forecast March 31, 2021 Dynamic Forecast December 31, 2020 Static Forecast December 31, 2020 Gradual Rate Change 100 bp increase in interest rates 6.6 % 6.4 % 6.2 % 6.3 % 200 bp increase in interest rates 13.9 % 13.3 % 12.8 % 12.7 % 

At March 31, 2021, the MVE profile indicates an increase in net balance sheet value due to instantaneous upward changes in rates. 

Table 18 Market Value of Equity Sensitivity 

March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Instantaneous Rate Change 100 bp increase in interest rates 0.9 % 1.9 % 200 bp increase in interest rates 1.4 % 2.8 % 

Since MVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in MVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, MVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changes in product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. 

The above NII, EAR, and MVE measures do not include all actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in response to anticipated changes in interest rates.

Capital 

Management actively reviews capital strategies for the Corporation and each of its subsidiaries in light of perceived business risks, future growth opportunities, industry standards, and compliance with regulatory requirements. The assessment of overall capital adequacy depends on a variety of factors, including asset quality, liquidity, stability of earnings, changing competitive forces, economic condition in markets served, and strength of management. At March 31, 2021, the capital ratios of the Corporation and its banking subsidiaries were in excess of regulatory minimum requirements. The Corporation&#8217;s capital ratios are summarized in the following table.

(a) The Federal Reserve establishes regulatory capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards for the Corporation. The Corporation follows Basel III, subject to certain transition provisions. These regulatory capital measurements are used by management, regulators, investors, and analysts to assess, monitor and compare the quality and composition of the Corporation's capital with the capital of other financial services companies. 

(b) Ratio is based upon basic earnings per common share. 

See Part II, Item 2, Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds, for information on the shares repurchased during the first quarter of 2021. 

In February 2019, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule (the "2019 CECL Rule") that revised certain capital regulations to account for changes to credit loss accounting under GAAP. The rule included a transition option that allowed banking organizations to phase in, over a three-year period, the day-one impact of CECL adoption on regulatory capital ratios. In August 2020, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that maintains the three-year transition option of the 2019 CECL Rule and also provided an option to delay for two years an estimate of the effect of CECL on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology's effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. The Corporation has elected to utilize the CECL Transition Provision granted by the banking regulators. Under these provisions, the Day 1 capital impact relating to the adoption of ASU 2016-13 and 25% of the difference between the period end ACL and the Day 1 ACL will be 100% deferred for 2 years, and then phased in over the next 3 years. At March 31, 2021, the Corporation had a modified CECL transitional amount of $111 million.

(a) The ratio tangible common equity to tangible assets excludes goodwill and other intangible assets, net. This financial measure has been included as it is considered to be a critical metric with which to analyze and evaluate financial condition and capital strength. 

(b) These capital measurements are used by management, regulators, investors, and analysts to assess, monitor and compare the quality and composition of our capital with the capital of other financial services companies. 

(c) The efficiency ratio as defined by the Federal Reserve guidance is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments) divided by the sum of net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains / losses, net. The fully tax-equivalent efficiency ratio is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments), excluding other intangible amortization, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains / losses, net. The adjusted efficiency ratio is noninterest expense, which excludes the provision for unfunded commitments, other intangible amortization, acquisition related costs, and 3Q 2020 initiatives, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains (losses), net, acquisition related costs, asset gains (losses), net, and gain on sale of branches. Management believes the adjusted efficiency ratio is a meaningful measure as it enhances the comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources and provides a better measure as to how the Corporation is managing its expenses by adjusting for acquisition related costs, provision for unfunded commitments, asset gains (losses), net, branch sales, and third quarter of 2020 initiatives. 

(d) Third quarter of 2020 initiatives consisted of cost saving efforts that were executed during the third quarter of 2020. These initiatives included a $45 million loss on prepayment of FHLB advances, $10 million in severance, and $6 million in write-downs related to branch sales and lease breakage related to announced branch consolidations. 

Sequential Quarter Results 

The Corporation reported net income of $94 million for the first quarter of 2021, compared to net income of $67 million for the fourth quarter of 2020. Net income available to common equity was $89 million for the first quarter of 2021, or $0.58 for both basic and diluted earnings per common share. Comparatively, net income available to common equity for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $62 million, or $0.40 for both basic and diluted earnings per common share (see Table 1). 

Fully tax-equivalent net interest income for the first quarter of 2021 was $180 million, $12 million, or 6%, lower than the fourth quarter of 2020. The net interest margin in the first quarter of 2021 was down 10 bp to 2.39%. Average earning assets decreased $400 million, or 1%, to $30.3 billion in the first quarter of 2021, with decreases of $218 million in loans and $181 million in investments. On the funding side, short and long-term funding decreased $518 million from the fourth quarter of 2020 primarily due to the paydown of PPPLF borrowings (see Table 2). 

The provision for credit losses had a release of $23 million for the first quarter of 2021, compared to $17 million of expense for the fourth quarter of 2020 (see Table 13). See discussion under sections: Provision for Credit Losses, Nonperforming Assets, and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans. 

Noninterest income for the first quarter of 2021 increased $10 million, or 11%, from the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily due to the increase of $9 million in mortgage banking, net, driven by the recovery of MSRs impairment (see Table 3). 

Noninterest expense of $175 million increased $2 million, or 1%, from the fourth quarter of 20 20, primarily due to higher personnel expense, partially offset by OREO write downs related to the closure of branches during the fourth quarter of 2020. (see Table 4). 

For the first quarter of 2021, the Corporation recognized income tax expense of $25 million, compared to income tax expense of $17 million for the fourth quarter of 2020. The higher income tax expense during the first quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 was primarily driven by an increase in income before taxes. See Income Taxes section for a detailed discussion on income taxes. 

Segment Review 

As discussed in Note 15 Segment Reporting of the notes to consolidated financial statements, the Corporation&#8217;s reportable segments have been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain strategic business units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes where the nature of the products and services, the type of customer, and the distribution of those products and services are similar. The reportable segments are Corporate and Commercial Specialty; Community, Consumer and Business; and Risk Management and Shared Services.

Notable Changes in Segment Financial Data 

The Corporate and Commercial Specialty segment consists of lending and deposit solutions to larger businesses, developers, not-for-profits, municipalities, and financial institutions, and the support to deliver, fund, and manage such banking solutions. In addition, this segment provides a variety of investment, fiduciary, and retirement planning products and services to individuals and small to mid-sized businesses. During the first quarter of 2021, the Corporation sold its wealth management subsidiary Whitnell. 

&#8226; Revenue increased $7 million, or 5%, from the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of $5 million in asset gains/losses, net, including a $2 million pre-tax gain on sale of Whitnell. 

&#8226; Credit provision increased $5 million, or 44%, as loans in the pipeline continued to fund along with slower payoffs. 

&#8226; Average loans increased $1.6 billion, or 12%, primarily driven by an $808 million increase in commercial and business loans, which is largely related to PPP loans, and a $744 million increase in CRE loans. 

The Community, Consumer, and Business segment consists of lending, deposit solutions, and historically offered ancillary financial services, primarily insurance and risk consulting, to individuals and small to mid-sized businesses. 

&#8226; Revenue decreased $20 million, or 13%, from the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a $22 million decrease in insurance commissions and fees as a result of the sale of ABRC, which was partially offset by a $17 million increase in net mortgage banking income as a result of an $11 million recovery of MSRs impairment during the first three months of 2021, compared to impairment of $9 million during the first three months of 2020. In addition, net interest income decreased from the first three months of 2021 largely driven by the current interest rate environment. 

&#8226; Noninterest expense decreased $16 million, or 14%, from the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a $12 million decrease in personnel expense, largely driven by a reduction in FTEs as a result of branch consolidations and the sale of ABRC. 

&#8226; Average deposits increased $2.4 billion, or 17%, from the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by customers holding proceeds from government stimulus programs and tax returns in their deposit accounts. 

The Risk Management and Shared Services segment includes key shared Corporate functions, Parent Company activity, intersegment eliminations, and residual revenues and expenses. 

&#8226; Revenues decreased $17 million, or 94%, from the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by the FTP charge on loans decreasing faster than the FTP credit paid for deposits as a result of the current interest rate environment. 

&#8226; Credit provision decreased $81 million as a result of improving credit quality within the loan portfolio and an improving economic forecast. 

&#8226; Noninterest expense decreased $4 million from the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by lower fringe benefit costs. 

&#8226; Average deposits decreased $411 million, or 26%, from the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in higher cost network deposits. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and revenues and expenses for the period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the determination of the ACLL, goodwill impairment assessment, MSRs valuation, and income taxes. A discussion of these policies can be found in the Critical Accounting Policies section in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There has been no changes in the Corporation's application of critical accounting policies since December 31, 2020.
