Current Developments 

Economic Developments 

Heightened inflationary concerns continue to weigh on the economy. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s tight monetary policy has included multiple interest rate hikes to slow the pace of inflation, which boosted the value of the USD. Meanwhile, global supply chain disruptions persist due to a variety of factors, including Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The combination of higher interest rates, depressed global equity prices, elevated market volatility and a slowdown in global economies have led to concerns of a potential recession. The Company continues to closely monitor the economy and its effects on its business, customers, employees, communities and markets. 

Further discussion of the potential impacts on the Company&#8217;s business due to interest rate hikes have been provided in Item 1A. &#8212; Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Financial Matters in this Form 10-K. 

LIBOR Transition 

LIBOR was a widely referenced benchmark rate intended to reflect the rate at which banks could borrow wholesale funds from other banks on an unsecured and short-term basis. In March 2021, the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority and Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration announced that the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR settings and non-USD LIBOR settings would cease to be published after December 31, 2021. The publication of the overnight, one-, three-, six- and 12-month USD LIBOR settings has been extended through June 30, 2023. 

In March 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the &#8220;LIBOR Act&#8221;) was signed into law. The LIBOR Act provides a uniform, nationwide solution for so-called tough legacy contracts that do not have clear and practicable provisions for replacing LIBOR after June 30, 2023. The LIBOR Act also establishes a litigation safe harbor for lenders that have the discretion to select a LIBOR replacement under certain situations, including the use of a Federal Reserve-selected replacement rate based on SOFR. On December 16, 2022, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule that implements the LIBOR Act by identifying benchmark rates based on SOFR that will replace LIBOR in certain financial contracts after June 30, 2023. 

The Company holds a significant volume of LIBOR-based products that are indexed to tenors that will cease to be published after June 30, 2023. The volume of these products continues to decrease as the Company works through the transition. A cross-functional team was created to manage this transition and communicate with both internal and external stakeholders. The Company developed and updated business and legal processes, contract language, and models, as well as invested in analytical tools and information and operational systems to facilitate the transition of legacy LIBOR products to ARRs. 

The Company offers loans based on ARRs, such as SOFR and the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index. The Company ceased offering new loans or loan renewals based on LIBOR on January 1, 2022. The Company continues to engage with customers to proactively modify the remaining LIBOR-based product contracts and transition to a benchmark replacement prior to June 30, 2023. The Company will leverage relevant contractual and statutory solutions, if necessary, including the LIBOR Act and other relevant legislation, to transition any residual LIBOR-based product exposures maturing after June 2023 to appropriate benchmark replacements. The Company&#8217;s LIBOR transition is anticipated to continue through June 30, 2023. 

The Company will continue to monitor the risks and impacts of this transition. For additional information related to the potential impact surrounding the transition from LIBOR on the Company&#8217;s business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Financial Matters in this Form 10-K. 

Our MD&#38;A analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of the Company for 2022 and 2021. Some tables include additional periods to comply with disclosure requirements or to illustrate trends in greater depth. When reading the discussion in the MD&#38;A, readers should also refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in this Form 10-K. The page locations of specific sections that we refer to are presented in the table of contents. To review our financial condition and results of operations for 2021 and a comparison between 2021 and 2020 results, see Item 7. MD&#38;A of our 2021 Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on February 28, 2022.

(2) Efficiency ratio is calculated as noninterest expense divided by total revenue . 

The Company&#8217;s 2022 net income was $1.13 billion, an increase of $255.1 million, or 29%, from 2021 net income of $873.0 million. The increase was primarily due to higher net interest income, partially offset by increases in the provision for credit losses and income tax expense. Noteworthy items about the Company&#8217;s performance for 2022 included: 

&#8226; Net interest income growth and net interest margin expansion. Year-over-year net interest income before provision for (reversal of) credit losses grew by $514.3 million or 34% to $2.05 billion in 2022, from $1.53 billion in 2021. Full year 2022 net interest margin was 3.45%, up 73 bps year-over-year. 

&#8226; Expanding profitability. The Company&#8217;s 2022 ROA, ROE and tangible return on average tangible equity of 1.80%, 19.51% and 21.29%, respectively, all expanded year-over-year by 33 bps, 381 bps and 405 bps, respectively. Tangible return on average tangible equity is a non-GAAP financial measure. For additional details, see the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures presented under Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Form 10-K. 

&#8226; Improved efficiency. Efficiency ratio of 36.65% and adjusted efficiency ratio of 31.74% in 2022 both improved year-over-year. Adjusted efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure. For additional details, see the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures presented under Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Form 10-K. 

&#8226; Asset growth. Total assets reached $64.11 billion, growing $3.24 billion or 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by loan growth. 

&#8226; Loan growth. Total loans were $48.23 billion as of December 31, 2022, a year-over-year increase of $6.53 billion or 16% from $41.69 billion. This was primarily driven by well-balanced growth in the CRE, residential mortgage and commercial and industrial (&#8220;C&#38;I&#8221;) loan segments. 

&#8226; Deposit growth. Total deposits were $55.97 billion as of December 31, 2022, a year-over-year increase of $2.62 billion or 5% from $53.35 billion, primarily driven by growth in time deposits, partially offset by decreases in noninterest-bearing demand and money market deposits. 

&#8226; Equity growth. Book value per common share was $42.46 as of December 31, 2022, a year-over-year increase of $1.33 or 3%. Tangible equity per common share of $39.10 as of December 31, 2022, increased by $1.31 or 3% year-over-year. Tangible equity per common share is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income 

The Company&#8217;s primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the interest income earned on interest-earning assets less interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average interest-earning assets. Net interest income and net interest margin are impacted by several factors, including changes in average balances and the composition of interest-earning assets and funding sources, market interest rate fluctuations and the slope of the yield curve, repricing characteristics and maturity of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the volume of noninterest-bearing sources of funds and asset quality. 

Net interest income before provision for (reversal of) credit losses in 2022 was $2.05 billion, an increase of $514.3 million or 34%, compared with $1.53 billion in 2021. Net interest margin was 3.45% in 2022, an increase of 73 bps from 2.72% in 2021. The year-over-year changes in net interest income and net interest margin primarily reflected higher interest-earning asset yields and strong loan growth, partially offset by a higher average cost of deposits. The changes in yields and rates reflected rising benchmark interest rates. 

Average interest-earning assets were $59.31 billion in 2022, an increase of $3.05 billion or 5% from $56.26 billion in 2021. The increase in average interest-earning assets primarily reflected growth in loans and debt securities, partially offset by a decrease in interest-bearing cash and deposits with banks. 

The yield on average interest-earning assets was 3.91% in 2022, an increase of 103 bps from 2.88% in 2021. The year-over-year increase in the yield on average interest-earning assets primarily resulted from rising benchmark interest rates. 

The average loan yield was 4.52% in 2022, an increase of 93 bps from 3.59% in 2021. The year-over-year change in the average loan yield reflected the loan portfolio&#8217;s sensitivity to rising benchmark interest rates. Approximately 62% and 66% of loans held-for-investment were variable-rate or hybrid loans in their adjustable-rate period as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Deposits are an important source of funds and impact both net interest income and net interest margin. Average deposits were $54.30 billion in 2022, an increase of $2.82 billion or 5% from $51.48 billion in 2021. Average noninterest-bearing deposits were $22.78 billion, an increase of $1.51 billion or 7% from $21.27 billion in 2021. Average noninterest-bearing deposits made up 42% and 41% of average deposits for 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

The average cost of deposits was 0.46% in 2022, an increase of 33 bps from 0.13% in 2021. The year-over-year increase reflected higher rates paid on money market and time deposits in response to the rising interest rate environment. 

The average cost of funds calculation includes deposits, FHLB advances, repurchase agreements, long-term debt and short-term borrowings. In 2022, the average cost of funds was 0.50%, an increase of 33 bps from 0.17% in 2021. The year-over-year increase was mainly driven by the change in the average cost of deposits discussed above. 

The Company utilizes various tools to manage interest rate risk. Refer to the Interest Rate Risk Management section of Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Risk Management &#8212; Market Risk Management for details.

Noninterest income comprised 13% and 16% of total revenue in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Noninterest income for 2022 was $298.7 million, an increase of $12.8 million or 4%, compared with $285.9 million in 2021. The increase was primarily due to growth in deposit account fees, and interest rate contracts and other derivative income, partially offset by a decrease in other investment income. 

Deposit account fees were $88.4 million in 2022, an increase of $17.2 million or 24%, compared with $71.3 million in 2021. This growth was primarily driven by higher treasury management and deposit-related fees from commercial deposits. 

Interest rate contracts and other derivative income was $29.1 million in 2022, an increase of $6.1 million or 27%, compared with $22.9 million in 2021. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to favorable credit valuation adjustments and higher transaction volume, which drove growth in interest rate contract premiums. 

Other investment income was $7.0 million in 2022, a decrease of $9.8 million or 58%, compared with $16.9 million in 2021. The decrease primarily reflected unfavorable equity valuation adjustments in the Company&#8217;s CRA investments in 2022, compared with the prior year. 

Noninterest Expense 

The following table presents the components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated: 

##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, ($ in thousands) 2022 2021 % Change from 2021 2020 Compensation and employee benefits $ 477,635 $ 433,728 10 % $ 404,071 Occupancy and equipment expense 62,501 62,996 (1) % 66,489 Deposit insurance premiums and regulatory assessments 19,449 17,563 11 % 15,128 Deposit account expense 25,508 16,152 58 % 13,530 Data processing 14,517 16,263 (11) % 16,603 Computer software expense 28,259 30,600 (8) % 29,033 Other operating expense 118,166 96,330 23 % 92,646 Amortization of tax credit and other investments 113,358 122,457 (7) % 70,082 Repurchase agreements&#8217; extinguishment cost &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; % 8,740 Total noninterest expense $ 859,393 &#160; $ 796,089 &#160; 8 &#160; % $ 716,322 &#160; ##TABLE_END

Noninterest expense was $859.4 million in 2022, an increase of $63.3 million or 8%, compared with $796.1 million in 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits, other operating expense, and deposit account expense, partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of tax credit and other investments. 

Compensation and employee benefits were $477.6 million in 2022, an increase of $43.9 million or 10%, compared with $433.7 million in 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher average compensation. 

Other operating expense was $118.2 million in 2022, an increase of $21.8 million or 23%, compared with $96.3 million in 2021. This increase was primarily due to higher interest expense on cash collateral, foreclosure and travel-related expenses, and miscellaneous operating losses, partially offset by lower legal expenses. 

Deposit account expense was $25.5 million in 2022, an increase of $9.4 million or 58%, compared with $16.2 million in 2021. The increase primarily reflected higher deposit referral fees and commercial customer account expenses. 

Amortization of tax credit and other investments was $113.4 million in 2022, a decrease of $9.1 million or 7%, compared with $122.5 million in 2021. The year-over-year change largely reflected investments that close in a given period and the mix of tax credits being recognized, all of which have differing amortization periods. 

Income Taxes 

The following table presents the income before income taxes, income tax expense and effective tax rate for the periods indicated: 

##TABLE_START ($ in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Income before income taxes $ 1,411,654 $ 1,056,377 $ 685,765 Income tax expense $ 283,571 $ 183,396 $ 117,968 Effective tax rate 20.1 % 17.4 % 17.2 % ##TABLE_END

Income tax expense was $283.6 million in 2022, compared with $183.4 million in 2021, resulting in an effective tax rate of 20.1% and 17.4%, respectively. The increase in the income tax expense was primarily related to an increase in pre-tax net income and a decrease in tax credits. The differences between the 2022 and 2021 effective tax rates from the federal statutory rate of 21% were primarily due to tax credits associated with renewable energy, historic and new market tax credit related projects and state taxes as described in Note 11 &#8212; Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

Operating Segment Results 

The Company organizes its operations into three reportable operating segments: (1) Consumer and Business Banking; (2) Commercial Banking; and (3) Other. These segments are defined by the type of customers served, and the related products and services provided. The segments reflect how financial information is currently evaluated by management. For a description of the Company&#8217;s internal management reporting process, including the segment cost allocation methodology, see Note 17 &#8212; Business Segments to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

Segment net interest income represents the difference between actual interest earned on assets and interest incurred on liabilities of the segment, adjusted for funding charges or credits through the Company&#8217;s internal funds transfer pricing (&#8220;FTP&#8221;) process. 

The following table presents the results by operating segment for the periods indicated:

Consumer and Business Banking 

The Consumer and Business Banking segment primarily provides financial products and services to consumer and commercial customers through the Company&#8217;s domestic branch network and digital banking platform. This segment offers consumer and commercial deposits, mortgage and home equity loans, and other products and services. It also originates commercial loans for small- and medium-sized enterprises through the Company&#8217;s branch network. Other products and services provided by this segment include wealth management, treasury management, interest rate risk hedging and foreign exchange services. 

The following table presents additional financial information for the Consumer and Business Banking segment for the periods indicated: 

##TABLE_START ($ in thousands) Year Ended December 31, Change from 2021 2022 2021 $ % 2020 Net interest income before provision for (reversal of) credit losses $ 1,170,850 $ 697,101 $ 473,749 68 % $ 530,829 Noninterest income 110,139 94,125 16,014 17 % 64,115 Total revenue 1,280,989 791,226 489,763 62 % 594,944 Provision for (reversal of) credit losses 27,197 (4,998) 32,195 644 % 3,885 Noninterest expense 397,882 364,635 33,247 9 % 331,750 Segment income before income taxes 855,910 431,589 424,321 98 % 259,309 Income tax expense 247,790 122,959 124,831 102 % 73,527 Segment net income $ 608,120 $ 308,630 $ 299,490 97 % $ 185,782 Average loans $ 15,769,072 $ 13,922,693 $ 1,846,379 13 % $ 12,056,987 Average deposits $ 33,278,330 $ 31,679,856 $ 1,598,474 5 % $ 27,201,737 ##TABLE_END

Consumer and Business Banking segment net income increased $299.5 million or 97% year-over-year to $608.1 million in 2022, due to revenue growth, partially offset by higher income tax expense, noninterest expense and provision for credit losses. Net interest income before provision for credit losses increased $473.7 million or 68% year-over-year to $1.17 billion. The increase was primarily driven by higher deposit fund transfer pricing credits due to noninterest-bearing deposit growth, and higher loan interest income, mainly from growth in residential mortgage loans. Noninterest income increased $16.0 million or 17% to $110.1 million, primarily driven by higher deposit account fees and foreign exchange income. Provision for credit losses increased $32.2 million, or 644%, year-over-year to $27.2 million, primarily driven by changes to the macroeconomic outlook and mortgage loan growth. Noninterest expense increased $33.2 million, or 9%, to $397.9 million, primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits and allocated corporate overhead expenses . 

Commercial Banking 

The Commercial Banking segment primarily generates commercial loan and deposit products. Commercial loan products include CRE lending, construction finance, commercial business lending, working capital lines of credit, trade finance, letters of credit, affordable housing lending, asset-based lending, asset-backed finance, project finance and equipment financing. Commercial deposit products and other financial services include treasury management, foreign exchange services and interest rate and commodity risk hedging. 

The following table presents additional financial information for the Commercial Banking segment for the periods indicated: 

##TABLE_START ($ in thousands) Year Ended December 31, Change from 2021 2022 2021 $ % 2020 Net interest income before provision for (reversal of) credit losses $ 892,386 $ 766,202 $ 126,184 16 % $ 706,286 Noninterest income 179,248 163,768 15,480 9 % 142,337 Total revenue 1,071,634 929,970 141,664 15 % 848,623 Provision for (reversal of) credit losses 46,303 (30,002) 76,305 254 % 206,768 Noninterest expense 314,185 275,649 38,536 14 % 266,923 Segment income before income taxes 711,146 684,323 26,823 4 % 374,932 Income tax expense 203,679 195,090 8,589 4 % 106,456 Segment net income $ 507,467 $ 489,233 $ 18,234 4 % $ 268,476 Average loans $ 29,550,386 $ 25,794,004 $ 3,756,382 15 % $ 24,742,030 Average deposits $ 17,276,427 $ 17,122,743 $ 153,684 1 % $ 10,811,020 ##TABLE_END

Commercial Banking segment net income increased $18.2 million, or 4%, year-over-year to $507.5 million in 2022. This increase reflected revenue growth, partially offset by higher provision for credit losses and noninterest expense. Net interest income before provision for credit losses increased $126.2 million, or 16%, to $892.4 million, driven by higher loan interest income from commercial loan growth. Noninterest income increased $15.5 million, or 9%, to $179.2 million, primarily driven by higher interest rate contracts and other derivative income, deposit account fees and foreign exchange income. Provision for credit losses increased $76.3 million, or 254%, year-over-year to $46.3 million, primarily driven by changes to the macroeconomic outlook and commercial loan growth. Noninterest expense increased $38.5 million, or 14%, to $314.2 million, primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits, other operating expenses and allocated corporate overhead expenses. 

Other 

Centralized functions, including the corporate treasury activities of the Company and eliminations of inter-segment amounts, have been aggregated and included in the Other segment, which provides broad administrative support to the two core segments, namely the Consumer and Business Banking and the Commercial Banking segments. 

The following table presents additional financial information for the Other segment for the periods indicated: 

##TABLE_START ($ in thousands) Year Ended December 31, Change from 2021 2022 2021 $ % 2020 Net interest (loss) income $ (17,355) $ 68,268 $ (85,623) (125) % $ 140,078 Noninterest income 9,279 28,002 (18,723) (67) % 29,095 Total (loss) revenue (8,076) 96,270 (104,346) (108) % 169,173 Noninterest expense 147,326 155,805 (8,479) (5) % 117,649 Segment loss before income taxes (155,402) (59,535) (95,867) 161 % 51,524 Income tax benefit (167,898) (134,653) (33,245) 25 % (62,015) Segment net income $ 12,496 $ 75,118 $ (62,622) (83) % $ 113,539 Average deposits $ 3,744,822 $ 2,681,097 $ 1,063,725 40 % $ 2,750,134 ##TABLE_END

The Other segment reported segment loss before income taxes of $155.4 million and segment net income of $12.5 million, reflecting an income tax benefit of $167.9 million in 2022. The increase in segment loss before income taxes was primarily driven by lower revenue. The $85.6 million year-over-year decrease in net interest income was primarily driven by lower FTP spread income absorbed by the Other segment, partially offset by an increase in interest income from investments due to a higher debt securities yield in 2022. 

The income tax expense or benefit in the Other segment consists of the remaining unallocated income tax expense or benefit after allocating income tax expense to the two core segments, and reflects the impact of tax credit investment activity. Income tax expense is allocated to the Consumer and Business Banking and the Commercial Banking segments by applying statutory income tax rates to the segment income before income taxes. Tax credit investment amortization is allocated to the Other segment. 

Balance Sheet Analysis 

Debt Securities 

The Company maintains a portfolio of high quality and liquid debt securities with a moderate duration profile. It closely manages the overall portfolio interest rate and liquidity risks. The Company&#8217;s debt securities provide: 

&#8226; interest income for earnings and yield enhancement; 

&#8226; availability for funding needs arising during the normal course of business; 

&#8226; the ability to execute interest rate risk management strategies in response to changes in economic or market conditions; and 

&#8226; collateral to support pledging agreements as required and/or to enhance the Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity. 

While the Company does not intend to sell its debt securities, it may sell AFS securities in response to changes in the balance sheet and related interest rate risk to meet liquidity, regulatory and strategic requirements. 

The following table presents the distribution of the Company&#8217;s AFS and HTM debt securities portfolio as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and by credit rating as of December 31, 2022:

(1) Credit ratings express opinions about the credit quality of a debt security. The Company determines the credit rating of a security according to the lowest credit rating made available by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (&#8220;NRSROs&#8221;). Debt securities rated investment grade, which are those with ratings similar to BBB- or above (as defined by NRSROs), are generally considered by the rating agencies and market participants to be low credit risk. Ratings percentages are allocated based on fair value. 

(2) For debt securities not rated by NRSROs, the Company uses other factors which include but are not limited to the priority in collections within the securitization structure, and whether the contractual payments have historically been on time. 

As of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, 98% of the carrying value of the Company&#8217;s debt securities portfolio was rated investment grade by NRSROs. 

The Company&#8217;s AFS and HTM debt securities portfolio had an effective duration, defined as the sensitivity of the value of the portfolio to interest rate changes, of 5.2 as of December 31, 2022. This increased from 5.0 as of December 31, 2021, primarily due to the upshifting of the yield curve while the portfolio has seasoned. 

Available-for-Sale Debt Securities 

The fair value of AFS debt securities totaled $6.03 billion as of December 31, 2022, a decrease of $3.93 billion or 39% from $9.97 billion as of December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to the Company&#8217;s transfer of $3.01 billion of AFS securities to HTM securities during the first quarter of 2022, and a decline in the portfolio valuation within the rising interest rate environment. For further discussion regarding the transfer, refer to the Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities section below. The Company&#8217;s AFS debt securities are carried at fair value with non-credit related unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in Other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Pre-tax net unrealized losses on AFS debt securities were $844.2 million as of December 31, 2022, compared with $121.8 million as of December 31, 2021. 

As of December 31, 2022, 97% of the carrying value of the AFS debt securities portfolio was rated investment grade by NRSROs, compared with 98% as of December 31, 2021. Of the AFS debt securities with gross unrealized losses, substantially all were rated investment grade as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021. There was no allowance for credit losses provided against the AFS debt securities as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021. Additionally, there were no credit losses recognized in earnings for both 2022 and 2021. 

Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities 

During the first quarter of 2022, the Company transferred $3.01 billion in aggregate fair value of U.S. Treasury, government agency and government-sponsored enterprise debt and mortgage-backed securities, and municipal securities from AFS to HTM. In comparison, there were no HTM debt securities as of December 31, 2021. The Company&#8217;s HTM debt securities are carried at amortized cost. The unrealized gains or losses at the date of transfer of these securities continue to be reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;), net of tax on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are amortized over the remaining life of the securities. 

All HTM debt securities were issued, guaranteed, or supported by the U.S. government or government-sponsored enterprises. Accordingly, the Company applied a zero credit loss assumption for these securities and no allowance for credit loss was recorded as of December 31, 2022. For additional discussion on the allowance for credit losses, see Note 4 &#8212; Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

For additional information on AFS and HTM securities, see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 2 &#8212; Fair Value Measurement and Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Note 4 &#8212; Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

Loan Portfolio 

The Company offers a broad range of financial products designed to meet the credit needs of its borrowers. The Company&#8217;s loan portfolio segments include commercial loans, which consist of C&#38;I, CRE, multifamily residential, and construction and land loans, as well as consumer loans, which consist of single-family residential, home equity lines of credit (&#8220;HELOCs&#8221;) and other consumer loans. Total loans held-for-investment were $48.20 billion as of December 31, 2022, an increase of $6.51 billion, or 16%, from $41.69 billion as of December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily driven by well-balanced growth across all our major loan categories including increases of $2.89 billion or 18% in total CRE loans, $2.11 billion, or 19%, in total residential mortgage loans, and $1.56 billion, or 11%, in C&#38;I loans. The composition of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2022 was similar to the composition as of December 31, 2021.

The negative change in AOCI was primarily due to increased unrealized losses in AFS debt securities. For other factors that contributed to the changes in stockholders&#8217; equity, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements &#8212; Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders&#8217; Equity in this Form 10-K. 

Book value was $42.46 per common share as of December 31, 2022, an increase of 3% from $41.13 per common share as of December 31, 2021, primarily due to the factors described above. Tangible equity per common share was $39.10 as of December 31, 2022, compared with $37.79 as of December 31, 2021. For additional details, see the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures presented under Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Form 10-K. 

The Company paid a cash dividend of $1.60 per common share in 2022, compared with $1.32 per common share in 2021, an increase of 21%. In January 2023, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2023 cash dividend of $0.48 per common share, which represents a 20% increase or eight cents per common share, from the previous quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per common share. The dividend was paid on February 21, 2023, to stockholders of record as of February 6, 2023. 

Deposits and Other Sources of Funding 

Deposits are the Company&#8217;s primary source of funding, the cost of which has a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s net interest income and net interest margin. Additional funding may be provided by short- and long-term borrowings, and long-term debt. See Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Risk Management &#8212; Liquidity Risk Management &#8212; Liquidity in this Form 10-K for a discussion of the Company&#8217;s liquidity management. The following table summarizes the Company&#8217;s sources of funds as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:

Deposits 

The Company offers a wide variety of deposit products to consumer and commercial customers. To provide a stable and low-cost source of funding and liquidity, the Company&#8217;s strategy is to grow and retain relationship-based deposits. Total deposits reached $55.97 billion as of December 31, 2022, an increase of $2.62 billion or 5% from $53.35 billion as of December 31, 2021. Deposit growth was driven by time deposits, which increased $5.37 billion or 67% year-over-year, partially offset by decreases in noninterest-bearing demand and money market deposits. The balance shift to time deposits was largely driven by continued increases in benchmark interest rates and a successful branch-based CD campaign. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits comprised 38% and 43% of total deposits as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in noninterest-bearing demand deposits reflects customer utilization of excess balances and a shift to interest-earning options, in response to higher interest rates. Additional information regarding the impact of deposits on net interest income, with a comparison of average deposit balances and rates, is provided in Item 7 &#8212; MD&#38;A &#8212; Results of Operations &#8212; Net Interest Income in this Form 10-K. 

As of December 31, 2022, customer deposits of $52.92 billion, $1.47 billion, and $1.58 billion were held in the Company&#8217;s domestic offices, the subsidiary bank in China and the branch in Hong Kong, respectively. D epositors domiciled in non-U.S. countries and territories made up $11.79 billion or 22% of the deposits held in domestic offices as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, $6.26 billion or 30% of total noninterest-bearing demand deposits as of December 31, 2022, were from depositors domiciled in non-U.S. countries and territories. 

Customer deposit accounts in the domestic offices are insured by the FDIC for up to $250,000. The deposits in the Company&#8217;s subsidiary bank in China and the branch in Hong Kong are insured by each jurisdiction&#8217;s deposit insurance authority for up to 500,000 RMB and 500,000 HKD, respectively. The amounts disclosed below are derived using the same methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory reporting requirements. The following table presents total uninsured deposits by location as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:

Other Sources of Funding 

As of December 31, 2022, all previously outstanding FHLB advances had matured, compared with $249.3 million of FHLB advances outstanding as of December 31, 2021. 

Gross repurchase agreements were $300.0 million as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021. As of December 31, 2022, the interest rates ranged from 6.63% to 6.95%. Repurchase agreements of $200.0 million have an original maturity of 10.0 years, whereas repurchase agreements of $100.0 million have an original maturity of 8.5 years. All repurchase agreements will mature in 2023. 

Repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and recorded as liabilities based on the values at which the assets are sold. To ensure the market value of the underlying collateral remains sufficient, the Company monitors the fair value of collateral pledged relative to the principal amounts borrowed under the repurchase agreements. The Company manages liquidity risks related to the repurchase agreements by sourcing funds from a diverse group of counterparties, and entering into repurchase agreements with longer durations, when appropriate. For additional details, see Note 3 &#8212; Assets Purchased under Resale Agreements and Sold under Repurchase Agreements to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

The Company uses long-term debt to provide funding to acquire interest-earning assets, and to enhance liquidity and regulatory capital adequacy. Long-term debt totaled $148.0 million and $147.7 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining maturities ranged between 11.9 years and 14.7 years. Long-term debt consists of junior subordinated debt, which qualifies as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes. For additional details, see Note 10 &#8212; Federal Home Loan Bank Advances and Long-Term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

Regulatory Capital and Ratios 

The federal banking agencies have risk-based capital adequacy requirements intended to ensure that banking organizations maintain capital that is commensurate with the degree of risk associated with their operations. The Company and the Bank are each subject to these regulatory capital adequacy requirements. See Item 1. Business &#8212; Supervision and Regulation &#8212; Regulatory Capital Requirements and Regulatory Capital-Related Development in this Form 10-K for additional details. 

The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, which requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses to be based on management&#8217;s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Company&#8217;s relevant financial assets. The Company has elected the phase-in option provided by a final rule that delays an estimate of the CECL effect on regulatory capital for two years and phases in the impact over three years. The rule permits certain banking organizations to exclude from regulatory capital the initial adoption impact of CECL, plus 25% of the cumulative changes in the allowance for credit losses under CECL for each period until December 31, 2021, followed by a three-year phase-out period in which the aggregate benefit is reduced by 25% in 2022, 50% in 2023 and 75% in 2024. Accordingly, our capital ratios as of December 31, 2022 reflect a delay of 75% of the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s capital ratios as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 under the Basel III Capital Rules, and those required by regulatory agencies for capital adequacy and well-capitalized classification purposes: 

##TABLE_START Basel III Capital Rules December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Company East West Bank Company East West Bank Minimum Regulatory Requirements Minimum Regulatory Requirements including Capital Conservation Buffer Well- Capitalized Requirements Risk-based capital ratios: CET 1 capital 12.7 % 12.5 % 12.8 % 12.3 % 4.5 % 7.0 % 6.5 % Tier 1 capital (1)

9.8 % 9.7 % 9.0 % 8.6 % 4.0 % 4.0 % 5.0 % ##TABLE_END

(1) The Tier 1 leverage well-capitalized requirement applies only to the Bank since there is no Tier 1 leverage ratio component in the definition of a well-capitalized bank holding company. The minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio requirement for the Company to be considered well-capitalized is 6%. 

The Company is committed to maintaining strong capital levels to assure the Company&#8217;s investors, customers and regulators that the Company and the Bank are financially sound. As of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company and the Bank continued to exceed all &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; capital requirements and the required minimum capital requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules. Total risk-weighted assets were $50.04 billion as of December 31, 2022, an increase of $6.45 billion or 15% from $43.59 billion as of December 31, 2021. The increase in risk-weighted assets was primarily due to loan growth. 

Risk Management 

Overview 

In the normal course of conducting its business, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent to the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to the Company&#8217;s business. The Company operates under a Board-approved ERM framework, which outlines the company-wide approach to risk management and oversight, and describes the structures and practices employed to manage the current and emerging risks inherent to the Company. The Company&#8217;s ERM program incorporates risk management throughout the organization in identifying, managing, monitoring and reporting risks. It identifies the Company&#8217;s major risk categories as: credit, liquidity, capital, market, operational, compliance, legal, strategic and reputational. 

The Risk Oversight Committee of the Board of Directors monitors the ERM program through established risk categories and provides oversight of the Company&#8217;s risk appetite and control environment. The Risk Oversight Committee provides focused oversight of the Company&#8217;s identified enterprise risk categories on behalf of the full Board of Directors. Under the direction of the Risk Oversight Committee, management committees apply targeted strategies to reduce the risks to which the Company&#8217;s operations are exposed. 

The Company&#8217;s ERM program is executed along the three lines of defense model, which provides for a consistent and standardized risk management control environment across the enterprise. The first line of defense is comprised of production, operational, and support units. The second line of defense is comprised of various risk management and control functions charged with monitoring and managing specific major risk categories and/or risk subcategories. The third line of defense is comprised of the Internal Audit function and Independent Asset Review (&#8220;IAR&#8221;). Internal Audit and IAR provide assurance and evaluate the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes as established by the Company. Reporting directly to the Board&#8217;s Audit Committee, Internal Audit maintains organizational independence and objectivity. Further discussion and analysis of the primary risk areas are detailed in the following subsections of Risk Management. 

Credit Risk Management 

Credit risk is the risk that a borrower or a counterparty will fail to perform according to the terms and conditions of a loan or investment and expose the Company to loss. Credit risk exists with many of the Company&#8217;s assets and exposures such as loans, debt securities and certain derivatives. The majority of the Company&#8217;s credit risk is associated with lending activities. 

The Risk Oversight Committee has primary oversight responsibility for identified enterprise risk categories including credit risk. The Risk Oversight Committee monitors management&#8217;s assessment of asset quality, credit risk trends, credit quality administration, underwriting standards, and portfolio credit risk management strategies and processes, such as diversification and concentration limits, all of which enable management to control credit risk. At the management level, the Credit Risk Management Committee has primary oversight responsibility for credit risk. The Senior Credit Supervision function manages credit policy for the line of business transactional credit risk, assuring that all exposure is risk-rated according to the requirements of the credit risk rating policy. The Senior Credit Supervision function evaluates and reports the overall credit risk exposure to senior management and the Risk Oversight Committee. Reporting directly to the Board&#8217;s Risk Oversight Committee, the IAR function provides additional support to the Company&#8217;s strong credit risk management culture by providing an independent and objective assessment of underwriting and documentation quality. A key focus of our credit risk management is adherence to a well-controlled underwriting process. 

The Company assesses the overall credit quality performance of the loans held-for-investment portfolio through an integrated analysis of specific performance ratios. This approach forms the basis of the discussion in the sections immediately following: Nonperforming Assets, Troubled Debt Restructurings (&#8220;TDRs&#8221;) and Allowance for Credit Losses. 

Credit Quality 

The Company utilizes a credit risk rating system to assist in monitoring credit quality. Loans are evaluated using the Company&#8217;s internal credit risk rating of 1 through 10. For more information on the Company&#8217;s credit quality indicators and internal credit risk ratings, refer to Note 6 &#8212; Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets are comprised of nonaccrual loans, other real estate owned (&#8220;OREO&#8221;), and other nonperforming assets. Other nonperforming assets and OREO are repossessed assets and properties, respectively, acquired through foreclosure, or through full or partial satisfaction of loans held-for-investment. Nonperforming assets were $99.8 million or 0.16% of total assets as of December 31, 2022, a decrease of $3.7 million or 4%, compared with $103.5 million or 0.17% of total assets as of December 31, 2021.

Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due or when the full collection of principal or interest becomes uncertain regardless of the length of past due status. Collectability is generally assessed based on economic and business conditions, the borrower&#8217;s financial condition and the adequacy of collateral, if any. For additional details regarding the Company&#8217;s nonaccrual loan policy, see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Loans Held-for-Investment to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

Nonaccrual loans were $99.5 million as of December 31, 2022, an increase of $6.3 million or 7% from $93.2 million as of December 31, 2021. This increase was predominantly due to an increase in CRE nonaccrual loans, partially offset by charge-offs and paydowns of commercial loans. As of December 31, 2022, $68.3 million or 69% of nonaccrual loans were less than 90 days delinquent. In comparison, $54.2 million or 58% of nonaccrual loans were less than 90 days delinquent as of December 31, 2021.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

TDRs are loans for which contractual terms have been modified by the Company for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, and for which a concession to the borrower was granted that the Company would not otherwise consider. The Company&#8217;s loan modifications are handled on a case-by-case basis and are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan collectability and meet the borrower&#8217;s financial needs. A modification typically may include rate reduction, principal forgiveness, extension of loan terms, and delay of payment, and is intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. At the time of restructuring, if a portion of the loan is deemed to be uncollectible, a charge-off may be recorded. Alternatively, if a charge-off has already been recorded in a previous period then no charge-off is required at the time of modification. 

The following table presents the performing and nonperforming TDRs by loan portfolio segments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The allowance for loan losses for total TDRs was $17.7 million as of December 31, 2022, and $4.8 million as of December 31, 2021.

Performing TDRs were $75.9 million as of December 31, 2022, a decrease of $37.9 million or 33% from $113.8 million as of December 31, 2021. This decrease reflected payoffs and paydowns of performing C&#38;I, single-family residential and multifamily residential TDR loans, partially offset by one newly designated performing C&#38;I TDR loan. Over 93% and 94% of the performing TDR loans were current as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Nonperforming TDRs were $43.8 million as of December 31, 2022, an increase of $13.4 million or 44% from $30.4 million as of December 31, 2021. This increase primarily reflected newly designated nonperforming C&#38;I TDR loans, partially offset by payoffs and paydowns of nonperforming C&#38;I TDR loans. 

Existing TDRs that were subsequently modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be classified as TDRs. Customers who require further assistance upon exiting from the COVID-19 deferral programs may receive further modifications which may be classified as TDRs. As of December 31, 2022, there were no TDRs that were modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the amount of TDRs that were modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic were insignificant as of December 31, 2021. 

Loan Modifications Due to COVID-19 Pandemic 

The Company granted a range of commercial and consumer loan accommodations to borrowers experiencing financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 related loan modifications, which occurred between March 1, 2020 through January 1, 2022, that met the loan modification criteria under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act or under the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised), were generally not categorized as TDRs during the relief period which expired on January 1, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no loans under payment deferral and forbearance programs, compared with $363.1 million of loans under payment deferral and forbearance programs as of December 31, 2021. Loans that exited the modification program were substantially all current as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses represents management&#8217;s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Company&#8217;s relevant financial assets. The allowance for credit losses estimate uses various models and estimation techniques based on historical loss experience, current borrower characteristics, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and other relevant factors. 

In addition to the allowance for loan losses, the Company maintains an allowance for unfunded credit commitments. The Company has three general areas for which it provides the allowance for unfunded credit commitments: (1) recourse obligations for loans sold, (2) letters of credit, and (3) unfunded lending commitments. The Company&#8217;s methodology for determining the allowance calculation for unfunded lending commitments uses the lifetime loss rates of the on-balance sheet commitment. Recourse obligations for loans sold and letters of credit use the weighted loss rates for the applicable segment of the individual credit. 

For loans and securities, allowance for credit losses are contra-asset valuation accounts that are deducted from the amortized cost basis of these assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. For unfunded credit commitments, the allowance for credit losses is a liability account that is reported as a component of Accrued expenses and other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

The Company is committed to maintaining the allowance for credit losses at a level that is commensurate with the estimated inherent losses in the loan portfolio, including unfunded credit facilities. While the Company believes that the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2022 was appropriate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio and in unfunded credit commitments based on the information available, future allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to, accounting standard and regulatory changes, loan growth, portfolio performance and general economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires numerous estimates and judgements. For a description of the policies, methodologies and judgments used to determine the allowance for credit losses, see Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Critical Accounting Estimates, Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6 &#8212; Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

2022 net charge-offs were $18.5 million or 0.04% of average loans held-for-investment, compared with $50.0 million, or 0.13% of average loans held-for-investment in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in C&#38;I and CRE charge-offs. 

Liquidity Risk Management 

Liquidity 

Liquidity is a financial institution&#8217;s capacity to meet its deposit and obligations to other counterparties as they come due, or to obtain adequate funding at a reasonable cost to meet those obligations. The objective of liquidity management is to manage the potential mismatch of asset and liability cash flows. Maintaining an adequate level of liquidity depends on the institution&#8217;s ability to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected cash flows, and collateral needs without adversely affecting daily operations or the financial condition of the institution. To achieve this objective, the Company analyzes its liquidity risk, maintains readily available liquid assets and utilizes diverse funding sources including its stable core deposit base. 

The Board of Directors&#8217; Risk Oversight Committee has primary oversight responsibility over liquidity risk management. At the management level, the Company&#8217;s Asset/Liability Committee (&#8220;ALCO&#8221;) establishes the liquidity guidelines that govern the day-to-day active management of the Company&#8217;s liquidity position by requiring sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. These guidelines are established and monitored for both the Bank and East West, on a stand-alone basis to ensure that the Company can serve as a source of strength for its subsidiaries. The ALCO regularly monitors the Company&#8217;s liquidity status and related management processes, providing regular reports to the Board of Directors. The Company&#8217;s liquidity management practices have been effective under normal operating and stressed market conditions. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Liquidity Sources. The Company&#8217;s primary source of funding is from deposits, generated by its banking business, which we believe is a relatively stable and low-cost source of funding. A substantial portion of our loans were funded by our deposits, which amounted to $55.97 billion and $53.35 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company&#8217;s loan-to-deposit ratio was 86% as of December 31, 2022, compared with 78% as of December 31, 2021. 

In addition to deposits, the Company has access to various sources of wholesale financing, including borrowing capacity with the FHLB and FRBSF, unsecured federal funds lines of credit with various correspondent banks, and several master repurchase agreements with major brokerage companies to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio, meet daily cash demands and allow management flexibility to execute its business strategy. Economic conditions and the stability of capital markets impact the Company&#8217;s access to and the cost of wholesale financing. The Company&#8217;s access to capital markets is also affected by the ratings received from various credit rating agencies. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had available borrowing capacity of $22.90 billion. The available borrowing capacity included secured borrowing lines of $12.77 billion with the FHLB and $2.05 billion with the FRBSF, unsecured federal funds lines of credit with correspondent banks of $1.14 billion, and borrowing capacity from unpledged debt securities of $6.94 billion. Unencumbered loans and/or debt securities were pledged to the FHLB and the FRBSF discount window as collateral. The Company has established operational procedures to enable borrowing against these assets, including regular monitoring of the total pool of loans and debt securities eligible as collateral. Eligibility of collateral is defined in guidelines from the FHLB and FRBSF and is subject to change at their discretion. See Item 7. &#8212; MD&#38;A &#8212; Balance Sheet Analysis &#8212; Deposits and Other Sources of Funding in this Form 10-K for further detail related to the Company&#8217;s funding sources. The Company believes its available borrowing capacity and liquid asset pool described below provide sufficient liquidity above its expected cash needs. 

The Company maintains a certain level of liquid assets in the form of cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing deposits with banks, short-term resale agreements, and unencumbered high-quality and liquid AFS debt securities. The following table presents the Company&#8217;s liquid assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: 

##TABLE_START ($ in thousands) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,481,784 $ 3,912,935 Interest-bearing deposits with banks 139,021 736,492 Resale agreements due to mature in one year 307,192 1,818,503 AFS debt securities: U.S. Treasury, and U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise debt securities 1,067,810 2,334,652 U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities 2,262,464 4,157,263 Foreign government bonds 227,053 257,733 Municipal securities 257,099 523,158 Non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and CLOs 1,694,293 2,042,882 Corporate debt securities 526,274 649,665 Less: pledged securities (531,233) (803,896) Total $ 9,431,757 &#160; $ 15,629,387 &#160; ##TABLE_END

Unencumbered liquid assets totaled $9.43 billion as of December 31, 2022, compared with $15.63 billion as of December 31, 2021. The decrease in liquid assets was primarily related to the transfer of $3.01 billion of debt securities from the AFS portfolio to the HTM portfolio during the first quarter of 2022, a decrease in the fair value of AFS debt securities primarily due to interest rate increases and net cash usage due to higher net growth in loans than deposits. 

AFS debt securities, included as part of liquidity sources, consist of high quality and liquid securities with moderate durations to minimize overall interest rate and liquidity risks. The Company believes these AFS debt securities provide quick sources of liquidity to obtain financing, regardless of market conditions, through sale or pledging. We also hold additional debt securities within our HTM portfolio, which are not intended for sale but may be pledged to obtain additional liquidity. In addition, the Company may use debt and equity issuances when costs are deemed attractive, should longer term needs arise. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Cash Requirements. In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters contractual obligations that require future cash payments, including funding for customer deposit withdrawals, repayments for short- and long-term borrowings and other cash commitments. For additional information on these obligations, see the following Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K: 

&#8226; Note 3 &#8212; Assets Purchased under Resale Agreements and Sold under Repurchase Agreements 

&#8226; Note 7 &#8212; Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Partnerships, Tax Credit and Other Investments, Net and Variable Interest Entities 

&#8226; Note 9 &#8212; Deposits 

&#8226; Note 10 &#8212; Federal Home Loan Bank Advances and Long-Term Debt 

The Company also has off-balance sheet arrangements, which represent transactions that are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company&#8217;s off-balance sheet arrangements include (1) commitments to extend credit, such as loan commitments, commercial letters of credit for foreign and domestic trade, standby letters of credit (&#8220;SBLCs&#8221;), and financial guarantees, to meet the financing needs of its customers, (2) future interest obligations related to customer deposits and the Company&#8217;s borrowings, and (3) transactions with unconsolidated entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company, or engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the Company. Because many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future funding requirements. Information about the Company&#8217;s loan commitments, commercial letters of credit and SBLCs is provided in Note 12 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows summarizes the Company&#8217;s sources and uses of cash by type of activities in 2022, 2021 and 2020. Excess cash generated by operating and investing activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Liquidity for East West. In addition to bank level liquidity management, the Company manages liquidity at the parent company level for various operating needs including payment of dividends, repurchases of common stock, principal and interest payments on its borrowings, acquisitions, and additional investments in its subsidiaries. East West&#8217;s primary source of liquidity is from cash dividends distributed by its subsidiary, East West Bank. The Bank is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends as discussed in Item 1 . Business &#8212; Supervision and Regulation &#8212; Dividends and Other Transfers of Funds in this Form 10-K. East West held $228.5 million and $345.0 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Management believes that East West has sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet the projected cash obligations for the coming year. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Liquidity Stress Testing. The Company utilizes liquidity stress analysis to determine the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the Company, foreign subsidiary and foreign branch to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. Scenario analyses include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources, market triggers, potential uses of funding and economic conditions in certain countries. In addition, Company specific events are incorporated into the stress testing. Liquidity stress tests are conducted to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons, both immediate and longer term, and over a variety of stressed conditions. Given the range of potential stresses, the Company maintains contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for individual entities. 

As of December 31, 2022, the Company believes it has adequate liquidity resources to conduct operations and meet other needs in the ordinary course of business, and is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital resources or operations. Given the uncertain and rapidly changing market and economic conditions, the Company will continue to actively evaluate the impact on its business and financial position. For more information on how economic conditions may impact our liquidity, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Form 10-K. 

Market Risk Management 

Market risk refers to the risk of potential loss due to adverse movements in market risk factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and credit spreads. The Company is primarily exposed to interest rate risk through its core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits. The Risk Oversight Committee of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors has primary oversight responsibility and has given the ALCO the task of market risk management. The ALCO establishes guidelines, risk measures and limits, and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market risk management activities. 

Interest Rate Risk Management 

Interest rate risk results primarily from the Company&#8217;s traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans, which are the primary areas of market risk for the Company. Interest rate risk is comprised of repricing risk, basis risk, yield curve risk and options risk. Repricing risk arises from differences in the cash flow or repricing between asset and liability portfolios. Basis risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different market rate indices, which do not always change by the same amount. Yield curve risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different maturities on a given yield curve; when the yield curve changes shape, the risk position is altered. Options risk arises from &#8220;embedded options&#8221; within asset and liability products. For example, loan prepayments and early withdrawals of certificates of deposits could increase or decrease in response to interest rate fluctuation. 

The ALCO coordinates the overall management of the Company&#8217;s interest rate risk, meets regularly to review the Company&#8217;s open market positions and establishes policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk. Interest rate risk management is carried out primarily through strategies involving the Company&#8217;s debt securities portfolio, loan portfolio, available funding channels and capital market activities. In addition, the Company&#8217;s policies permit the use of derivative instruments to assist in managing interest rate risk. 

The interest rate risk exposure is measured and monitored through various risk management tools, which include a simulation model that performs interest rate sensitivity analyses under multiple interest rate scenarios against a baseline. The simulation model incorporates the market&#8217;s forward rate expectations and the Company&#8217;s earning assets and liabilities. The Company uses both a static balance sheet and a forward growth balance sheet to perform the interest rate sensitivity analyses. The simulated interest rate scenarios include an instantaneous non-parallel shift in the yield curve and a gradual non-parallel shift in the yield curve (&#8220;rate ramp&#8221;) over a static balance sheet. In addition, the Company also performs simulations using other alternative interest rate scenarios, including various permutations of the yield curve flattening, steepening or inverting. Results of these various simulations are used to formulate and gauge strategies to achieve a desired risk profile within the Company&#8217;s capital and liquidity guidelines. 

The net interest income simulation model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of the Company&#8217;s interest rate sensitive assets, liabilities and related derivative contracts. It also incorporates various assumptions, which management believes to be reasonable but may have a significant impact on the results. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the timing and magnitude of changes in interest rates, the yield curve evolution and shape, the correlation between various interest rate indices, financial instruments&#8217; future repricing characteristics and spread relative to benchmark rates, and the effect of interest rate floors and caps. The modeled results are highly sensitive to deposit decay and deposit beta assumptions, which are derived from a regression analysis of the Company&#8217;s historical deposit data. Deposit beta commonly refers to the correlation of the changes in interest rates paid on deposits to changes in the benchmark interest rates. The Company used full-through-the-cycle betas with each incremental rate increase in the rate ramp scenarios, and did not assume lags in repricing. The model is also sensitive to the loan and investment prepayment assumptions that are based on an independent model and the Company&#8217;s historical prepayment data, which consider anticipated prepayments under different interest rate environments. 

Simulation results are highly dependent on input assumptions. To the extent the actual behavior is different from the assumptions used in the models, there could be material changes in interest rate sensitivity results. The assumptions applied in the model are documented, supported, and periodically back-tested to assess the reasonableness and effectiveness. The Company also regularly monitors the sensitivity of the other important modeling assumptions, such as loan and security prepayments and early withdrawal on fixed-rate customer liabilities. The Company makes appropriate calibrations to the model as needed and continually validates the model, methodology and results. Changes to key model assumptions are reviewed by the ALCO. Scenario results do not reflect strategies that the management could employ to limit the impact of changing interest rate expectations. The simulation does not represent a forecast of the Company&#8217;s net interest income but is a tool utilized to assess the risk of the impact of changing market interest rate across a range of interest rate environments. 

In March 2022, the Federal Reserve raised the target range for the fed funds rate to 0.25% to 0.50% to address concerns about inflation, which reflected supply and demand imbalances due to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. The Federal Reserve continued its aggressive approach in responding to inflation throughout 2022 by incrementally raising the target range for the fed funds rate, which by year-end had increased to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%, and which was subsequently increased to a range of 4.50% to 4.75% in February 2023. The market estimates that interest rates are likely to continue rising, potentially reaching 5.00% or higher by March 2023. However, increased uncertainty regarding a potential recession has also led to the expectation of rate cuts potentially occurring by the end of 2023. 

Twelve-Month Net Interest Income Simulation 

Net interest income simulation modeling measures interest rate risk through earnings volatility. The simulation projects the cash flow changes in interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities, expressed in terms of net interest income, over a specified time horizon for defined interest rate scenarios. Net interest income simulations provide insight into the impact of market rate changes on earnings, which help guide risk management decisions. The Company assesses interest rate risk by comparing the changes of net interest income in different interest rate scenarios. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s net interest income sensitivity related to an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates by 100 and 200 bps as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 based on a static balance sheet as of the date of the analysis. 

##TABLE_START Change in Interest Rates (in bps) Net Interest Income Volatility (1) 

December 31, 2022 2021 % % +200 11.6 % 19.5 % +100 5.9 % 9.4 % -100 (5.3) % NM -200 (8.6) % NM ##TABLE_END

NM &#8212; Not meaningful. 

(1) The percentage change represents net interest income change over a 12-month period in a stable interest rate environment versus in the various interest rate scenarios. 

The composition of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movement due to the imbalance between the faster repricing of the floating-rate loan portfolio versus deposit products. In the table above, net interest income volatility is expressed in relation to base-case net interest income, which decreased year-over year as a result of interest rate hedging activities, changes in the funding mix, decreases in cash and cash equivalents, resale agreements, short-term investments, and growth in fixed-rate loans. 

While an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates was used in the simulation model described in the preceding paragraph, the Company also models scenarios based on gradual shifts in interest rates and assesses the corresponding impacts. These interest rate scenarios provide additional information to estimate the Company&#8217;s underlying interest rate risk. The rate ramp table below shows the net interest income volatility under a gradual non-parallel shift of the yield curve, in even monthly increments over the first 12 months, followed by rates held constant thereafter based on a static balance sheet as of the date of the analysis. Actual results will vary based on the timing and pace of interest rate changes, as well as changes in the balance sheet. 

##TABLE_START Change in Interest Rates (in bps) Net Interest Income Volatility December 31, 2022 2021 % % +200 Rate ramp 6.3 % 9.2 % +100 Rate ramp 3.4 % 4.1 % -100 Rate ramp (2.4) % NM -200 Rate ramp (4.9) % NM ##TABLE_END

NM &#8212; Not meaningful. 

As of December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s net interest income profile reflects an asset sensitive position. Net interest income is expected to increase when interest rates rise as the Company has a large share of variable rate loans, primarily linked to Prime, LIBOR, and Term SOFR indices. The Company&#8217;s interest income is sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates. The Company added $3.25 billion of interest rate hedges during 2022, which reduced the net interest income volatility by approximately 1% of the base net interest income for every 100 bps change in interest rates. The Company&#8217;s deposit portfolio is primarily composed of non-maturity deposits, which are not directly tied to short-term interest rate indices, but are, nevertheless, sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates. The modeled results are highly sensitive to reinvestment yield and deposit beta assumptions. Actual results in terms of net interest income growth during a period of rising interest rates will also reflect earning asset growth and deposit mix changes based on customer preferences relative to the interest rate environment. During a period of declining interest rates, balance sheet growth could offset headwinds to net interest income from yield compression. 

Economic Value of Equity at Risk 

Economic value of equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;) is a cash flow calculation that takes the present value of all asset cash flows and subtracts the present value of all liability cash flows. This calculation is used for asset/liability management and measures changes in the economic value of the bank. The economic value approach provides a comparatively broader scope than the net interest income volatility approach since it captures all anticipated cash flows. 

The EVE simulation reflects the sensitivity of the EVE to interest rate changes across the full maturity spectrum of the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities. It identifies risks arising from repricing, prepayment and maturity gaps between assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, as well as from off-balance sheet derivative exposure. The simulation provides long-term economic perspective into the Company&#8217;s interest rate risk profile, which allows the Company to manage anticipated negative effects of interest rate fluctuations. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s EVE sensitivity related to an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates by 100 and 200 bps as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: 

##TABLE_START Change in Interest Rates (in bps) EVE Volatility (1) 

December 31, 2022 2021 % % +200 (6.0 %) 7.1 % +100 (2.9 %) 3.5 % -100 1.1 % NM -200 2.3 % NM ##TABLE_END

NM &#8212; Not meaningful. 

(1) The percentage change represents net portfolio value change of the Company in a stable interest rate environment versus in the various interest rate scenarios. 

The Company&#8217;s EVE sensitivity for the upward interest rate scenarios shifted from a positive to a negative change as of December 31, 2022, compared with the results as of December 31, 2021. The change in EVE sensitivity was primarily due to updates to non-maturity deposit behavior, which were assumed to run-off faster in the higher interest rate environment, as well as interest rate hedging activities that were executed during the year. 

The Company&#8217;s EVE profile as of December 31, 2022, reflects a liability sensitive EVE position. Since the EVE profile represents the discounted present value of cash flows over the expected life of the instruments, the change in EVE does not reflect the degree of earnings that would be impacted over a short time horizon. Additionally, EVE does not account for factors such as balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, product spreads, and yield curve relationships that could reduce or increase the impact of changes in interest rates. Given the uncertainty of the magnitude, timing and direction of future interest rate movements, and the shape of the yield curve, actual results may vary from those predicted by the Company&#8217;s model. 

Derivatives 

It is the Company&#8217;s policy not to speculate on the future direction of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. However, the Company periodically enters into derivative transactions in order to manage its exposure to market risk, primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The Company believes these derivative transactions, when properly structured and managed, provides a hedge against inherent risk in certain assets and liabilities or against risk in specific transactions. Hedging transactions may be implemented using a variety of derivative instruments such as swaps, forwards, options and collars. The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in interest payments received on certain floating-rate commercial loans and interest payments paid on certain floating-rate borrowings. Foreign exchange derivatives are used in net investment hedging strategies to mitigate the risk of changes in the USD equivalent value of a designated monetary amount of the Company&#8217;s net investment in East West Bank (China) Limited. Prior to entering into any accounting hedge activities, the Company analyzes the costs and benefits of the hedge in comparison to alternative strategies. The Company also repositions its hedging derivatives portfolio based on the current assessment of economic and financial conditions, including the interest rate and foreign currency environments, balance sheet composition and trends, and the relative mix of its cash and derivative positions. 

In addition, the Company enters into derivative transactions in order to accommodate its customers with their business needs or to assist customers with their risk management objectives, such as managing exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodity prices. To economically hedge against the derivative contracts entered into with the Company&#8217;s customers, the Company enters into offsetting derivative contracts with third-party financial institutions, some of which are cleared through central clearing organizations. The exposures from derivative transactions are collateralized by cash and/or eligible securities based on limits as set forth in the respective agreements between the Company and counterparty financial institutions. The changes in fair values of the derivative contracts traded with third-party financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the derivative transactions executed with customers throughout the terms of these contracts, except for the credit valuation adjustment component in the contracts and the spread variances between the customer derivatives and the offsetting financial counterparty positions. The Company also utilizes foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to mitigate the economic effect of fluctuations in certain foreign currency on-balance sheet assets and liabilities, primarily foreign currency denominated deposits offered to its customers. 

The Company is subject to credit risk associated with the counterparties to the derivative contracts. This counterparty credit risk is a multi-dimensional form of risk, affected by both the exposure and credit quality of the counterparty, both of which are sensitive to market-induced changes. The Company&#8217;s Credit Risk Management Committee provides oversight of credit risk and the Company has guidelines in place to manage counterparty concentration, tenor limits and collateral. The Company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties, by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements and by requiring collateral arrangements, where possible. The Company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to institutional third parties through the use of credit risk participation agreements. Certain derivative contracts are required to be cleared through central clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty credit risk, where variation margin is applied daily as settlement to the fair value of the derivative contracts. Additionally, the Company incorporates credit value adjustments and other market standard methodologies to appropriately reflect the counterparty&#8217;s and its own nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement of its derivatives. As of December 31, 2022, the Company anticipates performance by its counterparties and has not incurred any related credit losses. 

The following table summarizes certain information on derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges and utilized by the Company in its management of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:

Additional information on the Company&#8217;s derivatives is presented in Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Derivatives, Note 2 &#8212; Fair Value Measurement and Fair Value of Financial Instruments, and Note 5 &#8212; Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The Company&#8217;s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Certain of these policies include critical accounting estimates, which are subject to valuation assumptions, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and it is likely that materially different amounts could be reported under different assumptions and conditions. The Company has procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. The following is a brief description of the Company&#8217;s critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments. 

Allowance for Loan Losses and Unfunded Credit Commitments 

The Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses represents management&#8217;s estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Company&#8217;s financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loans and certain lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a number of matters including development and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of historical loss experience, assessment of key credit risk characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of collateral, and the determination of remaining expected life. For additional information on these judgements and the Company&#8217;s policies and methodologies used to determine the allowance for credit losses, see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Allowance for Loan Losses and Unfunded Credit Commitments, and Note 6 &#8212; Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

A critical judgement in the process is estimating the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses related to macroeconomic forecasts that are incorporated into quantitative methods. As any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the Company utilizes a baseline and upside or downside scenarios which are applied based on a probability weighting, to better reflect management&#8217;s expectation of expected credit losses given existing market conditions and the changes in the economic environment. Changes in the Company&#8217;s assumptions and economic forecasts could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses, which could potentially lead to significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the next. For further discussion on the economic forecast incorporated into the 2022 model, see Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Risk Management &#8212; Credit Risk Management &#8212; Allowance for Credit Losses. 

The allowance for credit losses is sensitive to changes in macroeconomic forecast assumptions. Given the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables within the Company&#8217;s models, it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one factor or input on the allowance. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors and input may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others. However, to provide additional context regarding the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses to changes in key variables, the Company compared the quantitative modeled estimate when applying a 100% probability weighting to the downside scenario rather than the weighting of multiple scenarios used to estimate the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2022. Without considering model overlays and qualitative adjustments which could result in a materially different estimate, this sensitivity analysis would have been approximately $292.9 million higher. 

This analysis demonstrates the sensitivity to the allowance for credit losses to key quantitative assumptions and is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for credit losses as it does not capture all the potential unknown variables that could arise in the forecast period, but it provides an approximation of a possible outcome under hypothetical severe conditions. Management believes that the estimate for the allowance for credit losses was reasonable and appropriate as of December 31, 2022. 

Fair Value Estimates 

Certain financial instruments are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on a recurring basis, including AFS debt securities, certain equity securities and derivatives. Changes in fair value are recorded either through earnings or other comprehensive income (loss). Other financial instruments, such as certain individually evaluated loans held-for-investment, loans held-for-sale, investments in qualified affordable housing partnerships, tax credit and other investments, OREO and other nonperforming assets, are not carried at fair value each period but may require nonrecurring fair value adjustments primarily due to application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or write-downs of individual assets. 

In determining the fair value of financial instruments, the Company uses market prices of the same or similar instruments whenever such prices are available. The Company does not use prices involving distressed sellers in determining fair value. Changes in the market conditions such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities, may increase variability or reduce the availability of market prices used to determine fair value. If observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain, then fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flows analysis. These modeling techniques incorporate management&#8217;s assessments regarding assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability, including the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique and the risk of nonperformance. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Company could result in different estimates of fair value of financial instruments. 

Significant judgment is also required to determine the fair value hierarchy for certain financial instruments. When fair values are based on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement, the financial assets and liabilities are classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy established under ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement . 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s assets recorded at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

For a complete discussion on the Company&#8217;s fair value hierarchy of financial instruments, fair value measurement techniques and assumptions, and the impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements, see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Fair Value and Note 2 &#8212; Fair Value Measurement and Fair Value of Financial Instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

Goodwill Impairment 

The valuation and testing methodologies used in the Company&#8217;s analysis of goodwill impairment are discussed in Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Goodwill, Note 8 &#8212; Goodwill, and Note 17 &#8212; Business Segments to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K . 

The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test on all three reporting units using a combination of income and market approaches to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit. The Company concluded that the goodwill allocated to its reporting units was not impaired as of December 31, 2022. The fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by a substantial amount and there was no indication of a significant risk of goodwill impairment based on current projections. 

Analyzing goodwill includes consideration of various factors that continue to evolve and for which significant uncertainty remains, including estimates of the profitability of the Company&#8217;s reporting units, long term growth rates and the estimated market cost of equity, such as the discount rate and price multiples of comparable companies. Imprecision in estimating these factors can affect the estimated fair value of the reporting units. Certain events or circumstances could have a negative effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting units, including declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions and adverse regulatory or legislative changes, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period. 

Income Taxes 

The Company files income tax returns in the jurisdictions in which it conducts business and evaluates income tax expense in two components: current and deferred income tax expense. Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or due from various tax jurisdictions in the current year and deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. The Company&#8217;s interpretations of the tax laws, including the U.S., its states and the municipalities, and the tax jurisdictions in Hong Kong and China, are complex and subject to audit by taxing authorities that disputes may occur regarding its view on a tax position taken by the Company. 

In estimating accrued taxes, the Company assesses the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent, and other pertinent information. The income tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the Company and the relevant government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining the tax accruals and in evaluating the tax positions, including evaluating uncertain tax positions. Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, tax credits, interpretations of tax laws, the status of examinations by the tax authorities, and newly enacted statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance that could impact the relative merits and risks of tax positions. These changes, when they occur, impact tax expense and can materially affect our operating results and financial condition. The Company reviews its tax positions on a quarterly basis and makes adjustments to accrued taxes as new information becomes available. The Company believes that adequate provisions have been recorded for all income tax uncertainties consistent with ASC 740, Income Taxes as of December 31, 2022 . For further information on the Company&#8217;s accounting for income taxes and significant tax attributes, see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Income Taxes and Note 11 &#8212; Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

To supplement the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company uses certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with, or as an alternative to U.S. GAAP. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company&#8217;s performance that either excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have such an effect, that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable financial measure that is calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this Form 10-K are tangible return on average tangible equity, tangible equity per common share and adjusted efficiency ratio. Certain additional non-GAAP financial measures that are components of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures are also set forth and reconciled in the table below. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance, and allow comparability to prior periods. These non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. 

The following tables present the reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for 2022, 2021 and 2020:
