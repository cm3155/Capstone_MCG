This information is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this report, and the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) on February 27, 2023 (the &#8220;Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K&#8221;). 

Organization and Strategy 

East West is a bank holding company incorporated in Delaware on August 26, 1998 and is registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Company commenced business on December 30, 1998 when, pursuant to a reorganization, it acquired all of the voting stock of the Bank, which became its principal asset. The Bank is an independent commercial bank headquartered in California that focuses on the financial service needs of individuals and businesses that operate in both the U.S. and Asia. Through over 120 locations in the U.S. and Asia, the Company provides a full range of consumer and commercial products and services through the following three business segments: (1) Consumer and Business Banking and (2) Commercial Banking, with the remaining operations recorded in (3) Other . The Company&#8217;s principal activity is lending to and accepting deposits from businesses and individuals. We are committed to enhancing long-term stockholder value by growing loans, deposits and revenue, improving profitability, and investing for the future while managing risks, expenses and capital. Our business model is built on customer loyalty and engagement, understanding our customers&#8217; financial goals, and meeting our customers&#8217; financial needs through our diverse products and services.

Current Developments 

Economic Developments 

Recent external data indicate that the pace of inflation has moderated in recent months and the volatility in the banking industry earlier in the year appears to have abated. However, inflation remains above the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System&#8217;s (&#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;) 2% target and further interest rate hikes are anticipated later this year. The higher interest rate environment continues to negatively impact the market value of bank-held securities. Additionally, the commercial real estate market is under pressure due to tighter credit conditions and decreased demand. These factors have adversely affected economic activity and the banking sector. Despite these concerns, fears of a potential recession in 2023 have diminished slightly due to the continuing strength in the job market. The Company is actively monitoring changes in economic and industry conditions and their impacts on the Company&#8217;s business, customers, employees, communities and markets. 

Further discussion of the potential impacts on the Company&#8217;s business due to interest rate hikes have been provided in Item 1A. &#8212; Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Financial Matters in the Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. 

LIBOR Transition and Phase Out 

The London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;), a benchmark rate that was widely referenced in the past, ceased publication on July 1, 2023. In preparation for this phase out, beginning January 1, 2022, the Company ceased offering new loans or loan renewals based on LIBOR, and began offering loans based on alternative reference rates (&#8220;ARRs&#8221;) such as Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) and the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index. The Company&#8217;s LIBOR exposures were predominantly comprised of commercial loans and derivative contracts, which have been remediated (i.e., amended to reference an ARR either on or before June 30, 2023 or at the instrument&#8217;s next reset date after June 30, 2023), or already contained appropriate fallback provisions to transition to an ARR. As of July 3, 2023, the remaining small portion of the Company&#8217;s LIBOR-based assets and liabilities have all been amended to use the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act and other relevant legislation and regulation. 

For additional information related to the potential impact surrounding the transition from LIBOR on the Company&#8217;s business, see item 1A. Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Financial Matters in the Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. For additional background information on the LIBOR transition, see Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) &#8212; Overview in the Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. 

Potential Regulatory Reforms in Response to Recent Bank Failures 

Following the bank failures of March 2023, Congress and federal regulatory agencies are considering potential changes to the laws and regulations that apply to banks. On April 28, 2023, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#8220;FDIC&#8221;) issued reports on the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, respectively, identifying potential causes that the federal banking agencies may seek to address through changes to their supervisory and regulatory policies. On July 27, 2023, the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency jointly issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would revise the capital framework applicable to banking organizations with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets or with significant trading activity and, if finalized, would likely result in meaningfully increased capital requirements for those organizations. By imposing additional costs on banking organizations with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets, the proposal could reduce the benefits of growth beyond that size for a banking organization that has less than $100 billion in total consolidated assets. The extent of any further actions to be taken by these agencies or Congress in response to the bank failures, and potential causes highlighted in the Federal Reserve and FDIC reports, and the impact of any such actions on institutions with less than $100 billion in total consolidated assets, such as the Company, remains unclear. 

FDIC Special Assessment and Uninsured Deposits 

On May 11, 2023, the FDIC published a proposed rule that would impose a special deposit insurance assessment on banks in order to recover losses that the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) has incurred in the receiverships of failed institutions. The proposed rule would impose the special assessment for eight quarterly assessment periods beginning with the first quarter of 2024 assessment period, subject to adjustments if the total amount collected is insufficient to cover the DIF&#8217;s costs. Each quarterly special assessment would be equal to 3.13 basis points (0.0313%) of a bank&#8217;s estimated uninsured deposits that exceeded $5 billion as of December 31, 2022. 

On July 24, 2023, the FDIC issued Financial Institution Letter (&#8220;FIL&#8221;) 37-2023 &#8212; Estimated Uninsured Deposits Reporting Expectations, which clarifies the reporting of an insured depository institution&#8217;s estimated uninsured deposits in the Call Report Schedule RC-O, Memorandum item 2 (&#8220;RC-OM item 2&#8221;). This FIL specifies that uninsured deposits reported in RC-OM item 2 should include the deposit balances in excess of the FDIC limit that have been collateralized by pledged assets, and include all deposits of subsidiaries. The Company will evaluate previously filed call reports based on this recent FIL and revise as needed.

(2) Efficiency ratio is calculated as noninterest expense divided by total revenue . 

The Company&#8217;s second quarter 2023 net income was $312.0 million, an increase of $53.7 million or 21%, compared with second quarter 2022 net income of $258.3 million. The increase was primarily due to higher net interest income and lower income tax expense, partially offset by higher noninterest expense and provision for credit losses. Net income for the first half of 2023 was $634.5 million, an increase of $138.5 million or 28% compared with first half of 2022 net income of $496.0 million. The increase was primarily due to higher net interest income, partially offset by higher noninterest expense and provision for credit losses, and a decrease in noninterest income. Noteworthy items about the Company&#8217;s second quarter and first half of 2023 performance included: 

&#8226; Net interest income growth and net interest margin expansion . Second quarter 2023 net interest income before provision for credit losses was $566.7 million, an increase of $93.8 million or 20% from the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter 2023 net interest margin of 3.55% expanded by 32 basis points (&#8220;bps&#8221;) year-over-year. For the first half of 2023, net interest income before provision for credit losses was $1.17 billion, an increase of $278.0 million or 31% year-over-year. The net interest margin for the first half of 2023 was 3.75%, up 70 bps year-over-year. 

&#8226; Expanding profitability. Second quarter 2023 ROA, ROE and the return on average TCE of 1.85%, 19.43% and 21.01%, respectively, all expanded year-over-year by 19 bps, 120 bps and 107 bps, respectively. Likewise, for the first half of 2023, ROA, ROE and the return on average TCE of 1.93%, 20.27% and 21.95%, respectively, all expanded year-over-year by 32 bps, 291 bps and 299 bps, respectively. Return on average TCE is a non-GAAP financial measure. For additional details, see the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures presented under Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Form 10-Q. 

&#8226; Asset growth. Total assets reached $68.53 billion, an increase of $4.42 billion or 7% from December 31, 2022, primarily driven by a $2.90 billion or 83% increase in cash and cash equivalents and a $1.60 billion or 3% increase in total loans. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily funded with borrowings from the Bank Term Funding Program (&#8220;BTFP&#8221;). 

&#8226; Loan growth. Total loans were $49.83 billion as of June 30, 2023, an increase of $1.60 billion or 3% from $48.23 billion as of December 31, 2022. This was primarily driven by growth in the commercial real estate (&#8220;CRE&#8221;) and residential mortgage loan segments. 

&#8226; Strong capital levels. Stockholders&#8217; equity was $6.46 billion or $45.67 per share as of June 30, 2023, both up 8% from $5.98 billion or $42.46 per share as of December 31, 2022. Tangible book value per share of $42.33 as of June 30, 2023, increased $3.23 or 8% from $39.10 as of December 31, 2022. Tangible book value per share is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income 

The Company&#8217;s primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the interest income earned on interest-earning assets less interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average interest-earning assets. Net interest income and net interest margin are impacted by several factors, including changes in average balances and the composition of interest-earning assets and funding sources, market interest rate fluctuations and the slope of the yield curve, repricing characteristics and maturity of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the volume of noninterest-bearing sources of funds, and asset quality. 

The increases in net interest income and net interest margin in the second quarter and the first half of 2023 compared with the same prior year periods primarily reflected higher interest-earning asset yields and strong loan growth, partially offset by a higher average cost of deposits. The changes in yield and rate reflected rising benchmark interest rates. 

Average interest-earning assets were $64.06 billion for the second quarter of 2023, an increase of $5.39 billion or 9% from $58.67 billion for the second quarter of 2022. For the first half of 2023, the average interest-earning assets were $62.78 billion, an increase of $4.10 billion or 7% from $58.68 billion for the first half of 2022. The increases in average interest-earning assets in both periods primarily reflected loan growth, and higher interest-bearing cash and deposits with banks, partially offset by decreases in assets purchased under resale agreements (&#8220;resale agreements&#8221;). 

The yield on average interest-earning assets for the second quarter of 2023 was 5.67%, an increase of 225 bps from 3.42% for the second quarter of 2022. The yield on average interest-earning assets for the first half of 2023 was 5.59%, an increase of 239 bps from 3.20% for the first half of 2022. The year-over-year increases in the yield on average interest-earning assets primarily resulted from rising benchmark interest rates. 

The average loan yield for the second quarter of 2023 was 6.33%, an increase of 238 bps from 3.95% for the second quarter of 2022. The average loan yield for the first half of 2022 was 6.24%, an increase of 244 bps from 3.80% for the first half of 2022. The changes in the average loan yield reflected the loan portfolio&#8217;s sensitivity to rising benchmark interest rates. Approximately 61% and 63% of loans held-for-investment were variable-rate a s of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Deposits are an important source of funds and impact both net interest income and net interest margin. Average deposits were $54.28 billion for the second quarter of 2023, which increased $155.0 million from $54.13 billion for the second quarter of 2022. For the first half of 2023, average deposits were $54.62 billion, an increase of $539.7 million or 1% from $54.08 billion for the first half of 2022. Average noninterest-bearing deposits were $16.93 billion for the second quarter of 2023, a decrease of $6.96 billion or 29% from $23.89 billion for the second quarter of 2022. For the first half of 2023, average noninterest-bearing deposits were $18.31 billion, a decrease of $5.35 billion or 23% from $23.66 billion for the first half of 2022. Average noninterest-bearing deposits made up 31% and 44% of average deposits for the second quarters of 2023 and 2022, respectively, and 34% and 44% for the first halves of 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

The average cost of deposits was 2.12% for the second quarter of 2023, a 195 bps increase from 0.17% for the second quarter of 2022. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 3.09% for the second quarter of 2023, a 279 bps increase from 0.30% for the second quarter of 2022. The average cost of deposits was 1.86% for the first half of 2023, a 173 bps increase from 0.13% for the first half of 2022. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 2.80% for the first half of 2023, a 256 bps increase from 0.24% for the first half of 2022. The year-over-year increases primarily reflected higher rates paid on time deposits, money market and checking deposits in response to the rising interest rate environment. 

The average cost of funds calculation includes deposits, short-term borrowings, Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) advances, assets sold under repurchase agreements (&#8220;repurchase agreements&#8221;), and long-term debt. For the second quarter of 2023, the average cost of funds was 2.31%, a 211 bps increase from 0.20% for the second quarter of 2022. For the first half of 2023, the average cost of funds was 2.01%, a 185 bps increase from 0.16% for the first half of 2022. The increases in both periods were mainly driven by the increased cost of deposits discussed above. 

The Company utilizes various tools to manage interest rate risk. Refer to the Interest Rate Risk Management section of Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Risk Management &#8212; Market Risk Management in this Form 10-Q.

Noninterest income comprised 12% and 11% of total revenue for the second quarter and the first half of 2023, respectively, compared with 14% and 15% for the second quarter and the first half of 2022, respectively. Second quarter 2023 noninterest income was $78.6 million, compared with $78.4 million for the same period in 2022. Noninterest income for the first half of 2023 was $138.6 million, a decrease of $19.6 million or 12%, compared with $158.2 million for the same period in 2022. This decrease was primarily due to net realized losses on AFS debt securities and a decrease in interest rate contracts and other derivative income during the first half of 2023. 

Interest rate contracts and other derivative income was $7.4 million for the second quarter of 2023, a decrease of $2.4 million or 25%, compared with $9.8 million for the same period in 2022. For the first half of 2023, interest rate contracts and other derivative income was $9.9 million, a decrease of $11.0 million or 53%, compared with $20.9 million for the same period in 2022. The decreases were primarily due to less favorable credit valuation adjustments, partially offset by an increase in transaction volume during the second quarter and first half of 2023. 

Net realized losses on AFS debt securities of $10.0 million for the first half of 2023 were due to the write-off of an impaired subordinated debt security during the first quarter of 2023. In comparison, net realized gains on AFS debt securities were $917 thousand and $1.3 million for the second quarter and first half of 2022, respectively. 

Noninterest Expense 

The following table presents the components of noninterest expense for the second quarters and first halves of 2023 and 2022:

Second quarter 2023 noninterest expense was $261.8 million, an increase of $64.9 million or 33%, compared with $196.9 million for the same period in 2022. For the first half of 2023, noninterest expense was $480.2 million, an increase of $93.9 million or 24%, compared with $386.3 million for the same period in 2022. The increases in both the second quarter and the first half of 2023, were primarily due to higher amortization of tax credit and other investments, compensation and employee benefits, other operating expense, deposit account expense and deposit insurance premiums and regulatory assessments. 

Compensation and employee benefits were $124.9 million for the second quarter of 2023, an increase of $11.6 million or 10%, compared with $113.4 million for the same period in 2022. For the first half of 2023, compensation and employee benefits were $254.6 million, an increase of $25.0 million or 11%, compared with $229.6 million for the first half of 2022. These increases were primarily due to staffing growth and the year-over-year change in deferred loan costs. 

Deposit insurance premiums and regulatory assessments were $8.3 million for the second quarter of 2023, an increase of $3.3 million or 68%, compared with $4.9 million for the same period in 2022. For the first half of 2023, deposit insurance premiums and regulatory assessments were $16.2 million, an increase of $6.5 million or 68%, compared with $9.6 million for the same period in 2022. These increases were primarily due to a two bps increase in the base deposit insurance assessment rate under the FDIC&#8217;s Amended Restoration Plan. 

Deposit account expense was $10.6 million for the second quarter of 2023, an increase of $4.9 million or 86%, compared with $5.7 million for the same period in 2022. For the first half of 2023, deposit account expense was $20.2 million, an increase of $9.8 million or 95%, compared with $10.4 million for the same period in 2022. These increases were primarily due to an increase in deposit referral fees which were driven by higher interest rates. 

Other operating expense was $35.3 million for the second quarter of 2023, an increase of $2.9 million or 9%, compared with $32.4 million for the same period in 2022. For the first half of 2023, other operating expense was $70.2 million, an increase of $14.4 million or 26%, compared with $55.8 million for the same period in 2022. These increases were primarily due to higher interest expense on cash collateral and corporate expenses, partially offset by a reduction in foreclosure expenses. 

Amortization of tax credit and other investments was $55.9 million for the second quarter of 2023, an increase of $40.9 million or 273%, compared with $15.0 million for the same period in 2022. For the first half of 2023, amortization of tax credit and other investments was $66.0 million, an increase of $37.1 million or 129%, compared with $28.9 million for the same period in 2022. The year-over-year changes were largely due to the timing of investments that closed.

Second quarter 2023 income tax expense was $45.6 million and the effective tax rate was 12.7%, compared with second quarter 2022 income tax expense of $82.7 million and an effective tax rate of 24.3%. For the first half of 2023, income tax expense was $144.5 million and the effective tax rate was 18.6%, compared with income tax expense of $143.0 million and an effective tax rate of 22.4% for the same period in 2022. The decrease in income tax expense for the second quarter 2023 compared with the year-ago period was primarily due to renewable energy tax credit investments that closed during the quarter. The increase in income tax expense for the first half of 2023 compared with the first half of 2022 was primarily due to a higher level of pretax income in the first half of 2023. The year-over-year decreases in the effective tax rate were primarily due to the aforementioned tax credit investments that closed during the second quarter of 2023. 

Operating Segment Results 

The Company organizes its operations into three reportable operating segments: (1) Consumer and Business Banking; (2) Commercial Banking; and (3) Other. These segments are defined by the type of customers served and the related products and services provided. The segments reflect how financial information is currently evaluated by management. For a description of the Company&#8217;s internal management reporting process, including the segment cost allocation methodology, see Note 15 &#8212; Business Segments to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

Segment net interest income represents the difference between actual interest earned on assets and interest incurred on liabilities of the segment, adjusted for funding charges or credits through the Company&#8217;s internal funds transfer pricing (&#8220;FTP&#8221;) process.

Consumer and Business Banking segment net income increased $3.3 million or 2% year-over-year to $156.9 million for the second quarter of 2023, and $46.4 million or 18% year-over-year to $299.1 million for the first half of 2023. The increases in both periods were primarily driven by an increase in net interest income, partially offset by higher noninterest expense, income tax, and provision for credit losses. Net interest income before provision for credit losses increased $23.1 million or 8% year-over-year to $307.5 million for the second quarter of 2023, and $114.2 million or 23% year-over-year to $611.8 million for the first half of 2023. The increases in both periods were primarily driven by higher deposit FTP credits due to the year-over-year increase in market rates. Provision for credit losses increased $2.6 million or 91% year-over-year to $5.5 million for the second quarter of 2023, and $14.5 million or 242% year-over-year to $20.5 million for the first half of 2023. These increases in both periods were primarily due to the current economic outlook as well as residential mortgage loan growth. Noninterest expense increased $12.7 million or 14% year-over-year to $107.0 million for the second quarter of 2023, and $30.5 million or 16% year-over-year to $220.9 million for the first half of 2023. The increases in both periods primarily reflected higher compensation and employee benefits expense and allocated corporate overhead expenses. 

Commercial Banking 

The Commercial Banking segment primarily generates commercial loan and deposit products. Commercial loan products include CRE lending, construction finance, commercial business lending, working capital lines of credit, trade finance, letters of credit, affordable housing lending, asset-based lending, asset-backed finance, project finance and equipment financing. Commercial deposit products and other financial services include treasury management, foreign exchange services, and interest rate and commodity risk hedging.

The increases in both periods reflected a growth in net interest income, partially offset by higher provision for credit losses and noninterest expense and lower noninterest income. Net interest income before provision for credit losses increased $32.1 million or 14% year-over-year to $263.0 million for the second quarter of 2023, and $60.7 million or 14% year-over-year to $499.8 million for the first half of 2023. The increases were primarily due to higher loan interest income from commercial loan growth and higher deposit FTP credits due to the year-over-year increase in market rates. Noninterest income decreased $5.5 million or 11% year-over-year to $42.5 million for the second quarter of 2023, mainly due to a decrease in foreign exchange income. Noninterest income decreased $11.0 million or 11% year-over-year to $86.1 million for the first half of 2023, mainly due to a decrease in interest rate contracts and other derivative income. Provision for credit losses increased $9.9 million or 93% year-over-year to $20.5 million for the second quarter of 2023, and $10.0 million or 64% year-over-year to $25.5 million for the first half of 2023, primarily driven by the current economic outlook as well as commercial loan growth. Noninterest expense increased $7.3 million or 9% year-over-year to $88.3 million for the second quarter of 2023, and $21.2 million or 14% year-over-year to $175.6 million for the first half of 2023, primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits, deposit account expense and allocated corporate overhead expenses. 

Other 

Centralized functions, including the corporate treasury activities of the Company and eliminations of inter-segment amounts, have been aggregated and included in the Other segment, which provides broad administrative support to the two core segments, namely the Consumer and Business Banking and the Commercial Banking segments. 

The following tables present additional financial information for the Other segment for the periods indicated:

The Other segment reported segment loss before income taxes of $61.3 million and segment net income of $16.1 million, reflecting an income tax benefit of $77.4 million, for the second quarter of 2023. The decrease in segment loss before income taxes was primarily due to lower net interest loss and higher noninterest income, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. For the first half of 2023, the Other segment reported segment loss before income taxes of $29.4 million and segment net income of $61.9 million, reflecting an income tax benefit of $91.3 million. The decrease in segment loss before income taxes was primarily driven by higher net interest income, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense. The $38.6 million decrease in net interest loss before provision for credit losses for the second quarter of 2023 and $103.1 million increase in net interest income before provision for credit losses for the first half of 2023 were primarily driven by an increase in interest income from investments due to a higher yield on interest-bearing cash and deposits with banks and debt securities. Noninterest income increased $6.9 million for the second quarter of 2023, mainly due to an increase in foreign exchange income, and decreased $8.1 million for the first half of 2023, primarily due to a write-off of an impaired subordinated debt security in the first quarter of 2023. Noninterest expense increased $44.9 million for the second quarter of 2023, and $42.3 million for the first half of 2023, primarily due to higher amortization of tax credits and other investments as a result of tax credit investments closed in the second quarter of 2023. This also contributed to higher income tax benefit in both the second quarter and first half of 2023. 

The income tax expense or benefit in the Other segment consists of the remaining unallocated income tax expense or benefit after allocating income tax expense to the two core segments, and reflects the impact of tax credit investment activity. Income tax expense is allocated to the Consumer and Business Banking and the Commercial Banking segments by applying statutory income tax rates to the segment income before income taxes. Tax credit investment amortization is allocated to the Other segment. 

Balance Sheet Analysis 

Debt Securities 

The Company maintains a portfolio of high quality and liquid debt securities with a moderate duration profile. It closely manages the overall portfolio credit, interest rate and liquidity risks. The Company&#8217;s debt securities provide: 

&#8226; interest income for earnings and yield enhancement; 

&#8226; funding availability for needs arising during the normal course of business; 

&#8226; the ability to execute interest rate risk management strategies in response to changes in economic or market conditions; and 

&#8226; collateral to support pledging agreements as required and/or to enhance the Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity. 

While the Company does not intend to sell its debt securities, it may sell AFS securities in response to changes in the balance sheet and related interest rate risk to meet liquidity, regulatory and strategic requirements. 

The following table presents the distribution of the Company&#8217;s AFS and HTM debt securities portfolio as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and by credit ratings as of June 30, 2023:

(1) Credit ratings express opinions about the credit quality of a debt security. The Company determines the credit rating of a security according to the lowest credit rating made available by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (&#8220;NRSROs&#8221;). Debt securities rated investment grade, which are those with ratings similar to BBB- or above (as defined by NRSROs), are generally considered by the rating agencies and market participants to be low credit risk. Ratings percentages are allocated based on fair value. 

(2) For debt securities not rated by NRSROs, the Company uses other factors which include but are not limited to the priority in collections within the securitization structure, and whether the contractual payments have historically been on time. 

As of June 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s AFS and HTM debt securities portfolios had an effective duration (defined as the sensitivity of the value of the portfolio to interest rate changes) of 3.9 and 7.7, respectively, compared with 4.1 and 8.0, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. The modest decreases in both the AFS and HTM effective durations were due to the reduction in variation of optionality under the current interest rate environment. 

Available-for-Sale Debt Securities 

The fair value of the AFS debt securities portfolio totaled $5.99 billion as of June 30, 2023, a decrease of $47.7 million or 1% from $6.03 billion as of December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to maturities and paydowns, partially offset by purchases of U.S. Treasury securities. The Company&#8217;s AFS debt securities are carried at fair value with noncredit-related unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in Other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Pre-tax net unrealized losses on AFS debt securities were $833.3 million as of June 30, 2023, compared with $844.2 million as of December 31, 2022. 

As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 96% and 97%, respectively, of the carrying value of the AFS debt securities portfolio was rated investment grade by NRSROs. Of the AFS debt securities with gross unrealized losses, substantially all were rated investment grade as of both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. There was no allowance for credit losses provided against the AFS debt securities as of each of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Additionally, there were no credit losses recognized in earnings for both the second quarters and first halves of 2023 and 2022. 

Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities 

All HTM debt securities were issued, guaranteed, or supported by the U.S. government or government-sponsored enterprises. Accordingly, the Company applied a zero credit loss assumption for these securities and no allowance for credit loss was recorded as of both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

For additional information on AFS and HTM securities, see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K and Note 3 &#8212; Fair Value Measurement and Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Note 5 &#8212; Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

Loan Portfolio 

The Company offers a broad range of financial products designed to meet the credit needs of its borrowers. The Company&#8217;s loan portfolio segments include commercial loans, which consist of commercial and industrial (&#8220;C&#38;I&#8221;), CRE, multifamily residential, and construction and land loans, as well as consumer loans, which consist of single-family residential, home equity lines of credit (&#8220;HELOCs&#8221;) and other consumer loans. Loans held-for-investment totaled $49.83 billion as of June 30, 2023, an increase of $1.63 billion or 3% from $48.20 billion as of December 31, 2022. This growth was primarily driven by increases of $849.3 million or 4% in total CRE loans and $825.9 million or 6% in total residential mortgage loans. The composition of the loan portfolio as of June 30, 2023 was similar to the composition as of December 31, 2022.

Total C&#38;I loan commitments were $23.91 billion as of June 30, 2023, an increase of $1.13 billion or 5% from $22.78 billion as of December 31, 2022. Total C&#38;I loans were $15.67 billion as of June 30, 2023, a decrease of $41.0 million or 0.3% from $15.71 billion as of December 31, 2022, with a utilization rate of 66% as of June 30, 2023, compared with 69% as of December 31, 2022. Total C&#38;I loans made up 31% and 33% of total loans held-for-investment as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The C&#38;I loan portfolio includes loans and financing for businesses across a wide spectrum of industries. The Company offers a variety of C&#38;I products, including commercial business lending, working capital lines of credit, trade finance, letters of credit, asset-based lending, asset-backed finance, project finance and equipment financing. Additionally, the Company has a portfolio of broadly syndicated C&#38;I loans, which represent revolving or term loan facilities that are marketed and sold primarily to institutional investors. This portfolio totaled $788.6 million and $855.9 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The majority of the C&#38;I loans had variable interest rates as of both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

The C&#38;I portfolio is well-diversified by industry. The Company monitors concentrations within the C&#38;I loan portfolio by industry and customer exposure, and has exposure limits by industry and loan product. The following table presents the industry mix within the Company&#8217;s C&#38;I loan portfolio as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Commercial &#8212; Total Commercial Real Estate Loans. Total CRE loans totaled $19.92 billion as of June 30, 2023, which grew $849.3 million or 4% from $19.07 billion as of December 31, 2022, and accounted for 40% of total loans held-for-investment as of June 30, 2023, compared with 39% as of December 31, 2022. The total CRE portfolio consists of CRE, multifamily residential, and construction and land loans, and affordable housing lending. The increase in total CRE loans was driven by well-diversified growth across our major property types, partially offset by a decrease in office CRE loans. The Company&#8217;s underwriting parameters for CRE loans are established in compliance with supervisory guidance, including: property type, geography and loan-to-value (&#8220;LTV&#8221;). The consistency of the Company&#8217;s low LTV underwriting standards has historically resulted in lower credit losses. 

The Company&#8217;s total CRE loan portfolio is well-diversified by property type with an average CRE loan size of $2.9 million as of June 30, 2023, compared with $2.8 million as of December 31, 2022. The following table summarizes the Company&#8217;s total CRE loans by property type as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022:

The weighted-average LTV ratio of the total CRE loan portfolio was 51% as of both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Weighted average LTV is based on the most recent LTV, which is based on the latest available appraisal and current loan commitment. Approximately 90% of total CRE loans had an LTV ratio of 65% or lower as of both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

As 70% and 71% of total CRE loans were concentrated in California as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, changes in California&#8217;s economy and real estate values could have a significant impact on the collectability of these loans and the required level of allowance for loan losses. For additional information related to the higher degree of risk from a downturn in the California real estate markets, see Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Geopolitical Uncertainties to the Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. 

Commercial &#8212; Commercial Real Estate Loans. The Company focuses on providing financing to experienced real estate investors and developers who have moderate levels of leverage, many of whom are long-time customers of the Bank. CRE loans totaled $14.37 billion as of June 30, 2023, compared with $13.86 billion as of December 31, 2022, and accounted for 29% of total loans held-for-investment as of both dates. Interest rates on CRE loans may be fixed, variable or hybrid. As of June 30, 2023, 63% of our CRE portfolio was variable rate, of which 49% had customer-level interest rate derivative contracts in place. These are hedging contracts offered by the Company to help our customers manage their interest rate risk while the Bank's own exposure remained variable rate. In comparison, as of December 31, 2022, 65% of our CRE portfolio was variable rate, of which 47% had customer-level interest rate derivative contracts in place. Loans are underwritten with conservative standards for cash flows, debt service coverage and LTV. 

Owner-occupied properties comprised 20% of the CRE loans as of both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The remainder were non-owner-occupied properties, where 50% or more of the debt service for the loan is typically provided by rental income from an unaffiliated third party. 

Commercial &#8212; Multifamily Residential Loans. The multifamily residential loan portfolio is largely comprised of loans secured by residential properties with five or more units. Multifamily residential loans totaled $4.76 billion as of June 30, 2023, compared with $4.57 billion as of December 31, 2022, and accounted for 9% of total loans held-for-investment as of both dates. The Company offers a variety of first lien mortgages, including fixed- and variable-rate loans, as well as hybrid loans with interest rates that adjust annually after an initial fixed rate period of three to ten years. As of June 30, 2023, 56% of our multifamily residential loan portfolio was variable rate, of which 37% had customer-level interest rate derivative contracts in place. These are hedging contracts offered by the Company to help our customers manage their interest rate risk while the Bank's own exposure remained variable rate. In comparison, as of December 31, 2022, 57% of our multifamily residential loan portfolio was variable rate, of which 34% had customer-level interest rate derivative contracts in place. 

Commercial &#8212; Construction and Land Loans. Construction and land loans provide financing for a portfolio of projects diversified by real estate property type. Construction and land loans totaled $781.1 million as of June 30, 2023, compared with $638.4 million as of December 31, 2022, and accounted for 2% and 1% of total loans held-for-investment as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Construction loan exposure was made up of $652.5 million in loans outstanding, plus $753.5 million in unfunded commitments as of June 30, 2023, compared with $536.8 million in loans outstanding, plus $611.4 million in unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2022. Land loans totaled $128.6 million as of June 30, 2023, compared with $101.7 million as of December 31, 2022.

Consumer &#8212; Single-Family Residential Loans. Single-family residential loans totaled $12.31 billion or 25% of total loans held-for-investment as of June 30, 2023, compared with $11.22 billion or 23% of total loans held-for-investment as of December 31, 2022. Single-family residential loans increased $1.09 billion or 10% from December 31, 2022, primarily driven by organic growth in mortgages and residential properties in California and New York. The Company was in a first lien position for all of its single-family residential loans as of both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Many of these loans are reduced documentation loans, for which a substantial down payment is required, resulting in a low LTV ratio at origination, typically 65% or less. The weighted-average LTV ratio was 53% as of both dates. These loans have historically experienced low delinquency and loss rates. The Company offers a variety of single-family residential first lien mortgage loan programs, including fixed- and variable-rate loans, as well as hybrid loans with interest rates that adjust on a regular basis, typically annually, after an initial fixed rate period. 

Consumer &#8212; Home Equity Lines of Credit. Total HELOC commitments were $5.39 billion as of June 30, 2023, a decrease of $108.0 million or 2% from $5.50 billion, with a utilization rate of 35% as of June 30, 2023, compared with 39% as of December 31, 2022. A majority of unfunded HELOC commitments are unconditionally cancellable. HELOCs outstanding totaled $1.86 billion or 4% of total loans held-for-investment as of June 30, 2023, compared with $2.12 billion or 5% of total loans held-for-investment as of December 31, 2022. HELOCs outstanding decreased $259.7 million or 12% from December 31, 2022. The Company was in a first lien position for 80% and 83% of total outstanding HELOCs as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The weighted-average LTV ratio was 48% on HELOC commitments as of June 30, 2023, compared with 49% as of December 31, 2022. Weighted-average LTV ratio represents the loan&#8217;s balance divided by the estimated current property value. For junior lien home equity loans, combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien home equity products. Many of these loans are reduced documentation loans, for which a substantial down payment is required, resulting in a low LTV ratio at origination, typically 65% or less. As a result, these loans have historically experienced low delinquency and loss rates. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s HELOCs were variable-rate loans as of both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

All originated commercial and consumer loans are subject to the Company&#8217;s conservative underwriting guidelines and loan origination standards. Management believes that the Company&#8217;s underwriting criteria and procedures adequately consider the unique risks associated with these products. The Company conducts a variety of quality control procedures and periodic audits, including the review of lending and legal requirements, to ensure that the Company is in compliance with these requirements. 

Foreign Outstandings 

The Company&#8217;s overseas offices, which include the branch in Hong Kong and the subsidiary bank in China, are subject to the general risks inherent in conducting business in foreign countries, such as regulatory, economic and political uncertainties. As such, the Company&#8217;s international operation risk exposure is largely concentrated in China and Hong Kong. In addition, the Company&#8217;s financial assets held in the Hong Kong branch and the subsidiary bank in China may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors. The following table presents the major financial assets held in the Company&#8217;s overseas offices as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022:

Capital 

The Company maintains a strong capital base to support its anticipated asset growth, operating needs, and credit risks, and to ensure that the Company and the Bank are in compliance with all regulatory capital guidelines. The Company engages in regular capital planning processes on at least an annual basis to optimize the use of available capital and to appropriately plan for future capital needs, allocating capital to existing and future business activities. Furthermore, the Company conducts capital stress tests as part of its capital planning process. The stress tests enable the Company to assess the impact of adverse changes in the economy and interest rates on its capital base. 

The Company&#8217;s stockholders&#8217; equity was $6.46 billion as of June 30, 2023, an increase of $477.1 million or 8% from $5.98 billion as of December 31, 2022. The increase in the Company&#8217;s stockholders&#8217; equity was primarily due to $634.5 million of net income, partially offset by $137.0 million of common dividends declared. For other factors that contributed to the changes in stockholders&#8217; equity, refer to Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements &#8212; Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders&#8217; Equit y in this Form 10-Q. 

Book value per share was $45.67 as of June 30, 2023, an increase of 8% from $42.46 per share as of December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of the factors described above. Tangible book value per share was $42.33 as of June 30, 2023, compared with $39.10 as of December 31, 2022. For additional details, see the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures presented under Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Form 10-Q. 

The Company paid a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.48 and $0.40 per share during the second quarters of 2023 and 2022, respectively. In July 2023, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors declared third quarter 2023 cash dividend of $0.48 per share. The dividend is payable on August 15, 2023, to stockholders of record as of August 1, 2023. 

Deposits and Other Sources of Funding 

Deposits are the Company&#8217;s primary source of funding, the cost of which has a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s net interest income and net interest margin. Additional funding is provided by short- and long-term borrowings, and long-term debt. See Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Risk Management &#8212; Liquidity Risk Management &#8212; Liquidity in this Form 10-Q for a discussion of the Company&#8217;s liquidity management. The following table summarizes the Company&#8217;s sources of funding as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022:

Deposits 

The Company offers a wide variety of deposit products to consumer and commercial customers. To provide a stable and low-cost source of funding and liquidity, the Company&#8217;s strategy is to grow and retain relationship-based deposits. Total deposits were $55.66 billion as of June 30, 2023, a decrease of $309.1 million or 1% from $55.97 billion as of December 31, 2022. The decrease in deposits was primarily due to a decrease in noninterest-bearing demand accounts, which was partially offset by increases in time deposits and interest-bearing checking. The growth in time deposits and interest-bearing checking reflected customers seeking higher yields in a rising interest rate environment. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits comprised 30% and 38% of total deposits as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

Uninsured deposits represent the portion of deposit accounts in U.S. offices that exceed the FDIC insurance limit. The Company calculates its uninsured deposits based on the methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory reporting. Total uninsured deposit balances reported on Schedule RC-OM item 2 of the Bank&#8217;s Call report were $25.74 billion and $31.04 billion as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

The following table summarizes the Company&#8217;s uninsured deposits information as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, after certain adjustments: 

($ in thousands) June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Uninsured deposits, per regulatory reporting requirements $ 25,738,814 $ 31,036,311 Less: Collateralized deposits (3,866,970) (3,776,344) Affiliate deposits (400,340) (351,181) Uninsured deposits, excluding collateralized and affiliate deposits (a) $ 21,471,504 &#160; $ 26,908,786 &#160; Total domestic deposits (b) $ 53,153,055 &#160; $ 53,225,764 &#160; Uninsured deposits, excluding collateralized and affiliate deposits ratio (a) / (b) 40 &#160; % 51 &#160; % 

Our deposit base is seasoned, stable and well-diversified. We offer our customers an insured cash sweep (&#8220;ICS&#8221;) product that allows customers to insure deposits above FDIC insurance limits. During the first half of 2023, we have seen an increase in the demand for the ICS product by our customers. The Company&#8217;s domestic uninsured deposits, excluding collateralized and affiliate deposits ratio improved to 40% as of June 30, 2023, compared with 51% as of December 31, 2022. Management believes that presenting uninsured deposits excluding collateralized and affiliate deposits provides a more accurate view of the deposits at risk, given that the collateralized deposits are secured, and the affiliate deposits are not customer-facing and eliminate in consolidation. 

Additional information regarding the impact of deposits on net interest income, with a comparison of average deposit balances and rates, is provided in Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Results of Operations &#8212; Net Interest Income in this Form 10-Q. See also the discussion of the impact of deposits on liquidity at Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Liquidity Risk Management &#8212; Liquidity in this Form 10-Q. 

Other Sources of Funding 

The Company had $4.50 billion of short-term borrowings outstanding as of June 30, 2023, consisting of funds borrowed from the BTFP in March 2023. These borrowings were more cost effective than other borrowing sources and have a positive carry as cash placed at the Federal Reserve Bank. There were no short-term borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 10 &#8212; Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for additional information on the BTFP and the Company&#8217;s related borrowings. 

Repurchase agreements were $300.0 million as of December 31, 2022. During the first half of 2023, the Company recorded $3.9 million of charges related to the extinguishment of the $300.0 million of repurchase agreements. For additional details, see Note 4 &#8212; Assets Purchased under Resale Agreements and Sold under Repurchase Agreements to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

The Company uses long-term debt to provide funding to acquire interest-earning assets, and to enhance liquidity and regulatory capital adequacy. Long-term debt consists of junior subordinated debt, which qualifies as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes. Refer to Note 10 &#8212; Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for additional information on the junior subordinated debt. 

Regulatory Capital and Ratios 

The federal banking agencies have risk-based capital adequacy requirements intended to ensure that banking organizations maintain capital that is commensurate with the degree of risk associated with their operations. The Company and the Bank are each subject to these regulatory capital adequacy requirements. See Item 1. Business &#8212; Supervision and Regulation &#8212; Regulatory Capital Requirements and Regulatory Capital-Related Development in the Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for additional details. 

The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, which requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses to be based on management&#8217;s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Company&#8217;s relevant financial assets. The Company has elected the phase-in option provided by a final rule that delays an estimate of the current expected credit losses (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) effect on regulatory capital for two years and phases in the impact over three years. The rule permits certain banking organizations to exclude from regulatory capital the initial adoption impact of CECL, plus 25% of the cumulative changes in the allowance for credit losses under CECL for each period until December 31, 2021, followed by a three-year phase-out period in which the aggregate benefit is reduced by 25% in 2022, 50% in 2023 and 75% in 2024. Accordingly, our capital ratios as of June 30, 2023 reflect a delay of 50% of the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s capital ratios as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 under the Basel III Capital Rules, and those required by regulatory agencies for capital adequacy and well-capitalized classification purposes:

The well-capitalized Tier 1 capital ratio requirements for the Company and the Bank are 6.0% and 8.0%, respectively. 

The Company is committed to maintaining strong capital levels to assure its investors, customers and regulators that the Company and the Bank are financially sound. As of both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company and the Bank continued to exceed all &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; capital requirements and the required minimum capital requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules. Total risk-weighted assets were $51.70 billion as of June 30, 2023, an increase of $1.66 billion from $50.04 billion as of December 31, 2022. The increase in the risk-weighted assets was primarily due to residential mortgage and CRE loan growth. 

Risk Management 

Overview 

In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent to the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to the Company&#8217;s business. The Company operates under a Board-approved enterprise risk management (&#8220;ERM&#8221;) framework, which outlines the company-wide approach to risk management and oversight, and describes the structures and practices employed to manage the current and emerging risks inherent to the Company. The Company&#8217;s ERM program incorporates risk management throughout the organization in identifying, managing, monitoring, and reporting risks. It identifies the Company&#8217;s major risk categories as: credit, liquidity, capital, market, operational, compliance, legal, strategic, technology and reputational. 

The Risk Oversight Committee of the Board of Directors monitors the ERM program through identified risk categories and provides oversight of the Company&#8217;s risk appetite and control environment. The Risk Oversight Committee provides focused oversight of the Company&#8217;s identified enterprise risk categories on behalf of the full Board of Directors. Under the direction of the Risk Oversight Committee, management committees apply targeted strategies to manage and reduce the risks to which the Company&#8217;s operations are exposed. 

The Company&#8217;s ERM program is executed along the three lines of defense model, which provides for a consistent and standardized risk management control environment across the enterprise. The first line of defense is comprised of production, operational and support units. The second line of defense is comprised of various risk management and control functions charged with monitoring and managing specific major risk categories and/or risk subcategories. The third line of defense is comprised of the Internal Audit function and Independent Asset Review (&#8220;IAR&#8221;). Internal Audit and IAR provide assurance and evaluate the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes as established by the Company. Reporting directly to the Board&#8217;s Audit Committee, Internal Audit maintains organizational independence and objectivity. Further discussion and analysis of certain primary risk areas are detailed in the following subsections of Risk Management. 

Credit Risk Management 

Credit risk is the risk that a borrower or a counterparty will fail to perform according to the terms and conditions of a loan or investment and expose the Company to loss. Credit risk exists with many of the Company&#8217;s assets and exposures such as loans, debt securities and certain derivatives. The majority of the Company&#8217;s credit risk is associated with lending activities. 

The Risk Oversight Committee has primary oversight responsibility for identified enterprise risk categories including credit risk. The Risk Oversight Committee monitors management&#8217;s assessment of asset quality, credit risk trends, credit quality administration, underwriting standards, and portfolio credit risk management strategies and processes, such as diversification and concentration limits, all of which enable management to control credit risk. At the management level, the Credit Risk Management Committee has primary oversight responsibility for credit risk. The Senior Credit Supervision function manages credit policy for the line of business transactional credit risk, assuring that all exposure is risk-rated according to the requirements of the credit risk rating policy. The Senior Credit Supervision function evaluates and reports the overall credit risk exposure to senior management and the Risk Oversight Committee. Reporting directly to the Board&#8217;s Risk Oversight Committee, the IAR function provides additional support to the Company&#8217;s strong credit risk management culture by providing an independent and objective assessment of underwriting and documentation quality. A key focus of our credit risk management is adherence to a well-controlled underwriting and audit monitoring process. 

The Company assesses the overall credit quality performance of the loans held-for-investment portfolio through an integrated analysis of specific performance ratios. This approach forms the basis of the discussion in the sections immediately following: Credit Quality, Nonperforming Assets and Allowance for Credit Losses. 

Credit Quality 

The Company utilizes a credit risk rating system to assist in monitoring credit quality. Loans are evaluated using the Company&#8217;s internal credit risk rating of 1 through 10. For more information on the Company&#8217;s credit quality indicators and internal credit risk ratings, refer to Note 7 &#8212; Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets are comprised of nonaccrual loans, other real estate owned (&#8220;OREO&#8221;) and other nonperforming assets. Other nonperforming assets and OREO are repossessed assets and properties, respectively, acquired through foreclosure, or through full or partial satisfaction of loans held-for-investment. Nonperforming assets were $115.5 million or 0.17% of total assets as of June 30, 2023, an increase of $15.7 million or 16%, compared with $99.8 million or 0.16% of total assets as of December 31, 2022.

Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due or when the full collection of principal or interest becomes uncertain regardless of the length of past due status. Collectability is generally assessed based on economic and business conditions, the borrower&#8217;s financial condition, and the adequacy of collateral, if any. For additional details regarding the Company&#8217;s nonaccrual loan policy, see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Loans Held-for-Investment to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. 

Nonaccrual loans were $115.5 million as of June 30, 2023, an increase of $16.0 million or 16% from $99.5 million as of December 31, 2022. This increase was predominantly due to an increase in commercial nonaccrual loans, partially offset by charge-offs of commercial loans. As of June 30, 2023, $68.1 million or 59% of nonaccrual loans were less than 90 days delinquent. In comparison, $68.3 million or 69% of nonaccrual loans were less than 90 days delinquent as of December 31, 2022.

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The Company maintains the allowance for credit losses at a level sufficient to provide appropriate reserves to absorb estimated future credit losses in accordance with GAAP. For additional information on the policies, methodologies and judgments used to determine the allowance for credit losses, see Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Critical Accounting Estimates and Item 8. Financial Statements &#8212; Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K, and Note 7 &#8212; Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.

Second quarter of 2023 net charge-offs were $7.5 million, or annualized 0.06% of average loans held-for-investment, compared with net recoveries of $6.6 million, or annualized 0.06% of average loans held-for-investment for the second quarter of 2022. First half of 2023 net charge-offs were $8.1 million or annualized 0.03% of average loans held-for-investment, compared with $1.7 million or annualized 0.01% of average loans held-for-investment for the first half of 2022. The increase in net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2023 was primarily driven by higher losses in our C&#38;I portfolio. The increase in net charge-offs in the first half of 2023 was primarily driven by lower recoveries in our C&#38;I portfolio. 

Liquidity Risk Management 

Liquidity 

Liquidity risk arises from the Company&#8217;s inability to meet its customer deposit withdrawals and obligations to other counterparties as they come due, or to obtain adequate funding at a reasonable cost to meet those obligations. Liquidity risk also considers the stability of deposits. The objective of liquidity management is to manage the potential mismatch of asset and liability cash flows. Maintaining an adequate level of liquidity depends on the institution&#8217;s ability to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected cash flow and collateral needs without adversely affecting daily operations or the financial condition of the institution. To achieve this objective, the Company analyzes its liquidity risk, maintains readily available liquid assets, and utilizes diverse funding sources including its stable core deposit base. 

The Board of Directors&#8217; Risk Oversight Committee has primary oversight responsibility over liquidity risk management. At the management level, the Company&#8217;s Asset/Liability Committee (&#8220;ALCO&#8221;) establishes the liquidity guidelines that govern the day-to-day active management of the Company&#8217;s liquidity position by requiring sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. These guidelines are established and monitored for both the Bank and East West on a stand-alone basis to ensure that the Company can serve as a source of strength for its subsidiaries. The ALCO regularly monitors the Company&#8217;s liquidity status and related management processes, and provides regular reports to the Board of Directors. The Company&#8217;s liquidity management practices have been effective under normal operating and stressed market conditions. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Liquidity Sources. The Company&#8217;s primary source of funding is from deposits generated by its banking business, which we believe is a relatively stable and low-cost source of funding. Our loans are funded by deposits, which amounted to $55.66 billion as of June 30, 2023, compared with $55.97 billion as of December 31, 2022. The Company&#8217;s loan-to-deposit ratio was 90% as of June 30, 2023, compared with 86% as of December 31, 2022. 

In addition to deposits, the Company has access to various sources of wholesale financing, including borrowing capacity with the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (&#8220;FRBSF&#8221;), such as under the BTFP, unsecured federal funds lines of credit with various correspondent banks, and several master repurchase agreements with major brokerage companies to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio, meet daily cash demands and allow management flexibility to execute its business strategy. However, general financial market and economic conditions could impact our access and cost of external funding. Additionally, the Company&#8217;s access to capital markets is affected by the ratings received from various credit rating agencies. 

Unencumbered loans and/or debt securities were pledged to the FHLB, the FRBSF discount window, and the FRBSF BTFP as collateral. The Company has established operational procedures to enable borrowing against these assets, including regular monitoring of the total pool of loans and debt securities eligible as collateral. Eligibility of collateral is defined in guidelines from the FHLB and FRBSF and is subject to change at their discretion. See Item 2 &#8212; MD&#38;A &#8212; Balance Sheet Analysis &#8212; Deposits and Other Sources of Funding in this Form 10-Q for further details related to the Company&#8217;s funding sources. The Company believes its cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity described below provide sufficient liquidity above its expected cash needs. 

The Company maintains its source of liquidity in the form of cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity with its eligible loans and debt securities as collateral. The following table presents the Company&#8217;s total cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022: 

Change ($ in thousands) June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 $ % Cash and cash equivalents $ 6,377,887 $ 3,481,784 $ 2,896,103 83 % Interest-bearing deposits with banks 17,169 139,021 (121,852) (88) % Borrowing capacity: FHLB 12,846,387 12,773,996 72,391 1 % FRBSF 8,370,223 2,049,048 6,321,175 308 % Unpledged available securities 1,611,319 6,939,591 (5,328,272) (77) % Federal funds facility 941,000 1,136,000 (195,000) (17) % Total $ 30,163,985 &#160; $ 26,519,440 &#160; $ 3,644,545 &#160; 14 &#160; % 

The Company&#8217;s total cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity totaled $30.16 billion as of June 30, 2023, compared with $26.52 billion as of December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily related to an increase in collateral available at the FRBSF and an increase in cash and cash equivalents, which was funded by borrowings from the BTFP in the first quarter of 2023. The BTFP was secured by pledged securities. The BTFP borrowings reflected the Company&#8217;s conservative liquidity management practices and were a cautionary measure in response to the volatility in the banking industry earlier in the year. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Cash Requirements. In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters contractual obligations that require future cash payments, including funding for customer deposit withdrawals, repayments for short- and long-term borrowings, and other cash commitments. For additional information on these obligations, see Note 9 &#8212; Deposits to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K, and Note 4 &#8212; Assets Purchased under Resale Agreements and Sold under Repurchase Agreements, Note 8 &#8212; Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Partnerships, Tax Credit and Other Investments, Net and Variable Interest Entities and Note 10 &#8212; Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

The Company also has off-balance sheet arrangements which represent transactions that are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company&#8217;s off-balance sheet arrangements include (1) commitments to extend credit, such as loan commitments, commercial letters of credit for foreign and domestic trade, standby letters of credit (&#8220;SBLCs&#8221;), and financial guarantees, to meet the financing needs of its customers, (2) future interest obligations related to customer deposits and the Company&#8217;s borrowings, and (3) transactions with unconsolidated entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company, or engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the Company. Because many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future funding requirements. The Company does not expect the total commitment amounts as of June 30, 2023 to have a material current or future impact on the Company&#8217;s financial conditions or results of operations. Information about the Company&#8217;s loan commitments, commercial letters of credit and SBLCs is provided in Note 11 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows summarizes the Company&#8217;s sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. Excess cash generated by operating and investing activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Liquidity for East West. In addition to bank level liquidity management, the Company manages liquidity at the parent company level for various operating needs including payment of dividends, repurchases of common stock, principal and interest payments on its borrowings, acquisitions and additional investments in its subsidiaries. East West&#8217;s primary source of liquidity is from cash dividends distributed by its subsidiary, East West Bank. The Bank is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends as discussed in Item 1 . Business &#8212; Supervision and Regulation &#8212; Dividends and Other Transfers of Funds in the Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. East West held $253.9 million and $228.5 million in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Management believes that East West has sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet the projected cash obligations for the coming year. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Liquidity Stress Testing. The Company utilizes liquidity stress analysis to determine the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the Company, foreign subsidiary and foreign branch to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. Scenario analyses include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources, market triggers, potential uses of funding and economic conditions in certain countries. In addition, Company-specific events are incorporated into the stress testing. For example, based on the Company&#8217;s analysis of the banking industry disruption in the first half of 2023, deposit runoffs were assumed to be more front-loaded to trigger earlier remediation actions. Liquidity stress tests are conducted to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons, both immediate and longer term, and over a variety of stressed conditions. Given the range of potential stresses, the Company maintains contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for individual entities. 

As of June 30, 2023, the Company believes it has adequate liquidity resources to conduct operations and meet other needs in the ordinary course of business, and is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its liquidity, capital resources or operations. Given the uncertain and rapidly changing market and economic conditions, the Company will continue to actively evaluate the impact on its business and financial position. For more details on how economic conditions may impact our liquidity, see Item 1A . Risk Factors in the Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. 

Market Risk Management 

Market risk refers to the risk of potential loss due to adverse movements in market risk factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and credit spreads. The Company is primarily exposed to interest rate risk through its core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits. There have been no significant changes in our risk management practices as described in Item 7 . MD&#38;A &#8212; Market Risk Management in the Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. 

Interest Rate Risk Management 

Interest rate risk is the risk that market fluctuations in interest rates can have a negative impact on the Company&#8217;s earnings and capital stemming from mismatches in the Company&#8217;s asset and liability cash flows primarily arising from customer-related activities such as lending and deposit-taking. The Company is subject to interest rate risk because: 

&#8226; Assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times. If assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest rates are generally rising, earnings will initially increase; 

&#8226; Assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts; 

&#8226; Short- and long-term market interest rates may change by different amounts. For example, the shape of the yield curve may affect the yield of new loans and funding costs differently; 

&#8226; The remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For example, if long-term mortgage interest rates increase sharply, mortgage-related products may pay down at a slower rate than anticipated, which could impact portfolio income and valuation; or 

&#8226; Interest rates may have a direct or indirect effect on loan demand, collateral values, mortgage origination volume, and the fair value of other financial instruments. 

The ALCO coordinates the overall management of the Company&#8217;s interest rate risk, meets regularly to review the Company&#8217;s open market positions and establishes policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk. Interest rate risk management is carried out primarily through strategies involving the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio, debt securities portfolio, available funding channels and capital market activities. In addition, the Company&#8217;s policies permit the use of derivative instruments to assist in managing interest rate risk. 

Interest rate risk exposure is measured and monitored through various risk management tools, which include a simulation model that performs interest rate sensitivity analyses under multiple interest rate scenarios against a baseline. The simulation model incorporates the market&#8217;s forward rate expectations and the Company&#8217;s earning assets and liabilities. The net interest income simulation model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of the Company&#8217;s interest rate sensitive assets, liabilities, and related derivative contracts. It also incorporates various assumptions, which management believes to be reasonable but may have a significant impact on the results. 

Simulation results are highly dependent on input assumptions. To the extent the actual behavior is different from the assumptions used in the models, there could be material changes in interest rate sensitivity results. The assumptions applied in the model are documented, supported, and periodically back-tested to assess the reasonableness and effectiveness. For a more detailed discussion of the Company&#8217;s interest income simulation model, refer to Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Market Risk Management in the Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. 

The Federal Reserve continued its aggressive response to inflation by incrementally raising the target range for the fed funds rate during the first half of 2023. On July 26, 2023 the Federal Reserve raised the target rate range to 5.25% to 5.50%. 

Twelve-Month Net Interest Income Simulation 

Net interest income simulation modeling measures interest rate risk through earnings volatility. The simulation projects the cash flow changes in interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities, expressed in terms of net interest income, over a specified time horizon for defined interest rate scenarios. Net interest income simulations provide insight into the impact of market rate changes on earnings, which help guide risk management decisions. The Company assesses interest rate risk by comparing the changes of net interest income in different interest rate scenarios. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s net interest income sensitivity related to an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates by 100 and 200 bps as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, based on a static balance sheet as of the date of the analysis.

Change in Interest Rates (in bps) June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 +200 3.9 % 11.6 % +100 2.3 % 5.9 % -100 (3.0) % (5.3) % -200 (6.3) % (8.6) % 

(1) The percentage change represents net interest income change over a 12-month period in a stable interest rate environment versus in the various interest rate scenarios. 

The composition of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to a mismatch of repricing behavior between the floating-rate loan portfolio and deposit products. In the table above, net interest income volatility expressed in relation to base-case net interest income decreased as of June 30, 2023. This decrease reflected updates to the deposit repricing assumptions and deposit product mix. Noninterest-bearing deposit account balances are assumed to be sensitive to interest rate levels and migrate to interest-bearing deposit accounts. 

The Company also models scenarios based on gradual shifts in interest rates and assesses the corresponding impacts. These interest rate scenarios provide additional information to estimate the Company&#8217;s underlying interest rate risk. The rate ramp table below shows the net interest income volatility under a gradual non-parallel shift of the yield curve, in even monthly increments over the first 12 months, followed by rates held constant thereafter based on a flat balance sheet as of the date of the analysis. 

Net Interest Income Volatility Change in Interest Rates (in bps) June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 +200 Rate Ramp 1.7 % 6.3 % +100 Rate Ramp 0.9 % 3.4 % -100 Rate Ramp (1.1) % (2.4) % -200 Rate Ramp (2.3) % (4.9) % 

As of June 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s net interest income profile reflects an asset sensitive position, where assets reprice more than liabilities. Net interest income is expected to increase when interest rates rise as the Company has a large population of variable rate loans, primarily tied to Prime and Term SOFR indices. The Company&#8217;s interest income is sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates. As of June 30, 2023, the Company designated interest rate contracts with a notional amount of $5.25 billion as cash flow hedges, which reduced net interest income volatility by approximately 1.6% of the base net interest income for every 100 bps change in interest rate . The Company&#8217;s deposit portfolio is primarily composed of non-maturity deposits, which are not directly tied to short-term interest rate indices, but are, nevertheless, sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates. The modeled results are highly sensitive to deposit durations, beta, deposit mix and other behavioral assumptions, which were derived using a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches. Actual results may deviate from the model results in terms of net interest income due to earning asset growth variation and deposit mix changes based on customer preferences relative to the interest rate environment. During a period of declining interest rates, balance sheet growth could offset headwinds to net interest income from yield compression. 

Economic Value of Equity at Risk 

Economic value of equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;) is a cash flow calculation that takes the present value of all asset cash flows and subtracts the present value of all liability cash flows. This calculation is used for asset/liability management and measures changes in the economic value of the bank. 

The economic value approach provides a comparatively broader scope than the net interest income volatility approach since it represents the discounted present value of cash flows over the expected life of the instruments. Due to this longer horizon, EVE is useful to identify risks arising from repricing, prepayment and maturity gaps between assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, as well as from off-balance sheet derivative exposure, over their lifetime. This long-term economic perspective into the Company&#8217;s interest rate risk profile allows the Company to identify anticipated negative effects of interest rate fluctuations. However, the difference in time horizons can cause the EVE analysis to diverge from the shorter term net interest income analysis presented above. Given the uncertainty of the magnitude, timing and direction of future interest rate movements, the shape of the yield curve, and potential changes to the balance sheet, actual results may vary from those predicted by the Company&#8217;s model. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s EVE sensitivity related to an instantaneous non-parallel shift in market interest rates by 100 and 200 bps as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022: 

EVE Volatility (1) 

Change in Interest Rates (in bps) June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 +200 (8.1) % (6.0) % +100 (3.5) % (2.9) % -100 1.5 % 1.1 % -200 3.0 % 2.3 % 

(1) The percentage change represents net portfolio value change of the Company in a stable interest rate environment versus in the various interest rate scenarios. 

As of June 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s EVE is expected to decrease when interest rates rise. The change in EVE sensitivity was primarily due to updated deposit modeling assumptions, which decreased the duration of the non-maturity deposit portfolio. 

Derivatives 

It is the Company&#8217;s policy not to speculate on the future direction of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. However, the Company periodically enters into derivative transactions in order to manage its exposure to market risk, primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The Company believes these derivative transactions, when properly structured and managed, provide a hedge against inherent risk in certain assets and liabilities or against risk in specific transactions. Hedging transactions may be implemented using a variety of derivative instruments such as swaps, forwards, options, and collars. The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in interest received on certain floating-rate commercial loans and interest paid on certain floating-rate borrowings. Foreign exchange derivatives are used in net investment hedging strategies to mitigate the risk of changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of a designated monetary amount of the Company&#8217;s net investment in East West Bank (China) Limited. Prior to entering into any accounting hedge activities, the Company analyzes the costs and benefits of the hedge in comparison to alternative strategies. The Company also repositions its hedging derivatives portfolio based on the current assessment of economic and financial conditions, including the interest rate and foreign currency environments, balance sheet composition and trends, and the relative mix of its cash and derivative positions. 

In addition, the Company enters into derivative transactions in order to accommodate its customers with their business needs or to assist customers with their risk management objectives, such as managing exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodity prices. To economically hedge against the derivative contracts entered into with the Company&#8217;s customers, the Company enters into offsetting derivative contracts with third-party financial institutions, some of which are cleared through central clearing organizations. The exposures from derivative transactions are collateralized by cash and/or eligible securities based on limits as set forth in the respective agreements between the Company and counterparty financial institutions. The changes in fair values of the derivative contracts traded with third-party financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the derivative transactions executed with customers throughout the terms of these contracts, except for the credit valuation adjustment component in the contracts and the spread variances between the customer derivatives and the offsetting financial counterparty positions. The Company also utilizes foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to mitigate the economic effect of fluctuations in certain foreign currency on-balance sheet assets and liabilities, primarily foreign currency denominated deposits offered to its customers. 

The Company is subject to credit risk associated with the counterparties to the derivative contracts. This counterparty credit risk is a multi-dimensional form of risk, affected by both the exposure and credit quality of the counterparty, both of which are sensitive to market-induced changes. The Company&#8217;s Credit Risk Management Committee provides oversight of credit risk and the Company has guidelines in place to manage counterparty concentration, tenor limits, and collateral. The Company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties, by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements, and by requiring collateral arrangements, where possible. The Company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to institutional third-parties through the use of credit risk participation agreements. Certain derivative contracts are required to be cleared through central clearinghouses, to further mitigate counterparty credit risk, where variation margin is applied daily as settlement to the fair value of the derivative contracts. In addition, the Company incorporates credit value adjustments and other market standard methodologies to appropriately reflect the counterparty&#8217;s and the Company&#8217;s own nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement of its derivatives. As of June 30, 2023, the Company anticipates performance by its counterparties and has not incurred any related credit losses. 

The following table summarizes certain information on derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges and utilized by the Company in its management of interest rate and foreign currency risk as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022:

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The Company&#8217;s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. Certain of these policies include critical accounting estimates, which are subject to valuation assumptions, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and it is likely that materially different amounts could be reported under different assumptions and conditions. The Company has procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. The following accounting policies are critical to the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements: 

&#8226; allowance for credit losses; 

&#8226; fair value estimates; 

&#8226; goodwill impairment; and 

&#8226; income taxes. 

For additional information on the Company&#8217;s critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments, see Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Critical Accounting Estimates in the Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. 

Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

To supplement the Company&#8217;s unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company uses certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with, or as an alternative to U.S. GAAP. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company&#8217;s performance that either excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have such an effect, that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable financial measure that is calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this Form 10-Q are return on average TCE, adjusted efficiency ratio, and tangible book value per share. Certain additional non-GAAP financial measures that are components of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures are also set forth and reconciled in the table below. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance, and allow comparability to prior periods. These non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. 

The following tables present the reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for the periods presented:
