Overview 

The following discussion provides information about the results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources of East West Bancorp, Inc. (referred to herein on an unconsolidated basis as &#8220;East West&#8221; and on a consolidated basis as the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we&#8221; or &#8220;EWBC&#8221;) and its subsidiaries, including its subsidiary bank, East West Bank and its subsidiaries (referred to herein as &#8220;East West Bank&#8221; or the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). This information is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this report, and the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) on February 27, 2023 (the &#8220;Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K&#8221;).

Current Developments 

Economic Developments 

In response to the recent volatility in the banking industry, the U.S. government intervened to maintain financial stability by implementing a &#8220;systemic risk exception&#8221; which allowed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) to protect all the depositors of certain failed banks, while the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;) created a new lending facility to mitigate liquidity pressures on the banking system. Although the broader banking system remains well capitalized, the market value of U.S. Treasury and government-backed mortgage securities held by banks continues to decline due to rising interest rates. Meanwhile, inflationary concerns continue to drive higher interest rates and weigh on the economy. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s monetary policy has included multiple interest rate hikes that have slowed the pace of inflation. Despite the slowdown in inflation, the Federal Reserve has indicated that additional measures are necessary to bring inflation in line with its 2% annual target. The combination of higher interest rates, depressed global equity prices, elevated market volatility and a slowdown in global economies has led to concerns of a potential recession. The Company continues to monitor the economy and its effects on the Company&#8217;s business, customers, employees, communities and markets. 

Further discussion of the potential impacts on the Company&#8217;s business due to interest rate hikes have been provided in Item 1A. &#8212; Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Financial Matters in the Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. 

LIBOR Transition 

London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;), a benchmark rate that has historically been widely referenced, will no longer be published after June 30, 2023. On January 1, 2022, the Company ceased offering new loans or loan renewals based on LIBOR, and began offering loans based on alternative reference rates (&#8220;ARRs&#8221;) such as Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) and the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index. A significant majority of the Company&#8217;s LIBOR exposure, predominantly comprised of commercial loans and derivative contracts have been remediated (i.e., amended to reference an ARR either before or immediately after June 2023) or already contains appropriate fallback provisions to transition to an ARR. The remaining LIBOR exposure represents a small minority of the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities. The Company will leverage the appropriate contractual and statutory provisions, including the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act and other relevant legislation, to transition any remaining LIBOR-based product exposures maturing after June 2023 to the appropriate benchmark replacement rates. The Company&#8217;s LIBOR transition is anticipated to continue through June 30, 2023. 

For additional information related to the potential impact surrounding the transition from LIBOR on the Company&#8217;s business, see item 1A. Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Financial Matters in the Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. For additional background information on the LIBOR transition, see Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) &#8212; Overview in the Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. 

Potential Regulatory Reforms in Response to Recent Bank Failures 

The recent failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Santa Clara, California, and Signature Bank, New York, New York, in March 2023, and First Republic Bank, San Francisco, California, in May 2023, may lead to regulatory changes and initiatives that could impact the Company. For example, the FDIC has stated that it plans to impose a special deposit insurance assessment on banks in order to recover losses that the FDIC&#8217;s Deposit Insurance Fund incurs in the receivership of these institutions. Changes in the financial services industry, including an increase in uninsured deposits and technological advances, have also prompted the FDIC to explore options and potential reforms to the deposit insurance system. Additionally, in response to these bank failures, President Biden has encouraged the federal banking agencies to adopt various reforms, including establishing more stringent capital and liquidity rules and other enhanced prudential standards for banking organizations with $100 billion or more in assets and completing an incentive compensation rule for bank executives pursuant to Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act. On April 28, 2023, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC issued reports on the potential causes of failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, respectively. Among the changes discussed, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC highlighted potential changes needed to supervisory approaches for banks of all sizes as well as to regulatory requirements. Currently, it is unclear what actions federal regulatory agencies will take as a result of these failures. 

Small Business Lending Data Collection Rule 

On March 30, 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalized a rule under section 1071 of the Dodd-Frank Act requiring lenders to collect and report data regarding small business lending activity. The Company is evaluating the impact of the new rule. 

Bank Term Funding Program 

In March 2023, the Federal Reserve announced the creation of the Bank Term Funding Program (&#8220;BTFP&#8221;), which was designed to make additional funding available to eligible depository institutions by allowing them to receive short-term advances backed by collateral pledged at par value. See Note 10 &#8212; Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Balance Sheet Analysis &#8212; Deposits and Other Sources of Funding &#8212; Other Sources of Funding in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this &#8220;Form 10-Q&#8221;) for additional information related to the Company&#8217;s borrowings from the BTFP.

(2) Efficiency ratio is calculated as noninterest expense divided by total revenue . 

The Company&#8217;s first quarter 2023 net income was $322.4 million, an increase of $84.8 million or 36%, compared with first quarter 2022 net income of $237.7 million. The increase was primarily due to higher net interest income, partially offset by higher income tax and noninterest expense and lower noninterest income. Noteworthy items about the Company&#8217;s first quarter 2023 performance included: 

&#8226; Net interest income growth and net interest margin expansion. First quarter 2023 net interest income before provision for credit losses was $599.9 million, an increase of $184.2 million or 44% from the first quarter of 2022. First quarter 2023 net interest margin of 3.96%, expanded by 109 basis points (&#8220;bps&#8221;), compared with the first quarter of 2022. 

&#8226; Expanding profitability. First quarter 2023 ROA, ROE and the return on average TCE of 2.01%, 21.15% and 22.94%, respectively, all expanded year-over-year by 45 bps, 465 bps and 494 bps, respectively. Return on average TCE is a non-GAAP financial measure. For additional details, see the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures presented under Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Form 10-Q. 

&#8226; Improved efficiency. Efficiency ratio of 33.11% and adjusted efficiency ratio of 30.46% for the first quarter of 2023 both improved year-over-year. Adjusted efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure. For additional details, see the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures presented under Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Form 10-Q. 

&#8226; Asset growth. Total assets reached $67.24 billion, growing $3.13 billion or 5% from December 31, 2022, primarily driven by the $2.45 billion or 70% increase in cash and cash equivalents. This increase in on-balance sheet liquidity was in response to the recent volatility in the banking industry and reflects the Company&#8217;s conservative liquidity management practices. The increase in cash and cash equivalent was primarily funded with borrowings from the BTFP totaling $4.50 billion as of March 31, 2023. 

&#8226; Loan growth. Total loans were $48.92 billion as of March 31, 2023, an increase of $696.8 million or 1% from $48.23 billion as of December 31, 2022. This was primarily driven by growth in the residential mortgage and commercial real estate (&#8220;CRE&#8221;) loan segments. 

&#8226; Strong capital levels. Stockholders&#8217; equity was $6.31 billion or $44.62 per share as of March 31, 2023, both up 5% from $5.98 billion or $42.46 per share as of December 31, 2022. Tangible book value per share of $41.28 as of March 31, 2023, increased by $2.18 or 6% from $39.10 as of December 31, 2022. Tangible book value per share is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income 

The Company&#8217;s primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the interest income earned on interest-earning assets less interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average interest-earning assets. Net interest income and net interest margin are impacted by several factors, including changes in average balances and the composition of interest-earning assets and funding sources, market interest rate fluctuations and the slope of the yield curve, repricing characteristics and maturity of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the volume of noninterest-bearing sources of funds, and asset quality. 

First quarter 2023 net interest income before provision for credit losses was $599.9 million, an increase of $184.2 million or 44%, compared with $415.6 million for the first quarter of 2022. First quarter 2023 net interest margin was 3.96%, an increase of 109 bps from 2.87% for the first quarter of 2022. The increases in net interest income and net interest margin primarily reflected higher interest-earning asset yields and strong loan growth, partially offset by a higher average cost of deposits. The changes in yields and rates reflected rising benchmark interest rates. 

Average interest-earning assets were $61.48 billion for the first quarter of 2023, an increase of $2.79 billion or 5% from $58.69 billion for the first quarter of 2022. The increase in average interest-earning assets primarily reflected loan growth, partially offset by decreases in assets purchased under resale agreements (&#8220;resale agreements&#8221;) and interest-bearing cash and deposits with banks. 

The yield on average interest-earning assets for the first quarter of 2023 was 5.51%, an increase of 252 bps from 2.99% for the first quarter of 2022. The year-over-year increase in the yield on average interest-bearing assets primarily resulted from rising benchmark interest rates. 

The average loan yield for the first quarter of 2023 was 6.14%, an increase of 251 bps from 3.63% for the first quarter of 2022. The changes in the average loan yield reflected the loan portfolio&#8217;s sensitivity to rising benchmark interest rates. Approximately 61% and 65% of loans held-for-investment were variable-rate or hybrid loans in their adjustable-rate period a s of March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Deposits are an important source of funds and impact both net interest income and net interest margin. Average deposits were $54.95 billion for the first quarter of 2023, an increase of $928.6 million or 2% from $54.03 billion for the first quarter of 2022. Average noninterest-bearing deposits were $19.71 billion for the first quarter of 2023, a decrease of $3.72 billion or 16% from $23.43 billion for the first quarter of 2022. Average noninterest-bearing deposits made up 36% and 43% of average deposits for the first quarters of 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

The average cost of deposits was 1.60% for the first quarter of 2023, a 150 bps increase from 0.10% for the first quarter of 2022. The increase primarily reflected higher rates paid on time deposits and money market deposits in response to the rising interest rate environment. 

The average cost of funds calculation includes deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) advances, assets sold under repurchase agreements (&#8220;repurchase agreements&#8221;), long-term debt and short-term borrowings. For the first quarter of 2023, the average cost of funds was 1.69%, a 157 bps increase from 0.12% for the first quarter of 2022. The increase in the average cost of funds was primarily driven by the increase in the cost of deposits discussed above. 

The Company utilizes various tools to manage interest rate risk. Refer to the Interest Rate Risk Management section of Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Risk Management &#8212; Market Risk Management in this Form 10-Q.

Noninterest income comprised 9% of total revenue for the first quarter of 2023, compared with 16% for the first quarter of 2022. First quarter 2023 noninterest income was $60.0 million, a decrease of $19.8 million or 25%, compared with $79.7 million for the same period in 2022. This decrease was primarily due to net realized losses on AFS debt securities and a decrease in interest rate contracts and other derivative income. 

The $10.0 million net realized losses on AFS debt securities was due to the write-off of an impaired subordinated debt security during the first quarter of 2023. Net realized gains on AFS debt securities was $1.3 million during the first quarter of 2022. 

Interest rate contracts and other derivative income was $2.6 million for the first quarter of 2023, a decrease of $8.6 million or 77%, compared with $11.1 million for the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable credit valuation adjustments during the first quarter of 2023, partially offset by an increase in transaction volume.

$ 218,447 &#160; $ 189,450 &#160; $ 28,997 &#160; 15 &#160; % 

First quarter 2023 noninterest expense was $218.4 million, an increase of $29.0 million or 15%, compared with $189.5 million for the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits, other operating expense, deposit account expense, repurchase agreements&#8217; extinguishment cost and deposit insurance premiums and regulatory assessments, partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of tax credit and other investments. 

Compensation and employee benefits were $129.7 million for the first quarter of 2023, an increase of $13.4 million or 12%, compared with $116.3 million for the same period in 2022. The change was primarily due to staffing growth to support the Company&#8217;s growing business and annual employee merit increases. 

Deposit insurance premiums and regulatory assessments were $7.9 million for the first quarter of 2023, an increase $3.2 million or 68%, compared with $4.7 million for the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to a two bps increase in the base deposit insurance assessment rate under the FDIC&#8217;s Amended Restoration Plan. 

Deposit account expense was $9.6 million for the first quarter of 2023, an increase of $4.9 million or 105%, compared with $4.7 million for the same period in 2022. The change was primarily due to an increase in deposit referral fees which was driven by higher interest rates. 

Other operating expense was $31.0 million for the first quarter of 2023, an increase of $7.6 million or 32%, compared with $23.4 million for the same period in 2022. This increase was primarily due to higher interest expense on cash collateral and corporate expenses. 

Amortization of tax credit and other investments was $10.1 million for the first quarter of 2023, a decrease of $3.8 million or 27%, compared with $13.9 million for the same period in 2022. The year-over-year change was largely due to the timing of investments that closed, which have differing amortization periods. 

During the first quarter of 2023, the Company prepaid $300.0 million of repurchase agreements and incurred debt extinguishment costs of $3.9 million. No such expense was incurred in the same period in 2022. 

Income Taxes

$ 421,392 $ 297,906 41 % Income tax expense $ 98,953 $ 60,254 64 % Effective tax rate 23.5 % 20.2 % 

First quarter 2023 income tax expense was $99.0 million and the effective tax rate was 23.5%, compared with first quarter 2022 income tax expense of $60.3 million and an effective tax rate of 20.2%. The increases in the income tax expense and the effective tax rate primarily reflected a higher level of income in 2023 and the timing of tax credits recognized. 

Operating Segment Results 

The Company organizes its operations into three reportable operating segments: (1) Consumer and Business Banking; (2) Commercial Banking; and (3) Other. These segments are defined by the type of customers served and the related products and services provided. The segments reflect how financial information is currently evaluated by management. For a description of the Company&#8217;s internal management reporting process, including the segment cost allocation methodology, see Note 15 &#8212; Business Segments to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

Segment net interest income represents the difference between actual interest earned on assets and interest incurred on liabilities of the segment, adjusted for funding charges or credits through the Company&#8217;s internal funds transfer pricing (&#8220;FTP&#8221;) process. 

The following table presents the results by operating segment for the periods indicated:

Consumer and Business Banking 

The Consumer and Business Banking segment primarily provides financial products and services to consumer and commercial customers through the Company&#8217;s domestic branch network and digital banking platform. This segment offers consumer and commercial deposits, mortgage and home equity loans, and other products and services. It also originates commercial loans for small- and medium-sized enterprises through the Company&#8217;s branch network. Other products and services provided by this segment include wealth management, treasury management, interest rate risk hedging and foreign exchange services. 

The following table presents additional financial information for the Consumer and Business Banking segment for the periods indicated: 

Three Months Ended March 31, Change from 2022 ($ in thousands) 2023 2022 $ % Net interest income before provision for credit losses $ 304,242 $ 213,214 $ 91,028 43 % Noninterest income 26,002 25,199 803 3 % Total revenue 330,244 238,413 91,831 39 % Provision for credit losses 15,012 3,104 11,908 384 % Noninterest expense 113,823 96,095 17,728 18 % Segment income before income taxes 201,409 139,214 62,195 45 % Income tax expense 59,162 40,050 19,112 48 % Segment net income $ 142,247 $ 99,164 $ 43,083 43 % Average loans $ 17,110,917 $ 14,606,446 $ 2,504,471 17 % Average deposits $ 33,848,051 $ 33,113,820 $ 734,231 2 % 

Consumer and Business Banking segment net income increased $43.1 million or 43%, year-over-year to $142.2 million for the first quarter of 2023. The increase reflected revenue growth, partially offset by higher income tax expense, noninterest expense, and provision for credit losses. Net interest income before provision for credit losses increased $91.0 million or 43%, year-over-year to $304.2 million for the first quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher deposit fund transfer pricing credits due to the year-over-year increase in market rates. Provision for credit losses increased $11.9 million or 384%, year-over-year to $15.0 million, primarily driven by changes to the macroeconomic outlook and residential mortgage loan growth. Noninterest expense increased $17.7 million or 18%, year-over-year to $113.8 million for the first quarter of 2023. The increase primarily reflected higher compensation and employee benefits expense and allocated corporate overhead expenses. 

Commercial Banking 

The Commercial Banking segment primarily generates commercial loan and deposit products. Commercial loan products include CRE lending, construction finance, commercial business lending, working capital lines of credit, trade finance, letters of credit, affordable housing lending, asset-based lending, asset-backed finance, project finance and equipment financing. Commercial deposit products and other financial services include treasury management, foreign exchange services, and interest rate and commodity risk hedging. 

The following table presents additional financial information for the Commercial Banking segment for the periods indicated: 

Three Months Ended March 31, Change from 2022 ($ in thousands) 2023 2022 $ % Net interest income before provision for credit losses $ 236,723 $ 208,077 $ 28,646 14 % Noninterest income 43,599 49,077 (5,478) (11) % Total revenue 280,322 257,154 23,168 9 % Provision for credit losses 4,988 4,896 92 2 % Noninterest expense 87,248 73,395 13,853 19 % Segment income before income taxes 188,086 178,863 9,223 5 % Income tax expense 53,629 51,356 2,273 4 % Segment net income $ 134,457 $ 127,507 $ 6,950 5 % Average loans $ 31,038,920 $ 27,505,972 $ 3,532,948 13 % Average deposits $ 17,282,964 $ 17,736,525 $ (453,561) (3) % 

Commercial Banking segment net income increased $7.0 million or 5%, year-over-year to $134.5 million for the first quarter of 2023, driven by an increase in net interest income, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense and a decrease in noninterest income. Net interest income before provision for credit losses increased $28.6 million or 14%, year-over-year to $236.7 million for the first quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher loan interest income from commercial loan growth and higher deposit fund transfer pricing credits due to the year-over-year increase in market rates. Noninterest income decreased $5.5 million or 11%, to $43.6 million, mainly due to a decrease in interest rate contracts and other derivative income. Noninterest expense increased $13.9 million or 19%, year-over-year to $87.2 million for the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits and allocated corporate overhead expenses. 

Other 

Centralized functions, including the corporate treasury activities of the Company and eliminations of inter-segment amounts, have been aggregated and included in the Other segment, which provides broad administrative support to the two core segments, namely the Consumer and Business Banking and the Commercial Banking segments. 

The following table presents additional financial information for the Other segment for the periods indicated: 

Three Months Ended March 31, Change from 2022 ($ in thousands) 2023 2022 $ % Net interest income (loss) before provision for credit losses $ 58,896 $ (5,678) $ 64,574 NM Noninterest (loss) income (9,623) 5,467 (15,090) (276) % Total revenue (loss) 49,273 (211) 49,484 NM Noninterest expense 17,376 19,960 (2,584) (13) % Segment income (loss) before income taxes 31,897 (20,171) 52,068 258 % Income tax benefit 13,838 31,152 (17,314) (56) % Segment net income $ 45,735 $ 10,981 $ 34,754 316 % Average deposits $ 3,822,894 $ 3,175,001 $ 647,893 20 % 

NM &#8212; Not meaningful. 

The Other segment reported segment income before income taxes of $31.9 million and segment net income of $45.7 million for the first quarter of 2023, reflecting an income tax benefit of $13.8 million. The increase in segment income before income taxes was primarily driven by higher net interest income, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest income. The $64.6 million increase in net interest income before provision for credit losses was primarily driven by an increase in interest income from investments due to a higher yield on debt securities and interest-bearing cash with banks, and a higher FTP spread income absorbed by the Other segment. The $15.1 million decrease in noninterest income was mainly due to a $10.0 million write-off of an impaired subordinated debt security during the first quarter of 2023 and a $6.5 million decrease in foreign exchange income. 

The income tax expense or benefit in the Other segment consists of the remaining unallocated income tax expense or benefit after allocating income tax expense to the two core segments, and reflects the impact of tax credit investment activity. Income tax expense is allocated to the Consumer and Business Banking and the Commercial Banking segments by applying statutory income tax rates to the segment income before income taxes. Tax credit investment amortization is allocated to the Other segment. 

Balance Sheet Analysis 

Debt Securities 

The Company maintains a portfolio of high quality and liquid debt securities with a moderate duration profile. It closely manages the overall portfolio credit, interest rate and liquidity risks. The Company&#8217;s debt securities provide: 

&#8226; interest income for earnings and yield enhancement; 

&#8226; funding availability for needs arising during the normal course of business; 

&#8226; the ability to execute interest rate risk management strategies in response to changes in economic or market conditions; and 

&#8226; collateral to support pledging agreements as required and/or to enhance the Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity. 

While the Company does not intend to sell its debt securities, it may sell AFS securities in response to changes in the balance sheet and related interest rate risk to meet liquidity, regulatory and strategic requirements. 

The following table presents the distribution of the Company&#8217;s AFS and HTM debt securities portfolio as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and by credit ratings as of March 31, 2023:

(1) Credit ratings express opinions about the credit quality of a debt security. The Company determines the credit rating of a security according to the lowest credit rating made available by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (&#8220;NRSROs&#8221;). Debt securities rated investment grade, which are those with ratings similar to BBB- or above (as defined by NRSROs), are generally considered by the rating agencies and market participants to be low credit risk. Ratings percentages are allocated based on fair value. 

(2) For debt securities not rated by NRSROs, the Company uses other factors which include but are not limited to the priority in collections within the securitization structure, and whether the contractual payments have historically been on time. 

As of March 31, 2023, the Company&#8217;s AFS and HTM debt securities portfolios had an effective duration (defined as the sensitivity of the value of the portfolio to interest rate changes) of 3.9 and 7.9, respectively, compared with 4.1 and 8.0, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. The slight decrease in both the AFS and HTM effective durations was primarily due to the change in the level and shape of the yield curve as a result of a more bearish economic outlook. 

Available-for-Sale Debt Securities 

The fair value of the AFS debt securities portfolio totaled $6.30 billion as of March 31, 2023, an increase of $265.9 million or 4% from $6.03 billion as of December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to purchases of U.S. Treasury securities. The Company&#8217;s AFS debt securities are carried at fair value with noncredit-related unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in Other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Pre-tax net unrealized losses on AFS debt securities were $771.4 million as of March 31, 2023, compared with $844.2 million as of December 31, 2022. 

As of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 97% of the carrying value of the AFS debt securities portfolio was rated investment grade by NRSROs. Of the AFS debt securities with gross unrealized losses, substantially all were rated investment grade as of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. There was no allowance for credit losses provided against the AFS debt securities as of each of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Additionally, there were no credit losses recognized in earnings for either March 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022. 

Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities 

All HTM debt securities were issued, guaranteed, or supported by the U.S. government or government-sponsored enterprises. Accordingly, the Company applied a zero credit loss assumption for these securities and no allowance for credit loss was recorded as of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

For additional information on AFS and HTM securities, see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K and Note 3 &#8212; Fair Value Measurement and Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Note 5 &#8212; Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

Loan Portfolio 

The Company offers a broad range of financial products designed to meet the credit needs of its borrowers. The Company&#8217;s loan portfolio segments include commercial loans, which consist of commercial and industrial (&#8220;C&#38;I&#8221;), CRE, multifamily residential, and construction and land loans, as well as consumer loans, which consist of single-family residential, home equity lines of credit (&#8220;HELOCs&#8221;) and other consumer loans. Loans held-for-investment totaled $48.92 billion as of March 31, 2023, an increase of $715.6 million or 1% from $48.20 billion as of December 31, 2022. This growth was primarily driven by increases of $430.2 million or 3% in total residential mortgage loans and $363.5 million or 2% in total CRE loans. The composition of the loan portfolio as of March 31, 2023 was similar to the composition as of December 31, 2022.

Commercial 

The commercial loan portfolio comprised 72% of total loans as of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The Company actively monitors the commercial lending portfolio for elevated levels of credit risk and reviews credit exposures for sensitivity to changing economic conditions. 

Commercial &#8212; Commercial and Industrial Loans. Total C&#38;I loan commitments were $23.06 billion as of March 31, 2023, an increase of $275.0 million or 1% from $22.78 billion as of December 31, 2022. Total C&#38;I loans were $15.64 billion as of March 31, 2023, a decrease of $69.3 million or less than 0.5% from $15.71 billion as of December 31, 2022, with a utilization rate of 68% as of March 31, 2023, compared with 69% as of December 31, 2022. Total C&#38;I loans made up 32% and 33% of total loans held-for-investment as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The C&#38;I loan portfolio includes loans and financing for businesses across a wide spectrum of industries, comprised of commercial business lending, working capital lines of credit, trade finance, letters of credit, asset-based lending, asset-backed finance, project finance and equipment financing. Additionally, the Company has a portfolio of broadly syndicated C&#38;I loans, which represent revolving or term loan facilities that are marketed and sold primarily to institutional investors. This portfolio totaled $812.1 million and $855.9 million as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The majority of the C&#38;I loans had variable interest rates as of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

The C&#38;I portfolio is well-diversified by industry. The Company monitors concentrations within the C&#38;I loan portfolio by industry and customer exposure, and has exposure limits by industry and loan product. The following charts illustrate the industry mix within the Company&#8217;s C&#38;I loan portfolio as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Commercial &#8212; Total Commercial Real Estate Loans. Total CRE loans totaled $19.43 billion as of March 31, 2023, which grew by $363.5 million or 2% from $19.07 billion as of December 31, 2022, and accounted for 40% of total loans held-for-investment as of March 31, 2023, compared with 39% as of December 31, 2022. The total CRE portfolio consists of CRE, multifamily residential, and construction and land loans, and affordable housing lending. The increase in total CRE loans was driven by well-diversified growth across our major property types, partially offset by a decrease in office CRE loans. The Company&#8217;s underwriting parameters for CRE loans are established in compliance with supervisory guidance, including: property type, geography and loan-to-value (&#8220;LTV&#8221;). The consistency of the Company&#8217;s low LTV underwriting standards has historically resulted in lower credit losses. 

The Company&#8217;s total CRE loan portfolio is well-diversified by property type with an average CRE loan size of $2.8 million as of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The following table summarizes the Company&#8217;s total CRE loans by property type as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:

Because 71% of total CRE loans were concentrated in California as of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, changes in California&#8217;s economy and real estate values could have a significant impact on the collectability of these loans and the required level of allowance for loan losses. For additional information related to the higher degree of risk from a downturn in the California real estate markets, see Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Geopolitical Uncertainties to the Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. 

Commercial &#8212; Commercial Real Estate Loans.

Interest rates on CRE loans may be fixed, variable or hybrid. As of March 31, 2023, 64% of our CRE portfolio was variable rate, of which 47% had customer-level interest rate derivative contracts in place.

In comparison, as of December 31, 2022, 65% of our CRE portfolio was variable rate, of which 47% had customer-level interest rate derivative contracts in place. Loans are underwritten with conservative standards for cash flows, debt service coverage and LTV. 

Owner-occupied properties comprised 21% and 20% of the CRE loans as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The remainder were non-owner-occupied properties, where 50% or more of the debt service for the loan is typically provided by rental income from an unaffiliated third party. 

Commercial &#8212; Multifamily Residential Loans. The multifamily residential loan portfolio is largely comprised of loans secured by residential properties with five or more units. Multifamily residential loans totaled $4.68 billion as of March 31, 2023, compared with $4.57 billion as of December 31, 2022, and accounted for 10% and 9% of total loans held-for-investment as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The Company offers a variety of first lien mortgages, including fixed- and variable-rate loans, as well as hybrid loans with interest rates that adjust annually after an initial fixed rate period of three to ten years. As of March 31, 2023, 55% of our multifamily residential loan portfolio was variable rate, of which 35% had customer-level interest rate derivative contracts in place. These are hedging contracts offered by the Company to help our customers manage their interest rate risk while the Bank's own exposure remained variable rate. In comparison, as of December 31, 2022, 57% of our multifamily residential loan portfolio was variable rate, of which 34% had customer-level interest rate derivative contracts in place.

Consumer &#8212; Single-Family Residential Loans. Single-family residential loans totaled $11.79 billion or 24% of total loans held-for-investment as of March 31, 2023, compared with $11.22 billion or 23% of total loans held-for-investment as of December 31, 2022. Single-family residential loans increased $564.0 million or 5% from December 31, 2022, primarily driven by organic growth in mortgages and residential properties in California and New York. The Company was in a first lien position for all of its single-family residential loans as of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Many of these loans are reduced documentation loans, for which a substantial down payment is required, resulting in a low LTV ratio at origination, typically 65% or less. The weighted-average LTV ratio was 53% as of both dates. These loans have historically experienced low delinquency and loss rates. The Company offers a variety of single-family residential first lien mortgage loan programs, including fixed- and variable-rate loans, as well as hybrid loans with interest rates that adjust on a regular basis, typically annually, after an initial fixed rate period. 

Consumer &#8212; Home Equity Lines of Credit. Total HELOC commitments were $3.49 billion as of March 31, 2023, an increase of $108.0 million or 3% from $3.38 billion, with a utilization rate of 36% as of March 31, 2023, compared with 39% as of December 31, 2022.

The Company was in a first lien position for 82% and 83% of total outstanding HELOCs as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The weighted-average LTV ratio was 49% on HELOC commitments as of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Weighted-average LTV ratio represents the loan&#8217;s balance divided by the estimated current property value. For junior lien home equity loans, combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien home equity products. Many of these loans are reduced documentation loans, for which a substantial down payment is required, resulting in a low LTV ratio at origination, typically 65% or less. As a result, these loans have historically experienced low delinquency and loss rates. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s HELOCs were variable-rate loans as of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

All originated commercial and consumer loans are subject to the Company&#8217;s conservative underwriting guidelines and loan origination standards. Management believes that the Company&#8217;s underwriting criteria and procedures adequately consider the unique risks associated with these products. The Company conducts a variety of quality control procedures and periodic audits, including the review of lending and legal requirements, to ensure that the Company is in compliance with these requirements.

Capital 

The Company maintains a strong capital base to support its anticipated asset growth, operating needs, and credit risks, and to ensure that the Company and the Bank are in compliance with all regulatory capital guidelines. The Company engages in regular capital planning processes on at least an annual basis to optimize the use of available capital and to appropriately plan for future capital needs, allocating capital to existing and future business activities.

The Company&#8217;s stockholders&#8217; equity was $6.31 billion as of March 31, 2023, an increase of $324.7 million or 5% from $5.98 billion as of December 31, 2022. The increase in the Company&#8217;s stockholders&#8217; equity was primarily due to $322.4 million in net income and a positive change in accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) of $85.6 million, partially offset by $68.4 million in common dividends declared. The positive change in AOCI was primarily due to increased unrealized gains in AFS debt securities and cash flow hedges. For other factors that contributed to the changes in stockholders&#8217; equity, refer to Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements &#8212; Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders&#8217; Equit y in this Form 10-Q.

Deposits 

The Company offers a wide variety of deposit products to consumer and commercial customers. To provide a stable and low-cost source of funding and liquidity, the Company&#8217;s strategy is to grow and retain relationship-based deposits. Total deposits were $54.74 billion as of March 31, 2023, a decrease of $1.23 billion or 2% from $55.97 billion as of December 31, 2022. The decrease in deposits was primarily due to decreases in money market and noninterest-bearing demand accounts which reflected changing client behavior due to high interest rates as well as the recent events that impacted the banking industry. The decrease was partially offset by increases in time deposits and interest-bearing checking deposits. The growth in time deposits reflected a successful branch-based Lunar New Year certificate of deposit campaign. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits comprised 34% and 38% of total deposits as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

As of March 31, 2023, the Company&#8217;s domestic deposits were $52.30 billion, of which insured or otherwise collateralized deposits were estimated at $29.49 billion. In comparison, as of December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s domestic deposits were $53.23 billion, of which insured or otherwise collateralized deposits were estimated at $26.48 billion. The Company&#8217;s domestic uninsured deposit ratio improved to 44% as of March 31, 2023, compared with 50% as of December 31, 2022. The Company maintains a granular and relationship-based deposit base, which is well diversified by industry and customer type. The Company gathers deposits through its more than 120 retail branches and locations in the U.S. and Asia. As of March 31, 2023, total commercial deposits, state and public agency, brokered and foreign office deposits totaled $36.72 billion, or 67% of total deposits, and comprised approximately 98,000 accounts with an approximate average account size of $375,000. Commercial deposit accounts were diversified across various industry sectors, with no one sector representing more than 10% of deposits. As of March 31, 2023, $18.02 billion or 33% of total deposits were consumer deposits and comprised over 468,000 accounts with an approximate average account size of $40,000. 

Additional information regarding the impact of deposits on net interest income, with a comparison of average deposit balances and rates, is provided in Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Results of Operations &#8212; Net Interest Income in this Form 10-Q. See also the discussion of the impact of deposits on liquidity at Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Liquidity Risk Management &#8212; Liquidity in this Form 10-Q. 

Other Sources of Funding 

The Company had $4.50 billion of short-term borrowings outstanding as of March 31, 2023, which consisted of funds from the BTFP, which were more cost effective than other borrowing sources and have a positive carry when left as cash placed at the Federal Reserve Bank. There were no short-term borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 10 &#8212; Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for additional information on the BTFP and the Company&#8217;s related borrowings. 

Repurchase agreements were $300.0 million as of December 31, 2022. During the first quarter of 2023, the Company recorded $3.9 million of charges related to the extinguishment of $300.0 million of repurchase agreements. Repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and recorded as liabilities based on the values at which the assets are sold. To ensure the market value of the underlying collateral remains sufficient, the Company monitors the fair value of collateral pledged relative to the principal amounts borrowed under the repurchase agreements. The Company manages liquidity risks related to the repurchase agreements by sourcing funds from a diverse group of counterparties, and entering into repurchase agreements with longer durations, when appropriate. For additional details, see Note 4 &#8212; Assets Purchased under Resale Agreements and Sold under Repurchase Agreements to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

The Company uses long-term debt to provide funding to acquire interest-earning assets, and to enhance liquidity and regulatory capital adequacy. Long-term debt totaled $148.0 million as of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Long-term debt consists of junior subordinated debt, which qualifies as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes. Refer to Note 10 &#8212; Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for additional information on the junior subordinated debt. 

Regulatory Capital and Ratios 

The federal banking agencies have risk-based capital adequacy requirements intended to ensure that banking organizations maintain capital that is commensurate with the degree of risk associated with their operations. The Company and the Bank are each subject to these regulatory capital adequacy requirements. See Item 1. Business &#8212; Supervision and Regulation &#8212; Regulatory Capital Requirements and Regulatory Capital-Related Development in the Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for additional details. 

The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, which requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses to be based on management&#8217;s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Company&#8217;s relevant financial assets. The Company has elected the phase-in option provided by a final rule that delays an estimate of the current expected credit losses (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) effect on regulatory capital for two years and phases in the impact over three years. The rule permits certain banking organizations to exclude from regulatory capital the initial adoption impact of CECL, plus 25% of the cumulative changes in the allowance for credit losses under CECL for each period until December 31, 2021, followed by a three-year phase-out period in which the aggregate benefit is reduced by 25% in 2022, 50% in 2023 and 75% in 2024. Accordingly, our capital ratios as of March 31, 2023 reflect a delay of 50% of the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s capital ratios as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 under the Basel III Capital Rules, and those required by regulatory agencies for capital adequacy and well-capitalized classification purposes: 

Basel III Capital Rules March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Company Bank Company Bank Minimum Regulatory Requirements Minimum Regulatory Requirements including Capital Conservation Buffer Well-Capitalized Requirements Risk-based capital ratios: Common Equity Tier 1 capital (1)

(1) The Common Equity Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 leverage well-capitalized requirements apply only to the Bank since there is no Common Equity Tier 1 capital component or Tier 1 leverage ratio component in the definition of a well-capitalized bank holding company. The minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio requirement for the Company to be considered well-capitalized is 6.0%. 

The Company is committed to maintaining strong capital levels to assure its investors, customers and regulators that the Company and the Bank are financially sound. As of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company and the Bank continued to exceed all &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; capital requirements and the required minimum capital requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules. Total risk-weighted assets were $50.23 billion as of March 31, 2023, an increase of $190.6 million from $50.04 billion as of December 31, 2022. The increase in the risk-weighted assets was primarily due to residential mortgage and CRE loan growth. 

Risk Management 

Overview 

In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent to the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to the Company&#8217;s business. The Company operates under a Board-approved enterprise risk management (&#8220;ERM&#8221;) framework, which outlines the company-wide approach to risk management and oversight, and describes the structures and practices employed to manage the current and emerging risks inherent to the Company. The Company&#8217;s ERM program incorporates risk management throughout the organization in identifying, managing, monitoring, and reporting risks. It identifies the Company&#8217;s major risk categories as: credit, liquidity, capital, market, operational, compliance, legal, strategic, and reputational. 

The Risk Oversight Committee of the Board of Directors monitors the ERM program through identified risk categories and provides oversight of the Company&#8217;s risk appetite and control environment. The Risk Oversight Committee provides focused oversight of the Company&#8217;s identified enterprise risk categories on behalf of the full Board of Directors. Under the direction of the Risk Oversight Committee, management committees apply targeted strategies to manage and to reduce the risks to which the Company&#8217;s operations are exposed. 

The Company&#8217;s ERM program is executed along the three lines of defense model, which provides for a consistent and standardized risk management control environment across the enterprise. The first line of defense is comprised of production, operational, and support units. The second line of defense is comprised of various risk management and control functions charged with monitoring and managing specific major risk categories and/or risk subcategories. The third line of defense is comprised of the Internal Audit function and Independent Asset Review (&#8220;IAR&#8221;). Internal Audit and IAR provide assurance and evaluate the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes as established by the Company. Reporting directly to the Board&#8217;s Audit Committee, Internal Audit maintains organizational independence and objectivity. Further discussion and analysis of the primary risk areas are detailed in the following subsections of Risk Management. 

Credit Risk Management 

Credit risk is the risk that a borrower or a counterparty will fail to perform according to the terms and conditions of a loan or investment and expose the Company to loss. Credit risk exists with many of the Company&#8217;s assets and exposures such as loans, debt securities and certain derivatives. The majority of the Company&#8217;s credit risk is associated with lending activities. 

The Risk Oversight Committee has primary oversight responsibility for identified enterprise risk categories including credit risk. The Risk Oversight Committee monitors management&#8217;s assessment of asset quality, credit risk trends, credit quality administration, underwriting standards, and portfolio credit risk management strategies and processes, such as diversification and concentration limits, all of which enable management to control credit risk. At the management level, the Credit Risk Management Committee has primary oversight responsibility for credit risk. The Senior Credit Supervision function manages credit policy for the line of business transactional credit risk, assuring that all exposure is risk-rated according to the requirements of the credit risk rating policy. The Senior Credit Supervision function evaluates and reports the overall credit risk exposure to senior management and the Risk Oversight Committee. Reporting directly to the Board&#8217;s Risk Oversight Committee, the IAR function provides additional support to the Company&#8217;s strong credit risk management culture by providing an independent and objective assessment of underwriting and documentation quality. A key focus of our credit risk management is adherence to a well-controlled underwriting process. 

The Company assesses the overall credit quality performance of the loans held-for-investment portfolio through an integrated analysis of specific performance ratios. This approach forms the basis of the discussion in the sections immediately following: Credit Quality, Nonperforming Assets and Allowance for Credit Losses. 

Credit Quality 

The Company utilizes a credit risk rating system to assist in monitoring credit quality. Loans are evaluated using the Company&#8217;s internal credit risk rating of 1 through 10. For more information on the Company&#8217;s credit quality indicators and internal credit risk ratings, refer to Note 7 &#8212; Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s criticized loans as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets are comprised of nonaccrual loans, other real estate owned (&#8220;OREO&#8221;) and other nonperforming assets. Other nonperforming assets and OREO are repossessed assets and properties, respectively, acquired through foreclosure, or through full or partial satisfaction of loans held-for-investment. Nonperforming assets were $93.4 million or 0.14% of total assets as of March 31, 2023, a decrease of $6.4 million or 6%, compared with $99.8 million or 0.16% of total assets as of December 31, 2022. 

The following table presents nonperforming assets information as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:

Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due or when the full collection of principal or interest becomes uncertain regardless of the length of past due status. Collectability is generally assessed based on economic and business conditions, the borrower&#8217;s financial condition, and the adequacy of collateral, if any. For additional details regarding the Company&#8217;s nonaccrual loan policy, see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Loans Held-for-Investment to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. 

Nonaccrual loans were $93.1 million as of March 31, 2023, a decrease of $6.4 million or 6% from $99.5 million as of December 31, 2022. This decrease was predominantly due to increases in paydowns, charge-offs and pay-offs of commercial loans, partially offset by an increase in single-family residential nonaccrual loans. As of March 31, 2023, $61.4 million or 66% of nonaccrual loans were less than 90 days delinquent. In comparison, $68.3 million or 69% of nonaccrual loans were less than 90 days delinquent as of December 31, 2022.

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses represents management&#8217;s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Company&#8217;s relevant financial assets. The allowance for credit losses estimate uses various models and estimation techniques based on historical loss experience, current borrower characteristics, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and other relevant factors. 

In addition to the allowance for loan losses, the Company maintains an allowance for unfunded credit commitments. The Company has three general areas for which it provides the allowance for unfunded credit commitments: (1) recourse obligations for loans sold, (2) letters of credit, and (3) unfunded lending commitments. The Company&#8217;s methodology for determining the allowance calculation for unfunded lending commitments uses the lifetime loss rates of the on-balance sheet commitment. Recourse obligations for loans sold and letters of credit use the weighted loss rates for the applicable segment of the individual credit. 

For loans and securities, allowance for credit losses are contra-asset valuation accounts that are deducted from the amortized cost basis of these assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. For unfunded credit commitments, the allowance for credit losses is a liability account that is reported as a component of Accrued expenses and other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

The Company is committed to maintaining the allowance for credit losses at a level that is commensurate with the estimated inherent losses in the loan portfolio, including unfunded credit facilities. While the Company believes that the allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2023 was appropriate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio and in unfunded credit commitments based on the information available, future allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to, accounting standard and regulatory changes, loan growth, portfolio performance and general economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires numerous estimates and judgements. For a description of the policies, methodologies and judgments used to determine the allowance for credit losses, see Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Critical Accounting Estimates and Item 8. Financial Statements &#8212; Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K, and Note 7 &#8212; Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

The following table presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan portfolio segments and unfunded credit commitments as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:

First quarter 2023 net charge-offs were $609 thousand, or annualized 0.01% of average loans held-for-investment, compared with $8.3 million, or annualized 0.08% of average loans held-for-investment, for the first quarter of 2022. The decrease in net charge-offs was primarily due to a decrease in C&#38;I charge-offs. 

Liquidity Risk Management 

Liquidity 

Liquidity risk arises from the Company&#8217;s inability to meet its customer deposit withdrawals and obligations to other counterparties as they come due, or to obtain adequate funding at a reasonable cost to meet those obligations. Liquidity risk also considers the stability of deposits. The objective of liquidity management is to manage the potential mismatch of asset and liability cash flows. Maintaining an adequate level of liquidity depends on the institution&#8217;s ability to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected cash flows, and collateral needs without adversely affecting daily operations or the financial condition of the institution. To achieve this objective, the Company analyzes its liquidity risk, maintains readily available liquid assets, and utilizes diverse funding sources including its stable core deposit base. 

The Board of Directors&#8217; Risk Oversight Committee has primary oversight responsibility over liquidity risk management. At the management level, the Company&#8217;s Asset/Liability Committee (&#8220;ALCO&#8221;) establishes the liquidity guidelines that govern the day-to-day active management of the Company&#8217;s liquidity position by requiring sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. These guidelines are established and monitored for both the Bank and East West on a stand-alone basis to ensure that the Company can serve as a source of strength for its subsidiaries. The ALCO regularly monitors the Company&#8217;s liquidity status and related management processes, providing regular reports to the Board of Directors. The Company&#8217;s liquidity management practices have been effective under normal operating and stressed market conditions. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Liquidity Sources. The Company&#8217;s primary source of funding is from deposits generated by its banking business, which we believe is a relatively stable and low-cost source of funding. Our loans are funded by deposits, which amounted to $54.74 billion as of March 31, 2023, compared with $55.97 billion as of December 31, 2022. The Company&#8217;s loan-to-deposit ratio was 89% as of March 31, 2023, compared with 86% as of December 31, 2022. 

In addition to deposits, the Company has access to various sources of wholesale financing, including borrowing capacity with the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (&#8220;FRBSF&#8221;), such as under the newly established BTFP, unsecured federal funds lines of credit with various correspondent banks, and several master repurchase agreements with major brokerage companies to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio, meet daily cash demands and allow management flexibility to execute its business strategy. However, general financial market and economic conditions could impact our access and cost of external funding. Additionally, the Company&#8217;s access to capital markets is affected by the ratings received from various credit rating agencies. 

Unencumbered loans and/or debt securities were pledged to the FHLB, the FRBSF discount window, and the FRBSF BTFP as collateral. The Company has established operational procedures to enable borrowing against these assets, including regular monitoring of the total pool of loans and debt securities eligible as collateral. Eligibility of collateral is defined in guidelines from the FHLB and FRBSF and is subject to change at their discretion. See Item 2 &#8212; MD&#38;A &#8212; Balance Sheet Analysis &#8212; Deposits and Other Sources of Funding in this Form 10-Q for further detail related to the Company&#8217;s funding sources. The Company believes its cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity described below provide sufficient liquidity above its expected cash needs. 

The Company maintains its source of liquidity in the form of cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity with its eligible loans and debt securities as collateral. The following table presents the Company&#8217;s total cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022: 

Change ($ in thousands) March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 $ % Cash and cash equivalents $ 5,934,194 $ 3,481,784 $ 2,452,410 70 % Interest-bearing deposits with banks 10,249 139,021 (128,772) (93) % Borrowing capacity: FHLB 13,066,246 12,773,996 292,250 2 % FRBSF 8,822,513 2,049,048 6,773,465 331 % Unpledged securities available 1,770,416 6,939,591 (5,169,175) (74) % Federal funds facility 1,056,000 1,136,000 (80,000) (7) % Total $ 30,659,618 &#160; $ 26,519,440 &#160; $ 4,140,178 &#160; 16 &#160; % 

The Company&#8217;s total cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity totaled $30.66 billion as of March 31, 2023, compared with $26.52 billion as of December 31, 2022. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily related to an increase in collateral available at the FRBSF and an increase in cash and cash equivalents, which was funded by borrowings from the BTFP during the first quarter of 2023. The BTFP was secured by pledged securities. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Cash Requirements. In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters contractual obligations that require future cash payments, including funding for customer deposit withdrawals, repayments for short- and long-term borrowings, and other cash commitments. For additional information on these obligations, see Note 9 &#8212; Deposits to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K, and Note 4 &#8212; Assets Purchased under Resale Agreements and Sold under Repurchase Agreements, Note 8 &#8212; Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Partnerships, Tax Credit and Other Investments, Net and Variable Interest Entities and Note 10 &#8212; Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

The Company also has off-balance sheet arrangements which represent transactions that are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company&#8217;s off-balance sheet arrangements include (1) commitments to extend credit, such as loan commitments, commercial letters of credit for foreign and domestic trade, standby letters of credit (&#8220;SBLCs&#8221;), and financial guarantees, to meet the financing needs of its customers, (2) future interest obligations related to customer deposits and the Company&#8217;s borrowings, and (3) transactions with unconsolidated entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company, or engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the Company. Because many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future funding requirements. Information about the Company&#8217;s loan commitments, commercial letters of credit and SBLCs is provided in Note 11 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows summarizes the Company&#8217;s sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. Excess cash generated by operating and investing activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Liquidity for East West. In addition to bank level liquidity management, the Company manages liquidity at the parent company level for various operating needs including payment of dividends, repurchases of common stock, principal and interest payments on its borrowings, acquisitions and additional investments in its subsidiaries. East West&#8217;s primary source of liquidity is from cash dividends distributed by its subsidiary, East West Bank. The Bank is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends as discussed in Item 1 . Business &#8212; Supervision and Regulation &#8212; Dividends and Other Transfers of Funds in the Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. East West held $243.0 million and $228.5 million in cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Management believes that East West has sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet the projected cash obligations for the coming year. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Liquidity Stress Testing. The Company utilizes liquidity stress analysis to determine the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the Company, foreign subsidiary and foreign branch to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. Scenario analyses include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources, market triggers, potential uses of funding and economic conditions in certain countries. In addition, Company specific events are incorporated into the stress testing. Liquidity stress tests are conducted to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons, both immediate and longer term, and over a variety of stressed conditions. Given the range of potential stresses, the Company maintains contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for individual entities. 

As of March 31, 2023, the Company believes it has adequate liquidity resources to conduct operations and meet other needs in the ordinary course of business, and is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its liquidity, capital resources or operations. Given the uncertain and rapidly changing market and economic conditions, the Company will continue to actively evaluate the impact on its business and financial position. For more information on how economic conditions may impact our liquidity, see Item 1A . Risk Factors in the Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. 

Market Risk Management 

Market risk refers to the risk of potential loss due to adverse movements in market risk factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and credit spreads. The Company is primarily exposed to interest rate risk through its core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits. There have been no significant changes in our risk management practices as described in Item 7 . MD&#38;A &#8212; Market Risk Management in the Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. 

Interest Rate Risk Management 

Interest rate risk results primarily from the Company&#8217;s traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans, which are the primary areas of market risk for the Company. The ALCO coordinates the overall management of the Company&#8217;s interest rate risk, meets regularly to review the Company&#8217;s open market positions and establishes policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk. Interest rate risk management is carried out primarily through strategies involving the Company&#8217;s debt securities portfolio, loan portfolio, available funding channels and capital market activities. In addition, the Company&#8217;s policies permit the use of derivative instruments to assist in managing interest rate risk. 

Interest rate risk exposure is measured and monitored through various risk management tools, which include a simulation model that performs interest rate sensitivity analyses under multiple interest rate scenarios against a baseline. The simulation model incorporates the market&#8217;s forward rate expectations and the Company&#8217;s earning assets and liabilities. The net interest income simulation model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of the Company&#8217;s interest-rate sensitive assets, liabilities, and related derivative contracts. It also incorporates various assumptions, which management believes to be reasonable but may have a significant impact on the results. 

Simulation results are highly dependent on input assumptions. To the extent the actual behavior is different from the assumptions used in the models, there could be material changes in interest rate sensitivity results. The assumptions applied in the model are documented, supported, and periodically back-tested to assess the reasonableness and effectiveness. For a more detailed discussion of the Company&#8217;s interest income simulation model, refer to Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Market Risk Management in the Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. 

The Federal Reserve continued its aggressive response to inflation by incrementally raising the target range for the fed funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5.00% in March 2023, from the 2022 year-end range of 4.25% to 4.50%. On May 3, 2023 the Federal Reserve raised the target rate range to 5.00% to 5.25%. However, increased uncertainty regarding a potential recession has also led to the expectation of rate cuts potentially starting in September 2023. 

Twelve-Month Net Interest Income Simulation 

Net interest income simulation modeling measures interest rate risk through earnings volatility. The simulation projects the cash flow changes in interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities, expressed in terms of net interest income, over a specified time horizon for defined interest rate scenarios. Net interest income simulations provide insight into the impact of market rate changes on earnings, which help guide risk management decisions. The Company assesses interest rate risk by comparing the changes of net interest income in different interest rate scenarios. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s net interest income sensitivity related to an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates by 100 and 200 bps as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, based on a static balance sheet as of the date of the analysis. 

Net Interest Income Volatility (1) 

Change in Interest Rates (in bps) March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 +200 9.0 % 11.6 % +100 4.8 % 5.9 % -100 (4.7) % (5.3) % -200 (9.3) % (8.6) % 

(1) The percentage change represents net interest income change over a 12-month period in a stable interest rate environment versus in the various interest rate scenarios. 

The composition of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to a mismatch of repricing behavior between the floating-rate loan portfolio and deposit products. In the table above, net interest income volatility expressed in relation to base-case net interest income, decreased quarter -over-quarter primarily as a result of changes in the Company&#8217;s balance sheet composition. 

While an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates was used in the simulation model described in the preceding paragraph, the Company also models scenarios based on gradual shifts in interest rates and assesses the corresponding impacts. These interest rate scenarios provide additional information to estimate the Company&#8217;s underlying interest rate risk. The rate ramp table below shows the net interest income volatility under a gradual non-parallel shift of the yield curve, in even monthly increments over the first 12 months, followed by rates held constant thereafter based on a static balance sheet as of the date of the analysis. 

Net Interest Income Volatility Change in Interest Rates (in bps) March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 +200 Rate Ramp 4.5 % 6.3 % +100 Rate Ramp 2.3 % 3.4 % -100 Rate Ramp (2.4) % (2.4) % -200 Rate Ramp (4.8) % (4.9) % 

As of March 31, 2023, the Company&#8217;s net interest income profile reflects an asset sensitive position. Net interest income is expected to increase when interest rates rise as the Company has a large population of variable rate loans, primarily linked to Prime, LIBOR, and Term SOFR indices. The Company&#8217;s interest income is sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates. As of March 31, 2023, the Company designated interest rate contracts with a notional amount of $3.25 billion as cash flow hedges . The modeled results incorporated an additional $1.00 billion of interest rate contracts that were designated as cash flow hedges during April 2023. The increase in the total notional amount of cash flow hedges to $4.25 billion reduced net interest income volatility by approximately 1.5% of the base net interest income for every 100 bps change in interest rates. The Company&#8217;s deposit portfolio is primarily composed of non-maturity deposits, which are not directly tied to short-term interest rate indices, but are, nevertheless, sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates. The modeled results are highly sensitive to deposit durations, beta, deposit mix and other behavioral assumptions, which were derived using a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches. Actual results may deviate from the model results in terms of net interest income due to earning asset growth variation and deposit mix changes based on customer preferences relative to the interest rate environment. During a period of declining interest rates, balance sheet growth could offset headwinds to net interest income from yield compression. 

Economic Value of Equity at Risk 

Economic value of equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;) is a cash flow calculation that takes the present value of all asset cash flows and subtracts the present value of all liability cash flows. This calculation is used for asset/liability management and measures changes in the economic value of the bank. 

The economic value approach provides a comparatively broader scope than the net interest income volatility approach since it represents the discounted present value of cash flows over the expected life of the instruments. Due to this longer horizon, EVE is useful to identify risks arising from repricing, prepayment and maturity gaps between assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, as well as from off-balance sheet derivative exposure, over their lifetime. This long-term economic perspective into the Company&#8217;s interest rate risk profile allows the Company to identify anticipated negative effects of interest rate fluctuations. However, the difference in time horizons can cause the EVE analysis to diverge from the shorter term net interest income analysis presented above. Given the uncertainty of the magnitude, timing and direction of future interest rate movements, the shape of the yield curve, and potential changes to the balance sheet, actual results may vary from those predicted by the Company&#8217;s model. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s EVE sensitivity related to an instantaneous non-parallel shift in market interest rates by 100 and 200 bps as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022: 

EVE Volatility (1) 

Change in Interest Rates (in bps) March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 +200 (1.8) % (6.0) % +100 (1.0) % (2.9) % -100 1.0 % 1.1 % -200 2.0 % 2.3 % 

(1) The percentage change represents net portfolio value change of the Company in a stable interest rate environment versus in the various interest rate scenarios. 

As of March 31, 2023, the Company&#8217;s EVE profile reflects a liability sensitive position as the Company&#8217;s EVE is expected to decrease when interest rates rise. The EVE sensitivity decreased quarter-over-quarter primarily due to increases in fixed-rate short-term borrowings and cash and cash equivalents. 

Derivatives 

It is the Company&#8217;s policy not to speculate on the future direction of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. However, the Company periodically enters into derivative transactions in order to manage its exposure to market risk, primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The Company believes these derivative transactions, when properly structured and managed, provides a hedge against inherent risk in certain assets and liabilities or against risk in specific transactions. Hedging transactions may be implemented using a variety of derivative instruments such as swaps, forwards, options, and collars. The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in interest payments received on certain floating-rate commercial loans and interest payments paid on certain floating-rate borrowings. Foreign exchange derivatives are used in net investment hedging strategies to mitigate the risk of changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of a designated monetary amount of the Company&#8217;s net investment in East West Bank (China) Limited. Prior to entering into any accounting hedge activities, the Company analyzes the costs and benefits of the hedge in comparison to alternative strategies. The Company also repositions its hedging derivatives portfolio based on the current assessment of economic and financial conditions, including the interest rate and foreign currency environments, balance sheet composition and trends, and the relative mix of its cash and derivative positions. 

In addition, the Company enters into derivative transactions in order to accommodate its customers with their business needs or to assist customers with their risk management objectives, such as managing exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodity prices. To economically hedge against the derivative contracts entered into with the Company&#8217;s customers, the Company enters into offsetting derivative contracts with third-party financial institutions, some of which are cleared through central clearing organizations. The exposures from derivative transactions are collateralized by cash and/or eligible securities based on limits as set forth in the respective agreements between the Company and counterparty financial institutions. The changes in fair values of the derivative contracts traded with third-party financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the derivative transactions executed with customers throughout the terms of these contracts, except for the credit valuation adjustment component in the contracts and the spread variances between the customer derivatives and the offsetting financial counterparty positions. The Company also utilizes foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to mitigate the economic effect of fluctuations in certain foreign currency on-balance sheet assets and liabilities, primarily foreign currency denominated deposits offered to its customers. 

The Company is subject to credit risk associated with the counterparties to the derivative contracts. This counterparty credit risk is a multi-dimensional form of risk, affected by both the exposure and credit quality of the counterparty, both of which are sensitive to market-induced changes. The Company&#8217;s Credit Risk Management Committee provides oversight of credit risk and the Company has guidelines in place to manage counterparty concentration, tenor limits, and collateral. The Company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties, by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements and by requiring collateral arrangements, where possible. The Company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to institutional third-parties through the use of credit risk participation agreements. Certain derivative contracts are required to be cleared through central clearinghouses, to further mitigate counterparty credit risk, where variation margin is applied daily as settlement to the fair value of the derivative contracts. In addition, the Company incorporates credit value adjustments and other market standard methodologies to appropriately reflect the counterparty&#8217;s and its own nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement of its derivatives. As of March 31, 2023, the Company anticipates performance by its counterparties and has not incurred any related credit losses. 

The following table summarizes certain information on derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges and utilized by the Company in its management of interest rate and foreign currency risk as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The Company&#8217;s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. Certain of these policies include critical accounting estimates, which are subject to valuation assumptions, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and it is likely that materially different amounts could be reported under different assumptions and conditions. The Company has procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. The following accounting policies are critical to the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements: 

&#8226; allowance for credit losses; 

&#8226; fair value estimates; 

&#8226; goodwill impairment; and 

&#8226; income taxes.

Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

To supplement the Company&#8217;s unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company uses certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with, or as an alternative to U.S. GAAP. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company&#8217;s performance that either excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have such an effect, that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable financial measure that is calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this Form 10-Q are return on average TCE, adjusted efficiency ratio, and tangible book value per share. Certain additional non-GAAP financial measures that are components of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures are also set forth and reconciled in the table below. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance, and allow comparability to prior periods. These non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. 

The following tables present the reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for the periods presented:
