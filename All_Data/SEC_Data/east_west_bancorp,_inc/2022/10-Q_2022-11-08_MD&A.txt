Forward-Looking Statements 

Certain matters discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this &#8220;Form 10-Q&#8221;) contain forward-looking statements that are intended to be covered by the safe harbor for such statements provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, East West Bancorp, Inc. (referred to herein on an unconsolidated basis as &#8220;East West&#8221; and on a consolidated basis as the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we&#8221; or &#8220;EWBC&#8221;) may make forward-looking statements in other documents that it files with, or furnishes to, the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) and management may make forward-looking statements to analysts, investors, media members and others. Forward-looking statements are those that do not relate to historical facts, and that are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the Company&#8217;s industry, management&#8217;s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond the Company&#8217;s control. These statements may relate to the Company&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and/or business and usually can be identified by the use of forward-looking language, such as &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;assumes,&#8221; &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;can,&#8221; &#8220;continues,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;forecasts,&#8221; &#8220;goal,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;likely,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;might,&#8221; &#8220;objective,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;potential,&#8221; &#8220;projects,&#8221; &#8220;remains,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;target,&#8221; &#8220;trend,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; or similar expressions, and the negative thereof. You should not place undue reliance on these statements, as they are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described below. When considering these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind these risks and uncertainties, as well as any cautionary statements the Company may make. Moreover, you should treat these statements as speaking only as of the date they are made and based only on information then actually known to the Company.

Overview 

The following discussion provides information about the results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources of the Company and its subsidiaries, including its subsidiary bank, East West Bank and its subsidiaries (referred to herein as &#8220;East West Bank&#8221; or the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). This information is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this report, and the Company&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K. 

Organization and Strategy 

East West is a bank holding company incorporated in Delaware on August 26, 1998 and is registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Company commenced business on December 30, 1998 when, pursuant to a reorganization, it acquired all of the voting stock of the Bank, which became its principal asset. The Bank is an independent commercial bank headquartered in California that focuses on the financial service needs of the Asian-American community. Through over 120 locations in the U.S. and China, the Company provides a full range of consumer and commercial products and services through the following three business segments: (1) Consumer and Business Banking, and (2) Commercial Banking, with the remaining operations recorded in (3) Other . The Company&#8217;s principal activity is lending to and accepting deposits from businesses and individuals. We are committed to enhancing long-term stockholder value by growing loans, deposits and revenue, improving profitability, and investing for the future while managing risks, expenses and capital. Our business model is built on promoting customer loyalty and engagement, understanding our customers&#8217; financial goals, and meeting their financial needs through our diverse products and services. We expect our relationship-focused business model to continue to generate organic growth from existing customers and to expand our targeted customer bases. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had $62.58 billion in assets and approximately 3,200 full-time equivalent employees. For additional information on our strategy, and the products and services provided by the Bank, see Item 1. Business &#8212; Strategy and Banking Services in the Company&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K. 

Developments 

Economic Developments 

Heightened inflationary pressures caused by rising oil and other commodity prices due to Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, and global supply chain disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to weigh on the economy. Concerns of a potential recession have increased as the federal government continues to hike interest rates to slow down inflation. Although U.S. economic conditions have continued to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing effects of its impact on the macroeconomic environment may persist for some time. The Company continues to closely monitor the economy and its effects on its business, customers, employees, communities and markets. 

Further discussion of the potential impacts on the Company&#8217;s business due to interest rate hikes have been provided in Item 1A. &#8212; Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Financial Matters in the Company&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K. 

LIBOR Transition 

LIBOR is a widely referenced benchmark rate that is intended to reflect the rate at which banks can borrow wholesale funds from other banks on an unsecured and short-term basis. In March 2021, the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority and Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration announced that the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR settings and non-USD LIBOR settings would cease to be published after December 31, 2021. The publication of the overnight, one-, three-, six- and 12-month USD LIBOR settings has been extended through June 30, 2023, which will provide additional time to wind down or renegotiate existing contracts that reference these LIBOR settings. 

In March 2022, President Biden signed into law the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the &#8220;LIBOR Act&#8221;). The LIBOR Act provides a clear and uniform federal solution to transition legacy LIBOR-based contracts that either contain insufficient contractual fallback provisions addressing the LIBOR cessation and its transition to a benchmark selected by the Federal Reserve or lack contractual fallback provisions entirely. The LIBOR Act also establishes a safe harbor for lenders, shielding lenders from potential litigation resulting from their choice of a replacement rate, under certain situations including the use of a Federal Reserve-selected replacement rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;). The Federal Reserve published its proposed rulemaking that implements the LIBOR Act in the Federal Register in July 2022, which establishes benchmark replacement recommendations for various product types. 

The Company holds a significant volume of LIBOR-based products, including loans, derivatives, debt securities, assets purchased under resale agreements (&#8220;resale agreements&#8221;), junior subordinated debt, and assets sold under repurchase agreements (&#8220;repurchase agreements&#8221;) that are indexed to LIBOR tenors that will cease to be published after June 30, 2023. The Company has a cross-functional team to manage the communication of the Company&#8217;s transition plans with both internal and external stakeholders. The team helps to ensure that the Company appropriately updates its business processes, analytical tools, information systems and contract language to minimize disruption during and after the LIBOR transition. The Company has invested in updates to business and legal processes, models, analytical tools, and information and operational systems to facilitate the transition of legacy LIBOR products and offer products under alternative rates. 

The Company started offering loans based on alternative reference rates, including SOFR and the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index during the fourth quarter of 2021, and ceased offering new LIBOR loans and LIBOR loan renewals beginning January 1, 2022. The Company continues to engage with customers to proactively modify LIBOR-based product contracts and transition to a benchmark replacement prior to June 30, 2023. The Company will leverage relevant contractual and statutory solutions, if necessary, including the LIBOR Act and other relevant legislation, to transition any residual LIBOR-based product exposures maturing after June 2023 to appropriate benchmark replacements. The Company&#8217;s LIBOR transition is anticipated to continue through June 30, 2023. 

The Company will continue to monitor potential risks and impacts associated with the transition. For additional information related to the potential impact surrounding the transition from LIBOR on the Company&#8217;s business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Financial Matters in the Company&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K. 

Deposit Insurance Assessment Rates 

In October 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule to increase the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly for insured depository institutions by two basis points (&#8220;bps&#8221;), beginning in the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The increase in the assessment rate schedules is intended to: (1) increase the likelihood that the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) will reach at least 1.35 percent by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2028; (2) reduce the FDIC&#8217;s need to consider a potentially pro-cyclical assessment rate increase, and (3) support growth in the DIF in progressing towards the FDIC&#8217;s long-term goal of a 2 percent Designated Reserve Ratio. The new assessment rate schedules will remain in effect unless and until the reserve ratio meets or exceeds 2 percent. As a result of the adoption of the assessment rate schedules, the FDIC insurance costs of the Bank will likely increase but not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

Community Reinvestment Act 

On May 5, 2022, the federal banking agencies issued a proposed rule that would substantially revise how they evaluate an insured depository institution&#8217;s record of satisfying the credit needs of its entire communities, including low- and moderate-income individuals and neighborhoods, under the Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;). We are evaluating the potential impact of the proposed rule on the Bank. 

Inflation Reduction Act 

On August 16, 2022, the U.S. federal government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The bill contains numerous tax provisions, including a 15 percent corporate minimum tax. At this point, the legislation is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements.

(2) Efficiency ratio is calculated as noninterest expense divided by total revenue . 

The Company&#8217;s third quarter 2022 net income was $295.3 million, an increase of $69.9 million or 31%, compared with third quarter 2021 net income of $225.4 million. Net income for the first nine months of 2022 was $791.3 million, an increase of $136.1 million or 21%, compared with the first nine months of 2021 net income of $655.2 million. The year-over-year increases in both periods were primarily due to higher net interest income, partially offset by higher income tax expense and provision for credit losses. Noteworthy items about the Company&#8217;s third quarter and first nine months of 2022 performance included: 

&#8226; Net interest income growth and net interest margin expansion. Third quarter 2022 net interest income before provision for (reversal of) credit losses was $551.8 million, an increase of $156.1 million or 39% from the third quarter of 2021. Third quarter 2022 net interest margin of 3.68% expanded 98 bps year-over-year. For the first nine months of 2022, net interest income before provision for (reversal of) credit losses was $1.44 billion, an increase of $314.5 million or 28% year-over-year. The net interest margin for the first nine months of 2022 was 3.27%, up 55 bps year-over-year. 

&#8226; Improved efficiency. Efficiency ratios of 34.43% and 35.98% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, both improved year-over-year. The adjusted efficiency ratios of 31.18% and 32.98% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, both improved year-over-year. For additional details, see the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures presented under Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Form 10-Q. 

&#8226; Expanding profitability. Third quarter 2022 ROA, ROE and the tangible return on average tangible equity of 1.86%, 20.30% and 22.16%, respectively, all expanded compared with third quarter 2021. Likewise, for the first nine months of 2022, ROA, ROE and the tangible return on average tangible equity of 1.70%, 18.35% and 20.04%, respectively, all expanded year-over-year. For additional details, see the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures presented under Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Form 10-Q. 

&#8226; Total assets reached $62.58 billion, growing by $1.71 billion or 3% from December 31, 2021, primarily driven by loan growth. 

&#8226; Total loans were $47.46 billion as of September 30, 2022, an increase of $5.76 billion or 14% from $41.69 billion as of December 31, 2021. This was primarily driven by well-diversified growth across the commercial real estate (&#8220;CRE&#8221;), residential mortgage, and commercial and industrial (&#8220;C&#38;I&#8221;) loan segments. 

&#8226; Total deposits were $53.86 billion as of September 30, 2022, an increase of $506.8 million or 1% from $53.35 billion as of December 31, 2021. Growth was primarily driven by increased time deposits, partially offset by decreases in noninterest-bearing demand and money market accounts. 

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income 

The Company&#8217;s primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the interest income earned on interest-earning assets less interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average interest-earning assets. Net interest income and net interest margin are impacted by several factors, including changes in average balances and the composition of interest-earning assets and funding sources, market interest rate fluctuations and the slope of the yield curve, repricing characteristics and maturity of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the volume of noninterest-bearing sources of funds, and asset quality. 

Third quarter 2022 net interest income before provision for credit losses was $551.8 million, an increase of $156.1 million or 39%, compared with $395.7 million for the third quarter 2021. For the first nine months of 2022, net interest income was $1.44 billion, an increase of $314.5 million or 28%, compared with $1.13 billion for the first nine months of 2021. Third quarter 2022 net interest margin was 3.68%, an increase of 98 bps from 2.70% for the third quarter of 2021. The year-over-year changes in net interest income and net interest margin primarily reflected higher loan yields, strong loan growth and higher debt securities yields. For the first nine months of 2022, net interest margin was 3.27%, an increase of 55 bps from 2.72% for the first nine months of 2021. The year-over-year changes in net interest income and net interest margin primarily reflected higher loan yields, strong loan growth and higher debt securities volume and yields. The changes in yields and rates reflected rising benchmark interest rates. 

Average interest-earning assets were $59.48 billion for the third quarter of 2022, an increase of $1.24 billion or 2% from $58.24 billion for the third quarter of 2021. For the first nine months of 2022, the average interest-earning assets were $58.95 billion, an increase of $3.60 billion or 7% from $55.35 billion for the first nine months of 2021. The increases in average interest-earning assets in both periods primarily reflected growth in loans and debt securities, partially offset by a decrease in interest-bearing cash and deposits with banks. 

The yield on average interest-earning assets for the third quarter of 2022 was 4.19%, an increase of 136 bps from 2.83% for the third quarter of 2021. The yield on average interest-earning assets for the first nine months of 2022 was 3.54%, an increase of 65 bps from 2.89% for the first nine months of 2021. The year-over-year changes in the yield on average interest-bearing assets primarily resulted from rising benchmark interest rates and a changed earning asset mix in favor of higher-yielding assets. 

The average loan yield for the third quarter of 2022 was 4.75%, an increase of 114 bps from 3.61% for the third quarter of 2021. The average loan yield for the first nine months of 2022 was 4.13%, an increase of 54 bps from 3.59% for the first nine months of 2021. The year-over-year changes in the average loan yield reflect the loan portfolio&#8217;s sensitivity to rising benchmark interest rates. Approximately 62% and 65% of loans held-for-investment were variable-rate or hybrid loans in their adjustable-rate period a s of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Deposits are an important source of funds and impact both net interest income and net interest margin. Average deposits were $54.05 billion for the third quarter of 2022, an increase of $554.9 million or 1% from $53.50 billion for the third quarter of 2021. For the first nine months of 2022, average deposits were $54.07 billion, an increase of $3.54 billion or 7% from $50.53 billion for the first nine months of 2021. Average noninterest-bearing deposits were $22.42 billion for the third quarter of 2022, a decrease of $745.7 million or 3% from $23.17 billion for the third quarter of 2021. For the first nine months of 2022, average noninterest-bearing deposits were $23.24 billion, an increase of $2.90 billion or 14% from $20.35 billion for the first nine months of 2021. Average noninterest-bearing deposits made up 41% and 43% of average deposits for the third quarters of 2022 and 2021, respectively, and 43% and 40% for the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

The average cost of deposits was 0.51% for the third quarter of 2022, a 39 bps increase from 0.12% for the third quarter of 2021. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.86% for the third quarter of 2022, a 65 bps increase from 0.21% for the third quarter of 2021. The average cost of deposits was 0.26% for the first nine months of 2022, an increase of 11 bps from 0.15% for the first nine months of 2021. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.45% for the first nine months of 2022, a 20 bps increase from 0.25% for the first nine months of 2021. The year-over-year increases primarily reflected higher rates paid on money market accounts and time deposits. 

The average cost of funds calculation includes deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) advances, repurchase agreements, long-term debt and short-term borrowings. For the third quarter of 2022, the average cost of funds was 0.55%, a 41 bps increase from 0.14% for the third quarter of 2021. For the first nine months of 2022, the average cost of funds was 0.29%, an 11 bps increase from 0.18% for the first nine months of 2021. The year-over-year changes in the average cost of funds were driven by the changes in the cost of deposits discussed above.

The following table summarizes the extent to which changes in (1) interest rates, and (2) volume of average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities affected the Company&#8217;s net interest income for the periods presented. The total change for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities is segmented into changes attributable to variations in volume and yield/rate. Changes that are not solely due to either volume or yield/rate are allocated proportionally based on the absolute value of the change related to average volume and average rate.

$ 75,552 &#160; $ 73,109 &#160; 3% $ 233,739 &#160; $ 214,406 &#160; 9% 

Noninterest income comprised 12% and 14% of total revenue for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2022, respectively, compared with 16% for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, respectively. Third quarter 2022 noninterest income was $75.6 million, an increase of $2.4 million or 3%, compared with $73.1 million for the same period in 2021. This increase was primarily due to increases in deposit account fees, wealth management fees and lending fees, partially offset by other investment loss and a decrease in foreign exchange income. Noninterest income for the first nine months of 2022 was $233.7 million, an increase of $19.3 million or 9%, compared with $214.4 million for the same period in 2021. This increase was primarily due to increases in deposit account fees, interest rate contracts and other derivative income; and lending fees, partially offset by lower other investment income. 

Lending fees were $20.3 million for the third quarter of 2022, an increase of $2.8 million or 16% compared with $17.5 million for the same period in 2021. This was primarily due to increased syndication, unused commitment and other loan fees. For the first nine months of 2022, lending fees were $59.9 million, an increase of $2.9 million or 5%, compared with $57.0 million for the same period in 2021. This was primarily due to increased unused commitment and other loan fees, partially offset by a decrease in syndication fees. 

Deposit account fees were $23.6 million for the third quarter of 2022, an increase of $5.1 million or 28%, compared with $18.5 million for the same period in 2021. For the first nine months of 2022, deposit account fees were $66.3 million, an increase of $15.1 million or 29%, compared with $51.2 million for the same period in 2021. These increases were primarily driven by growth in treasury management fees from commercial deposits. 

Interest rate contracts and other derivative income was $8.8 million for the third quarter of 2022, an increase of $1.6 million or 22%, compared with $7.2 million for the same period in 2021. For the first nine months of 2022, interest rate contracts and other derivative income was $29.7 million, an increase of $8.7 million or 42%, compared with $21.0 million for the same period in 2021. These increases were primarily due to higher favorable credit valuation adjustments during the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, compared with the same periods in 2021. 

Foreign exchange income was $10.1 million for the third quarter of 2022, a decrease of $3.0 million or 23%, compared with $13.1 million for the same period in 2021. For the first nine months of 2022, foreign exchange income was $34.1 million, a decrease of $1.5 million or 4%, compared with $35.6 million for the first nine months of 2021. The decreases for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, compared with the prior year periods, primarily reflected increased losses on foreign exchange trades, partially offset by the favorable valuation of certain foreign currency denominated balance sheet items. 

Wealth management fees were $8.9 million for the third quarter of 2022, an increase of $3.3 million or 59%, compared with $5.6 million for the same period in 2021. For the first nine months of 2022, wealth management fees were $21.5 million, an increase of $1.0 million or 5%, compared with $20.5 million for the first nine months of 2021. These increases were primarily due to a higher volume of customer activity. 

Other investment loss was $580 thousand for the third quarter of 2022, compared with income of $5.3 million for the same period in 2021. For the first nine months of 2022, other investment income was $5.9 million, a decrease of $8.0 million or 57% from $13.9 million for the first nine months of 2021. These decreases primarily reflected unfavorable equity valuation adjustments in the Company&#8217;s CRA investments in 2022, compared with the same year-ago periods. 

Noninterest Expense 

The following table presents the components of noninterest expense for the third quarters and first nine months of 2022 and 2021:

Third quarter 2022 noninterest expense was $216.0 million, an increase of $10.6 million or 5%, compared with $205.4 million for the same period in 2021. First nine months of 2022 noninterest expense was $602.3 million, an increase of $16.3 million or 3%, compared with $586.0 million for the same period in 2021. These increases were primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits and other operating expense, partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of tax credit and other investments. 

Compensation and employee benefits were $127.6 million for the third quarter of 2022, an increase of $21.8 million or 21%, compared with $105.8 million for the same period in 2021. For the first nine months of 2022, compensation and employee benefits were $357.2 million, an increase of $38.2 million or 12%, compared with $319.0 million for the same period in 2021. These increases were primarily due to headcount growth and the year-over-year change in deferred loan costs. 

Other operating expense was $28.1 million for the third quarter of 2022, an increase of $7.1 million or 34%, compared with $21.0 million for the same period in 2021, primarily due to a reduction in foreclosure related gains and interest expense paid on cash collateral. For the first nine months of 2022, other operating expense was $78.3 million, an increase of $19.8 million or 34%, compared with $58.5 million for the same period in 2021, primarily due to increased charitable contributions, foreclosure expenses, miscellaneous operational losses and travel-related expenses. 

Amortization of tax credit and other investments was $19.9 million for the third quarter of 2022, a decrease of $18.1 million or 48%, compared with $38.0 million for the same period in 2021. For the first nine months of 2022, amortization of tax credit and other investments was $48.8 million, a decrease of $41.9 million or 46%, compared with $90.7 million for the same period in 2021. The year-over-year change reflects the mix of tax credits being recognized, which have differing amortization periods, as well as the impact of investments that close in a given period.

Third quarter 2022 income tax expense was $89.0 million and the effective tax rate was 23.2%, compared with third quarter 2021 income tax expense of $48.0 million and an effective tax rate of 17.5%. For the first nine months of 2022, income tax expense was $232.0 million and the effective tax rate was 22.7%, compared with income tax expense of $124.1 million and an effective tax rate of 15.9% for the same period in 2021. The year-over-year increases in the income tax expense and the effective tax rate reflected a higher level of income before income taxes and a decrease in tax credits recognized in 2022. 

Operating Segment Results

(1) During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company enhanced its segment allocation methodology related to the fair values of interest rate and commodity derivative contracts, which are included in noninterest income. These fair values, which were previously allocated to the &#8220; Commercial Banking &#8221; segment prior to the fourth quarter of 2021, have since been reclassified between &#8220; Consumer and Business Banking &#8221; and &#8220; Commercial Banking .&#8221; Balances for the third quarter and nine months of 2021 have been reclassified to reflect these allocation changes for comparability. 

Consumer and Business Banking 

The Consumer and Business Banking segment primarily provides financial products and services to consumer and commercial customers through the Company&#8217;s domestic branch network. This segment offers consumer and commercial deposits, mortgage and home equity loans, and other products and services. It also originates commercial loans for small- and medium-sized enterprises. Other products and services provided by this segment include wealth management, treasury management, interest rate risk hedging and foreign exchange services.

(1) During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company enhanced its segment allocation methodology related to the fair values of interest rate and commodity derivative contracts, which are included in noninterest income. These fair values, which were previously allocated to the &#8220; Commercial Banking &#8221; segment prior to the fourth quarter of 2021, have since been reclassified between &#8220; Consumer and Business Banking &#8221; and &#8220; Commercial Banking .&#8221; Balances for the third quarter and nine months of 2021 have been reclassified to reflect these allocation changes for comparability. 

Consumer and Business Banking segment net income increased $97.4 million or 127% year-over-year to $174.0 million for the third quarter of 2022, and $209.4 million or 96% year-over-year to $426.7 million for the first nine months of 2022. The increases in both periods reflected revenue growth, partially offset by higher income tax expense and noninterest expense. Net interest income before provision for credit losses increased $149.7 million or 85% year-over-year to $326.4 million for the third quarter of 2022, and $323.6 million or 65% year-over-year to $824.0 million for the first nine months of 2022. The increases in both periods were primarily driven by higher deposit fund transfer pricing credits due to noninterest-bearing deposit growth, and higher loan interest income, primarily from growth in residential mortgage loans. Noninterest expense increased $13.4 million or 15% year-over-year to $104.0 million for the third quarter of 2022, and $26.9 million or 10% year-over-year to $294.4 million for the first nine months of 2022. The increases in both periods primarily reflected higher compensation and employee benefits expense. 

Commercial Banking 

The Commercial Banking segment primarily generates commercial loan and deposit products. Commercial loan products include CRE lending, construction finance, working capital lines of credit, trade finance, letters of credit, commercial business lending, affordable housing lending, asset-based lending, asset-backed finance, project finance and equipment financing. Commercial deposit products and other financial services include treasury management, foreign exchange services, and interest rate and commodity risk hedging.

Commercial Banking segment net income decreased $4.1 million or 3%, year-over-year to $122.9 million for the third quarter of 2022, due to increases in provision for credit losses and noninterest expense, partially offset by revenue growth. For the first nine months of 2022, this segment&#8217;s net income increased $24.0 million or 7% year-over-year to $384.2 million. This increase reflected revenue growth, partially offset by higher provision for credit losses and noninterest expense. Net interest income before provision for credit losses increased $33.2 million or 17% year-over-year to $223.0 million for the third quarter of 2022, and $102.5 million or 18% year-over-year to $662.0 million for the first nine months of 2022. The increases in both periods were primarily due to higher loan interest income from commercial loan growth. Provision for credit losses increased $29.3 million or 260% year-over-year to $18.0 million for the third quarter of 2022, and $57.9 million or 237% year-over-year to $33.5 million for the first nine months of 2022, primarily driven by the current macroeconomic outlook and commercial loan growth. Noninterest expense increased $14.7 million or 22% year-over-year to $81.4 million for the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits and higher corporate overhead allocations. For the first nine months of 2022, this segment&#8217;s noninterest expense increased $31.8 million or 16% year-over-year to $235.8 million, driven by increases in compensation and employee benefits, corporate overhead allocations and other operating expenses. 

Other 

Centralized functions, including the corporate treasury activities of the Company and eliminations of inter-segment amounts, have been aggregated and included in the Other segment, which provides broad administrative support to the two core segments, namely the Consumer and Business Banking, and the Commercial Banking segments. 

The following tables present additional financial information for the Other segment for the periods indicated:

The Other segment reported segment loss before income taxes of $32.1 million and segment net loss of $1.5 million for the third quarter of 2022, reflecting an income tax benefit of $30.6 million. For the first nine months of 2022, the Other segment reported segment loss before income taxes of $114.2 million and segment net loss of $19.6 million, reflecting an income tax benefit of $94.5 million. The increases in segment losses before income taxes for both periods were primarily driven by lower revenue, partially offset by decreases in noninterest expense. The $26.8 million and $111.6 million decreases in net interest income before provision for credit losses for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, compared to the same prior year periods, were primarily driven by lower FTP spread income absorbed by the Other segment, partially offset by an increase in interest income from investments due to a higher yield on debt securities for the third quarter of 2022, and a higher volume of debt securities for the first nine months of 2022. Noninterest expense decreased $17.5 million year-over-year to $30.6 million for the third quarter of 2022, and $42.3 million year-over-year to $72.1 million for the first nine months of 2022, primarily due to lower amortization of tax credits and other investments. 

The income tax expense or benefit in the Other segment consists of the remaining unallocated income tax expense or benefit after allocating income tax expense to the two core segments. Income tax expense is allocated to the Consumer and Business Banking and the Commercial Banking segments by applying statutory income tax rates to the segment income before income taxes. 

Balance Sheet Analysis 

Debt Securities 

The Company maintains a portfolio of high quality and liquid debt securities with a moderate duration profile. It closely manages the overall portfolio interest rate and liquidity risks. The Company&#8217;s debt securities provide: 

&#8226; interest income for earnings and yield enhancement; 

&#8226; availability for funding needs arising during the normal course of business; 

&#8226; the ability to execute interest rate risk management strategies in response to changes in economic or market conditions; and 

&#8226; collateral to support pledging agreements as required and/or to enhance the Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity. 

While the Company intends to hold its debt securities indefinitely, it may sell AFS securities in response to changes in the balance sheet and related interest rate risk to meet liquidity, regulatory and strategic requirements. 

The following table presents the distribution of the Company&#8217;s AFS and HTM debt securities portfolio as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and by credit ratings as of September 30, 2022:

(1) Credit ratings express opinions about the credit quality of a debt security. The Company determines the credit rating of a security according to the lowest credit rating made available by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (&#8220;NRSROs&#8221;). Debt securities rated investment grade, which are those with ratings similar to BBB- or above (as defined by NRSROs), are generally considered by the rating agencies and market participants to be low credit risk. Ratings percentages are allocated based on fair value. 

(2) For debt securities not rated by NRSROs, the Company uses other factors which include but are not limited to the priority in collections within the securitization structure, and whether the contractual payments have historically been on time. 

The Company&#8217;s AFS and HTM debt securities portfolios had an effective duration, defined as the sensitivity of the value of the portfolio to interest rate changes, of 5.3 as of September 30, 2022. This increased from 5.0 as of December 31, 2021, primarily due to both the upshifting and steepening of the yield curve. 

Available-for-Sale Debt Securities 

The fair value of the AFS debt securities portfolio totaled $5.91 billion as of September 30, 2022, a decrease of $4.06 billion or 41% from $9.97 billion as of December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to the Company&#8217;s transfer of $3.01 billion of AFS securities to HTM securities during the first quarter of 2022 and a decline in the portfolio valuation within the rising interest rate environment. For further discussion regarding the transfer, refer to the Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities section below. The Company&#8217;s AFS debt securities are carried at fair value with noncredit-related unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in Other comprehensive (loss) income on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Pre-tax net unrealized losses on AFS debt securities were $865.3 million as of September 30, 2022, compared with $121.8 million as of December 31, 2021. 

As of September 30, 2022, 96% of the carrying value of the AFS debt securities portfolio was rated investment grade by NRSROs, compared with 98% as of December 31, 2021. Of the AFS debt securities with gross unrealized losses, substantially all were rated investment grade as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. There was no allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, provided against the AFS debt securities. Additionally, there were no credit losses recognized in earnings for both the third quarters and first nine months of 2022 and 2021. For additional discussion on the allowance for credit losses, see Note 5 &#8212; Securities &#8212; Allowance for Credit Losses on Available-for-Sale Debt Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities 

During the first quarter of 2022, the Company transferred $3.01 billion in aggregate fair value of U.S. Treasury, government agency and government-sponsored enterprise debt and mortgage-back securities, and municipal securities from AFS to HTM. In comparison, there were no HTM debt securities as of December 31, 2021. The Company&#8217;s HTM debt securities are carried at amortized cost. The unrealized gains or losses at the date of transfer of these securities continue to be reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;), net of tax on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are amortized over the remaining life of the securities. 

All HTM debt securities were issued, guaranteed, or supported by the U.S. government or government-sponsored enterprises. Accordingly, the Company applied a zero credit loss assumption for these securities and no allowance for credit loss was recorded as of September 30, 2022. For additional discussion on the allowance for credit losses, see Note 5 &#8212; Securities &#8212; Allowance for Credit Losses on Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

For additional information on AFS and HTM securities, see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K and Note 2 &#8212; Current Accounting Developments and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 3 &#8212; Fair Value Measurement and Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Note 5 &#8212; Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

Loan Portfolio 

The Company offers a broad range of financial products designed to meet the credit needs of its borrowers. The Company&#8217;s loan portfolio segments include commercial loans, which consist of C&#38;I, CRE, multifamily residential, construction and land loans, and consumer loans, which consist of single-family residential, home equity lines of credit (&#8220;HELOCs&#8221;), and other consumer loans. Total net loans were $46.87 billion as of September 30, 2022, an increase of $5.72 billion or 14% from $41.15 billion as of December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily driven by well-diversified growth throughout our major loan categories including increases of $2.53 billion or 16% in total CRE loans, $1.80 billion or 16% in residential mortgage loans, and $1.47 billion or 10% in C&#38;I loans. The composition of the loan portfolio as of September 30, 2022 was similar to the composition as of December 31, 2021.

Because 72% and 75% of total CRE loans were concentrated in California as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, changes in California&#8217;s economy and real estate values could have a significant impact on the collectability of these loans and the required level of allowance for loan losses.

Consumer &#8212; Single-Family Residential Mortgages. Single-family residential loans totaled $10.86 billion or 23% of total loans held-for-investment as of September 30, 2022, compared with $9.09 billion or 22% of total loans held-for-investment as of December 31, 2021. Year-to-date, single-family residential mortgages increased $1.76 billion or 19%, primarily driven by net growth in California and New York. The Company was in a first lien position for all of its single-family residential loans as of both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Many of these loans are reduced documentation loans, for which a substantial down payment is required, resulting in a low LTV ratio at origination, typically 65% or less. These loans have historically experienced low delinquency and loss rates. The Company offers a variety of single-family residential first lien mortgage loan programs, including fixed- and variable-rate loans, as well as hybrid loans with interest rates that adjust on a regular basis, typically each year, after an initial fixed rate period.

These loans have historically experienced low delinquency and loss rates. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s HELOCs were variable-rate loans as of both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

All originated commercial and consumer loans are subject to the Company&#8217;s underwriting guidelines and loan origination standards. Management believes that the Company&#8217;s underwriting criteria and procedures adequately consider the unique risks associated with these products. The Company conducts a variety of quality control procedures and periodic audits, including the review of lending and legal requirements, to ensure that the Company is in compliance with these requirements. 

Foreign Outstandings 

The Company&#8217;s overseas offices, which include the branch in Hong Kong and the subsidiary bank in China, are subject to the general risks inherent in conducting business in foreign countries, such as regulatory, economic and political uncertainties. As such, the Company&#8217;s international operation risk exposure is largely concentrated in China and Hong Kong. In addition, the Company&#8217;s financial assets held in the Hong Kong branch and the subsidiary bank in China may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors.

The year-to-date decrease in the Company&#8217;s stockholders&#8217; equity was primarily due to a negative change in AOCI of $709.7 million, $172.1 million in common dividends declared, and $100.0 million in common stock repurchases, partially offset by $791.3 million in net income. The negative change in AOCI was primarily due to increased unrealized losses in AFS debt securities. For other factors that contributed to the changes in stockholders&#8217; equity, refer to Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements &#8212; Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders&#8217; Equit y in this Form 10-Q. 

Book value was $40.17 per common share as of September 30, 2022, a decrease of 2% from $41.13 per common share as of December 31, 2021, primarily as a result of the factors described above. Tangible equity per common share was $36.80 as of September 30, 2022, compared with $37.79 as of December 31, 2021.

Additional funding is provided by short- and long-term borrowings, and long-term debt. See Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Risk Management &#8212; Liquidity Risk Management &#8212; Liquidity in this Form 10-Q for a discussion of the Company&#8217;s liquidity management. The following table summarizes the Company&#8217;s sources of funds as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021:

Deposits 

The Company offers a wide variety of deposit products to consumer and commercial customers. To provide a stable and low-cost source of funding and liquidity, the Company&#8217;s strategy is to grow and retain relationship-based deposits. Total deposits were $53.86 billion as of September 30, 2022, an increase of $506.8 million or 1% from $53.35 billion as of December 31, 2021. The increase in deposits was primarily due to growth in time deposits, partially offset by decreases in noninterest-bearing demand and money market deposits. This move from noninterest-bearing and lower paying non-maturity deposits to time deposits was largely driven by continued increases in benchmark rates. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits comprised 40% and 43% of total deposits as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

Additional information regarding the impact of deposits on net interest income, with a comparison of average deposit balances and rates, is provided in Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Results of Operations &#8212; Net Interest Income in this Form 10-Q. See also the discussion of the impact of deposits on liquidity at Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Liquidity Risk Management &#8212; Liquidity in this Form 10-Q. 

Other Sources of Funding 

The Company had an outstanding overnight federal funds purchase of $200.0 million, with a fixed interest rate of 3.11% as of September 30, 2022. There was no outstanding overnight federal funds purchase as of December 31, 2021. 

As of September 30, 2022, the Company had FHLB advances of $324.9 million, compared with advances totaling $249.3 million as of December 31, 2021. As of September 30, 2022, the FHLB advances were comprised of an overnight advance of $250.0 million with a fixed interest rate of 3.22% and a term advance of $74.9 million with a floating interest rate of 3.25% that matures in November 2022. 

Gross repurchase agreements totaled $611.8 million and $300.0 million as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Resale and repurchase agreements are reported net, pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 210-20-45-11, Balance Sheet Offsetting: Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements . As of both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company did not have any gross resale agreements that were eligible for netting pursuant to ASC 210-20-45-11. The weighted-average interest rates were 2.81% and 2.57% for the third quarters of 2022 and 2021, respectively; and 2.73% and 2.62% for the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, gross repurchase agreements had original terms between six months and nine years and remaining maturities between three months and 11 months. 

Repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and recorded as liabilities based on the values at which the assets are sold. As of September 30, 2022, the collateral for the repurchase agreements was comprised of U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasury securities. To ensure the market value of the underlying collateral remains sufficient, the Company monitors the fair value of collateral pledged relative to the principal amounts borrowed under repurchase agreements. The Company manages liquidity risks related to the repurchase agreements by sourcing funds from a diverse group of counterparties, and entering into repurchase agreements with longer durations, when appropriate. For additional details, see Note 4 &#8212; Assets Purchased under Resale Agreements and Sold under Repurchase Agreements to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

The Company uses long-term debt to provide funding to acquire interest-earning assets, and to enhance liquidity and regulatory capital adequacy. Long-term debt totaled $147.9 million and $147.7 million as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Long-term debt consists of junior subordinated debt, which qualifies as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes. The junior subordinated debt was issued in connection with the Company&#8217;s various pooled trust preferred securities offerings, as well as with common stock issued by the six wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company in conjunction with these offerings. The junior subordinated debt had weighted-average interest rates of 2.86% and 1.74% for the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, respectively, with remaining maturities ranging between 12.2 years and 15.0 years as of September 30, 2022. 

Regulatory Capital and Ratios 

The federal banking agencies have risk-based capital adequacy requirements intended to ensure that banking organizations maintain capital that is commensurate with the degree of risk associated with their operations. The Company and the Bank are each subject to these regulatory capital adequacy requirements. See Item 1. Business &#8212; Supervision and Regulation &#8212; Regulatory Capital Requirements and Regulatory Capital-Related Development in the Company&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K for additional details. 

The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, which requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses to be based on management&#8217;s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Company&#8217;s relevant financial assets. The Company has elected the phase-in option provided by a final rule that delays an estimate of the current expected credit losses methodology (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) effect on regulatory capital for two years and phases in the impact over three years. The rule permits certain banking organizations to exclude from regulatory capital the initial adoption impact of CECL, plus 25% of the cumulative changes in the allowance for credit losses under CECL for each period until December 31, 2021, followed by a three-year phase-out period in which the aggregate benefit is reduced by 25% in 2022, 50% in 2023 and 75% in 2024. Accordingly, the capital ratios as of September 30, 2022 delayed 75% of the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital through the year 2021. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s capital ratios as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, under the Basel III Capital Rules, and those required by regulatory agencies for capital adequacy and well-capitalized classification purposes: 

Basel III Capital Rules September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Minimum Regulatory Requirements Minimum Regulatory Requirements including Capital Conservation Buffer Well- Capitalized Requirements Company Bank Company Bank Risk-based capital ratios: Common Equity Tier 1 capital 12.3 % 12.1 % 12.8 % 12.3 % 4.5 % 7.0 % 6.5 % Tier 1 capital (1)

9.6 % 9.4 % 9.0 % 8.6 % 4.0 % 4.0 % 5.0 % 

(1) The Tier 1 leverage well-capitalized requirement applies only to the Bank since there is no Tier 1 leverage ratio component in the definition of a well-capitalized bank holding company. The minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio requirement for the Company to be considered well-capitalized is 6.0%. 

The Company is committed to maintaining strong capital levels to assure its investors, customers and regulators that the Company and the Bank are financially sound. As of both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company and the Bank continued to exceed all &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; capital requirements and the required minimum capital requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules. Total risk-weighted assets were $49.27 billion as of September 30, 2022, an increase of $5.68 billion or 13% from $43.59 billion as of December 31, 2021. The increase in the risk-weighted assets was primarily due to loan growth. 

Risk Management 

Overview 

In the normal course of conducting its business, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent to the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to the Company&#8217;s businesses. The Company operates under a Board-approved enterprise risk management (&#8220;ERM&#8221;) framework, which outlines the company-wide approach to risk management and oversight, and describes the structures and practices employed to manage the current and emerging risks inherent to the Company. The Company&#8217;s ERM program incorporates risk management throughout the organization in identifying, managing, monitoring, and reporting risks. It identifies the Company&#8217;s major risk categories as credit risk, liquidity risk, capital risk, market risk, operational risk, compliance and regulatory risks, legal risks, strategic risks, and reputational risks. 

The Risk Oversight Committee of the Board of Directors monitors the ERM program through established risk categories and provides oversight of the Company&#8217;s risk appetite and control environment. The Risk Oversight Committee provides focused oversight of the Company&#8217;s identified enterprise risk categories on behalf of the full Board of Directors. Under the direction of the Risk Oversight Committee, management committees apply targeted strategies to reduce the risks to which the Company&#8217;s operations are exposed. 

The Company&#8217;s ERM program is executed along the three lines of defense model, which provides for a consistent and standardized risk management control environment across the enterprise. The first line of defense is comprised of production, operational, and support units. The second line of defense is comprised of various risk management and control functions charged with monitoring and managing specific major risk categories and/or risk subcategories. The third line of defense is comprised of the Internal Audit function and Independent Asset Review (&#8220;IAR&#8221;). Internal Audit and IAR provides assurance and evaluates the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes as established by the Company. Reporting directly to the Board&#8217;s Audit Committee, Internal Audit maintains organizational independence and objectivity. Further discussion and analysis of the primary risk areas are detailed in the following subsections of Risk Management. 

Credit Risk Management 

Credit risk is the risk that a borrower or a counterparty will fail to perform according to the terms and conditions of a loan or investment and expose the Company to loss. Credit risk exists with many of the Company&#8217;s assets and exposures such as loans and certain derivatives. The majority of the Company&#8217;s credit risk is associated with lending activities. 

The Risk Oversight Committee has primary oversight responsibility for identified enterprise risk categories including credit risk. The Risk Oversight Committee monitors management&#8217;s assessment of asset quality, credit risk trends, credit quality administration, underwriting standards, and portfolio credit risk management strategies and processes, such as diversification and concentration limits, all of which enable management to control credit risk. At the management level, the Credit Risk Management Committee has primary oversight responsibility for credit risk. The Senior Credit Supervision function manages credit policy for the line of business transactional credit risk, assuring that all exposure is risk-rated according to the requirements of the credit risk rating policy. The Senior Credit Supervision function evaluates and reports the overall credit risk exposure to senior management and the Risk Oversight Committee. Reporting directly to the Board&#8217;s Risk Oversight Committee, the Independent Asset Review function provides additional support to the Company&#8217;s strong credit risk management culture by providing an independent and objective assessment of underwriting and documentation quality. A key focus of our credit risk management is adherence to a well-controlled underwriting process. 

The Company assesses the overall credit quality performance of the loans held-for-investment portfolio through an integrated analysis of specific performance ratios. This approach forms the basis of the discussion in the sections immediately following: Nonperforming Assets, Troubled Debt Restructurings (&#8220;TDR&#8221;) and Allowance for Credit Losses. 

Credit Quality 

The Company utilizes a credit risk rating system to assist in monitoring credit quality. Loans are evaluated using the Company&#8217;s internal credit risk rating of 1 through 10. For more information on the Company&#8217;s credit quality indicators and internal credit risk ratings, refer to Note 7 &#8212; Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets are comprised of nonaccrual loans, other real estate owned (&#8220;OREO&#8221;) and other nonperforming assets. Other nonperforming assets and OREO are repossessed assets and properties, respectively, acquired through foreclosure, or through full or partial satisfaction of loans held-for-investment. Nonperforming assets were $97.0 million or 0.16% of total assets as of September 30, 2022, a decrease of $6.4 million or 6%, compared with $103.5 million or 0.17% of total assets as of December 31, 2021.

Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due or when the full collection of principal or interest becomes uncertain regardless of the length of past due status. Collectability is generally assessed based on economic and business conditions, the borrower&#8217;s financial condition, and the adequacy of collateral, if any. For additional details regarding the Company&#8217;s nonaccrual loan policy, see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Loans Held-for-Investment to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K. 

Nonaccrual loans were $82.5 million as of September 30, 2022, a decrease of $10.6 million or 11% from $93.2 million as of December 31, 2021. This decrease was predominantly the result of charge-offs and paydowns of commercial loans. As of September 30, 2022, $54.4 million or 66% of nonaccrual loans were less than 90 days delinquent. In comparison, $54.2 million or 58%, of nonaccrual loans were less than 90 days delinquent as of December 31, 2021.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

TDRs are loans for which contractual terms have been modified by the Company for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, and for which a concession to the borrower was granted that the Company would not otherwise consider. The Company&#8217;s loan modifications are handled on a case-by-case basis and are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan collectability and meet the borrower&#8217;s financial needs. The following table presents the performing and nonperforming TDRs by portfolio segment as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The allowance for loan losses for TDRs was $16.9 million as of September 30, 2022 and $4.8 million as of December 31, 2021. 

($ in thousands) September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Performing TDRs Nonperforming TDRs Total Performing TDRs Nonperforming TDRs Total Commercial: C&#38;I $ 58,273 $ 32,121 $ 90,394 $ 77,256 $ 28,239 $ 105,495 CRE: CRE 22,768 &#8212; 22,768 23,379 &#8212; 23,379 Multifamily residential 3,876 174 4,050 4,042 197 4,239 Total CRE 26,644 174 26,818 27,421 197 27,618 Consumer: Residential mortgage: Single-family residential 4,786 68 4,854 6,585 1,102 7,687 HELOCs 2,244 325 2,569 2,553 845 3,398 Total residential mortgage 7,030 393 7,423 9,138 1,947 11,085 Total TDRs $ 91,947 &#160; $ 32,688 &#160; $ 124,635 &#160; $ 113,815 &#160; $ 30,383 &#160; $ 144,198 &#160; 

Performing TDRs were $91.9 million as of September 30, 2022, a decrease of $21.9 million or 19% from $113.8 million as of December 31, 2021. This decrease primarily reflected the payoffs and paydowns of performing C&#38;I and single-family residential TDR loans. Approximately 94% of the performing TDRs were current as of both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Nonperforming TDRs were $32.7 million as of September 30, 2022, an increase of $2.3 million or 8% from $30.4 million as of December 31, 2021 . This increase primarily reflected newly designated nonperforming C&#38;I TDR loans , partially offset by payoffs and paydowns of C&#38;I and single-family residential nonperforming TDR loans. 

Existing TDRs that were subsequently modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be classified as TDRs. Customers who require further assistance upon exiting from the COVID-19 deferral programs may receive further modifications which may be classified as TDRs. As of September 30, 2022, there were no TDRs that were provided modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the amount of TDRs that were provided modification related to the COVID-19 pandemic were insignificant as of December 31, 2021 . 

Loan Modifications Due to COVID-19 Pandemic 

The Company has granted a range of commercial and consumer loan accommodations, predominantly in the form of payment deferrals, to provide relief to borrowers experiencing financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For COVID-19 related loan modifications, which occurred between March 1, 2020 through January 1, 2022, that have met the loan modification criteria under Section 4013 of the CARES Act, as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, or under the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised), the Company elected to temporarily suspend TDR accounting under ASC Subtopic 310-40, Receivables &#8212; Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors. As of September 30, 2022, COVID-19 loans under payment deferral and forbearance programs totaled $42.4 million, or 0.1% of total loans, compared with $363.1 million, or 0.9% of total loans as of December 31, 2021 . Loans that have exited the modification program were substantially all current as of September 30, 2022. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

ASU 2016-13, Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses to be based on management&#8217;s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Company&#8217;s relevant financial assets. The allowance for credit losses estimate uses various models and estimation techniques based on historical loss experience, current borrower characteristics, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and other relevant factors. 

In addition to the allowance for loan losses, the Company maintains an allowance for unfunded credit commitments. The Company has three general areas for which it provides the allowance for unfunded credit commitments: (1) recourse obligations for loans sold, (2) letters of credit, and (3) unfunded lending commitments. The Company&#8217;s methodology for determining the allowance calculation for unfunded lending commitments uses the lifetime loss rates of the on-balance sheet commitment. Recourse obligations for loans sold and letters of credit use the weighted loss rates for the applicable segment of the individual credit. 

In the case of loans and securities, allowance for credit losses are contra-asset valuation accounts that are deducted from the amortized cost basis of these assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. In the case of unfunded credit commitments, the allowance for credit losses is a liability account that is reported as a component of Accrued expenses and other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

The Company is committed to maintaining the allowance for credit losses at a level that is commensurate with the estimated inherent losses in the loan portfolio, including unfunded credit facilities. While the Company believes that the allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2022 was appropriate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio and in unfunded credit commitments based on the information available, future allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to, accounting standard and regulatory changes, loan growth, portfolio performance and general economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires numerous estimates and judgements. For a description of the policies, methodologies and judgments used to determine the allowance for credit losses, see Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Critical Accounting Estimates and Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K, and Note 7 &#8212; Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.

The allowance for loan losses was $582.5 million as of September 30, 2022, an increase of $40.9 million from $541.6 million as of December 31, 2021, primarily reflecting of our current macroeconomic outlook and loan growth. Third quarter 2022 net charge-offs were $6.6 million, or annualized 0.06% of average loans held-for-investment, compared with net charge-offs of $13.5 million, or annualized 0.13% of average loans held-for-investment, for the third quarter of 2021. The decrease in net charge-offs for the third quarter of 2022 compared with the same period in 2021 was primarily due to a decrease in CRE charge-offs, partially offset by increases in multifamily residential and C&#38;I charge-offs. In the first nine months of 2022, net charge-offs were $8.3 million, or annualized 0.02% of average loans held-for investment, compared with $40.2 million or annualized 0.14% of average loans held-for-investment for the first nine months of 2021. The decrease in net charge-offs for the first nine months of 2022, compared with the same period in 2021, was mainly due to a decrease in CRE charge-offs and an increase in C&#38;I recoveries. 

The Company considers multiple economic scenarios to develop the estimate of the allowance for loan losses. The scenarios may consist of a baseline forecast representing management's view of the most likely outcome, and downside or upside scenarios reflecting possible worsening or improving economic conditions. As of September 30, 2022, the Company assigned a lower weighting to its downside scenario and higher weightings to the baseline and upside scenarios, compared with the weightings assigned as of December 31, 2021. The current forecast as of September 30, 2022 incorporates an updated impact of high inflation, lower than previously expected annual Gross Domestic Product (&#8220;GDP&#8221;) growth, rising interest rates, and continued global oil and supply chain issues caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Macroeconomic assumptions underlying the baseline forecast include annual GDP growth of 1.6% and 1.4% for 2022 and 2023, respectively, and the unemployment rate to average 3.7% and 3.9% for 2022 and 2023, respectively. The downside scenario assumed annual GDP growth of 1.5% in 2022 dropping to a 2.0% decline for 2023, and the unemployment rate to rise from a 4.2% average for 2022 to a 7.3% average for 2023. The upside scenario assumed annual GDP growth of 1.9% and 4.1% for 2022 and 2023, respectively, and the unemployment rate to improve from an average of 3.6% for 2022 to 3.3% for 2023. 

As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, PPP loans outstanding were $110.9 million and $534.2 million, respectively. Because these loans are fully guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, there was no allowance for loan losses established for these loans as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 . 

The allowance for unfunded credit commitments was $24.0 million as of September 30, 2022, compared with $27.5 million as of December 31, 2021. 

Liquidity Risk Management 

Liquidity 

Liquidity is a financial institution&#8217;s capacity to meet its deposit and obligations to other counterparties as they come due, or to obtain adequate funding at a reasonable cost to meet those obligations. The objective of liquidity management is to manage the potential mismatch of asset and liability cash flows. Maintaining an adequate level of liquidity depends on the institution&#8217;s ability to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected cash flows, and collateral needs without adversely affecting daily operations or the financial condition of the institution. To achieve this objective, the Company analyzes its liquidity risk, maintains readily available liquid assets, and utilizes diverse funding sources including its stable core deposit base. 

The Board of Directors&#8217; Risk Oversight Committee has primary oversight responsibility over liquidity risk management. At the management level, the Company&#8217;s Asset/Liability Committee (&#8220;ALCO&#8221;) establishes the liquidity guidelines that govern the day-to-day active management of the Company&#8217;s liquidity position by requiring sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. These guidelines are established and monitored for both the Bank and East West on a stand-alone basis to ensure that the Company can serve as a source of strength for its subsidiaries. The ALCO regularly monitors the Company&#8217;s liquidity status and related management processes, providing regular reports to the Board of Directors. The Company&#8217;s liquidity management practices have been effective under normal operating and stressed market conditions. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Liquidity Sources. The Company&#8217;s primary source of funding is from deposits generated by its banking business, which are relatively stable and low-cost. Total deposits amounted to $53.86 billion as of September 30, 2022, compared with $53.35 billion as of December 31, 2021. The Company&#8217;s loan-to-deposit ratio was 88% as of September 30, 2022, compared with 78% as of December 31, 2021. 

In addition to deposits, the Company has access to various sources of wholesale financing, including borrowing capacity with the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (&#8220;FRBSF&#8221;), unsecured federal funds lines of credit with various correspondent banks, and several master repurchase agreements with major brokerage companies to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio, meet daily cash demands and allow management flexibility to execute its business strategy. Economic conditions and the stability of capital markets impact the Company&#8217;s access to and the cost of wholesale financing. The Company&#8217;s access to capital markets is also affected by the ratings received from various credit rating agencies. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had available borrowing capacity of $20.51 billion. The available borrowing capacity included $10.88 billion with the FHLB, $2.17 billion with the FRBSF, unsecured federal funds lines of credit with correspondent banks of $936.0 million, and borrowing capacity from unpledged debt securities of $6.52 billion. Unencumbered loans and/or debt securities were pledged to the FHLB and the FRBSF discount window as collateral. The Company has established operational procedures to enable borrowing against these assets, including regular monitoring of the total pool of loans and debt securities eligible as collateral. Eligibility of collateral is defined in guidelines from the FHLB and FRBSF and is subject to change at their discretion. The Company believes that its liquidity sources are sufficient to meet all reasonably foreseeable short-term needs. See Item 2 &#8212; MD&#38;A &#8212; Balance Sheet Analysis &#8212; Deposits and Other Sources of Funding in this Form 10-Q for further detail related to the Company&#8217;s funding sources. 

The Company maintains a certain level of liquid assets in the form of cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing deposits with banks, short-term resale agreements and unencumbered high-quality and liquid AFS debt securities. The following table presents the Company&#8217;s liquid assets as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021: 

($ in thousands) September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Encumbered Unencumbered Total Encumbered Unencumbered Total Cash and cash equivalents $ &#8212; $ 2,163,353 $ 2,163,353 $ &#8212; $ 3,912,935 $ 3,912,935 Interest-bearing deposits with banks &#8212; 630,543 630,543 &#8212; 736,492 736,492 Resale agreements due to mature in one year &#8212; 407,986 407,986 &#8212; 1,818,503 1,818,503 AFS debt securities: U.S. Treasury, and U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise debt securities 273,735 587,366 861,101 384,895 1,949,757 2,334,652 U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities 189,722 2,125,592 2,315,314 418,761 3,738,502 4,157,263 Foreign government bonds &#8212; 225,810 225,810 &#8212; 257,733 257,733 Municipal securities &#8212; 249,502 249,502 &#8212; 523,158 523,158 Non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and CLOs 181 1,724,617 1,724,798 240 2,042,642 2,042,882 Corporate debt securities &#8212; 529,565 529,565 &#8212; 649,665 649,665 Total $ 463,638 &#160; $ 8,644,334 &#160; $ 9,107,972 &#160; $ 803,896 &#160; $ 15,629,387 &#160; $ 16,433,283 &#160; 

Unencumbered liquid assets totaled $8.64 billion as of September 30, 2022, compared with $15.63 billion as of December 31, 2021. AFS debt securities, included as part of liquidity sources, consist of high quality and liquid securities with moderate durations to minimize overall interest rate and liquidity risks. The Company believes these AFS debt securities provide quick sources of liquidity to obtain financing, regardless of market conditions, through sale or pledging. The decrease in liquid assets was primarily related to the transfer of $3.01 billion of debt securities from AFS to HTM during the first quarter of 2022, a decrease in cash and cash equivalents driven by loan funding activities, a decrease in resale agreements primarily due to repayments, and a decrease in fair value of AFS debt securities primarily due to interest rate increases. 

Management believes that the Company&#8217;s excess cash, unencumbered AFS debt securities, borrowing capacity and access to sufficient sources of capital are adequate to meet its short- and long-term liquidity needs in the foreseeable future. In addition, the Company may use debt and equity issuances when costs are deemed attractive, should longer term needs arise. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Cash Requirements. In the ordinary course of the Company&#8217;s business, the Company enters into contractual obligations that require future cash payments, including funding for customer deposit withdrawals, repayments for short- and long-term borrowings, leases obligations and other cash commitments. The Company also has off-balance sheet arrangements which represent transactions that are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company&#8217;s off-balance sheet arrangements include (1) commitments to extend credit, such as loan commitments, commercial letters of credit for foreign and domestic trade, standby letters of credit (&#8220;SBLCs&#8221;), and financial guarantees, to meet the financing needs of its customers, (2) future interest obligations related to customer deposits and the Company&#8217;s borrowings, and (3) transactions with unconsolidated entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company, or engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the Company. Since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future funding requirements. Information about the Company&#8217;s loan commitments, commercial letters of credit and SBLCs is provided in Note 10 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. The Company&#8217;s liquidity sources have been, and are expected to be, sufficient to meet all such cash requirements. 

The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows summarizes the Company&#8217;s sources and uses of cash by type of activities for the first nine months of 2022 and 2021. Excess cash generated by operating and investing activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Liquidity for East West. In addition to bank level liquidity management, the Company manages liquidity at the parent company level for various operating needs including payment of dividends, repurchases of common stock, principal and interest payments on its borrowings, acquisitions and additional investments in its subsidiaries. East West&#8217;s primary source of liquidity is from cash dividends distributed by its subsidiary, East West Bank. The Bank is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends as discussed in Item 1 . Business &#8212; Supervision and Regulation &#8212; Dividends and Other Transfers of Funds of the Company&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K. East West held $226.5 million and $345.0 million in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Management believes that East West has sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet the projected cash obligations for the current year. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Liquidity Stress Testing. The Company utilizes liquidity stress analysis to determine the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the Company, foreign subsidiary and foreign branch levels needed to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. Scenario analyses include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources, market triggers, potential uses of funding and economic conditions in certain countries. In addition, Company specific events are incorporated into the stress testing. Liquidity stress tests are conducted to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons, both immediate and longer term, and over a variety of stressed conditions. Given the range of potential stresses, the Company maintains contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for individual entities. 

As of September 30, 2022, the Company was not aware of any material commitments for capital expenditures in the foreseeable future and believes it has adequate liquidity resources to conduct operations and meet other needs in the ordinary course of business. Given the uncertainty and the rapidly changing market and economic conditions, the Company will continue to actively evaluate the impact on its business and financial position. For more information on how economic conditions may impact our liquidity, see Item 1A . Risk Factors of the Company&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K. 

Market Risk Management 

Market risk is the risk that the Company&#8217;s financial condition may change resulting from adverse movements in market rates or prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, interest rate contracts prices, investment securities prices, credit spreads, and related risk due to mismatches in rate sensitive assets and liabilities. In the event of market stress, the risk could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. 

The Board&#8217;s Risk Oversight Committee has primary oversight responsibility over market risk management. At the management level, the ALCO establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market risk management activities. Corporate Treasury supports the ALCO in measuring, monitoring, and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks. 

Interest Rate Risk Management 

Interest rate risk results primarily from the Company&#8217;s traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans, which are the primary areas of market risk for the Company. Economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates, and consumer preferences impact the level of noninterest-bearing funding sources at the Company, as well as affect the difference between the interest the Company earns on interest-earning assets and pays on interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, changes in interest rates can influence the rate of principal prepayments on loans and the speed of deposit withdrawals. Due to the pricing term mismatches and the embedded options inherent in certain products, changes in market interest rates affect not only the expected near-term earnings, but also the economic value of these interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Other market risks include foreign currency exchange risk and equity price risk. These risks are not considered significant to the Company and no separate quantitative information concerning these risks is presented herein. 

Under the oversight of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, the ALCO coordinates the overall management of the Company&#8217;s interest rate risk. The ALCO meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing the Company&#8217;s open market positions and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposures to market risk. Management of interest rate risk is carried out primarily through strategies involving the Company&#8217;s debt securities portfolio, loan portfolio, available funding channels, and capital market activities. In addition, the Company&#8217;s policies permit the use of derivative instruments to assist in managing interest rate risk. 

The interest rate risk exposure is measured and monitored through various risk management tools, which include a simulation model that performs interest rate sensitivity analyses under various interest rate scenarios. The model incorporates the Company&#8217;s cash instruments, loans, debt securities, resale agreements, deposits, borrowings and repurchase agreements, as well as financial instruments from the Company&#8217;s foreign operations. The Company uses both a static balance sheet and a forward growth balance sheet to perform the interest rate sensitivity analyses. The simulated interest rate scenarios include an instantaneous non-parallel shift in the yield curve and a gradual non-parallel shift in the yield curve (&#8220;rate ramp&#8221;) over a static balance sheet. In addition, the Company also performs simulations using other alternative interest rate scenarios, including various permutations of the yield curve flattening, steepening or inverting. Results of these various simulations are used to formulate and gauge strategies to achieve a desired risk profile within the Company&#8217;s capital and liquidity guidelines. 

The net interest income simulation model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of the Company&#8217;s interest-rate sensitive assets, liabilities, and related derivative contracts. It also incorporates various assumptions, which management believes to be reasonable but may have a significant impact on the results. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the timing and magnitude of changes in interest rates, the yield curve evolution and shape, the correlation between various interest rate indices, financial instruments&#8217; future repricing characteristics and spread relative to benchmark rates, and the effect of interest rate floors and caps. The modeled results are highly sensitive to deposit decay and deposit beta assumptions, which are derived from a regression analysis of the Company&#8217;s historical deposit data. The Company used full- through-the-economic-cycle betas with each incremental rate increase in the rate ramp scenarios, and did not assume lags in repricing. Deposit beta commonly refers to the correlation of the changes in interest rates paid on deposits to changes in the benchmark interest rates. The model is also sensitive to the loan and investment prepayment assumptions that are based on an independent model and the Company&#8217;s historical prepayment data, which consider anticipated prepayments under different interest rate environments. 

Simulation results are highly dependent on input assumptions. To the extent the actual behavior is different from the assumptions used in the models, there could be material changes in interest rate sensitivity results. The assumptions applied in the model are documented, supported, and periodically back-tested to assess the reasonableness and effectiveness. The Company makes appropriate calibrations to the model as needed and continually validates the model, methodology and results. Changes to key model assumptions are reviewed by the ALCO. Scenario results do not reflect strategies that the management could employ to limit the impact of changing interest rate expectations. 

In March 2022, the Federal Reserve raised the target range for the fed funds rate to 0.25% to 0.50% to address concerns about inflation, which reflected supply and demand imbalances due to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. The Federal Reserve has continued its aggressive approach in responding to inflation and raised the target range for the fed funds rate to 3.75% to 4.00% on November 2, 2022. The market estimates that interest rates are likely to continue to rise, potentially reaching 4.25% to 4.5% by the end of 2022. 

Twelve-Month Net Interest Income Simulation 

Net interest income simulation modeling measures interest rate risk through earnings volatility. The simulation projects the cash flow changes in interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities, expressed in terms of net interest income, over a specified time horizon for defined interest rate scenarios. Net interest income simulations provide insight into the impact of market rates changes on earnings, which help guide risk management decisions. The Company assesses interest rate risk by comparing the changes of net interest income in different interest rate scenarios. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s net interest income sensitivity related to an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates by 100 and 200 bps as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, based on a static balance sheet as of the date of the analysis. 

Change in Interest Rates (in bps) Net Interest Income Volatility (1) 

September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 +200 11.7 % 19.5 % +100 6.0 % 9.4 % -100 (5.2) % NM -200 (10.2) % NM 

NM &#8212; Not meaningful. 

(1) The percentage change represents net interest income change over 12 month period in a stable interest rate environment versus in the various interest rate scenarios. 

The composition of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the faster repricing of the floating-rate loan portfolio than the deposit products. Growth and/or contraction in the Company&#8217;s loans, other earning assets, deposits, and borrowings may lead to changes in the sensitivity to interest rate movements. Year-to-date decreases in cash and cash equivalents, resale agreements, and short-term investments, together with growth in fixed-rate loans, as well as the interest rate hedging activities and changes in the funding mix have decreased the Company&#8217;s asset sensitivity. In the table above, net interest income volatility is expressed in relation to the base-case net interest income, which increased between September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, due to balance sheet growth and an expanded base-case net interest margin. 

While an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates was used in the simulation model described in the preceding paragraph, the Company also models scenarios based on gradual shifts in interest rates and assesses the corresponding impacts. These interest rate scenarios provide additional information to estimate the Company&#8217;s underlying interest rate risk. The rate ramp table below shows the net interest income volatility under a gradual non-parallel shift of the yield curve, in even monthly increments over the first 12 months, followed by rates held constant thereafter based on a static balance sheet as of the date of the analysis. Actual results will vary based on the timing and pace of interest rate changes, as well as changes in the balance sheet. 

Change in Interest Rates (in bps) Net Interest Income Volatility September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 +200 Rate Ramp 5.2 % 9.2 % +100 Rate Ramp 2.6 % 4.1 % -100 Rate Ramp (2.2) % NM -200 Rate Ramp (4.9) % NM 

NM &#8212; Not meaningful. 

As of September 30, 2022, the Company&#8217;s net interest income profile reflects an asset sensitive position. Net interest income is expected to increase when interest rates rise, as the Company has a large share of variable rate loans in its loan portfolio, primarily linked to Prime or LIBOR indices. The Company&#8217;s interest income is sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates. The Company&#8217;s deposit portfolio is primarily composed of non-maturity deposits, which are not directly tied to short-term interest rate indices, but are, nevertheless, sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates. The modeled results are highly sensitive to reinvestment yield and deposit beta assumptions. Actual results in terms of net interest income growth during a period of rising interest rates will also reflect earning asset growth and deposit mix changes based on customer preferences relative to the interest rate environment. 

Economic Value of Equity at Risk 

Economic value of equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;) is a cash flow calculation that takes the present value of all asset cash flows and subtracts the present value of all liability cash flows. This calculation is used for asset/liability management and measures changes in the economic value of the bank. The economic value approach provides a comparatively broader scope than the net interest income volatility approach since it captures all anticipated cash flows. 

The EVE simulation reflects the sensitivity of the EVE to interest rate changes across the full maturity spectrum of the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities. It identifies risks arising from repricing, prepayment and maturity gaps between assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, as well as from derivative exposures that are off-balance sheet. The simulation provides long-term economic perspective into the Bank&#8217;s interest rate risk profile, which allows the Bank to manage anticipated negative effects of interest rate fluctuations. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s EVE sensitivity related to an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates by 100 and 200 bps as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021: 

Change in Interest Rates (in bps) EVE Volatility (1) 

September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 +200 1.0 % 7.1 % +100 1.0 % 3.5 % -100 0.0 % NM -200 (0.3) % NM 

NM &#8212; Not meaningful. 

(1) The percentage change represents net portfolio value change of the Company in a stable interest rate environment versus in the various interest rate scenarios. 

The Company&#8217;s EVE sensitivity for the upward interest rate scenarios decreased as of September 30, 2022, compared with the results as of December 31, 2021. The changes in EVE sensitivity were primarily due to faster deposit decay and higher deposit beta assumptions used in the model, changes in the level and shape of the yield curve, and lower cash balances as of September 30, 2022. 

The Company&#8217;s EVE profile as of September 30, 2022 reflects an asset sensitive EVE position under the higher interest rate scenarios. Given the uncertainty of the magnitude, timing and direction of future interest rate movements, as well as the shape of the yield curve, actual results may vary from those predicted by the Company&#8217;s model. 

Derivatives 

It is the Company&#8217;s policy not to speculate on the future direction of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and energy commodity prices. However, the Company periodically enters into derivative transactions in order to reduce its exposure to market risks, primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The Company believes that these derivative transactions, when properly structured and managed, provides a hedge against inherent risk in certain assets and liabilities or against risk in specific transactions. Hedging transactions may be implemented using a variety of derivative instruments such as swaps, forwards, options, and collars. Prior to entering into any hedging activities, the Company analyzes the costs and benefits of the hedge in comparison to alternative strategies. In addition, the Company enters into derivative transactions in order to assist customers with their risk management objectives, such as managing exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currencies and energy commodity prices. To economically hedge against the derivative contracts entered with the Company&#8217;s customers, the Company enters into mirrored derivative contracts with third-party financial institutions. The exposures from derivative transactions are collateralized by cash and/or eligible securities based on limits as set forth in the respective agreements entered between the Company and counterparty financial institutions. 

The Company is subject to credit risk associated with the counterparties to the derivative contracts. This counterparty credit risk is a multi-dimensional form of risk, affected by both the exposure and credit quality of the counterparty, both of which are sensitive to market-induced changes. The Company&#8217;s Credit Risk Management Committee provides oversight of credit risks and the Company has guidelines in place to manage counterparty concentration, tenor limits, and collateral. The Company manages the credit risk of its derivative exposures by diversifying its positions among various counterparties, by entering into legally enforceable master netting arrangements, and by requiring collateral arrangements, where possible. The Company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to third-party financial institutions through the use of credit risk participation agreements. Certain derivative contracts are required to be centrally cleared through clearinghouses, which further mitigates credit risk. The Company incorporates credit value adjustments and other market standard methodologies to appropriately reflect its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty&#8217;s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements of its derivatives. 

The following table summarizes certain information about derivative financial instruments utilized by the Company in its management of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021:

Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments &#8212; Interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in the Company&#8217;s asset and liability management activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage the Company&#8217;s interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. The Company uses interest rate derivatives to hedge the risk of variable cash flows in its variable interest rate borrowings, which includ es repurchase agreements and FHLB advances, as well as a portion of its variable interest rate CRE loans. The Company also uses foreign exchange derivatives to hedge the risk of changes in the USD equivalent value of a designated monetary amount of the Company&#8217;s net investment in East West Bank (China) Limited. For both the cash flow and the net investment hedges, the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments are recognized in AOCI, net of tax , on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

The fluctuation in foreign currency translation of the hedged exposure is expected to be offset by changes in the fair value of the forward contracts. As of September 30, 2022, the outstanding foreign currency forwards effectively hedged approximately 44% of the net Chinese Renminbi exposure from East West Bank (China) Limited. 

Changes to the composition of the Company&#8217;s derivatives designated as hedging instruments during the first nine months of 2022 reflect actions taken for interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk management. The Company repositions its hedging derivatives portfolio based on the current assessment of economic and financial conditions, including the interest rate and foreign currency environments, balance sheet composition and trends, and the relative mix of its cash and derivative positions. 

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments &#8212; The Company enters into interest rate, foreign exchange and energy commodity contracts to support the business needs of its customers. When derivative transactions are executed with its customers, the derivative contracts are offset by paired trades with third-party financial institutions. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are either exchange-traded, centrally cleared through a clearinghouse or over-the-counter. Derivative contracts entered with central clearing organizations are settled-to-market daily to the extent the central clearing organizations&#8217; rulebook legally characterize daily payments of variation margin as a settlement. 

The Company offers various interest rate derivative contracts to its customers and enters into offsetting contracts with third-party financial institutions, including central clearing organizations, to manage its interest risk. Interest rate derivative contracts allow borrowers to lock in attractive intermediate and long-term fixed rate financing while not increasing the interest rate risk to the Company. These transactions are not linked to any specific Company assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, or to forecasted transactions in a hedging relationship, and are therefore classified as economic hedges. The contracts are marked-to-market at each reporting period. The changes in fair values of the derivative contracts traded with third-party financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the derivative transactions executed with customers throughout the terms of these contracts, except for the credit valuation adjustment component. The Company records credit valuation adjustments on derivatives to properly reflect the variances of credit worthiness between the Company and the counterparties, considering the effects of enforceable master netting agreements and collateral arrangements. 

The Company enters into foreign exchange contracts with its customers to accommodate their business needs. The foreign exchange contracts include forward and spot contracts, swaps and options. To manage the foreign exchange risk and credit exposures from the contracts with its customers, the Company enters into offsetting foreign exchange contracts with third-party financial institutions and/or enters into bilateral collateral and master netting agreements with certain customer counterparties. The changes in the fair values of contracts entered with third-party financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the foreign exchange transactions executed with the customers throughout the terms of these contracts. As of September 30, 2022, the Company anticipates performance by all counterparties and has not experienced nonperformance by any of its counterparties, and therefore did not incur any related losses. The Company also utilizes foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to mitigate the economic effect of fluctuations in certain foreign currency-denominated on-balance sheet assets and liabilities, primarily foreign currency-denominated deposits offered to its customers. The Company&#8217;s policies permit taking proprietary currency positions within approved limits, in compliance with exemptions to proprietary trading restrictions provided under Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Volcker Rule. The Company does not speculate in the foreign exchange markets, and actively manages its foreign exchange exposures within prescribed risk limits and defined controls. 

The Company enters into energy commodity contracts with its customers to allow them to hedge against the risk of energy commodity price fluctuations. To economically hedge against the risk of fluctuation in energy commodity prices in the products offered to its customers, the Company enters into offsetting energy commodity contracts with third-party financial institutions, including central clearing organizations. The changes in fair values of the energy commodity contracts traded with third-party financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the energy commodity transactions executed with customers throughout the terms of these contracts. 

Additional information on the Company&#8217;s derivatives is presented in Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K, and Note 3 &#8212; Fair Value Measurement and Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Note 6 &#8212; Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The Company&#8217;s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K. Certain of these policies include critical accounting estimates, which are subject to valuation assumptions, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and it is likely that materially different amounts could be reported under different assumptions and conditions. The Company has procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. The following accounting policies are critical to the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements: 

&#8226; allowance for credit losses; 

&#8226; fair value estimates; 

&#8226; goodwill impairment; and 

&#8226; income taxes. 

For additional information on the Company&#8217;s critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments, see Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Critical Accounting Estimates in the Company&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K. 

Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

To supplement the Company&#8217;s unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company uses certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with, or as an alternative to U.S. GAAP. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company&#8217;s performance that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A non-GAAP financial measure may also be a financial metric that is not required by U.S. GAAP or other applicable requirements. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance, and allow comparability to prior periods. These non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. 

The following tables present the reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for the third quarters and first nine months of 2022 and 2021:
