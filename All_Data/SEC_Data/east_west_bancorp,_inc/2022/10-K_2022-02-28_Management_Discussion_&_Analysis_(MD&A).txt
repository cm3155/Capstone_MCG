Overview 

The following discussion provides information about the results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources of the Company, and its subsidiaries, including its subsidiary bank, East West Bank and its subsidiaries. This information is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this Form 10-K. 

The Bank is an independent commercial bank headquartered in California that has a focus on the financial service needs of the Asian-American community. Through over 120 locations in the U.S. and China, the Company provides a full range of consumer and commercial products and services through the following business segments: Consumer and Business Banking and Commercial Banking, with the remaining operations recorded in Other . The Company&#8217;s principal activity is lending to and accepting deposits from businesses and individuals. The primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is principally derived from the difference between interest earned on loans and debt securities and interest paid on deposits and other funding sources. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $60.87 billion in assets and approximately 3,100 full-time equivalent employees. 

Coronavirus Disease 2019 Global Pandemic 

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) pandemic has created a historic public health crisis and caused unprecedented disruptions to global economies. Although the COVID-19 pandemic continues to present public health challenges, including the emergence of new variants, great progress has been made and continues to be made in containing the virus through vaccination efforts. While these responses have largely mitigated the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic and propelled the U.S. economy to recovery, a resurgence of the pandemic, the adoption and long-term effectiveness of the vaccines, and other factors including the continuing impact on global supply chains may slow down such progress. As a result, we are unable to quantify all the specific impacts, and the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, regulatory capital, and liquidity ratios. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has been focused on serving our customers and communities and maintaining the well-being of our employees. The Company has been, and may continue to be, impacted by the pandemic. 

On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 to provide additional relief for individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including additional funding for the PPP. The PPP Extension Act of 2021, enacted on March 30, 2021, extended the PPP through May 31, 2021. The Company was a participating lender in the PPP in 2020 and 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately 1,800 PPP loans outstanding with balances totaling $534.2 million, which were recorded in the commercial and industrial (&#8220;C&#38;I&#8221;) loan portfolio. During 2021, the Company submitted and received SBA approval for the forgiveness of approximately 9,500 PPP loans, totaling $1.93 billion. 

The Company also participated in the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s MSLP and funded $233.6 million in MSLP loans as of December 31, 2020. The Company did not fund any MSLP loans in 2021. As part of the MSLP, the related Main Street special purpose vehicle purchased 95% participations in the loans originated. The portion retained by the Company totaled $10.2 million and $9.5 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The MSLP was terminated on January 8, 2021. 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company implemented protocols and processes to execute its business resumption plans to protect its employees and support its customers. As state and local governments have relaxed restrictions on temporary business closures, we have started phasing in the return of our corporate associates to the office. As we resume normal operations, our highest priority continues to be the health and safety of our associates and our customers. We have prepared our facilities with employee safety protocols, including badge or key fob access for fully vaccinated associates, personal protection equipment, visual safety reminders related to social distancing and mask requirements, and sanitizing products . The Company continues to monitor the external environment and make changes to its safety protocols as appropriate. 

Further discussion of the potential impacts on our business due to the COVID-19 pandemic is provided under Part I, Item 1A. &#8212; Risk Factors in this Form 10-K . 

Our MD&#38;A reviews the financial condition and results of operations of the Company for 2021 and 2020. Some tables include additional periods to comply with disclosure requirements or to illustrate trends in greater depth. When reading the discussion in the MD&#38;A, readers should also refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in this Form 10-K. The page locations of specific sections that we refer to are presented in the table of contents. To review our financial condition and results of operations for 2020 and a comparison between 2020 and 2019 results, see Item 7. MD&#38;A of our 2020 Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2021.

The Company&#8217;s 2021 net income was $873.0 million, an increase of $305.2 million, or 54%, from 2020 net income of $567.8 million. The increase was driven by higher net interest income and noninterest income, and the reversal of provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense and income tax expense. 

Noteworthy items about the Company&#8217;s performance for 2021 included: 

&#8226; Profitability in 2021 expanded substantially, reflecting robust net interest income and fee income growth, efficient expense management, and materially improved asset quality. 2021 ROA was 1.47%, an increase of 31 bps, from 1.16% for 2020. 2021 ROE was 15.70%, an increase of 453 bps, from 11.17% for 2020. 2021 non-GAAP return on average tangible equity was 17.24%, compared with 12.42% for 2020. For additional details, see the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures presented under Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Form 10-K. 

&#8226; The Company&#8217;s 2021 net interest income of $1.53 billion grew by $154.4 million, or 11.2%, from 2020 net interest income of $1.38 billion. 

&#8226; The efficiency ratio was 43.80% and 44.42% for 2021 and 2020, respectively. The non-GAAP efficiency ratio was 36.91% in 2021, an improvement of 239 bps from 39.30% in 2020. The non-GAAP efficiency ratio is adjusted for the amortization of tax credit and other investments, the amortization of core deposit intangibles, and repurchase agreements&#8217; extinguishment cost. For additional details, see the reconciliations of non-GAAP measures presented under Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Form 10-K. 

&#8226; The Company recorded a reversal of provision for credit losses of $35.0 million in 2021, primarily due to an improved macroeconomic outlook, compared with a provision for credit losses of $210.7 million in 2020. 

&#8226; Total assets reached $60.87 billion, growing by $8.71 billion or 17% year-over-year, primarily reflecting growth in loans and AFS debt securities. 

&#8226; Total loans reached a record $41.69 billion as of December 31, 2021, growing by $3.30 billion or 9% year-over-year. Loan growth was well-diversified across the Company&#8217;s major loan portfolios, including residential mortgage, CRE and C&#38;I. 

&#8226; Total deposits reached $53.35 billion as of December 31, 2021, growing by $8.49 billion or 19% year-over-year. The growth was primarily driven by noninterest-bearing demand deposits and money market accounts, partially offset by a decrease in time deposits. 

&#8226; Asset quality metrics improved substantially. Criticized loans totaled $833.1 million as of December 31, 2021, decreasing by $384.4 million or 32% from $1.22 billion as of December 31, 2020. The criticized loans ratio was 2.00% of loans held-for-investment as of December 31, 2021, an improvement of 117 bps from 3.17% as of December 31, 2020. Nonperforming assets were $103.5 million, or 0.17% of total assets, as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of $131.4 million or 56%, from $234.9 million, or 0.45% of total assets, as of December 31, 2020. 

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income 

The Company&#8217;s primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the interest income earned on interest-earning assets less interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average interest-earning assets. Net interest income and net interest margin are impacted by several factors, including changes in average balances and the composition of interest-earning assets and funding sources, market interest rate fluctuations and the slope of the yield curve, repricing characteristics and maturity of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the volume of noninterest-bearing sources of funds and asset quality. 

2021 net interest income before provision for credit losses was $1.53 billion, an increase of $154.4 million or 11%, compared with $1.38 billion in 2020. The year-over year growth in net interest income was primarily driven by a decrease in interest expense, reflecting a lower cost of funds, and an increase in interest income from AFS debt securities due to average balance growth, partially offset by a decrease in interest income from loans, reflecting lower loan yields. Net interest margin for 2021 was 2.72%, a decrease of 26 basis points (&#8220;bps&#8221;) from 2.98% in 2020. The year-over year net interest margin compression primarily reflected lower yields on earning assets, a change in the interest-earning assets mix in favor of more lower-yielding assets, partially offset by lower cost of funds. 

Average interest-earning assets were $56.26 billion in 2021, an increase of $10.02 billion or 22% from $46.24 billion in 2020. The increase in average interest-earning assets was due to growth in the average balances of AFS debt securities, loans, interest-bearing cash and deposits with banks, and resale agreements. The growth in AFS debt securities, loans, and resale agreements reflected the Company&#8217;s deployment of excess cash. 

The yield on average interest-earning assets for 2021 was 2.88%, a decrease of 57 bps from 3.45% in 2020. The year-over-year yield compression reflected lower yields on interest-earning assets in response to the low interest rate environment. 

The average loan yield for 2021 was 3.59%, a decrease of 39 bps from 3.98% in 2020. Excluding the impact of PPP loans, the adjusted average loan yield was 3.57%, a decrease of 43 bps from 4.00% in 2020. For additional details, see the reconciliations of non-GAAP measures presented under Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Form 10-K. Approximately 66% and 65% of loans held-for-investment were variable-rate or hybrid loans in their adjustable rate period as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Deposits are an important source of funds and impact both net interest income and net interest margin. The average cost of deposits was 0.13% in 2021, a 32 bps decrease from 0.45% in 2020. The year-over-year decrease reflected a lower interest rate environment in 2021, the year-over-year run-off of higher-cost time deposits, and a higher proportion of noninterest-bearing demand deposits in the deposit mix. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits comprised 41% of average total deposits in 2021, compared with 34% in 2020. Time deposits comprised 16% of average total deposits in 2021, compared with 23% in 2020. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased 46 bps to 0.23% in 2021, from 0.69% in 2020. 

The average cost of funds in 2021 was 0.17%, a decrease of 34 bps from 0.51% in 2020. The decrease in the average cost of funds reflected the lower cost of deposits, as well as decreases in the cost of other funding sources due to changes in the interest rate environment. Other sources of funding primarily consist of FHLB advances, repurchase agreements, long-term debt and short-term borrowings. 

The Company utilizes various tools to manage interest rate risk. Refer to the Interest Rate Risk Management section of Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Risk Management &#8212; Market Risk Management for details.

##TABLE_START ($ in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 Change from 2020 % 2019 Lending fees $ 77,704 $ 74,842 4 % $ 63,670 Deposit account fees 71,261 48,148 48 % 38,648 Interest rate contracts and other derivative income 22,913 31,685 (28) % 39,865 Foreign exchange income 48,977 22,370 119 % 26,398 Wealth management fees 25,751 17,494 47 % 16,547 Net gains on sales of loans 8,909 4,501 98 % 4,035 Gains on sales of AFS debt securities 1,568 12,299 (87) % 3,930 Other investment income 16,852 10,641 58 % 18,117 Other income 11,960 13,567 (12) % 11,035 Total noninterest income $ 285,895 &#160; $ 235,547 &#160; 21 &#160; % $ 222,245 &#160; ##TABLE_END

Noninterest income comprised 16% and 15% of total revenue in 2021 and 2020, respectively. 2021 noninterest income was $285.9 million, an increase of $50.4 million or 21%, compared with $235.5 million in 2020. This increase was primarily due to increases in foreign exchange income, deposit account fees, wealth management fees, and other investment income, partially offset by decreases in gains on sales of AFS debt securities, and interest rate contracts and other derivative income. 

Deposit account fees were $71.3 million in 2021, an increase of $23.2 million or 48%, compared with $48.1 million in 2020. This increase primarily reflected higher treasury management and deposit-related fees resulting from commercial deposit growth. 

Interest rate contracts and other derivative income was $22.9 million in 2021, a decrease of $8.8 million or 28%, compared with $31.7 million in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a lower volume of customer-driven transactions, partially offset by favorable credit valuation adjustments. 

Foreign exchange income was $49.0 million in 2021, an increase of $26.6 million or 119%, compared with $22.4 million in 2020. This increase primarily reflected new customer acquisitions and growth in customer-driven transactions. 

Wealth management fees were $25.8 million in 2021, an increase of $8.3 million or 47%, compared with $17.5 million in 2020. This increase primarily reflected growth in customer transactions. 

Gains on sales of AFS debt securities were $1.6 million in 2021, a decrease of $10.7 million or 87%, compared with $12.3 million in 2020. This decrease reflected a lower volume of AFS debt securities sold. 

Other investment income was $16.9 million in 2021, an increase of $6.3 million or 58%, compared with $10.6 million in 2020. This increase primarily reflected higher earnings from equity method investments, partially offset by lower distributions from affordable housing partnership investments. 

Noninterest Expense 

The following table presents the components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated: 

##TABLE_START ($ in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 Change from 2020 % 2019 Compensation and employee benefits $ 433,728 $ 404,071 7 % $ 401,700 Occupancy and equipment expense 62,996 66,489 (5) % 69,730 Deposit insurance premiums and regulatory assessments 17,563 15,128 16 % 12,928 Deposit account expense 16,152 13,530 19 % 14,175 Data processing 16,263 16,603 (2) % 13,533 Computer software expense 30,600 29,033 5 % 26,471 Consulting expense 6,517 5,391 21 % 9,846 Legal expense 8,015 7,766 3 % 8,441 Other operating expense 81,798 79,489 3 % 92,249 Amortization of tax credit and other investments 122,457 70,082 75 % 98,383 Repurchase agreements&#8217; extinguishment cost &#8212; 8,740 (100) % &#8212; Total noninterest expense $ 796,089 &#160; $ 716,322 &#160; 11 &#160; % $ 747,456 &#160; ##TABLE_END

2021 noninterest expense was $796.1 million, an increase of $79.8 million or 11%, compared with $716.3 million in 2020. This increase primarily reflected higher amortization of tax credit and other investments, and compensation and employee benefits. 

Compensation and employee benefits were $433.7 million in 2021, an increase of $29.6 million or 7%, compared with $404.1 million in 2020. This increase primarily reflected higher bonuses. 

Amortization of tax credit and other investments was $122.5 million in 2021, an increase of $52.4 million or 75%, compared with $70.1 million in 2020. This increase was primarily due to a higher number of new tax credit investments in 2021 and the timing of tax credit recognition in each period, based on when tax credit projects were put into service. 

During the second quarter of 2020, the Company prepaid $150.0 million of repurchase agreements and incurred a debt extinguishment cost of $8.7 million. No such expense was incurred in 2021. 

Income Taxes 

##TABLE_START ($ in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Income before income taxes $ 1,056,377 $ 685,765 $ 843,917 Income tax expense $ 183,396 $ 117,968 $ 169,882 Effective tax rate 17.4 % 17.2 % 20.1 % ##TABLE_END

Income tax expense was $183.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $65.4 million, compared with income tax expense of $118.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The year-over-year increase in income tax expense was predominantly driven by higher level of income before income taxes. 2021 effective tax rate was 17.4%, compared with 2020 effective tax rate of 17.2%. 

Operating Segment Results 

The Company organizes its operations into three reportable operating segments: (1) Consumer and Business Banking; (2) Commercial Banking; and (3) Other. These segments are defined by the type of customers served and the related products and services provided. The segments reflect how financial information is currently evaluated by management. For an additional description of the Company&#8217;s internal management reporting process, including the segment cost allocation methodology, see Note 17 &#8212; Business Segments to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

Segment net interest income represents the difference between actual interest earned on assets and interest incurred on liabilities of the segment, adjusted for funding charges or credits through the Company&#8217;s internal funds transfer pricing (&#8220;FTP&#8221;) process. 

The following table presents the results by operating segment for the periods indicated:

(1) During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company enhanced its segment allocation methodology related to the fair values of interest rate and commodity derivative contracts, which are included in noninterest income. These fair values that were previously allocated to the &#8220;Commercial Banking&#8221; segment, have been reclassified between &#8220;Consumer and Business Banking&#8221; and &#8220;Commercial Banking.&#8221; Prior years&#8217; balances have been reclassified to conform to the 2021 presentation. 

Consumer and Business Banking 

The Consumer and Business Banking segment primarily provides financial products and services to consumer and commercial customers through the Company&#8217;s domestic branch network and digital banking platform. This segment offers consumer and commercial deposits, mortgage and home equity loans, and other products and services. It also originates commercial loans for small- and medium-sized enterprises. Other products and services provided by this segment include wealth management, treasury management, interest rate risk hedging, and foreign exchange services.

These fair values that were previously allocated to the &#8220;Commercial Banking&#8221; segment, have been reclassified between &#8220;Consumer and Business Banking&#8221; and &#8220;Commercial Banking.&#8221; Prior years&#8217; balances have been reclassified to conform to the 2021 presentation. 

Consumer and Business Banking segment net income increased $122.8 million or 66% year-over-year to $308.6 million in 2021, due to revenue growth and a lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher income tax expense and noninterest expense. Net interest income before (reversal of) provision for credit losses increased $166.3 million, or 31%, to $697.1 million, driven by higher interest income, primarily due to growth in residential mortgage loans, and lower interest expense, primarily due to lower interest rates and growth in noninterest-bearing demand deposits. Noninterest income increased $30.0 million, or 47%, to $94.1 million, primarily driven by higher deposit account fees, foreign exchange income and wealth management fees, reflecting growth in customer-driven transactions. Noninterest expense increased $32.9 million, or 10%, to $364.6 million, primarily due to higher allocated corporate overhead expense, and compensation and employee benefits. 

Commercial Banking 

The Commercial Banking segment primarily offers commercial loan and deposit products. Commercial loan products include commercial real estate lending, construction finance, working capital lines of credit, trade finance, letters of credit, commercial business lending, affordable housing lending, asset-based lending, asset-backed finance, project finance and equipment financing. Commercial deposit products and other financial services include treasury management, foreign exchange services, and interest rate and commodity risk hedging.

Commercial Banking segment net income increased $223.8 million or 83% year-over-year to $492.3 million in 2021, reflecting a lower provision for credit losses and higher revenue, partially offset by increased income tax expense and noninterest expense. Net interest income before (reversal of) provision for credit losses increased $59.9 million, or 8%, to $766.2 million, driven by lower interest expense, primarily due to lower interest rates and growth in noninterest-bearing demand deposits. Noninterest income increased $21.4 million, or 15%, to $163.8 million, primarily driven by higher foreign exchange income, deposit account fees and net gains on sales of loans, partially offset by lower interest rate contracts and other derivative income. 

Other 

Centralized functions, including the corporate treasury activities of the Company and eliminations of inter-segment amounts, have been aggregated and included in the Other segment, which provides broad administrative support to the two core segments, namely the Consumer and Business Banking and the Commercial Banking segments. 

The following table presents additional financial information for the Other segment for the periods indicated: 

##TABLE_START ($ in thousands) Year Ended December 31, Change from 2020 2021 2020 $ % 2019 Net interest income before provision for credit losses $ 68,268 $ 140,078 $ (71,810) (51) % $ 119,849 Noninterest income 28,002 29,095 (1,093) (4) % 29,702 Total revenue 96,270 169,173 (72,903) (43) % 149,551 Noninterest expense 160,046 117,649 42,397 36 % 141,391 Segment (loss) income before income taxes (63,776) 51,524 (115,300) (224) % 8,160 Income tax benefit (135,856) (62,015) (73,841) 119 % (67,880) Segment net income $ 72,080 $ 113,539 $ (41,459) (37) % $ 76,040 Average deposits $ 2,681,097 $ 2,750,134 $ (69,037) (3) % $ 2,330,958 ##TABLE_END

Other segment net income decreased $41.4 million or 37% year-over-year to $72.1 million in 2021, primarily driven by lower revenue and higher noninterest expense, partially offset by an increased income tax benefit. Net interest income before provision for credit losses decreased $71.8 million, or 51%, to $68.3 million. The decrease was primarily driven by lower FTP spread income absorbed by the Other segment, partially offset by an increase in interest income from investments due to a higher volume of AFS debt securities, and lower interest expense from borrowings. Noninterest expense increased $42.4 million, or 36%, to $160.0 million, primarily due to higher amortization of tax credits and other investments. 

Balance Sheet Analysis 

Debt Securities 

The Company maintains a portfolio of high quality and liquid debt securities with a moderate duration profile. It closely manages the overall portfolio interest rate and liquidity risks. The Company&#8217;s debt securities provide: 

&#8226; interest income for earnings and yield enhancement; 

&#8226; availability for funding needs arising during the normal course of business; 

&#8226; the ability to execute interest rate risk management strategies in response to changes in economic or market conditions; and 

&#8226; collateral to support pledging agreements as required and/or to enhance the Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity. 

Available-for-Sale Debt Securities 

Debt securities classified as AFS are carried at their fair value with the corresponding changes in fair value recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax , as a component of Stockholders&#8217; equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

The following table presents the distribution of the Company&#8217;s AFS debt securities portfolio by fair value and percentage of fair value as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and by credit rating as of December 31, 2021:

(1) Primarily based upon the credit ratings issued by S&#38;P, Moody&#8217;s Investors Service (&#8220;Moody&#8217;s&#8221;) or Fitch Ratings (&#8220;Fitch&#8221;), applying the lowest rating, if split rated. Rating percentages are allocated based on fair value. 

The fair value of AFS debt securities totaled $9.97 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of $4.42 billion or 80% from $5.54 billion as of December 31, 2020. The largest net change came from U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities, which increased $1.34 billion, followed by U.S. Treasury securities, which increased $981.9 million, and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, which increased $848.8 million. These changes were mainly driven by purchases during 2021 to deploy cash from deposit growth and to enhance the return of the overall AFS debt securities portfolio. 

The Company&#8217;s AFS debt securities portfolio had an effective duration, defined as the sensitivity of the value of the portfolio to interest rate changes, of 5.0 as of December 31, 2021. This increased from 4.2 as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in the target duration of securities purchased to achieve enhancement in portfolio yield, and portfolio duration extension because of the steepening of the yield curve. As of December 31, 2021, 90% of the carrying value of the Company&#8217;s debt securities portfolio was rated &#8220;AA-&#8221; or &#8220;Aa3&#8221; or higher by nationally recognized credit rating agencies, compared with 88% as of December 31, 2020. Credit ratings of BBB- or higher by S&#38;P and Fitch, or Baa3 or higher by Moody&#8217;s, are considered investment grade. 

The Company&#8217;s AFS debt securities are carried at fair value with non-credit related unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in Other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Pre-tax net unrealized losses on AFS debt securities were $121.8 million as of December 31, 2021, compared with pre-tax net unrealized gains on AFS debt securities of $74.1 million as of December 31, 2020. This change was primarily due to interest rate movement. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had no intention to sell securities with unrealized losses and believed it is more-likely-than-not that it would not be required to sell such securities before recovery of their amortized costs. 

Of the securities with gross unrealized losses, substantially all were rated investment grade as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Company believes that the gross unrealized losses were due to non-credit related factors and were primarily attributable to interest rate movement and widened spreads for certain securities. The Company believes that the credit support levels of the AFS debt securities are strong and, based on current assessments and macroeconomic forecasts, expects that full contractual cash flows will be received, even if near term credit performance is negatively impacted. 

The Company assesses individual securities for credit losses for each reporting period. If a credit loss is identified, the Company records an impairment through the allowance for credit losses with a corresponding Provision for credit losses on the Consolidated Statement of Income. There were no credit losses recognized in earnings for both 2021 and 2020. For additional information of the Company&#8217;s accounting policies, valuation and composition, see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , Note 2 &#8212; Fair Value Measurement and Fair Value of Financial Instruments , and Note 4 &#8212; Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

The following table presents the amortized cost and weighted-average yields by contractual maturity distribution, excluding periodic principal payments, of the Company&#8217;s AFS debt securities as of December 31, 2021. Actual maturities of certain securities can differ from contractual maturities as the borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties. In addition, factors such as prepayments and interest rates may affect the yields on the carrying values of these securities.

Loans Held-for-Sale 

As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, loans held-for-sale totaled $635 thousand and $1.8 million, respectively, and consisted of single-family residential loans. At the time of commitment to originate or purchase a loan, a loan is determined to be held-for-investment if it is the Company&#8217;s intent to hold the loan to maturity or for the foreseeable future, subject to periodic reviews under the Company&#8217;s evaluation processes, including liquidity and credit risk management. If the Company subsequently changes its intent to hold certain loans, those loans are transferred from held-for-investment to held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value. 

Sales of Originated Loans and Purchased Loans 

All loans originated by the Company are underwritten pursuant to the Company&#8217;s policies and procedures. Although the Company&#8217;s primary focus is on directly originated loans, in certain circumstances, the Company also purchases loans and participates in loans with other banks. In the normal course of doing business, the Company also participates out interests in directly originated commercial loans to other financial institutions or sells loans. 

The following tables provide information on loan sales during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Refer to Note 6 &#8212; Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information on loan purchases and transfers.

Foreign Outstandings 

The Company&#8217;s overseas offices, which include the branch in Hong Kong and the subsidiary bank in China, are subject to the general risks inherent in conducting business in foreign countries, such as regulatory, economic and political uncertainties. As such, the Company&#8217;s international operation risk exposure is largely concentrated in China and Hong Kong. In addition, the Company&#8217;s financial assets held in the Hong Kong branch and the subsidiary bank in China may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors. The following table presents the major financial assets held in the Company&#8217;s overseas offices as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:

Capital 

The Company maintains a strong capital base to support its anticipated asset growth, operating needs, and credit risks, and to ensure that the Company and the Bank are in compliance with all regulatory capital guidelines. The Company engages in regular capital planning processes on at least an annual basis to optimize the use of available capital and to appropriately plan for future capital needs, allocating capital to existing and future business activities. Furthermore, the Company conducts capital stress tests as part of its capital planning process. The stress tests enable the Company to assess the impact of adverse changes in the economy and interest rates on its capital base. 

In March 2020, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of the Company&#8217;s common stock. This $500.0 million repurchase authorization was inclusive of the Company&#8217;s $100.0 million stock repurchase authorization previously outstanding. The Company determines the timing and amount of stock repurchases, based on its assessment of various factors, including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity and the economic environment. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company repurchased 4,471,682 shares at an average price of $32.64 per share and a total cost of $146.0 million. The Company did not repurchase any shares during the remainder of 2020 and during 2021 . As of December 31, 2021, the total remaining available capital authorized for repurchase was $354.0 million. 

The Company&#8217;s stockholders&#8217; equity was $5.84 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of $568.0 million or 11% from $5.27 billion as of December 31, 2020. The increase in the Company&#8217;s stockholders&#8217; equity was primarily due to 2021 net income of $873.0 million, partially offset by cash dividends declared of $189.7 million and an increase in other comprehensive loss of $134.7 million. For other factors that contributed to the changes in stockholders&#8217; equity, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8212; Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders&#8217; Equity in this Form 10-K. 

Book value was $41.13 per common share as of December 31, 2021, an increase of 11% from $37.22 per common share as of December 31, 2020. Non-GAAP tangible common equity per share was $37.79 as of December 31, 2021, compared with $33.85 as of December 31, 2020. For additional details, see the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures presented under Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Form 10-K. The Company paid cash dividends of $1.32 per common share in 2021, compared with $1.10 per common share in 2020. In January 2022, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors declared first quarter 2022 cash dividends of $0.40 per common share, which represents a 21% increase or seven cents per common share, from the previous quarterly cash dividend of $0.33 per common share. The dividend was paid on February 22, 2022, to stockholders of record as of February 7, 2022. 

Deposits and Other Sources of Funding 

Deposits are the Company&#8217;s primary source of funding, the cost of which has a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s net interest income and net interest margin. Additional funding is provided by short- and long-term borrowings, and long-term debt. See Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Risk Management &#8212; Liquidity Risk Management &#8212; Liquidity in this Form 10-K for a discussion of the Company&#8217;s liquidity management.

Deposits 

The Company offers a wide variety of deposit products to consumer and commercial customers. The Company&#8217;s deposit strategy is to grow and retain relationship-based deposits, which provide a stable and low-cost source of funding and liquidity to the Company. 

Total deposits reached $53.35 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of $8.49 billion or 19% from $44.86 billion as of December 31, 2020. Deposit growth was well-diversified across our commercial sectors and branch network, including cross-border clients, partially offset by a reduction in higher-cost time deposits. The strongest growth was in noninterest-bearing demand deposits, which increased by $6.55 billion or 40% year-over-year. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits reached $22.85 billion or 43% of total deposits as of December 31, 2021, up from $16.30 billion or 36% of total deposits as of December 31, 2020. Additional information regarding the impact of deposits on net interest income, with a comparison of average deposit balances and rates, is provided in Item 7 &#8212; MD&#38;A &#8212; Results of Operations &#8212; Net Interest Income in this Form 10-K. 

Customer deposits of $50.54 billion, $1.37 billion and $1.44 billion were held in the Company&#8217;s domestic offices, the subsidiary bank in China and the branch in Hong Kong, respectively. Of the $50.54 billion of deposits held in the domestic offices as of December 31, 2021, $10.28 billion or 20% were from depositors domiciled in non-U.S. countries and territories. 

Customer deposit accounts in the domestic offices are insured by the FDIC for up to $250,000. The deposits in the Company&#8217;s subsidiary bank in China and the branch in Hong Kong are insured by each country&#8217;s federal authority for up to RMB 500,000 and HKD 500,000, respectively. The following table presents total uninsured deposits by location as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:

Other Sources of Funding 

Short-term borrowings generally consist of borrowings entered into by the Company&#8217;s subsidiary bank in China. As of December 31, 2021, there were no short-term borrowings outstanding, compared with $21.0 million as of December 31, 2020. 

FHLB advances were $249.3 million as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of $403.3 million or 62% from $652.6 million as of December 31, 2020. The decrease was due to $405.0 million of fixed rate FHLB advances that matured during 2021 and were not renewed. As of December 31, 2021, FHLB advances had floating interest rates ranging from 0.53% to 0.59% with $74.8 million maturing in two months and $174.5 million maturing in 10 months. 

Gross repurchase agreements totaled $300.0 million as of each of December 31, 2021 and 2020. As of December 31, 2021, gross repurchase agreements had interest rates ranging from 2.39% to 2.42%. Repurchase agreements of $200.0 million have an original maturity of 10.0 years and mature in 1.6 years, whereas repurchase agreements of $100.0 million have an original maturity of 8.5 years and mature in 1.7 years. 

Repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and recorded as liabilities based on the values at which the assets are sold. As of December 31, 2021, the collateral for the repurchase agreements was comprised of U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasury securities. To ensure the market value of the underlying collateral remains sufficient, the Company monitors the fair value of collateral pledged relative to the principal amounts borrowed under the repurchase agreements. The Company manages liquidity risks related to the repurchase agreements by sourcing funds from a diverse group of counterparties, and entering into repurchase agreements with longer durations, when appropriate. For additional details, see Note 3 &#8212; Assets Purchased under Resale Agreements and Sold under Repurchase Agreements to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

The Company uses long-term debt to provide funding to acquire interest-earning assets, and to enhance liquidity and regulatory capital adequacy. Long-term debt totaled $147.7 million and $147.4 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Long-term debt consists of junior subordinated debt, which qualifies as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes. The junior subordinated debt was issued in connection with the Company&#8217;s various pooled trust preferred securities offerings, as well as with common stock issued by the six wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company in conjunction with these offerings. The junior subordinated debt had a weighted-average interest rate of 1.74% and 2.26% during 2021 and 2020, respectively, with remaining maturities ranging between 12.9 years and 15.7 years as of December 31, 2021. In October 2020, the Company paid off $1.43 billion in borrowings from the PPPLF, which was included in long-term debt. 

Regulatory Capital and Ratios 

The federal banking agencies have risk-based capital adequacy guidelines intended to ensure that banking organizations maintain capital that is commensurate with the degree of risk associated with a banking organization&#8217;s operations. The Company and the Bank are subject to regulatory capital adequacy requirements. The Company and the Bank are also required to comply with the Basel III Capital Rules adopted by the federal banking agencies as standardized approach institutions. See Item 1. Business &#8212; Supervision and Regulation &#8212; Regulatory Capital Requirements in this Form 10-K for additional details. 

The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, which requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses to be based on management&#8217;s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Company&#8217;s relevant financial assets. The Company also elected the phase-in option provided by a final rule that delays the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital for two years and phases the impact over three years. As a result, the effects of CECL on the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s regulatory capital were delayed through the year 2021, after which the effects are being phased-in over a three-year period from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. In April 2020, in recognition of CARES Act requirements, and to facilitate the use of the PPPLF, the U.S banking agencies issued an interim final rule that banking organizations may exclude from leverage and risk-based capital requirements any eligible assets sold or pledged to the Federal Reserve on a non-recourse basis as part of the PPPLF. In addition, under the CARES Act, loans originated by a banking organization under the PPP (whether or not sold or pledged in the PPPLF) are risk-weighted at zero percent for regulatory capital purposes. Accordingly, the December 31, 2021, capital ratios exclude the impact of the increased allowance for loan losses due to CECL, and PPP loans are risk-weighted at zero percent. The Company paid off all of the PPPLF borrowings in 2020. . 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s capital ratios as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 under the Basel III Capital Rules, and those required by regulatory agencies for capital adequacy and well-capitalized classification purposes:

(1) The Tier 1 leverage well-capitalized requirement applies only to the Bank since there is no Tier 1 leverage ratio component in the definition of a well-capitalized bank holding company. In addition, the minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio requirement for the Company to be considered well-capitalized is 6%. 

(2) As of January 1, 2019, the 2.5% capital conservation buffer above the minimum capital ratios was required in order to avoid limitations on distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. 

The Company is committed to maintaining strong capital levels to assure the Company&#8217;s investors, customers and regulators that the Company and the Bank are financially sound. As of both December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company and the Bank continued to exceed all &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; capital requirements and the required minimum capital requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules. Total risk-weighted assets were $43.59 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of $5.18 billion or 13% from $38.41 billion as of December 31, 2020. The increase in the risk-weighted assets was primarily due to loan growth and increase in AFS debt securities. 

Other Matters 

LIBOR Transition 

As of December 31, 2021, the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR tenors ceased to be published. The overnight, one-, three-, six- and 12-month USD LIBOR tenors will continue to be calculated using panel bank submissions for the purpose of legacy contracts and will permanently cease on June 30, 2023. The transition away from USD LIBOR in loan agreements that use the Alternative Reference Rate Committee&#8217;s (&#8220;ARRC&#8221;) recommended fallback language will be triggered on that date. Federal banking agencies have encouraged banks to ensure existing contracts have robust fallback language that includes a clearly defined reference rate. 

The ARRC selected the SOFR as its recommended alternative to LIBOR, although the adoption of SOFR remains voluntary. The ARRC also formally recommended the CME Group&#8217;s forward-looking Term SOFR Reference Rates. The ARRC supports the use of the CME&#8217;s Term SOFR Reference Rates for business loan activity and continues to recommend using forms of overnight and averages of SOFR where possible. 

A majority of the Company&#8217;s LIBOR-based loans, derivatives, debt securities, resale agreements, junior subordinated debt and repurchase agreements are indexed to LIBOR tenors that will cease to be published after June 30, 2023. The volume of the Company&#8217;s LIBOR-based products that mature after June 30, 2023 is significant and, if not sufficiently planned for, the discontinuation of LIBOR could result in financial, operational, legal, reputational or compliance risks to the Company. 

The on-going transition from LIBOR is anticipated to continue through June 30, 2023. The Company has a cross-functional team in place to manage and execute an enterprise-wide LIBOR transition plan. The plan identifies, assesses, monitors and mitigates risk associated with the discontinuance of LIBOR. The cross-functional team also provides appropriate communication and educational information to impacted customers and other key internal and external stakeholders. The Company has invested in updates to business and legal processes, models, analytical tools, and information and operational systems to facilitate the transition of legacy LIBOR products and offer products under alternative rates. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company ceased extending new LIBOR loans as a primary offering in anticipation of the December 31, 2021 deadline for no new LIBOR contracts, and began offering new variable rate loans based on alternative reference rates, including SOFR and the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index. 

The Company will continue to monitor potential risks and impacts associated with the transition. For additional information related to the potential impact surrounding the transition from LIBOR on the Company&#8217;s business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Form 10-K.

In conducting its businesses, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent to the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to the Company&#8217;s businesses. The Company operates under a Board-approved ERM framework, which outlines the company-wide approach to risk management and oversight, and describes the structures and practices employed to manage the current and emerging risks inherent to the Company. The Company&#8217;s ERM program incorporates risk management throughout the organization in identifying, managing, monitoring and reporting risks. It identifies the Company&#8217;s major risk categories as credit risk, liquidity risk, capital risk, market risk, operational risk, compliance and regulatory risks, legal risks, strategic risks and reputational risks. 

The Risk Oversight Committee of the Board of Directors monitors the ERM program through stated risk categories and provides oversight of the Company&#8217;s risk appetite and control environment. The Risk Oversight Committee provides focused oversight of the Company&#8217;s identified enterprise risk categories on behalf of the full Board of Directors. Under the direction of the Risk Oversight Committee, management committees apply targeted strategies to reduce the risks to which the Company&#8217;s operations are exposed. 

The Company&#8217;s ERM program is executed along the three lines of defense model, which provides for a consistent and standardized risk management control environment across the enterprise. The first line of defense is comprised of production, operational, and support units. The second line of defense is comprised of various risk management and control functions charged with monitoring and managing specific major risk categories and/or risk subcategories. The third line of defense is comprised of the Internal Audit function and Independent Asset Review. Internal Audit provides assurance and evaluates the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes as established by the Company. Internal Audit has organizational independence and objectivity, reporting directly to the Board&#8217;s Audit Committee. Further discussion and analysis of each major risk area are included in the following sub-sections of Risk Management. 

Credit Risk Management 

Credit risk is the risk that a borrower or counterparty will fail to perform according to the terms and conditions of a loan or investment and expose the Company to loss. Credit risk exists with many of the Company&#8217;s assets and exposures such as loans and certain derivatives. The majority of the Company&#8217;s credit risk is associated with lending activities. 

The Risk Oversight Committee has primary oversight responsibility of identified enterprise risk categories including credit risk. The Risk Oversight Committee monitors management&#8217;s assessment of asset quality, credit risk trends, credit quality administration, underwriting standards, and portfolio credit risk management strategies and processes, such as diversification and concentration limits, all of which enable management to control credit risk. At the management level, the Credit Risk Management Committee has primary oversight responsibility for credit risk. The Senior Credit Supervision function manages credit policy and provides the resources to manage the line of business transactional credit risk, assuring that all exposure is risk-rated according to the requirements of the credit risk rating policy. The Senior Credit Supervision function evaluates and reports the overall credit risk exposure to senior management and the Risk Oversight Committee. The Independent Asset Review function supports a strong credit risk management culture by providing independent and objective assessment of underwriting and documentation quality, reporting directly to the Board&#8217;s Risk Oversight Committee. A key focus of our credit risk management is adherence to a well-controlled underwriting process. 

The Company assesses the overall credit quality performance of the loans held-for-investment portfolio through an integrated analysis of specific performance ratios. This approach forms the basis of the discussion in the sections immediately following: Nonperforming Assets, TDRs and Allowance for Credit Losses. 

Credit Quality 

The Company utilizes a credit risk rating system to assist in monitoring credit quality. Loans are evaluated using the Company&#8217;s internal credit risk rating of 1 through 10. Loans risk rated 1 through 5 are assigned an internal risk rating of &#8220;Pass.&#8221; Loans assigned with a credit risk rating of 6 have potential weaknesses that warrant closer attention by management and are assigned an internal risk rating of &#8220;Special mention.&#8221; Loans assigned a credit risk rating of 7 or 8 have well-defined weaknesses that may jeopardize the full and timely repayment of the loan; these are assigned an internal risk rating of &#8220;Substandard.&#8221; Loans assigned a credit risk rating of 9 have insufficient sources of repayment and a high probability of loss; these are assigned an internal risk rating of &#8220;Doubtful.&#8221; Loans assigned a credit risk rating of 10 are uncollectible and of such little value that they are no longer considered bankable assets; these are assigned an internal risk rating of &#8220;Loss.&#8221; Exposures categorized as criticized consist of &#8220;Special mention,&#8221; &#8220;Substandard,&#8221; &#8220;Doubtful&#8221; and &#8220;Loss&#8221; categories. Exposures categorized as classified consist of &#8220;Substandard,&#8221; &#8220;Doubtful,&#8221; and &#8220;Loss&#8221; categories. For more information on credit quality indicators, refer to Note 6 &#8212; Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets are comprised of nonaccrual loans, other real estate owned (&#8220;OREO&#8221;), and other nonperforming assets. Other nonperforming assets and OREO are repossessed assets and properties, respectively, acquired through foreclosure, or through full or partial satisfaction of loans held-for-investment. Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due or when the full collection of principal or interest becomes uncertain regardless of the length of past due status. Collectability is generally assessed based on economic and business conditions, the borrower&#8217;s financial condition and the adequacy of collateral, if any. For additional details regarding the Company&#8217;s nonaccrual loan policy, see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Loans Held-for-Investment to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

Nonaccrual loans were $93.2 million as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of $122.0 million or 57% from $215.2 million as of December 31, 2020. This decrease was predominantly due to the resolutions of C&#38;I oil and gas exposures and CRE loans. 

As of December 31, 2021, $54.2 million or 58% of nonaccrual loans were less than 90 days delinquent. In comparison, $106.4 million or 49% of nonaccrual loans were less than 90 days delinquent as of December 31, 2020. 

OREO was $363 thousand as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of $15.5 million from $15.8 million as of December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of two CRE properties totaling $40.7 million. During 2021, the Company took possession of one CRE property totaling $28.8 million. 

Other nonperforming assets totaled $9.9 million and $3.9 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, a net increase of $6.0 million or 155%, due to transfers of nonaccrual C&#38;I oil and gas loans to foreclosed assets, partially offset by the sales and write-downs of oil and gas foreclosed assets.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

TDRs are loans for which contractual terms have been modified by the Company for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, and for which a concession to the borrower was granted that the Company would not otherwise consider. The Company&#8217;s loan modifications are handled on a case-by-case basis and are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan collectability and meet the borrower&#8217;s financial needs. The following table presents the performing and nonperforming TDRs by loan portfolio segments as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. The allowance for loan losses for TDRs was $4.8 million as of December 31, 2021, and $10.3 million as of December 31, 2020.

Performing TDRs were $113.8 million as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of $29.4 million or 21% from $143.2 million as of December 31, 2020. This decrease reflected payoffs and paydowns of performing C&#38;I and construction TDR loans, partially offset by the transfers of C&#38;I TDRs from nonperforming to performing status. Over 94% and 85% of the performing TDRs were current as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Nonperforming TDRs were $30.4 million as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of $41.5 million or 58% from $71.9 million as of December 31, 2020. This decrease primarily reflected transfers of certain C&#38;I TDRs from nonperforming to performing status, and payoffs and charge-offs of C&#38;I TDRs. The decrease was partially offset by newly designated nonperforming C&#38;I TDR loans. 

Existing TDRs that were subsequently modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be classified as TDRs. As of December 31, 2021, there were two TDRs totaling $145 thousand that were provided subsequent modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Loan Modifications Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic 

Since late March 2020, under various forbearance programs, the Company has granted a range of commercial and consumer loan accommodations, predominantly in the form of payment deferrals, to provide relief to borrowers experiencing financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Section 4013 of the CARES Act, as amended by the CAA, permits a financial institution to elect to temporarily suspend TDR accounting under ASC Subtopic 310-40 in certain circumstances. To be eligible under Section 4013 of the CARES Act, a loan modification must be (1) related to the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) executed on a loan that was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019; and (3) executed between March 1, 2020, and the earlier of (a) 60 days after the date of termination of the federal National Emergency or (b) January 1, 2022. The federal banking regulators, in consultation with the FASB, issued the Interagency Statement on April 7, 2020, confirming that, for loans not subject to Section 4013 of the CARES Act, short-term modifications (i.e. six months or less) made on a good faith basis in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to borrowers who were current as of the implementation date of a loan modification, or modifications granted under government mandated modification programs, are not considered as TDRs under ASC Subtopic 310-40. See additional information in Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Troubled Debt Restructurings in this Form 10-K . 

The delinquency aging of loans modified related to the COVID-19 pandemic is frozen at the time of the modification. As a result, the recognition of delinquent loans, nonaccrual status, and loan net charge-offs may be delayed for certain borrowers who are enrolled in these loan modification programs, which would have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status. Interest income continues to be recognized over the accommodation periods. 

The following table provides a summary of the COVID-19 pandemic-related loan modifications that remained under their modified terms as of December 31, 2021. The amounts represent loan modifications that meet the criteria under Section 4013 of the CARES Act, as amended by the CAA, or the Interagency Statement and therefore are not considered as TDRs. These amounts exclude loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic made on existing TDRs. A loan is counted once in the table regardless of the number of accommodations received.

The above table excludes loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic that did not meet the criteria provided under Section 4013 of the CARES Act, as amended by the CAA, or the Interagency Statement, and that were evaluated and deemed to not be classified as TDRs. The determination to not consider a modification a TDR was made on the premise that the amount of the delayed restructured payments was insignificant relative to the unpaid principal or the collateral value of the loan, resulting in an insignificant shortfall in the contractual amount due from the borrower, or an insignificant delay in the timing of the restructured payment period relative to the payment frequency under the loan&#8217;s original contractual maturity or expected duration. 

The COVID-19 pandemic-related loan modifications primarily consisted of payment deferrals 12 months or less in duration, in the form of either principal payment deferrals, where the borrower was still paying interest, or full principal and interest payment deferrals. Other forbearance programs consisted of interest rate concessions. The deferred payments for commercial loans are either repaid at contractual maturity, or spread over the remaining contractual term of the loan. The deferred payments for consumer loans are repaid under defined payment plans between six to 72 months after the deferral period ends, or the loan term is extended beyond the contractual maturity by the number of payments deferred. 

As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $363.1 million of loans under payment deferral and forbearance programs, a decrease of $620.1 million or 63% from $983.2 million as of December 31, 2020. The loans on deferral as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020, predominantly consisted of CRE and residential mortgage loans. The year-to-date decrease in loans on deferral reflected the lifting of the COVID-19 pandemic-related business shutdowns and restrictions on travel and restaurant dining. The CRE COVID-19-related loan deferrals that were making at least partial payments increased from 73% as of December 31, 2020, to 100% as of December 31, 2021. Modifications are considered to have exited active accommodation after the borrower exited the modification program or after the modification period expired. The loans with exited or expired COVID-19 pandemic modifications were predominantly current as of December 31, 2021. The Company monitors the delinquency status of loans exiting relief programs on an ongoing basis. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic loan modifications were considered in determination of the allowance for credit losses. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

ASU 2016-13, Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses to be based on management&#8217;s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Company&#8217;s relevant financial assets. The allowance for credit losses estimate uses various models and estimation techniques based on historical loss experience, current borrower characteristics, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and other relevant factors. 

In addition to the allowance for loan losses, the Company maintains an allowance for unfunded credit commitments. The Company has three general areas for which it provides the allowance for unfunded credit commitments: 1) recourse obligations for loans sold, 2) letters of credit, and 3) unfunded lending commitments. The Company&#8217;s methodology for determining the allowance calculation for unfunded lending commitments uses the lifetime loss rates of the on-balance sheet commitment. Recourse obligations for loans sold and letters of credit use the weighted loss rates for the applicable segment of the individual credit. 

In the case of loans and securities, allowance for credit losses are contra-asset valuation accounts that are deducted from the amortized cost basis of these assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. In the case of unfunded credit commitments, the allowance for credit losses is a liability account that is reported as a component of Accrued expenses and other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

The Company is committed to maintaining the allowance for credit losses at a level that is commensurate with the estimated inherent losses in the loan portfolio, including unfunded credit facilities. While the Company believes that the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2021 was appropriate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio and in unfunded credit commitments based on the information available, future allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to, accounting standard and regulatory changes, loan growth, portfolio performance and general economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires numerous estimates and judgements. For a description of the policies, methodologies and judgments used to determine the allowance for credit losses, see Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Critical Accounting Estimates, Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6 &#8212; Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

The following table presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan portfolio segments as of the periods indicated:

The allowance for loan losses was $541.6 million as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of $78.4 million from $620.0 million as of December 31, 2020, primaril y driven by a reduction in the allowance against the C&#38;I loan portfolio. Th e change in th e allowance reflects an improvement over the year in the macroeconomic forecast, partially offset by loan growth. 

The Company considers multiple economic scenarios to develop the estimate of the allowance for loan losses. The scenarios may consist of a base forecast representing management&#8217;s view of the most likely outcome, and downside or upside scenarios reflecting possible worsening or improving economic conditions. The base forecast assumed that the worst of the pandemic had passed in 2021 and that COVID-19 variants would be seasonal and less disruptive in the future, with the economic outlook continuing to improve. Macroeconomic assumptions underlying the base forecast include: (1) annual Gross Domestic Product (&#8220;GDP&#8221;) growth of 4.4% for 2022; (2) a return to a 3.5% unemployment rate by the end of 2022; and (3) rising interest rates. The downside scenario assumed a pullback in the expected economic recovery due to rising concerns about COVID-19 variants, with no growth in GDP and a rise in unemployment throughout 2022. The upside scenario assumed a more optimistic view of the economic recovery, including higher GDP growth through 2022 and a faster return to full employment by mid-2022. 

As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, PPP loans outstanding were $534.2 million and $1.57 billion, respectively. Because these loans are fully guaranteed by the SBA, there was no allowance for loan losses established for these loans as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. 

The following table presents net charge-offs and the net charge-offs to average loans ratios based on the loan categories as of the periods indicated:

2021 net charge-offs were $50.0 million or 0.13% of average loans-held-for-investment, compared with $63.2 million or 0.17% of average loan held-for-investment in 2020. The year-over-year decrease in net charge-offs was primarily due to a decrease in C&#38;I charge-offs, partially offset by an increase in CRE charge-offs. The decrease in C&#38;I charge-offs was primarily driven by fewer oil and gas loan charge-offs, while the increase in CRE charge-offs was primarily driven by one CRE relationship. The recognition of certain loan charge-offs could be delayed due to payment deferral activities instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The allowance for unfunded credit commitments was $27.5 million as of December 31, 2021, compared with $33.6 million as of December 31, 2020. 

Liquidity Risk Management 

Liquidity 

Liquidity is a financial institution&#8217;s capacity to meet its deposit and other counterparties&#8217; obligations as they come due, compensate for balance sheet fluctuations, and provide funds for growth. The objective of liquidity management is to manage the potential mismatch of asset and liability cash flows at a reasonable cost. Maintaining an adequate level of liquidity depends on the institution&#8217;s ability to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected cash, and collateral needs without adversely affecting daily operations or the financial condition of the institution. To achieve this objective, the Company analyzes its liquidity risk, maintains readily available liquid assets and utilizes diverse funding sources including its stable core deposit base. 

The Board of Directors&#8217; Risk Oversight Committee has primary oversight responsibility over the Company&#8217;s liquidity risk. At the management level, the Company&#8217;s Asset/Liability Committee (&#8220;ALCO&#8221;) establishes the liquidity guidelines that govern the day-to-day active management of the Company&#8217;s liquidity position by requiring sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. These guidelines are established and monitored for both the Bank and East West, the parent company, on a stand-alone basis to ensure that the Company is a source of financial strength for its subsidiaries. The ALCO regularly monitors the liquidity status at the Company level, Bank level, and at foreign subsidiaries and branches, and related management processes, providing regular reports to the Board of Directors. The Company believes its liquidity management practices have been effective under both normal operating and stressed market conditions, including the financial stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Liquidity Sources. The Company&#8217;s primary source of funding is from deposits, which are relatively stable and low-cost. Total deposits amounted to $53.35 billion as of December 31, 2021, compared with $44.86 billion as of December 31, 2020. The Company&#8217;s loan-to-deposit ratio was 78% as of December 31, 2021, compared with 86% as of December 31, 2020. 

In addition to deposits, the Company has access to various sources of wholesale financing, including borrowing capacity with the FHLB and FRBSF, unsecured federal funds lines of credit with various correspondent banks, and several master repurchase agreements with major brokerage companies to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio, meet daily cash demands and allow management flexibility to execute its business strategy. Economic conditions and the stability of capital markets impact the Company&#8217;s access to and the cost of wholesale financing. The Company&#8217;s access to capital markets is also affected by the ratings received from various credit rating agencies. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had a total borrowing capacity of $25.27 billion. The Company had available borrowing capacity under secured borrowing lines of $11.93 billion with the FHLB and $4.05 billion with the FRBSF. Unencumbered loans and/or securities were pledged to the FHLB and the FRBSF discount window as collateral. The Company has established operational procedures to enable borrowing against these assets, including regular monitoring of the total pool of loans and securities eligible as collateral. Eligibility of collateral is defined in guidelines from the FHLB and FRBSF and is subject to change at their discretion. The Bank&#8217;s unsecured federal funds lines of credit with correspondent banks, subject to availability, totaled $1.03 billion as of December 31, 2021. Estimated borrowing capacity from unpledged AFS debt securities totaled $8.26 billion as of December 31, 2021. See Item 7. &#8212; MD&#38;A &#8212; Balance Sheet Analysis &#8212; Deposits and Other Sources of Funding in this Form 10-K for further detail related to the Company&#8217;s funding sources. 

The Company maintains a certain level of liquid assets in the form of cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing deposits with banks, short-term resale agreements, and unencumbered high-quality and liquid AFS debt securities. The following table presents the Company&#8217;s liquid assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:

Unencumbered liquid assets totaled $15.63 billion as of December 31, 2021, compared with $10.68 billion as of December 31, 2020. AFS debt securities consist of high quality and liquid securities with relatively short durations to minimize overall interest rate and liquidity risks. The Company believes these AFS debt securities are sources of liquidity that will permit it to quickly obtain financing, regardless of market conditions, through sale or pledging. 

Management believes that the Company&#8217;s excess cash, borrowing capacity and access to sufficient sources of capital are adequate to meet its short-term and long-term liquidity needs in the foreseeable future. In addition, the Company may use debt and equity issuances when costs are deemed attractive, should longer term needs arise. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Cash Requirements. In the ordinary course of the Company&#8217;s business, the Company enters into contractual obligations that require future cash payments, including funding for customer deposit withdrawals, repayments for short-term and long-term borrowings, leases obligations and other cash commitments. The Company also has off-balance sheet arrangements which represent transactions that are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company&#8217;s off-balance sheet arrangements include (i) commitments to extend credit, such as loan commitments, commercial letters of credit for foreign and domestic trade, standby letters of credit (&#8220;SBLCs&#8221;), and financial guarantees, to meet financing needs of its customers, (ii) future interest obligations related to customer deposits and the Company&#8217;s borrowings, and (iii) transactions with unconsolidated entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the Company. Since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future funding requirements. Information about the Company&#8217;s loan commitments, commercial letters of credit and SBLCs is provided in Note 12 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form10-K. 

The following table shows the Company&#8217;s material cash requirements from significant and determinable contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021. The Company&#8217;s liquidity sources have been, and are expected to be, sufficient to meet such cash requirements.

The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows summarizes the Company&#8217;s sources and uses of cash by type of activities in 2021, 2020, and 2019. Excess cash generated by operating and investing activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Liquidity for East West. In addition to bank level liquidity management, the Company manages liquidity at the parent company level for various operating needs including payment of dividends, repurchases of common stock, principal and interest payments on its borrowings, acquisitions and additional investments in its subsidiaries. East West&#8217;s primary source of liquidity is from cash dividends distributed by its subsidiary, East West Bank. The Bank is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends as discussed in Item 1 . Business &#8212; Supervision and Regulation &#8212; Dividends and Other Transfers of Funds in this Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2021, East West held $345.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, after receiving $200.0 million in dividends from the Bank. In comparison, as of December 31, 2020, East West held $439.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, after receiving $511.0 million in dividends from the Bank. The dividends from the Bank to East West have historically been sufficient to meet the projected cash obligations of the parent company for the coming year. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Liquidity Stress Testing. Liquidity stress testing is performed at the Company and Bank level, as well as at the foreign subsidiary and foreign branch levels. Stress tests and scenario analyses are intended to quantify the potential impact of a liquidity event on the financial and liquidity position of the entity. Scenario analyses include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources, market triggers, potential uses of funding and economic conditions in certain countries. In addition, Company specific events are incorporated into the stress testing. Liquidity stress tests are conducted to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons, both immediate and longer term, and over a variety of stressed conditions. Given the range of potential stresses, the Company maintains contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for individual entities. 

As of December 31, 2021, the Company was not aware of any material commitments for capital expenditures in the foreseeable future and believes it has adequate liquidity resources to conduct operations and meet other needs in the ordinary course of business. Given the uncertainty of economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company will continue to actively evaluate the nature and extent of impact on its business and financial position. For more information of how the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our liquidity, see Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic in this Form 10-K. 

Market Risk Management 

Market risk is the risk that the Company&#8217;s financial condition may change resulting from adverse movements in market rates or prices including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, interest rate contracts, investment securities prices, credit spreads and related risk resulting from mismatches in rate sensitive assets and liabilities. In the event of market stress, the risk could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. 

The Board&#8217;s Risk Oversight Committee has primary oversight responsibility over market risk management. At the management level, the ALCO establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market risk management activities. Corporate Treasury supports the ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks. 

Interest Rate Risk Management 

Interest rate risk results primarily from the Company&#8217;s traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans, which are the primary areas of market risk for the Company. Economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates, and consumer preferences impact the level of noninterest-bearing funding sources at the Company, as well as affect the difference between the interest the Company earns on interest-earning assets and pays on interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, changes in interest rates can influence the rate of principal prepayments on loans and the speed of deposit withdrawals. Due to the pricing term mismatches and the embedded options inherent in certain products, changes in market interest rates not only affect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic value of these interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Other market risks include foreign currency exchange risk and equity price risk. These risks are not considered significant to the Company, and no separate quantitative information concerning these risks is presented herein. 

With oversight by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, the ALCO coordinates the overall management of the Company&#8217;s interest rate risk. The ALCO meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing the Company&#8217;s open market positions and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk. Management of interest rate risk is carried out primarily through strategies involving the Company&#8217;s debt securities portfolio, loan portfolio, available funding channels and capital market activities. In addition, the Company&#8217;s policies permit the use of derivative instruments to assist in managing interest rate risk. 

The interest rate risk exposure is measured and monitored through various risk management tools, which include a simulation model that performs interest rate sensitivity analyses under multiple interest rate scenarios. The model incorporates the Company&#8217;s cash instruments, loans, debt securities, resale agreements, deposits, borrowings and repurchase agreements, as well as financial instruments from the Company&#8217;s foreign operations. The Company uses both a static balance sheet and a forward growth balance sheet to perform these analyses. The simulated interest rate scenarios include a non-parallel shift in the yield curve (&#8220;rate shock&#8221;) and a gradual non-parallel shift in the yield curve (&#8220;rate ramp&#8221;) over a static balance sheet. In addition, the Company also performs simulations using alternative interest rate scenarios, including various permutations of the yield curve flattening, steepening or inverting. Results of these various simulations are used to formulate and gauge strategies to achieve a desired risk profile within the Company&#8217;s capital and liquidity guidelines. 

The net interest income simulation model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of the Company&#8217;s interest-rate sensitive assets, liabilities and related derivative contracts. It also incorporates various assumptions, which management believes to be reasonable but may have a significant impact on results. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the timing and magnitude of changes in interest rates, the yield curve evolution and shape, the correlation between various interest rate indices, financial instrument future repricing characteristics and spread relative to benchmark rates, and the effect of interest rate floors and caps. The modeled results are highly sensitive to deposit decay and deposit beta assumptions, which are derived from a regression analysis of the Company&#8217;s historical deposit data. The Company used full betas with each incremental rate increase in the rate ramp scenarios, and did not assume lags in repricing. Deposit beta commonly refers to the correlation of the changes in interest rates paid on deposits to changes in benchmark interest rates. The model is also sensitive to the loan and investment prepayment assumptions that are based on an independent model and the Company&#8217;s historical prepayment data, which consider anticipated prepayments under different interest rate environments. 

Simulation results are highly dependent on input assumptions. To the extent actual behavior is different from the assumptions in the models, there could be a material change in interest rate sensitivity. The assumptions applied in the model are documented and supported for reasonableness, and periodically back-tested to assess their effectiveness. The Company makes appropriate calibrations to the model as needed, continually refining the model, methodology and results. Changes to key model assumptions are reviewed by the ALCO. Scenario results do not reflect strategies that management could employ to limit the impact of changing interest rate expectations. 

To help address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and financial markets, the Federal Reserve reduced the benchmark federal funds rate to a target range of 0.00% to 0.25%. Throughout 2021, it elected to follow this approach as pandemic-related risks to the economy were likely to persist for the foreseeable future. At its January 2022 meeting, the Federal Reserve maintained the target interest rate at a range of 0.00% to 0.25% but reiterated its commitment to a shift away from pandemic-era economic stimulus toward containing inflation and signaled that the Federal Reserve was on track to raise interest rates in 2022 and 2023. 

Twelve-Month Net Interest Income Simulation 

Net interest income simulation modeling looks at interest rate risk through earnings. It projects the changes in interest rate sensitive asset and liability cash flows, expressed in terms of net interest income, over a specified time horizon for defined interest rates scenarios. Net interest income simulations generate insight into the impact of changes in market rates on earnings and guide risk management decisions. The Company assesses interest rate risk by comparing net interest income using different interest rate scenarios. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s net interest income sensitivity related to an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates of 100 and 200 bps in an upward direction as of December 31, 2021 and 2020: 

##TABLE_START Change in Interest Rates (in bps) Net Interest Income Volatility (1) 

December 31, 2021 2020 +200 19.5 % 12.6 % +100 9.4 % 5.6 % -100 NM NM -200 NM NM ##TABLE_END

NM &#8212; Not meaningful. 

(1) The percentage change represents net interest income over 12 months in a stable interest rate environment versus net interest income in the various rate scenarios. 

While an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates was used in the simulation model described in the preceding paragraphs, the Company believes that any shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and would therefore have a more modest impact, and non-parallel gradual rate shift scenarios may give a more meaningful estimate of the Company&#8217;s underlying interest rate risk. The rate ramp table below shows the net income volatility under a gradual non-parallel shift of the yield curve upward, in even quarterly increments over the first 12 months, followed by rates held constant thereafter: 

##TABLE_START Change in Interest Rates (in bps) Net Interest Income Volatility (1) 

December 31, 2021 2020 +200 Rate Ramp 9.2 % 4.9 % +100 Rate Ramp 4.1 % 2.2 % -100 Rate Ramp NM NM -200 Rate Ramp NM NM ##TABLE_END

NM &#8212; Not meaningful. 

(1) The percentage change represents net interest income under a gradual non-parallel shift in even quarterly increments over 12 months. 

As of December 31, 2021, the Company&#8217;s net interest income profile reflects an asset sensitive position. Net interest income is expected to increase if interest rates rise. The Company is naturally asset sensitive due to the large share of variable rate loans in its loan portfolio, which are primarily linked to Prime and LIBOR indices. The Company&#8217;s interest income is sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates. The Company&#8217;s deposit portfolio is primarily comprised of non-maturity deposits, which are not directly tied to short-term interest rate indices, but are, nevertheless, sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates. 

As of December 31, 2021, the Company&#8217;s estimated twelve-month net interest income sensitivity was higher under both non-parallel rate shift and ramp increases, as compared with the sensitivity as of December 31, 2020. The increased rate sensitivity in the Company&#8217;s net interest income was primarily due to an increase in noninterest-bearing deposits and updated deposit assumptions. 

Economic Value of Equity at Risk 

Economic value of equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;) is a cash flow calculation that takes the present value of all asset cash flows and subtracts the present value of all liability cash flows. This calculation is used for asset/liability management and measures changes in the economic value of the bank. The fair market values of a bank's assets and liabilities are directly linked to interest rates. The economic value approach provides a comparatively broader scope than the net income volatility approach since it captures all anticipated cash flows. 

EVE simulation reflects the effect of interest rate shifts on the value of the Company and is used to assess the degree of interest rate risk exposure. In contrast to the earnings perspective, the economic perspective identifies risks arising from repricing or maturity gaps over the life of the balance sheet. Changes in economic value indicate anticipated changes in the value of the bank&#8217;s future cash flows. Thus, the economic perspective can provide a leading indicator of the bank&#8217;s future earnings and capital values. The economic value method also reflects sensitivity across the full maturity spectrum of the bank&#8217;s assets and liabilities. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s EVE sensitivity related to an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates of 100 and 200 bps in an upward direction as of December 31, 2021 and 2020: 

##TABLE_START Change in Interest Rates (in bps) EVE Volatility (1) 

December 31, 2021 2020 +200 7.1 % 9.6 % +100 3.5 % 4.8 % -100 NM NM -200 NM NM ##TABLE_END

NM &#8212; Not meaningful. 

(1) The percentage change represents net portfolio value of the Company in a stable interest rate environment versus net portfolio value in the various rate scenarios. 

The Company&#8217;s EVE sensitivity for the upward interest rate scenarios decreased as of December 31, 2021, compared with the results as of December 31, 2020. The changes in EVE sensitivity during this period were primarily due to changes in the level and shape of the yield curve, as well as changes in the balance sheet mix. 

The Company&#8217;s EVE profile as of December 31, 2021, reflects an asset sensitive EVE position under the higher interest rate scenarios. Given the uncertainty of the magnitude, timing and direction of future interest rate movements, and the shape of the yield curve, actual results may vary from those predicted by the Company&#8217;s model. 

Derivatives 

It is the Company&#8217;s policy not to speculate on the future direction of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. However, the Company will periodically enter into derivative transactions in order to reduce its exposure to market risks, primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The Company believes that these derivative transactions, when properly structured and managed, may provide a hedge against inherent risk in certain assets and liabilities and against risk in specific transactions. Hedging transactions may be implemented using a variety of derivative instruments such as swaps, forwards and options. Prior to entering into any hedging activities, the Company analyzes the costs and benefits of the hedge in comparison to alternative strategies. In addition, the Company enters into derivative transactions in order to assist customers with their risk management objectives, such as managing exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodity prices. To economically hedge against the derivative contracts entered into with the Company&#8217;s customers, the Company enters into mirrored derivative contracts with third-party financial institutions. The exposures from derivative transactions are collateralized by cash and/or eligible securities based on limits as set forth in the respective agreements entered between the Company and counterparty financial institutions. 

The Company is subject to credit risk associated with the counterparties to the derivative contracts. This counterparty credit risk is a multi-dimensional form of risk, affected by both the exposure and credit quality of the counterparty, both of which are sensitive to market-induced changes. The Company&#8217;s Credit Risk Management Committee provides oversight of credit risks and the Company has guidelines in place to manage counterparty concentration, tenor limits and collateral. The Company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties, by entering into legally enforceable master netting arrangements, and by requiring collateral arrangements, where possible. The Company may also transfer counterparty credit risk-related to interest rate swaps to institutional third parties through the use of credit risk participation agreements. Certain derivative contracts are required to be centrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty credit risk. The Company incorporates credit value adjustments and other market standard methodologies to appropriately reflect its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty&#8217;s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements of its derivatives. 

The following table summarizes certain information about derivative financial instruments utilized by the Company in its management of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:

Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments &#8212; Interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in the Company&#8217;s asset and liability management activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage the Company&#8217;s interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. We use derivatives to hedge the risk of variable cash flows that the Company is exposed to from its variable interest rate borrowings, including repurchase agreements and FHLB advances. The Company also uses derivatives to hedge the risk of changes in the USD equivalent value of a designated monetary amount of the Company&#8217;s investment in East West Bank (China) Limited. For both cash flow and net investment hedges, the change in the fair value of the hedging instruments is recognized in AOCI, net of tax , on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

The fluctuation in foreign currency translation of the hedged exposure is expected to be offset by changes in the fair value of the forward contracts. As of December 31, 2021, the outstanding foreign currency forward contracts effectively hedged approximately 50% of the net RMB exposure from East West Bank (China) Limited. 

Changes to the composition of the Company&#8217;s derivatives designated as hedging instruments during 2021 reflect actions taken for interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk management. The Company repositions its derivatives portfolio based on the current assessment of economic and financial conditions, including the interest rate and foreign currency environments, balance sheet composition and trends, and the relative mix of its cash and derivative positions. 

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments &#8212; The Company enters into interest rate, foreign exchange and energy commodity contracts to support the business needs of its customers. When derivative transactions are executed with its customers, the derivative contracts are offset by paired trades with third-party financial institutions. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are either exchange-traded, centrally cleared through a clearinghouse or over-the counter. 

The Company offers various interest rate derivative contracts to its customers. For the interest rate contracts entered into with its customers, the Company managed its interest rate risk by entering into offsetting interest rate contracts with third-party financial institutions and central clearing organizations. Certain derivative contracts entered into with central clearing organizations are settled-to-market daily to the extent the central clearing organizations&#8217; rulebooks legally characterize the variation margin as settlement. Derivative contracts allow borrowers to lock in attractive intermediate and long-term fixed rate financing while not increasing the interest rate risk to the Company. These transactions are not linked to any specific Company assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, or to forecasted transactions in a hedging relationship, and are therefore classified as economic hedges. The contracts are marked-to-market at each reporting period. The changes in fair values of the derivative contracts traded with third-party financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the derivative transactions executed with customers throughout the terms of these contracts, except for the credit valuation adjustment component. The Company records credit valuation adjustments on the derivatives to properly reflect the variances of credit worthiness between the Company and the counterparties, considering the effects of enforceable master netting agreements and collateral arrangements. 

The Company enters into foreign exchange contracts with its customers, consisting of forward, spot, swap and option contracts to accommodate the business needs of its customers. For the foreign exchange contracts entered into with its customers, the Company managed its foreign exchange and credit exposures by entering into offsetting foreign exchange contracts with third-party financial institutions and/or entering into bilateral collateral and master netting agreements with customer counterparties. The changes in the fair values entered with third-party financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the foreign exchange transactions executed with the customers throughout the terms of these contracts. As of December 31, 2021, the Company anticipates performance by all counterparties and has not experienced nonperformance by any of its counterparties, and therefore did not incur any related losses. The Company also utilizes foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to mitigate the economic effect of fluctuations in certain foreign currency on-balance sheet assets and liabilities, primarily foreign currency denominated deposits offered to its customers. The Company&#8217;s policies permit taking proprietary currency positions within approved limits, in compliance with exemptions to proprietary trading restrictions provided under Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, or the Volcker Rule. The Company does not speculate in the foreign exchange markets, and actively manages its foreign exchange exposures within prescribed risk limits and defined controls. 

The Company enters into energy commodity contracts with its customers to allow them to hedge against the risk of energy commodity price fluctuations. To economically hedge against the risk of commodity price fluctuations in the products offered to its customers, the Company enters into offsetting commodity contracts with third-party financial institutions and central clearing organizations. Certain derivative contracts entered into with central clearing organizations are settled to market daily, to the extent the central clearing organizations&#8217; rulebooks legally characterize the variation margin as settlement. The changes in fair values of the energy commodity contracts traded with third-party financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the energy commodity transactions executed with customers throughout the terms of these contracts. 

Additional information on the Company&#8217;s derivatives is presented in Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Derivatives, Note 2 &#8212; Fair Value Measurement and Fair Value of Financial Instruments, and Note 5 &#8212; Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The Company&#8217;s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Certain of these policies include critical accounting estimates, which are subject to valuation assumptions, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and it is likely that materially different amounts could be reported under different assumptions and conditions. The Company has procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. The following is a brief description of the Company&#8217;s critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments. 

Allowance for Loan Losses and Unfunded Credit Commitments 

ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses to be based on management&#8217;s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Company&#8217;s relevant financial assets. The Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses, which includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded credit commitments, is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve sufficient to absorb losses inherent in our credit portfolio. Management&#8217;s ongoing determination of the appropriateness of the allowance involves significan t judgements including, but no t limited to, the development and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of historical loss experience, assessment of key credit risk characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of collateral, and the determination of remaining expected life. The allowance for credit losses considers the unique risk characteristics of the loan portfolio segments. The commercial loan portfolio is comprised of C&#38;I, CRE, multifamily residential, and construction and land loans; and the consumer loan portfolio is comprised of single-family residential, HELOCs, and other consumer loans. 

When similar risk characteristics exist, the Company measures the expected loan losses on a collective pool basis. Lifetime loss rate models have been adopted for the portfolios, which use historical loss rates and forecast economic variables to calculate the expected credit losses for each loan pool. Models consisting of quantitative and qualitative components are designed for each pool to develop the expected credit loss estimate. Quantitative methods consider factors such as historical loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio, as well as an economic outlook over the life of the loan. Our allowance for credit losses is sensitive to the macroeconomic forecast assumptions. The Company incorporates forward-looking information using macroeconomic scenarios applied over the forecasted life of the loans. These macroeconomic scenarios, which are applied over a reasonable and supportable forecast period, consist of the base forecast representing management&#8217;s view of the most likely outcome reflected in the financial statements, along with two additional scenarios considered in calculating the allowance for loan loss estimate. The additional scenarios include downside and upside scenarios reflecting possible worsening or improving economic conditions. The scenarios are based on quantitative components, such as macroeconomic variables that are most relevant to the Company&#8217;s modeled credit losses, and qualitative components not already considered in the quantitative components, such as the environment factors including the uncertainties in the loan portfolio resulted from the estimated impact from the pandemic on credit losses, as well as the regulatory environment. 

Under the base forecast, the U.S. unemployment rate is expected to fall from below 4.0% at the start of 2022 to 3.5% by the end of 2022 and remain in this range thereafter. The U.S. real GDP is expected to grow by 4.4% for 2022 and taper down to below 3.0% by mid-2023. The downside scenario assumed a slower recovery to full employment and forecasted an increase in the U.S. unemployment rate throughout 2022, averaging 4.1% higher than the base scenario with a peak difference of 5.5% in the first quarter of 2023. A flat growth is assumed for real GDP in 2022, followed by a slower recovery thereafter. The upside scenario assumed a more optimistic view for the economic recovery, including higher annual GDP growth at 6.3% for 2022 and a faster return to full employment by mid-2022. 

The following sensitivity analysis does not represent management&#8217;s view of expected credit losses as of December 31, 2021 but is provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of allowance for credit losses considering the impact of alternative macroeconomic forecasts. If the Company applied a 100% weighting to the downside scenario rather than a weighting of multiple scenarios, and excluded the effects of the qualitative components to the allowance for credit losses, the difference between the weighted qualitative modeled loss estimates and downside scenario as of December 31, 2021 are as follows: 

&#8226; An increase of approximately $166 million in the allowance for credit losses for the commercial loan portfolio and its lending-related commitments. 

&#8226; An increase of approximately $5 million in the allowance for credit losses for the consumer loan portfolio and its lending-related commitments. 

The above sensitivity analysis is not intended to reflect the expected future changes in the allowance for credit losses. Additionally, qualitative factors such as the stress from the COVID-19 pandemic and the pace of the economic recovery, were excluded from the macroeconomic variables in the above sensitivity analysis, but were considered in estimating the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2021. While the effect of the current economic environment and the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be uncertain, the Company believes that its estimates for the allowance for credit losses are supported and reasonable. 

When loans do not share risk characteristics, the Company evaluates the expected credit losses on an individual basis if, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement. The following three different asset valuation measurement methods are available: (1) the present value of expected future cash flows, (2) the fair value of collateral less costs to sell, and (3) the loan&#8217;s observable market price. The allowance for loan losses for collateral-dependent loans is determined based on the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. For loans that are not collateral-dependent, the Company applies the present value of expected future cash flows valuation or the market value of the loan. 

The allowance for unfunded credit commitments includes reserves provided for unfunded loan commitments, letters of credit, SBLCs and recourse obligations for loans sold. For all off-balance sheet instruments and commitments, the unfunded credit exposure is calculated using utilization assumptions based on the Company's historical utilization experience in related portfolio segments. Loss rates are applied to the calculated exposure balances to estimate the allowance for unfunded credit commitments. Other elements such as credit risk factors for loans outstanding, terms and expiration dates of the unfunded credit facilities, and other pertinent information are considered to determine the adequacy of the allowance. 

For additional information on allowance for credit losses, see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6 &#8212; Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

Fair Value Estimates 

A portion of the Company&#8217;s financial instruments are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, with changes in fair value recorded either through earnings or other comprehensive income (loss). Financial instruments measured on a recurring basis include AFS debt securities, certain equity securities and derivatives. 

In determining the fair value of financial instruments, the Company uses market prices of the same or similar instruments whenever such prices are available. The Company does not use prices involving distressed sellers in determining fair value. Changes in the market conditions such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities, may increase variability or reduce the availability of market prices used to determine fair value. If observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain, then fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flows analysis. These modeling techniques incorporate management&#8217;s assessments regarding assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability, including the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique and the risk of nonperformance. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Company could result in different estimates of fair value of financial instruments. 

Significant judgment is also required to determine the fair value hierarchy for certain financial instruments. When fair values are based on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement, the financial assets and liabilities are classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy established under ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement . Total recurring Level 3 assets were $215 thousand and $273 thousand as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and there were no recurring Level 3 liabilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. 

Assets measured on a nonrecurring basis, include certain individually evaluated loans held-for-investment, loans held-for-sale, investments in qualified affordable housing partnerships, tax credit and other investments, OREO and other nonperforming assets. Total non-recurring Level 3 assets were $127.0 million and $208.8 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

For a complete discussion on the Company&#8217;s fair value hierarchy of financial instruments, fair value measurement techniques and assumptions, and the impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements, see Note 2 &#8212; Fair Value Measurement and Fair Value of Financial Instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

Goodwill Impairment 

The Company assesses goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that indicate a potential impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill to determine whether it is likely or not the fair value is less than its carrying amount or elect to bypass the qualitative test and proceed directly to a quantitative test. Factors considered in qualitative assessments may include but are not limited to macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, financial performance of the respective operating segment and other specific reporting unit considerations. If the qualitative analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit&#8217;s fair value is less than its carrying fair value, the Company is required to perform a quantitative assessment to determine if there is goodwill impairment. A quantitative valuation involves determining the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing the fair value to its corresponding carrying value. In order to determine the fair value of the reporting units, a combined income approach and market approach is used. 

Significant judgments are applied and assumptions are made when estimating the fair value of the reporting units. Estimates of fair value are dependent upon various factors including estimates of the profitability of the Company&#8217;s reporting units, long term growth rates and the estimated market cost of equity, such as the discount rate and price multiples of comparable companies. Imprecision in estimating these factors can affect the estimated fair value of the reporting units. Certain events or circumstances could have a negative effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting units, including declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions and adverse regulatory or legislative changes, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period. As of December 31, 2021, there is no goodwill impairment booked as a result of the evaluation. For additional information on goodwill, see in Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 8 &#8212; Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. For information on how reporting units were determined and the methodology and assumptions used to determine reporting unit fair values, see Note 17 &#8212; Business Segments in this Form 10-K. 

Income Taxes 

The Company is subject to income tax laws of the various tax jurisdictions in which it conducts business, including the U.S., its states and the municipalities, and the tax jurisdictions in Hong Kong and China. The Company estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to these various tax jurisdictions. The estimated income tax expense or benefit is reported on the Consolidated Statement of Income. 

Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or due from various tax jurisdictions in the current year and are reported in Accrued expenses and other liabilities or Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In estimating accrued taxes, the Company assesses the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent, and other pertinent information. The income tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the Company and the relevant government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining the tax accruals and in evaluating the tax positions, including evaluating uncertain tax positions. Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, tax credits, interpretations of tax laws, the status of examinations by the tax authorities, and newly enacted statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance that could impact the relative merits and risks of tax positions. These changes, when occur, impact tax expense and can materially affect our operating results and financial condition. The Company reviews its tax positions on a quarterly basis and makes adjustments to accrued taxes as new information becomes available. 

Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. Such assets arise due to temporary differences between the financial accounting basis and the income tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. The Company regularly evaluates the realizability of deferred tax assets. The available evidence used in connection with the evaluations includes taxable income, potential tax-planning strategies, and projected future reversals of deferred tax items. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, in an income tax return. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that management believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of realization upon settlement. Tax benefits not meeting our realization criteria represent unrecognized tax benefits. The Company establishes a liability for potential taxes, interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions based on facts and circumstances, including the interpretation of existing law, new judicial or regulatory guidance, and the status of tax audits. The Company believes that adequate provisions have been recorded for all income tax uncertainties consistent with ASC 740, Income Taxes as of December 31, 2021 . See Note 11 &#8212; Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information on income taxes.

Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

To supplement the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company uses certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with, or as an alternative to U.S. GAAP. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company&#8217;s performance that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A non-GAAP financial measure may also be a financial metric that is not required by U.S. GAAP or other applicable requirements. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance, and allow comparability to prior periods. These non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. 

During 2020, the Compan y recorded $10.7 million in recoveries, of which $1.1 million was recorded as an impairment recovery, and $5.1 million in uncertain tax position related to DC Solar. In addition, the Company prepaid $150.0 million of repurchase agreements and incurred a debt extinguishment cost of $8.7 million in 2020 . During 2019, the Company recorded a $7.0 million impairment charge, reversed $30.1 million of certain previously claimed tax credits and subsequently recovered $1.6 million related to DC Solar. 

The following tables present the reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures of 2021, 2020 and 2019:
