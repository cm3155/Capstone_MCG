Overview 

The following discussion provides information about the results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources of East West Bancorp, Inc. (referred to herein on an unconsolidated basis as &#8220;East West&#8221; and on a consolidated basis as the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we&#8221; or &#8220;EWBC&#8221;), and its subsidiaries, including its subsidiary bank, East West Bank and its subsidiaries (referred to herein as &#8220;East West Bank&#8221; or the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). This information is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this report, and the Company&#8217;s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) on February 26, 2021 (the &#8220;Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K&#8221;). 

Company Overview 

East West is a bank holding company incorporated in Delaware on August 26, 1998 and is registered under the Bank Holding Company Act. The Company commenced business on December 30, 1998 when, pursuant to a reorganization, it acquired all of the voting stock of the Bank, which became its principal asset. The Bank is an independent commercial bank headquartered in California that has a strong focus on the financial service needs of the Asian-American community. Through over 120 locations in the U.S. and China, the Company provides a full range of consumer and commercial products and services through three business segments: Consumer and Business Banking, Commercial Banking, and Other (which includes the remaining operations) . The Company&#8217;s principal activity is lending to and accepting deposits from businesses and individuals. The primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is principally derived from the difference between interest earned on loans and debt securities and interest paid on deposits and other funding sources. As of March 31, 2021, the Company had $56.87 billion in assets and approximately 3,200 full-time equivalent employees. For additional information on products and services provided by the Bank, see Item 1. Business &#8212; Banking Services of the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 Global Pandemic 

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) pandemic has caused significant disruption around the world, as well as economic and financial market deterioration. The economic and operating conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have created financial difficulties for many of the Company&#8217;s commercial and consumer customers. As a result, some borrowers may not be able to satisfy their obligations to us. As many of the Company&#8217;s loans are secured by real estate, a potential decline in the real estate markets could also negatively impact the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition and the credit quality of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio. We do not know and cannot quantify all of the specific impacts, and the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, in 2021. The impact will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic; actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic, including vaccinations; the effect on our customers and employees; and the effect on the economy and markets. While COVID-19 cases have begun to ease during the first quarter of 2021, the spread of new, more contagious variants could impact the magnitude and duration of this health crisis. However, ongoing virus containment efforts and vaccination progress, as well as the possibility of further government stimulus measures, could accelerate the macroeconomic recovery. 

Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic 

Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act &#8212; The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the &#8220;CARES Act&#8221;) was enacted on March 27, 2020 to lessen the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals, businesses and local economies. The CARES Act initiatives included extended unemployment benefits, mortgage forbearance, the Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;) Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;) and funding, and authorization for the Main Street Lending Program (&#8220;MSLP&#8221;). The Company participated in the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System&#8217;s (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;) MSLP and funded $233.6 million in MSLP loans as of December 31, 2020. The related Main Street special purpose vehicle purchased participations in these loans amounting to $221.9 million or 95% of the total amount of MSLP loans funded as of March 31, 2021. The MSLP was terminated on January 8, 2021 and the Company did not further participate in the program during the first quarter of 2021. The CARES Act also required mortgage servicers to grant, on a borrower&#8217;s request, forbearance for up to 180 days (which could be extended for up to another 180 days) on a federally-backed single-family mortgage loan or forbearance up to 30 days (which could be extended for two additional 30-day periods) on a federally-backed multifamily mortgage loan, when the borrowers experience financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

In response to the continued market disruption and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (&#8220;CAA&#8221;) enacted on December 27, 2020, contained a number of provisions that affect banking organizations. Among other things, the CAA provided additional funding to the PPP in early January 2021, expanded eligibility of businesses for the PPP, extended the PPP to March 31, 2021, and allowed eligible borrowers to obtain a second PPP loan (&#8220;second draw&#8221;) up to a maximum amount of $2.0 million. The SBA pays the originating bank a processing fee ranging from 3% to 5% based on the size of the loans. Second draw PPP borrowers are eligible for loan forgiveness on the same terms as the first draw borrowers. The CAA also simplified the loan forgiveness process for first and second draw borrowers with PPP loans of $150,000 or less. The PPP for first draw loans reopened in January 2021. The SBA also started allowing certain eligible borrowers, who previously received a PPP loan to apply for a second draw PPP with the same general terms as their first draw PPP loan and an extended maturity date of five years. 

On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (&#8220;ARPA&#8221;) to provide additional relief for individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including additional funding for the PPP, expansion of eligibility criteria for both first and second draw PPP loans and revision of the exclusions from payroll costs for purposes of loan forgiveness. The PPP Extension Act of 2021, enacted on March 30, 2021, extended the PPP through May 31, 2021. 

Paycheck Protection Program &#8212; The PPP provides forgivable loans to businesses in order to keep their employees on the payroll and make certain other eligible payments. PPP loans carry an interest rate of 1%. The SBA guarantees 100% of the PPP loans made to eligible borrowers. The entire principal amount and any accrued interest on the loans are eligible to be forgiven in whole or in part, if certain conditions are met, at which point the SBA will pay the bank that originated the PPP loan the forgiven amount. The Company is a participant in the PPP and elected to extend the application deadline to May 31, 2021. As of March 31, 2021, the Company had approximately 8,300 PPP loans outstanding with balances totaling $2.07 billion, which were recorded in the commercial and industrial (&#8220;C&#38;I&#8221;) portfolio. During the first quarter of 2021, the Company funded 5,075 new PPP loans totaling $828.2 million. Related to the PPP loans made in 2020, as of May 6, 2021, the Company had submitted and received SBA approval for the forgiveness of approximately 5,300 PPP loan applications, totaling $647.5 million. 

Other U.S. Government Facilities and Programs &#8212; During the second quarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve established the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (&#8220;PPPLF&#8221;) to allow eligible lenders to facilitate lending under the SBA&#8217;s PPP, taking PPP loans as collateral. The Company participated in the PPPLF during 2020, borrowing $1.44 billion, which it repaid in full in October 2020. As of both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the PPPLF. 

Loan Modifications &#8212; The CARES Act and related guidance from the federal banking agencies provide financial institutions the option to temporarily suspend requirements under generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) related to the classification of certain loan modifications as troubled debt restructurings (&#8220;TDRs&#8221;) to account for the current and anticipated effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, as amended by the CAA, specified that COVID-19 related loan modifications executed between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of (i) 60 days after the date of termination of the national emergency declared by the President and (ii) January 1, 2022, on loans that were current as of December 31, 2019 are not TDRs. Additionally, under guidance from the federal banking agencies, other short-term modifications made on a good faith basis in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to borrowers that were current prior to any relief are not TDRs under Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Subtopic 310-40, &#8220;Troubled Debt Restructuring by Creditors.&#8221; These modifications include short-term (e.g., up to six months) modifications such as payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or delays in payment that are insignificant. We have granted loan modifications to our customers in the form of maturity extensions, payment deferrals and forbearance. For a summary of the loans that we have modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, please refer to Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) &#8212; Risk Management &#8212; Credit Risk Management in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (&#8220;this Form 10-Q&#8221;). 

Our Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic 

In response to the pandemic, the Company has implemented protocols and processes to execute its business continuity plans to help protect its employees and support its customers. The Company is managing its response to the COVID-19 pandemic according to its Enterprise Business Continuity Policy, which invokes centralized management of the crisis event and the integration of its response. The CEO and key members of the Company&#8217;s management team meet regularly with senior executives to help drive decisions, communication and consistency of response across all businesses and functions. In addition, we have implemented measures to assist our employees and customers as discussed below: 

&#8226; Employees: 

The majority of the Company&#8217;s employees are able to work from home. The Company continues to evaluate its continuity plans and work-from-home strategy to best protect the health and safety of its employees, and the Company has developed workplace re-entry plans with proper protocols. For employees with jobs that are required to be performed on-site, we have taken significant actions to ensure employee safety by providing personal protection equipment, adopting social distancing measures, placing visual safety reminders related to social distancing, implementing an enhanced cleaning program, installing plexiglass panels, requiring temperature screenings and the wearing of masks for all employees. 

&#8226; Customers: 

We assisted our commercial, consumer and small business clients affected by the COVID-19 pandemic through payment deferrals, suspension of foreclosures on certain residential mortgage loans and participation in the SBA PPP and the MSLP. We intend to evaluate participation in additional new government-sponsored programs, as they are established. In addition, the Company continues to make a wide range of banking services accessible to customers through mobile and other digital channels to reduce the need for in-person branch visits. 

Impact on our Financial Position and Results of Operations &#8212; Our financial position and results of operations are sensitive to the ability of our customers to meet their loan obligations, the availability of our workforce and the decline in the value of assets which we hold. While its effects continue to materialize, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant decrease in commercial activity throughout our operating footprint. This decrease in commercial activity has caused and may continue to cause our customers to be unable to meet existing payment or other obligations to us. Despite the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we maintained solid profitability for the first quarter of 2021, earning a 1.50% return on average assets (&#8220;ROA&#8221;) and a 15.57% return on average equity (&#8220;ROE&#8221;). Our capital ratios are strong, and we remain well-positioned from a liquidity perspective, enabling us to weather adverse economic scenarios while continuing to support our customers and invest in our business.

Financial Review 

Noteworthy items about the Company&#8217;s performance for the first quarter of 2021 included: 

&#8226; Earnings: First quarter 2021 net income was $205.0 million, or $1.44 per diluted share, compared with first quarter 2020 net income of $144.8 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, an increase of $60.2 million or 42%. The increase was primarily due to no provision for credit losses in the first quarter of 2021 and an increase in noninterest income, partially offset by increases in income tax expense and noninterest expense, and lower net interest income. 

&#8226; Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin: First quarter 2021 net interest income before provision for credit losses was $353.7 million, a decrease of $9.0 million or 2%, compared with first quarter 2020 net interest income of $362.7 million. First quarter 2021 net interest margin was 2.71%, a decrease of 73 basis points from 3.44% for the first quarter of 2020. The net interest income and net interest margin decreases reflect the current low interest rate environment with the upper limit of the federal funds target range of 0.25%; the federal funds rate was cut by 150 basis points in March 2020. 

&#8226; Provision for Credit Losses: During the first quarter of 2021, the Company did not record a provision for credit losses, compared with a provision of $73.9 million for the first quarter of 2020. The year-over-year change in the provision for credit losses was primarily due to an improved macroeconomic outlook as compared with the first quarter of 2020. First quarter 2021 net charge-offs were $13.4 million or annualized 0.14% of average loans held-for-investment, compared with $898 thousand or annualized 0.01% of average loans held-for-investment, for the first quarter of 2020. 

&#8226; Tax: Income tax expense was $30.5 million and the effective tax rate was 12.9% for the first quarter of 2021, compared with income tax expense of $19.2 million and an effective tax rate of 11.7% for the first quarter of 2020. 

&#8226; Profitability: First quarter 2021 ROA was 1.50%, compared with 1.30% for the first quarter of 2020. First quarter 2021 ROE was 15.57%, compared with 11.60% for the first quarter of 2020. 

&#8226; Total Assets: As of March 31, 2021, total assets were $56.87 billion, an increase of $4.71 billion or 9% from $52.16 billion as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to purchases of AFS debt securities, loan growth, and an increase in assets purchased under resale agreements (&#8220;resale agreements&#8221;). 

&#8226; Loans: Total loans were $39.59 billion as of March 31, 2021, an increase of $1.20 billion or 3% from $38.39 billion as of December 31, 2020. Loan growth was well-diversified across each of the Company&#8217;s major loan portfolios, with increases from C&#38;I, driven by PPP loan funding, commercial real estate (&#8220;CRE&#8221;) and residential mortgage. 

&#8226; Total Liabilities: As of March 31, 2021, total liabilities were $51.59 billion, an increase of $4.70 billion or 10% from $46.89 billion as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to deposit growth. 

&#8226; Deposits: Total deposits were $49.55 billion as of March 31, 2021, an increase of $4.69 billion or 10% from $44.86 billion as of December 31, 2020. Growth was primarily driven by noninterest-bearing demand deposits, money market accounts and interest-bearing checking. 

&#8226; Allowance for Loan Losses: The allowance for loan losses was $607.5 million or 1.53% of loans held-for-investment as of March 31, 2021, compared with $620.0 million or 1.61% of loans held-for-investment as of December 31, 2020. 

&#8226; Asset Quality Metrics: As of March 31, 2021, criticized loans totaled $1.22 billion or 3.07% of loans held-for-investment, compared with the same amount of $1.22 billion or 3.17% of loans held-for-investment as of December 31, 2020. Nonperforming assets were $258.1 million or 0.45% of total assets as of March 31, 2021, compared with $234.9 million or 0.45% of total assets as of December 31, 2020. 

&#8226; Capital Levels: Our capital levels are strong. As of March 31, 2021, all of the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s regulatory capital ratios were well above the regulatory requirements to be considered well-capitalized. See Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Balance Sheet Analysis &#8212; Regulatory Capital and Ratios in this Form 10-Q for more information regarding capital. 

&#8226; Capital Return: The quarterly cash common stock dividend for the first quarter of 2021 was $0.33 per share, an increase of $0.055 or 20% from $0.275 per share for the first quarter of 2020. The Company returned $47.4 million in cash dividends to stockholders during the first quarter of 2021, compared with $40.5 million during the first quarter of 2020. 

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income 

The Company&#8217;s primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the interest income earned on interest-earning assets less interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average interest-earning assets. Net interest income and net interest margin are impacted by several factors, including changes in average balances and the composition of interest-earning assets and funding sources, market interest rate fluctuations and the slope of the yield curve, repricing characteristics and maturity of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, volume of noninterest-bearing sources of funds and asset quality. 

First quarter 2021 net interest income was $353.7 million, a decrease of $9.0 million or 2%, compared with $362.7 million for the first quarter of 2020. The year-over-year decline in net interest income was due to a decrease in interest-earning asset yields, which reflected significantly lower benchmark interest rates, partially offset by a decrease in the cost of funds. First quarter 2021 net interest margin was 2.71%, a decrease of 73 basis points from 3.44% for the first quarter of 2020. The upper limit of the federal funds target range was 0.25% in the first quarter of 2021; the federal funds rate was cut by 150 basis points in March 2020. 

Average interest-earning assets was $52.85 billion for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $10.49 billion or 25% from $42.36 billion for the first quarter of 2020. This was primarily driven by growth in average loans, average AFS debt securities, and average interest-bearing cash and deposits with banks, which increased by $3.58 billion, $3.19 billion and $3.14 billion, respectively. 

The yield on average interest-earning assets for the first quarter of 2021 was 2.93%, a decrease of 133 basis points from 4.26% for the first quarter of 2020. The year-over-year change reflected yield compression for all earning asset categories, in response to the drop in benchmark interest rate at the end of the first quarter 2020. The average loan yield for the first quarter of 2021 was 3.58%, a decrease of 113 basis points from 4.71% for the first quarter of 2020. Approximately 64% and 69% of loans held-for-investment were variable-rate or hybrid loans in their adjustable rate period as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Deposits are an important source of funds and impact both net interest income and net interest margin. Average total deposits were $47.85 billion for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $10.38 billion or 28% from $37.47 billion for the first quarter of 2020. Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits were $18.09 billion for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $6.96 billion or 63% from $11.12 billion for the first quarter of 2020. Average interest-bearing deposits were $29.76 billion for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $3.41 billion or 13% from $26.35 billion for the first quarter of 2020. Due to the strong growth in average noninterest-bearing deposits, the share of noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased to 38% of average total deposits in the first quarter of 2021, compared with 30% in the same period of 2020. 

The average cost of funds was 0.23% for the first quarter of 2021, a decrease of 67 basis points from 0.90% for the first quarter of 2020. The decrease in the average cost of funds primarily reflected the changed interest rate environment. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.30% for the first quarter of 2021, a decrease of 87 basis points from 1.17% for the first quarter of 2020. Other sources of funding included in the calculation of the average cost of funds primarily consist of FHLB advances, assets sold under repurchase agreements (&#8220;repurchase agreements&#8221;), long-term debt and short-term borrowings.

Noninterest income comprised 17% and 13% of total revenue for the first quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively. First quarter of 2021 noninterest income was $72.9 million, an increase of $17.4 million or 31%, compared with $55.5 million for the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily due to interest rate contracts and other derivative income, deposit account fees, and lending fees, partially offset by a decrease in other investment income. 

Lending fees were $18.4 million for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $2.6 million or 16%, compared with $15.8 million for the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in letter of credit issuance fees. 

Deposit account fees were $15.4 million for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $5.0 million or 47%, compared with $10.4 million for the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in customer-driven transactions. 

Interest rate contracts and other derivative income was $17.0 million for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $9.9 million or 140%, compared with $7.1 million for the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily due to favorable credit valuation adjustments, partially offset by lower transaction volumes. 

Other investment income was $925 thousand for the first quarter of 2021, a decrease of $2.5 million or 73%, compared with $3.4 million for the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to decreased distributions from investments in qualified affordable housing partnerships and lower unrealized gains on mutual funds.

First quarter of 2021 noninterest expense was $191.1 million, an increase of $10.8 million or 6%, compared with $180.3 million for the same period in 2020. This increase was primarily due to increases in amortization of tax credit and other investments, and compensation and employee benefits. 

Compensation and employee benefits were $107.8 million for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $5.8 million or 6%, compared with $102.0 million for the same period in 2020. The year-over-year increase was primarily related to an increase in bonus accrual. 

Amortization of tax credit and other investments was $25.4 million for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $6.6 million or 35%, compared with $18.8 million for the same period in 2020. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to new tax credit investments that were placed in service during the first quarter of 2021. 

Efficiency ratio, calculated as noninterest expense divided by total revenue, was 44.79% and 43.12% for the first quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively. Non-GAAP efficiency ratio, adjusted for the amortization of tax credit and other investments and the amortization of core deposit intangibles, was 38.68% for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 28 basis points from 38.40% for the same period in 2020.

Income tax expense was $30.5 million and the effective tax rate was 12.9% for the first quarter of 2021, compared with first quarter 2020 income tax expense of $19.2 million and effective tax rate of 11.7%. The increase in effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2021, compared with the same period in 2020 was primarily due to an increase in income before income taxes, partially offset by a year-over-year increase in investments in tax credits and other investments. 

Operating Segment Results 

The Company organizes its operations into three reportable operating segments: (1) Consumer and Business Banking; (2) Commercial Banking; and (3) Other. These segments are defined by the type of customers served and the related products and services provided. The segments reflect how financial information is currently evaluated by management. For additional description of the Company&#8217;s internal management reporting process, including the segment cost allocation methodology, see Note 14 &#8212; Business Segments to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

Segment net interest income represents the difference between actual interest earned on assets and interest incurred on liabilities of the segment, adjusted for funding charges or credits through the Company&#8217;s internal funds transfer pricing (&#8220;FTP&#8221;) process.

Consumer and Business Banking 

The Consumer and Business Banking segment primarily provides financial products and services to consumer and commercial customers through the Company&#8217;s domestic branch network. This segment offers consumer and commercial deposits, mortgage and home equity loans, and other products and services. It also originates commercial loans for small- and medium-sized enterprises. Other products and services provided by this segment include wealth management, treasury management and foreign exchange services. The integration of digital channels and our brick and mortar channels has been a priority for the Bank. The Company is developing a digital consumer banking platform to enhance the customer user experience and offer a full suite of banking services. Customer adoption of the digital banking application is in progress, and has contributed to growth in segment fee income and deposit growth. 

The following table presents additional financial information for the Consumer and Business Banking segment for the periods indicated:

S egment net income increased $8.2 million or 15% to $61.4 million during the first quarter of 2021, compared with $53.2 million in the same period in 2020, primarily due to lower provision for credit losses and higher noninterest income, partially offset by lower net interest income before provision for credit losses and an increase in income tax expense. The increase in income tax expense reflected higher segment income before income taxes. 

N et interest income before provision for credit losses decreased $2.7 million or 2% to $149.9 million during the first quarter of 2021, compared with $152.6 million in the same period in 2020, primarily reflecting a lower credit assigned to deposits under the FTP system in a near-zero interest rate environment. 

The Consumer and Business Banking segment recorded a $4.2 million reversal of provision for credit losses during the first quarter of 2021, compared with a $7.8 million provision for credit losses recorded in the same period in 2020. The year-over-year decrease in the provision for credit losses was primarily driven by improved macroeconomic conditions and outlook. 

First quarter of 2021 noninterest income increased $4.4 million or 27% to $20.8 million, compared with $16.4 million in the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by increases in deposit account fees, wealth management fees and foreign exchange income due to higher customer-driven transactions. 

Commercial Banking 

The Commercial Banking segment primarily generates commercial loans and deposits. Commercial loan products include commercial business loans and lines of credit, trade finance loans and letters of credit, CRE loans, construction and land lending, affordable housing loans and letters of credit, asset-based lending, and equipment financing. Commercial deposit products and other financial services include treasury management, foreign exchange services, and interest rate and commodity risk hedging.

Segment net income increased $52.9 million or 93% to $110.1 million during the first quarter of 2021, compared with $57.1 million in the same period in 2020, reflecting a lower provision for credit losses and higher noninterest income, partially offset by lower net interest income before provision for credit losses and an increase in income tax expense. The increase in income tax expense reflected higher segment income before income taxes. 

Net interest income before provision for credit losses decreased $6.4 million or 3% to $177.1 million during the first quarter of 2021, compared with $183.5 million in the same period in 2020, primarily driven by lower interest income earned on loans, partially offset by lower FTP charges assessed for loans due to the lower interest rate environment. 

The first quarter of 2021 provision for credit losses for the Commercial Banking segment was $4.2 million, compared with $66.1 million in the same period of 2020. The year-over-year decrease in the provision for credit losses was primarily driven by improved macroeconomic conditions and outlook. 

Noninterest income increased $17.6 million or 54% to $50.0 million in the first quarter 2021, compared with $32.5 million in the same period in 2020, primarily driven by higher interest rate contracts and other derivative income, deposit account fees and lending fees. 

Other 

Centralized functions, including the corporate treasury activities of the Company and eliminations of inter-segment amounts, have been aggregated and included in the Other segment, which provides broad administrative support to the two core segments, namely the Consumer and Business Banking and the Commercial Banking segments.

Segment net income decreased $1.0 million or 3% to $33.5 million during the first quarter of 2021, compared with $34.5 million in the same period in 2020, primarily driven by higher noninterest expense and lower noninterest income. 

Noninterest expense increased $9.3 million or 40% to $32.5 million during the first quarter of 2021, compared with $23.2 million in the same period in 2020, primarily reflecting higher amortization of tax credit and other investments. 

Noninterest income decreased $4.6 million or 69% to $2.0 million compared with $6.6 million for the same period in 2020, primarily reflecting decreases in other investment income, gains on sales of AFS debt securities and foreign exchange income. 

The income tax expense or benefit in the Other segment consists of the remaining unallocated income tax expense or benefit after allocating income tax expense to the two core segments. Income tax expense is allocated to the Consumer and Business Banking and the Commercial Banking segments based on statutory income tax rates, applied to segment income before income taxes. 

Balance Sheet Analysis 

Debt Securities

(1) There were no securities of a single non-federal governmental agency issuer that exceeded 10% of stockholder&#8217;s equity as of both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

(2) Primarily based upon the lowest of the credit ratings issued by Standard and Poor's (&#8220;S&#38;P&#8221;), Moody&#8217;s Investors Service (&#8220;Moody&#8217;s&#8221;) or Fitch Ratings (&#8220;Fitch&#8221;). Rating percentages are allocated based on fair value. 

The fair value of AFS debt securities totaled $7.79 billion as of March 31, 2021, an increase of $2.24 billion or 40% from $5.54 billion as of December 31, 2020. The largest changes came from U.S. Treasury securities, which increased $775.6 million, followed by U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities, which increased $602.1 million, and U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise debt securities, which increased $379.7 million. 

The Company&#8217;s debt securities portfolio had an effective duration, defined as a change in the price of a portfolio due to a 100 basis point shift in the yield curve, of 6.3 as of March 31, 2021 which increased from 4.2 as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in the target duration of securities purchased to achieve enhancement in portfolio yield. As of March 31, 2021, 90% of the carrying value of the Company&#8217;s debt securities portfolio was rated &#8220;AA-&#8221; or &#8220;Aa3&#8221; or higher by nationally recognized credit rating agencies, compared with 88% as of December 31, 2020. The increase in higher-rated securities was primarily due to the growth in U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities within the portfolio mix. Credit ratings of BBB- or higher by S&#38;P and Fitch, or Baa3 or higher by Moody&#8217;s, are considered investment grade. 

The Company&#8217;s AFS debt securities are carried at fair value with noncredit-related unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in Other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Pre-tax net unrealized losses on AFS debt securities were $115.3 million as of March 31, 2021, a net change of $189.4 million from pre-tax net unrealized gains of $74.1 million as of December 31, 2020. This change was primarily due to increases in benchmark interest rates and widening of spreads. As of March 31, 2021, the Company had no intention to sell securities with unrealized losses and believed it is more-likely-than-not that it would not be required to sell such securities before recovery of their amortized costs. 

Of the securities with gross unrealized losses, substantially all were rated investment grade as of both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, as classified based upon the lowest of the credit ratings issued by S&#38;P, Moody&#8217;s, or Fitch. The Company believes that the gross unrealized losses were due to non-credit related factors and the gross unrealized losses were primarily attributable to yield curve movement and widened spreads. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been muted by the government&#8217;s aggressive monetary policy, including benchmark rate cuts, resulting in the overall recovery of the market to pre-pandemic levels. The Company believes that the credit support levels of the AFS debt securities are strong and, based on current assessments and macroeconomic forecasts, expects that full contractual cash flows will be received. 

If a credit loss exists, the Company records an impairment related to credit losses through the allowance for credit losses with a corresponding Provision for credit losses on the Consolidated Statement of Income. There were no credit losses recognized in earnings for both the first quarter of 2021 and 2020. The Company assesses individual securities for credit losses for each reporting period. For additional information of the Company&#8217;s accounting policies, valuation and composition, see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K and Note 3 &#8212; Fair Value Measurement and Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Note 5 &#8212; Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

The following table presents the weighted-average yields and contractual maturity distribution, excluding periodic principal payments, of the Company&#8217;s AFS debt securities as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Actual maturities of certain securities can differ from contractual maturities as the borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties. In addition, factors such as prepayments and interest rates may affect the yields on the carrying values of these securities.

Loan Portfolio 

The Company offers a broad range of financial products designed to meet the credit needs of its borrowers. The Company&#8217;s loan portfolio segments include commercial loans, which consist of C&#38;I, CRE, multifamily residential, and construction and land loans; and consumer loans, which consist of single-family residential, home equity lines of credit (&#8220;HELOCs&#8221;) and other consumer loans. Total net loans were $38.98 billion as of March 31, 2021, an increase of $1.21 billion or 3% from $37.77 billion as of December 31, 2020. This was primarily driven by increases of $449.4 million or 3% in C&#38;I loans, primarily driven by PPP loan growth; $280.5 million or 2% in total CRE loans; and $484.0 million or 5% in residential mortgage. As of March 31, 2021, the Company had no loans held-for-sale. The composition of the loan portfolio as of March 31, 2021 was similar to the composition as of December 31, 2020. 

The following table presents the composition of the Company&#8217;s total loan portfolio by loan type as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020:

Actions to Support Customers during the COVID-19 Pandemic 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company assists customers by offering SBA PPP loans to help struggling businesses in our communities pay their employees and sustain their businesses. Given that PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA, the Company does not expect to realize credit losses on these loans. PPP processing fees are deferred and accreted into interest income over the estimated life of the loans, but may be accelerated upon forgiveness or prepayment. For more information on PPP loans, refer to Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Overview &#8212; Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic &#8212; Paycheck Protection Program in this Form 10-Q and Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Paycheck Protection Program to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K. 

In addition, the Company also provides payment relief through various loan modification programs. For a summary of the loans that the Company has modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Risk Management &#8212; Credit Risk Management in this Form 10-Q. 

Commercial 

The commercial loan portfolio comprised 74% of total loans as of March 31, 2021, compared with 75% of total loans as of December 31, 2020. The Company actively monitors the commercial lending portfolio for elevated levels of credit risk and reviews credit exposures for sensitivity to changing economic conditions. 

Commercial &#8212; Commercial and Industrial Loans. C&#38;I loans totaled $14.08 billion as of March 31, 2021, compared with $13.63 billion as of December 31, 2020, and accounted for 36% of total loans held-for-investment as of both dates. Year-to-date, C&#38;I loans increased $449.4 million or 3%, primarily driven by PPP loan funding. The C&#38;I loan portfolio includes loans and financing for businesses in a wide spectrum of industries, and includes asset-based lending, equipment financing and leasing, project-based finance, revolving lines of credit, SBA lending, structured finance, term loans and trade finance. The Company also has a portfolio of broadly syndicated C&#38;I loans, primarily Term B, which totaled $999.0 million and $892.1 million as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The majority of the C&#38;I loans have variable interest rates. 

The C&#38;I portfolio is well-diversified by industry. The Company monitors concentrations within the C&#38;I loan portfolio by customer exposure and industry classification, setting diversification targets and exposure limits by industry or loan product. The following charts illustrate the industry mix within our C&#38;I portfolio as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Commercial &#8212; Commercial Real Estate Loans. The total CRE loan portfolio consists of income-producing CRE, multifamily residential, and construction and land loans. Total CRE loans outstanding totaled $15.09 billion as of March 31, 2021, or 38% of total loans held-for-investment, compared with $14.81 billion or 39% of total loans held-for-investment as of December 31, 2020. Year-to-date total CRE loans increased $280.5 million or 2%, primarily driven by growth in income-producing CRE, partially offset by declines in construction and land loans. 

The Company&#8217;s total CRE portfolio is granular and broadly diversified by property type, which serves partially to mitigate its geographical concentration in California. The average size of total CRE loans was $2.4 million as of both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The following table summarizes the Company&#8217;s total CRE loan portfolio by property type as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020:

The weighted-average loan-to-value (&#8220;LTV&#8221;) ratio of the total CRE portfolio was 51% as of both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The low weighted-average LTV ratio was consistent by CRE property type. Approximately 90% of total CRE loans had an LTV ratio of 65% or lower as of March 31, 2021, compared with 89% as of December 31, 2020. The consistency of the Company&#8217;s low LTV underwriting standards has historically resulted in lower credit losses for income-producing CRE and multifamily residential loans. 

The following tables provide a summary of the Company&#8217;s income-producing CRE, multifamily residential, and construction and land loans by geography as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The distribution of the CRE loan portfolio reflects the Company&#8217;s geographical footprint, which is concentrated in California:

Since 77% of these loans were concentrated in California as of both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, changes in California&#8217;s economy and real estate values could have a significant impact on the collectability of these loans and the required level of allowance for loan losses.

Commercial &#8212; Income-Producing Commercial Real Estate Loans. The Company focuses on providing financing to experienced real estate investors and developers who have moderate levels of leverage, many of whom are long-time customers of the Bank. Income-producing CRE loans totaled $11.56 billion as of March 31, 2021, compared with $11.17 billion as of December 31, 2020, and accounted for 29% of total loans held-for-investment as of both dates. Interest rates on CRE loans may be fixed, variable or hybrid. Loans are underwritten with conservative standards for cash flows, debt service coverage and LTV. 

Owner-occupied properties comprised 19% and 20% of the income-producing CRE loans as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The remainder were non-owner-occupied properties, where 50% or more of the debt service for the loan is typically provided by unaffiliated rental income from a third party.

Consumer &#8212; Single-Family Residential Loans. Single-family residential loans totaled $8.52 billion as of March 31, 2021, compared with $8.19 billion as of December 31, 2020, and accounted for 22% and 21% of total loans held-for-investment as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Year-to-date single-family residential loans increased $336.5 million or 4%, primarily driven by net growth in New York. The Company was in a first lien position for virtually all of the single-family residential loans as of both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Many of these loans are reduced documentation loans, for which a substantial down payment is required, resulting in a low LTV ratio at origination, typically 65% or less. These loans have historically experienced low delinquency and loss rates. The Company offers a variety of single-family residential first lien mortgage loan programs, including fixed- and variable-rate loans, as well as hybrid loans with interest rates that adjust annually after an initial fixed-rate period. 

Consumer &#8212; Home Equity Lines of Credit. HELOCs totaled $1.75 billion as of March 31, 2021, compared with $1.60 billion as of December 31, 2020, and accounted for 4% of total loans held-for-investment as of both dates. Year-to-date HELOCs increased $147.5 million or 9%, primarily driven by growth in California. The Company was in a first lien position for 87% and 86% of total HELOCs as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Many of the loans within this portfolio are reduced documentation loans, for which a substantial down payment is required, resulting in a low LTV ratio at origination, typically 60% or less. These loans have historically experienced low delinquency and loss rates. Virtually all of the Company&#8217;s HELOCs were variable-rate loans. 

All originated commercial and consumer loans are subject to the Company&#8217;s underwriting guidelines and loan origination standards. Management believes that the Company&#8217;s underwriting criteria and procedures adequately consider the unique risks associated with these products. The Company conducts a variety of quality control procedures and periodic audits, including the review of lending and legal requirements, to ensure that the Company is compliant with these requirements. 

Loans Held-for-Sale 

As of March 31, 2021, the Company had no loans held-for-sale. As of December 31, 2020, loans held-for-sale of $1.8 million consisted of single-family residential loans. At the time of commitment to originate or purchase a loan, a loan is determined to be held-for-investment if it is the Company&#8217;s intent to hold the loan to maturity or for the &#8220;foreseeable future,&#8221; subject to periodic reviews under the Company&#8217;s evaluation processes, including liquidity and credit risk management. If the Company subsequently changes its intent to hold certain loans, those loans are transferred from held-for-investment to held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value. 

Sales of Originated Loans and Purchased Loans 

All loans originated by the Company are underwritten pursuant to the Company&#8217;s policies and procedures. Although the Company&#8217;s primary focus is on directly originated loans, in certain circumstances, the Company also purchases loans and participates in loans with other banks. The Company also participates out interests in directly originated commercial loans to other financial institutions and sells loans in the normal course of business. 

The following tables provide information on loan sales during the first quarters of 2021 and 2020. Refer to Note 7 &#8212; Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for additional information on loan purchases and transfers.

Capital 

The Company maintains a strong capital base to support its anticipated asset growth, operating needs and credit risks, and to ensure that the Company and the Bank are compliant with applicable regulatory capital guidelines. The Company engages in regular capital planning processes on at least an annual basis to optimize the use of available capital and to appropriately plan for future capital needs, allocating capital to existing and future business activities. Furthermore, the Company conducts capital stress tests as part of its capital planning process. The stress tests enable the Company to assess the impact of adverse changes in the economy and interest rates on its capital base. 

In March 2020, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of the Company&#8217;s common stock. This $500.0 million repurchase authorization was inclusive of the Company&#8217;s $100.0 million stock repurchase authorization previously outstanding. The Company determines the timing and amount of stock repurchases, based on its assessment of various factors, including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity and the economic environment. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company repurchased 4,471,682 shares at an average price of $32.64 per share and a total cost of $146.0 million. The Company did not repurchase any shares during the remainder of 2020 or in the first quarter of 2021. As of March 31, 2021, the total remaining available capital authorized for repurchase was $354.0 million. 

The Company&#8217;s stockholders&#8217; equity was $5.29 billion as of March 31, 2021, an increase of $15.9 million or 0.3% from $5.27 billion as of December 31, 2020. The increase in the Company&#8217;s stockholders&#8217; equity was primarily due to net income of $205.0 million for the first quarter of 2021, partially offset by an increase in other comprehensive loss of $134.4 million and cash dividends declared of $47.4 million during the first quarter of 2021. For other factors that contributed to the changes in stockholders&#8217; equity, refer to Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements &#8212; Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders&#8217; Equit y in this Form 10-Q.

The Company paid a quarterly cash dividends of $0.33 and $0.275 per common share for the first quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively. In April 2021, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors declared second quarter 2021 cash dividends of $0.33 per common share. The dividend is payable on May 17, 2021 to stockholders of record as of May 3, 2021 . 

Deposits and Other Sources of Funds

Additional funding is provided by short- and long-term borrowings, and long-term debt. See Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Risk Management &#8212; Liquidity Risk Management &#8212; Liquidity in this Form 10-Q for a discussion of the Company&#8217;s liquidity management.

Deposits 

The Company offers a wide variety of deposit products to consumer and commercial customers. The Company&#8217;s deposit strategy is to grow and retain relationship-based deposits, which provides a stable and low-cost source of funding and liquidity to the Company. 

Total deposits were $49.55 billion as of March 31, 2021, an increase of $4.68 billion or 10% from $44.86 billion as of December 31, 2020. Deposit growth was attributable to strong growth from both commercial and consumer customers, partially offset by a reduction in higher-cost time deposits. The strongest growth was in noninterest-bearing demand deposits, which increased by $2.62 billion or 16% compared with December 31, 2020. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits were $18.92 billion or 38% of total deposits as of March 31, 2021, up from $16.30 billion or 36% of total deposits as of December 31, 2020. Additional information regarding the impact of deposits on net interest income, with a comparison of average deposit balances and rates, is provided in Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Results of Operations &#8212; Net Interest Income in this Form 10-Q. 

Other Sources of Funding 

There were no short-term borrowings as of March 31, 2021. Short-term borrowings of $21.0 million as of December 31, 2020 consisted of borrowings entered into by the Company&#8217;s subsidiary, East West Bank (China) Limited. 

FHLB advances were $653.0 million as of March 31, 2021, an increase of $423 thousand from $652.6 million as of December 31, 2020. As of March 31, 2021, FHLB advances had fixed and floating interest rates ranging from zero percent to 2.34% and remaining maturities between one month and 1.6 years. Of these, $405.0 million have a blended interest rate of 2.22% and will mature in the second quarter of 2021. 

Gross repurchase agreements totaled $300.0 million as of both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Resale and repurchase agreements are reported net, pursuant to ASC 210-20-45-11, Balance Sheet Offsetting: Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements . As of both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company did not have any gross resale agreements that were eligible for netting pursuant to ASC 210-20-45-11. As of March 31, 2021, gross repurchase agreements had interest rates ranging from 2.41% to 2.49%, with original terms between 4.0 years and 8.5 years and remaining maturities between 2.3 years and 2.4 years. 

Repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and recorded as liabilities based on the values at which the assets are sold. As of March 31, 2021, the collateral for the repurchase agreements was comprised of U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasury securities. To ensure the market value of the underlying collateral remains sufficient, the Company monitors the fair value of collateral pledged relative to the principal amounts borrowed under repurchase agreements. The Company manages liquidity risks related to the repurchase agreements by sourcing funds from a diverse group of counterparties, and entering into repurchase agreements with longer durations, when appropriate. For additional details, see Note 4 &#8212; Assets Purchased under Resale Agreements and Sold under Repurchase Agreements to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

The Company uses long-term debt to provide funding to acquire interest-earning assets, and to enhance liquidity and regulatory capital adequacy. Long-term debt totaled $147.4 million as of both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Long-term debt consists of junior subordinated debt, which qualifies as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes. The junior subordinated debt was issued in connection with the Company&#8217;s various pooled trust preferred securities offerings, as well as with common stock issued by the six wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company in conjunction with these offerings. The junior subordinated debt had a weighted-average interest rate of 1.78% and 3.13% for the first quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively, with remaining maturities ranging between 13.7 years and 16.5 years as of March 31, 2021. 

Regulatory Capital and Ratios 

The federal banking agencies have risk-based capital adequacy guidelines intended to ensure that banking organizations maintain capital that is commensurate with the degree of risk associated with a banking organization&#8217;s operations. The Company and the Bank are subject to regulatory capital adequacy requirements. The Bank is a member bank of the Federal Reserve System and is primarily regulated by the Federal Reserve and the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (&#8220;DFPI&#8221;). The Company and the Bank are required to comply with the Basel III Capital Rules adopted by the federal banking agencies. Both the Company and the Bank are standardized approaches institutions under Basel III Capital Rules. See Item 1. Business &#8212; Supervision and Regulation &#8212; Regulatory Capital Requirements and Recent Regulatory Capital-Related Development of the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K for additional details. 

The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020. The Company has elected the phase-in option provided by regulatory guidance, which delays the estimated impact of Current Expected Credit Losses (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) on regulatory capital for two years and phases the impact over three years. As a result, the effects of CECL on the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s regulatory capital will be delayed through the year 2021, after which the effects will be phased-in over a three-year period from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. In April 2020, in recognition of CARES Act requirements, and to facilitate the use of the PPPLF, the U.S. banking agencies issued an interim final rule that banking organizations may exclude from leverage and risk-based capital requirements any eligible assets sold or pledged to the Federal Reserve on a non-recourse basis as part of the PPPLF. In addition, under the CARES Act, loans originated by a banking organization under the PPP (whether or not sold or pledged in the PPPLF) will be risk-weighted at zero percent for regulatory capital purposes. Accordingly, the March 31, 2021 capital ratios exclude the impact of the increased allowance for loan losses due to CECL, and PPP loans are risk-weighted at zero percent. As of March 31, 2021, the Company did not have any PPP loans pledged as collateral to the PPPLF. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s capital ratios as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 under the Basel III Capital Rules, and those required by regulatory agencies for capital adequacy and well-capitalized classification purposes:

(1) The Tier 1 leverage well-capitalized requirement applies only to the Bank since there is no Tier 1 leverage ratio component in the definition of a well-capitalized bank-holding company. 

(2) As of January 1, 2019, the 2.5% capital conservation buffer above the minimum risk-based capital ratios was required in order to avoid limitations on distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. 

The Company is committed to maintaining strong capital levels to assure the Company&#8217;s investors, customers and regulators that the Company and the Bank are financially sound. As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, both the Company and the Bank continued to exceed all &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; capital requirements and the fully phased-in required minimum capital requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules. Total risk-weighted assets were $39.57 billion as of March 31, 2021, an increase of $1.17 billion or 3% from $38.41 billion as of December 31, 2020. The increase in the risk-weighted assets was primarily due to loan growth and increased AFS debt securities. 

Other Matters 

London Interbank Offered Rate Transition 

On March 5, 2021, the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;) confirmed that the 1-week and 2-month U.S. dollar (&#8220;USD&#8221;) London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) settings will permanently cease following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021, and that the overnight and 12-month USD LIBOR settings will permanently cease following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023. The 1-month, 3-month and 6-month USD LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided or will be provided on a synthetic basis, subject to FCA consideration, after the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023. To the extent the 1-month, 3-month and 6-month USD LIBOR settings are provided on a synthetic basis, they will not be considered representative of the underlying market or economic reality they are intended to measure. The federal banking agencies have continued to encourage banks to transition away from LIBOR as soon as practicable. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (&#8220;ARRC&#8221;) has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) as its preferred rate as an alternative to LIBOR, although the ARRC has not proposed that SOFR be required. 

Given LIBOR&#8217;s extensive use across financial markets, the transition away from LIBOR presents various risks and challenges to financial markets and institutions, including to the Company. The majority of the Company&#8217;s LIBOR-based loans, derivatives, debt securities, resale agreements, junior subordinated debt and repurchase agreements are indexed to LIBOR tenors that will cease to be published on June 30, 2023. The volume of the Company&#8217;s LIBOR-based products that mature after June 30, 2023 is significant and, if not sufficiently planned for, the discontinuation of LIBOR could result in financial, operational, legal, reputational or compliance risks to the Company. 

The transition is anticipated to span several reporting periods through mid-2023 (depending on the setting) with the recently confirmed LIBOR cessation dates. The Company has created a cross-functional team to manage the communication of the Company&#8217;s transition plans with both internal and external stakeholders and to ensure that the Company appropriately updates its business processes, analytical tools, information systems and contract language to minimize disruptions during and after the LIBOR transition. The Company has completed a review of LIBOR contracts maturing after the LIBOR cessation dates and has begun taking steps to convert these contracts to alternative rates. For additional information related to the potential impact surrounding the transition from LIBOR on the Company&#8217;s business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the course of the Company&#8217;s business, the Company may enter into or be a party to transactions that are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are considered to be off-balance sheet arrangements. Off-balance sheet arrangements are any contractual arrangements to which a nonconsolidated entity is a party and under which the Company has: (1) any obligation under a guarantee contract; (2) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets; (3) any obligation under certain derivative instruments; or (4) any obligation under a material variable interest held by the Company in a nonconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the Company. 

Commitments to Extend Credit 

As a financial service provider, the Company routinely enters into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, commercial letters of credit for foreign and domestic trade, standby letters of credit (&#8220;SBLCs&#8221;) and financial guarantees to meet the financing needs of its customers. Many of these commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. The credit policies used in underwriting loans to customers are also used to extend these commitments. Under some of these contractual agreements, the Company may also have liabilities contingent upon the occurrence of certain events. The Company&#8217;s liquidity sources have been, and are expected to be, sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its lending activities. Information about the Company&#8217;s loan commitments, commercial letters of credit and SBLCs is provided in Note 10 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

Guarantees 

In the ordinary course of business, the Company periodically enters into various guarantee agreements in which the Company sells or securitizes loans with recourse. Under these guarantee arrangements, the Company is contingently obligated to repurchase the recourse component of the loans when the loans default. Additional information regarding guarantees is provided in Note 10 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

A discussion of significant contractual arrangements under which the Company may be held contingently liable is included in Note 10 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. In addition, the Company has commitments and obligations under post-retirement benefit plans as described in Note 14 &#8212; Employee Benefit Plans to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K, and has contractual obligations for future payments on debts, borrowings and lease obligations as detailed in Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations of the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K. 

Risk Management 

Overview 

In conducting its businesses, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent to the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to the Company&#8217;s businesses. The Company operates under a Board-approved enterprise risk management (&#8220;ERM&#8221;) framework, which outlines the company-wide approach to risk management and oversight, and describes the structures and practices employed to manage the current and emerging risks inherent to the Company. The Company&#8217;s ERM program incorporates risk management throughout the organization in identifying, managing, monitoring, and reporting risks. It identifies the Company&#8217;s major risk categories as credit risk; liquidity risk; capital risk; market risk; operational risk; regulatory, compliance and legal risks; accounting and tax risks, and strategic and reputational risks. 

The Board of Directors monitors the ERM program to ensure independent review and oversight of the Company&#8217;s risk appetite and control environment. The Risk Oversight Committee provides focused oversight of the Company&#8217;s identified enterprise risk categories on behalf of the full Board of Directors. Under the direction of the Risk Oversight Committee, management committees apply targeted strategies to reduce the risks to which the Company&#8217;s operations are exposed. 

The Company&#8217;s ERM program is executed along the three lines of defense model, which provides for a consistent and standardized risk management control environment across the enterprise. The first line of defense is comprised of production, operational, and support units. The second line of defense is comprised of various risk management and control functions charged with monitoring and managing specific major risk categories and/or risk subcategories. The third line of defense is comprised of the Internal Audit function and Independent Asset Review. Internal Audit provides assurance and evaluates the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes as established by the Company. Internal Audit has organizational independence and objectivity, reporting directly to the Board&#8217;s Audit Committee. Further discussion and analysis of each major risk area are included in the following sub-sections of Risk Management. 

Credit Risk Management 

Credit risk is the risk that a borrower or counterparty will fail to perform according to the terms and conditions of a loan or investment and expose the Company to loss. Credit risk exists with many of the Company&#8217;s assets and exposures such as loans and certain derivatives. The majority of the Company&#8217;s credit risk is associated with lending activities. 

The Risk Oversight Committee has primary oversight responsibility of identifying enterprise risk categories including credit risk. The Risk Oversight Committee monitors management&#8217;s assessment of asset quality and credit risk trends, credit quality administration and underwriting standards; as well as portfolio credit risk management strategies and processes, such as diversification and liquidity; all of which enable management to control credit risk. At the management level, the Credit Risk Management Committee has primary oversight responsibility for credit risk. The Senior Credit Supervision function manages credit policy and provides the resources to manage the line of business transactional credit risk, assuring that all exposure is risk-rated according to the requirements of the credit risk rating policy. The Senior Credit Supervision function evaluates and reports the overall credit risk exposure to senior management and the Risk Oversight Committee. The Independent Asset Review function supports a strong credit risk management culture by providing independent and objective assessment of underwriting and documentation quality, reporting directly to the Board&#8217;s Risk Oversight Committee. A key focus of the Company&#8217;s credit risk management is adherence to a well-controlled underwriting process. 

The Company assesses overall credit quality performance of the loan held-for-investment portfolio through an integrated analysis of specific performance ratios. This approach forms the basis of the discussion in the sections immediately following: Criticized loans, Nonperforming Assets, TDRs and Allowance for Credit Losses. 

Credit Quality 

The Company utilizes a credit risk rating system to assist in monitoring credit quality. Loans are evaluated using the Company&#8217;s internal credit risk rating of 1 through 10. Loans risk rated 1 through 5 are assigned an internal risk rating of &#8220;Pass.&#8221; Loans assigned with a credit risk rating of 6 have potential weaknesses that warrant closer attention by management and are assigned an internal risk rating of &#8220;Special mention.&#8221; Loans assigned a credit risk rating of 7 or 8 have well-defined weaknesses that may jeopardize the full and timely repayment of the loan; these are assigned an internal risk rating of &#8220;Substandard.&#8221; Loans assigned a credit risk rating of 9 have insufficient sources of repayment and a high probability of loss; these are assigned an internal risk rating of &#8220;Doubtful.&#8221; Loans assigned a credit risk rating of 10 are uncollectible and of such little value that they are no longer considered bankable assets; these are assigned an internal risk rating of &#8220;Loss.&#8221; Exposures categorized as criticized consist of &#8220;Special mention,&#8221; &#8220;Substandard,&#8221; &#8220;Doubtful&#8221; and &#8220;Loss&#8221; categories. Exposures categorized as classified consist of &#8220;Substandard,&#8221; &#8220;Doubtful&#8221; and &#8220;Loss&#8221; categories. For more information on credit quality indicators, refer to Note 7 &#8212; Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s criticized loans as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

($ in thousands) Change March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 $ % Criticized loans Special mention loans $ 504,226 $ 564,555 $ (60,329) (11) % Classified loans 712,693 652,880 59,813 9 % Total criticized loans $ 1,216,919 &#160; $1,217,435 $ (516) 0 &#160; % Special mention loans to loans held-for-investment 1.27 % 1.47 % Classified loans to loans held-for-investment 1.80 % 1.70 % Criticized loans to loans held-for-investment 3.07 % 3.17 % 

As of March 31, 2021, criticized loans totaled $1.22 billion, or 3.07% of loans held-for-investment, compared with $1.22 billion, or 3.17% of loans held-for-investment, as of December 31, 2020. Quarter-over-quarter, special mention loans decreased to $504.2 million as of March 31, 2021, from $564.6 million as of December 31, 2020. Classified loans increased to $712.7 million as of March 31, 2021, from $652.9 million as of December 31, 2020. The quarter-over-quarter increase in classified loans was more than offset by the quarter-over-quarter decrease in special mention loans. 

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets are comprised of nonaccrual loans, other real estate owned (&#8220;OREO&#8221;) and other nonperforming assets. Other nonperforming assets and OREO are repossessed assets and properties, respectively, acquired through foreclosure, or through full or partial satisfaction of loans held-for-investment. Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due or when the full collection of principal or interest becomes uncertain regardless of the length of past due status. Collectability is generally assessed based on economic and business conditions, the borrower&#8217;s financial condition and the adequacy of collateral, if any. For additional details regarding the Company&#8217;s nonaccrual loan policy, see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Loans Held-for-Investment to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K. 

The following table presents information regarding nonperforming assets as of the periods indicated:

Period-over-period changes to nonaccrual loans represent loans that are placed on nonaccrual status in accordance with the Company&#8217;s accounting policy, offset by reductions from loans that are repaid, paid down, charged off, sold, foreclosed or no longer classified as nonaccrual as a result of continued performance and improvement in the borrowers&#8217; financial condition and loan repayment capabilities. Nonaccrual loans were $232.0 million or 0.59% of loans held-for-investment as of March 31, 2021, compared with $215.2 million or 0.56% of loans held-for-investment as of December 31, 2020. Quarter-over-quarter, nonaccrual loans increased by $16.8 million or 8%, primarily driven by the inflow of a construction and land loan, and a CRE loan to nonaccrual status, partially offset by paydowns. C&#38;I nonaccrual loans were 54% and 62% of total nonaccrual loans as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. As of March 31, 2021, $123.6 million or 53% of nonaccrual loans were less than 90 days delinquent. In comparison, $106.4 million or 49% of nonaccrual loans were less than 90 days delinquent as of December 31, 2020. 

OREO was $15.8 million as of both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 due to the Company taking possession of one retail CRE property located in Southern California. 

Other nonperforming assets totaled $10.4 million and $3.9 million as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, an increase of $6.5 million or 166% due to one oil &#38; gas loan that was transferred to foreclosed assets.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

TDRs are loans for which contractual terms have been modified by the Company for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, and for which a concession to the borrower was granted that the Company would not otherwise consider. The Company&#8217;s loan modifications are handled on a case-by-case basis and are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan collectability and to meet the borrower&#8217;s financial needs. The following table presents the performing and nonperforming TDRs by portfolio segment as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The allowance for loan losses for TDRs was $5.3 million as of March 31, 2021 and $10.3 million as of December 31, 2020.

Performing TDRs were $123.1 million as of March 31, 2021, a decrease of $20.1 million or 14% from $143.2 million as of December 31, 2020. This decrease primarily reflected the transfer of one construction loan of $19.0 million from performing TDR to nonperforming TDR. The C&#38;I performing TDRs are mainly comprised of borrowers from the oil and gas, and general manufacturing &#38; wholesale sectors. Over 99% and 85% of the performing TDRs were current as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

Nonperforming TDRs were $83.7 million as of March 31, 2021, an increase of $11.8 million or 16% from $71.9 million as of December 31, 2020. This increase primarily reflecte d the migration of a construction loan from performing TDR to nonperforming TDR, partially offset by paydowns and a transfer of one C&#38;I loan to other nonperforming assets. The C&#38;I nonperforming TDRs are mainly comprised of borrowers from the oil and gas sector. 

Existing TDRs that were subsequently modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be classified as TDRs. As of March 31, 2021, there were six TDRs totaling $21.8 million that were provided subsequent modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Loan Modifications Due to COVID-19 Pandemic 

Since late March 2020, the Company has granted various commercial and consumer loan accommodation programs, predominantly in the form of payment deferrals, to provide relief to borrowers experiencing financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Section 4013 of the CARES Act, as amended by the CAA, permits a financial institution to elect to temporarily suspend TDR accounting under ASC Subtopic 310-40 in certain circumstances. To be eligible under Section 4013 of the CARES Act, as modified by the CAA, a loan modification must be (1) related to the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) executed on a loan that was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019; and (3) executed between March 1, 2020, and the earlier of (a) 60 days after the date of termination of the federal National Emergency or (b) January 1, 2022. The federal banking regulators, in consultation with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;), issued the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customer Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised) (the &#8220;Interagency Statement&#8221;) on April 7, 2020 confirming that, for loans not subject to Section 4013 of the CARES Act, short-term modifications (i.e., six months or less) made on a good faith basis in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to borrowers who were current as of the implementation date of a loan modification, or modifications granted under government mandated modification programs, are not considered as TDRs under ASC Subtopic 310-40. See additional information in Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Troubled Debt Restructurings to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K. 

The delinquency aging of loans modified related to the COVID-19 pandemic is frozen at the time of the modification. As a result, the recognition of delinquent loans, nonaccrual status and loan net charge-offs may be delayed for certain borrowers who are enrolled in these loan modification programs, which would have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status. Interest income continues to be recognized over the accommodation period. 

The following table provides a summary of the COVID-19 pandemic-related loan modifications that remained under their modified terms as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 . These amounts represent loan modifications that meet the criteria under Section 4013 of the CARES Act, as amended by the CAA, or Interagency Statement and therefore are not considered TDRs. These amounts also exclude loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic made on existing TDRs. A loan is counted once in the table regardless of the number of accommodations the borrower has received.

The above table excludes loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic that did not meet the criteria provided under Section 4013 of the CARES Act, as amended by the CAA, or the Interagency Statement, and that were evaluated and deemed to not be classified as TDRs. The determination to not consider a modification a TDR was made on the premise that the amount of the delayed restructured payments was insignificant relative to the unpaid principal or collateral value of the loan, resulting in an insignificant shortfall in the contractual amount due from the borrower, or an insignificant delay in the timing of the restructured payment period relative to the payment frequency under the loan&#8217;s original contractual maturity or expected duration. 

The COVID-19 pandemic-related loan modifications primarily consisted of payment deferrals six months or less in duration, in the form of either principal payment deferrals, where the borrower was still paying interest, or full principal and interest payment deferrals. Other forbearance programs consisted of interest rate concessions. The deferred payments for commercial loans are either repaid at contractual maturity, or spread over the remaining contractual term of the loan. The deferred payments for consumer loans are repaid under defined payment plans between six to 60 months after the deferral period ends, or the loan term is extended beyond the contractual maturity by the number of payments deferred. 

As of March 31, 2021, the Company had $1.14 billion of loans under payment deferral and forbearance programs, an increase of $161.0 million or 16% from $983.2 million as of December 31, 2020. The loans on deferral as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 largely consist of CRE loans (hotel, retail and others) and residential mortgage loans. The increase in deferrals during the three months ended March 31, 2021 was primarily driven by an increase in hotel CRE loans on deferral, reflecting the impact of resumed COVID-19-related business shutdowns, restrictions on travel and limitations on restaurant dining over the winter months. Of the CRE COVID-19 loan modifications, 92% were making partial payments, generally interest-only payments, while 8% were under full payment deferral as of March 31, 2021. This contrasts with 73% which were making partial payments, generally as interest-only payments and 27% which were under full payment deferral as of December 31, 2020. Modifications are considered to have exited active accommodation after the borrower exited the modification program or after the modification period expired. The loans with expired COVID-19 modifications were predominantly current as of March 31, 2021. The Company monitors the delinquency status of loans exiting relief programs on an ongoing basis. The impacts of the COVID-19 loan modifications were considered in the determination of the allowance for credit loss. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The Company&#8217;s measurement of the allowance for credit losses is based on management&#8217;s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Company&#8217;s relevant financial assets. The allowance for credit losses estimate uses various models and estimation techniques based on historical loss experience, current borrower characteristics, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts and other relevant factors. In the case of loans and securities, allowance for credit losses are contra-asset valuation accounts that are deducted from the amortized cost basis of these assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. In the case of unfunded credit commitments, the allowance for credit losses is a liability account that is reported as a component of Accrued expenses and other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

The Company&#8217;s methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses includes an estimate of expected credit losses on a collective basis for loan groups with similar risk characteristics, and a specific allowance for loans that are individually evaluated. For collectively evaluated loans, the Company uses quantitative models to forecast expected credit losses and these models consider historical credit loss experience, current market and economic conditions, and forecasted changes in market and economic conditions, if such forecasts are considered reasonable and supportable. The Company also considers qualitative factors in determining the allowance for loan losses. Qualitative adjustments are used to capture characteristics in the portfolio that impact expected credit losses, and which are not otherwise fully captured within the Company&#8217;s expected credit loss models. 

In addition to the allowance for loan losses, the Company maintains an allowance for unfunded credit commitments. The Company has three general areas for which it provides the allowance for unfunded credit commitments: recourse obligations for loans sold, letters of credit, and unfunded lending commitments. The Company&#8217;s methodology for determining the allowance for unfunded lending commitments calculation uses the lifetime loss rates of the on-balance sheet commitment. Recourse obligations for loans sold and letters of credit use the weighted loss rates for the segment of the individual credit. 

The Company employs a disciplined process and methodology to establish its allowance for loan losses each quarter. The process for estimating the allowance for loan losses takes into consideration many factors, including historical and forecasted loan loss trends, loan-level credit quality ratings and loan-specific risk characteristics. In addition to regular quarterly reviews of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, the Company performs ongoing assessments of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses is complex and requires judgement by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. 

The Company is committed to maintaining the allowance for credit losses at a level that is commensurate with the estimated inherent losses in the loan portfolio, including unfunded credit facilities. While the Company believes that the allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2021 was appropriate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio and in unfunded credit commitments based on the information available, future allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to, accounting standard and regulatory changes, loan growth, portfolio performance and general economic conditions. For a description of the policies, methodologies and judgements used to determine the allowance for credit losses, see Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K, and Note 7 &#8212; Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

The following table presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan portfolio segments and unfunded credit commitments as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 :

The allowance for loan losses was $607.5 million as of March 31, 2021, a decrease of $12.5 million from $620.0 million as of December 31, 2020 . The decrease in the allowance largely reflected an improvement in the macroeconomic forecast, partially offset by loan growth, resulting in $8.7 million and $4.0 million reductions in the allowance for loan losses against the CRE and C&#38;I loan portfolios, respectively. 

The Company considers multiple economic scenarios to develop the estimate of the allowance for loans. The scenarios consist of a base forecast representing management's view of the most likely outcome, combined with downside and upside scenarios reflecting possible worsening or improving economic conditions. The base forecast assumed better near-term economic conditions with a steadier long-term recovery period, based on economic stimulus from the government and the Federal Reserve maintaining its target fed funds range. The downside scenario assumed COVID-19 mortality increasing and causing a pull-back in the expected economic recovery and decline in consumer confidence and spending, as compared to the base forecast. The upside scenario assumed a more optimistic view for the economic recovery, as compared with the base forecast, including faster GDP growth, declining unemployment rate and improved consumer optimism based on more rapid distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. The Company applies management judgment to add qualitative factors for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on industry sectors that are affected by the pandemic. 

As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, PPP loans outstanding were $2.07 billion and $1.57 billion, respectively. As these loans are 100% guaranteed by SBA, the Company believes they will have zero expected loss. Accordingly, as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 , these loans had no related allowance for loan losses. 

First quarter of 2021 net charge-offs were $13.4 million or annualized 0.14% of average loans-held-for-investment, compared with $898 thousand or 0.01% of average loan held-for-investment for the first quarter of 2020. The year-over-year change in net loan charge-offs was largely due to higher CRE charge-offs in the first quarter of 2021, compared with CRE recoveries in the first quarter of 2020. Although the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact the credit quality of our loan portfolio, the potential effects have been considered in our allowance for loan losses. However, payment deferral activities instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could delay the recognition of certain loan charge-offs.

Liquidity Risk Management 

Liquidity 

Liquidity is a financial institution&#8217;s capacity to meet its deposit and other counterparties&#8217; obligations as they come due, or to obtain adequate funding at a reasonable cost to meet those obligations. The objective of liquidity management is to manage the potential mismatch of asset and liability cash flows. Maintaining an adequate level of liquidity depends on the institution&#8217;s ability to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected cash flows, and collateral needs without adversely affecting daily operations or the financial condition of the institution. To achieve this objective, the Company analyzes its liquidity risk, maintains readily available liquid assets and utilizes diverse funding sources including its stable core deposit base. 

The Board of Directors&#8217; Risk Oversight Committee has primary oversight responsibility. At the management level, the Company&#8217;s Asset/Liability Committee (&#8220;ALCO&#8221;) establishes the liquidity guidelines that govern the day-to-day active management of the Company&#8217;s liquidity position by requiring sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. These guidelines are established and monitored for both the Bank and for East West on a stand-alone basis to ensure that the Company is a source of strength for its subsidiaries. The ALCO regularly monitors the Company&#8217;s liquidity status and related management processes, providing regular reports to the Board of Directors. The Company&#8217;s liquidity management practices have been effective under normal operating and stressed market conditions. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Liquidity Sources. The Company&#8217;s primary source of funding is from deposits generated by its banking business, which are relatively stable and low-cost. Total deposits amounted to $49.55 billion as of March 31, 2021, compared with $44.86 billion as of December 31, 2020. The Company&#8217;s loan-to-deposit ratio was 80% as of March 31, 2021, compared with 86% as of December 31, 2020. 

In addition to deposits, the Company has access to various sources of wholesale funding, as well as borrowing capacity at the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (&#8220;FRBSF&#8221;) to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio, meet daily cash demands and allow management flexibility to execute its business strategy. Economic conditions and the stability of capital markets impact the Company&#8217;s access to and the cost of wholesale financing. The Company&#8217;s access to capital markets is also affected by the ratings received from various credit rating agencies. See Item 2 &#8212; MD&#38;A &#8212; Balance Sheet Analysis &#8212; Deposits and Other Sources of Funds in this Form 10-Q for further detail related to the Company&#8217;s funding sources. 

The Company maintains liquidity in the form of cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing deposits with banks, short-term resale agreements and unencumbered high-quality and liquid AFS debt securities. The following table presents the Company&#8217;s liquid assets as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020: 

($ in thousands) March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Encumbered Unencumbered Total Encumbered Unencumbered Total Cash and cash equivalents $ &#8212; $ 4,619,133 $ 4,619,133 $ &#8212; $ 4,017,971 $ 4,017,971 Interest-bearing deposits with banks &#8212; 741,923 741,923 &#8212; 809,728 809,728 Short-term resale agreements &#8212; 1,550,037 1,550,037 &#8212; 900,000 900,000 U.S. Treasury, and U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise debt securities 77,795 1,942,552 2,020,347 91,637 773,443 865,080 U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities 510,438 2,906,359 3,416,797 494,132 2,320,532 2,814,664 Foreign government bonds &#8212; 276,328 276,328 &#8212; 182,531 182,531 Municipal securities 1,031 419,034 420,065 1,033 395,040 396,073 Non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and CLOs 356 1,158,677 1,159,033 434 879,908 880,342 Corporate debt securities 1,238 495,405 496,643 1,249 404,719 405,968 Total $ 590,858 &#160; $ 14,109,448 &#160; $ 14,700,306 &#160; $ 588,485 &#160; $ 10,683,872 &#160; $ 11,272,357 &#160; 

Unencumbered liquid assets totaled $14.11 billion as of March 31, 2021, compared with $10.68 billion as of December 31, 2020. AFS debt securities, included as part of liquidity sources, consist of high quality and liquid securities with moderate durations to minimize overall interest rate and liquidity risks. The Company believes these AFS debt securities provide quick sources of liquidity to obtain financing, regardless of market conditions, through sale or pledging. 

As a means to generate incremental liquidity, the Company maintains available borrowing capacity under secured borrowing lines with the FHLB and FRBSF, unsecured federal funds lines of credit with various correspondent banks, and several master repurchase agreements with major brokerage companies. As of March 31, 2021, the Company had available borrowing capacity of $20.78 billion, including $7.37 billion with the FHLB and $6.06 billion with the FRBSF. The Company believes that its liquidity sources are sufficient to meet all reasonably foreseeable short-term needs over the next 12 months. Unencumbered loans and/or securities were pledged to the FHLB and the FRBSF discount window as collateral. The Company has established operational procedures to enable borrowing against these assets, including regular monitoring of the total pool of loans and securities eligible as collateral. Eligibility of collateral is defined in guidelines from the FHLB and FRBSF and is subject to change at their discretion. The Bank&#8217;s unsecured federal funds lines of credit with correspondent banks, subject to availability, totaled $1.01 billion as of March 31, 2021. Estimated borrowing capacity from unpledged AFS debt securities totaled $6.34 billion as of March 31, 2021. 

In connection with the Company&#8217;s participation in the PPP under the CARES Act, the Company has the ability to pledge loans originated under the SBA&#8217;s PPP program to the PPPLF, and receive term funding matching the balance and term of the pledged loans. As of March 31, 2021, the Company did not have any outstanding balance under the PPPLF. In comparison, the Company drew down $1.44 billion from the Federal Reserve PPPLF and pledged the same amount in PPP loans as collateral in the second quarter of 2020 and paid off the outstanding amounts under the PPPLF in full during the fourth quarter of 2020. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Liquidity for East West. In addition to bank level liquidity management, the Company manages liquidity at the parent company level for various operating needs including payment of dividends, repurchases of common stock, principal and interest payments on its borrowings, acquisitions and additional investments in its subsidiaries. East West&#8217;s primary source of liquidity is from cash dividends distributed by its subsidiary, East West Bank. The Bank is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends as discussed in Item 1 . Business &#8212; Supervision and Regulation &#8212; Dividends and Other Transfers of Funds of the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K. As of March 31, 2021, East West held $340.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, after receiving $50.0 million in dividends from the Bank. In comparison, as of December 31, 2020, East West held $439.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. Each year, the dividends from the Bank to East West are sufficient to meet the projected cash obligations of the parent company for the coming year. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Liquidity Stress Testing. Liquidity stress testing is performed at the Company level, as well as at the foreign subsidiary and foreign branch levels. Stress tests and scenario analyses are intended to quantify the potential impact of a liquidity event on the financial and liquidity position of the entity. Scenario analyses include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources, market triggers, potential uses of funding and economic conditions in certain countries. In addition, Company specific events are incorporated into the stress testing. Liquidity stress tests are conducted to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons, both immediate and longer term, and over a variety of stressed conditions. Given the range of potential stresses, the Company maintains contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for individual entities. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; COVID-19 Pandemic. In response to the ongoing developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company continues to closely monitor the impact of the pandemic on its business. The uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and its impact on the financial services industry, could potentially impact the liquidity of the Company. The prolonged strained economic, capital, credit and/or financial market conditions may expose the Company to liquidity risk. However, the Company believes that market conditions have shown signs of improvement after the Federal Reserve stepped in with a broad array of actions to stabilize financial markets and to lower borrowing costs. In December 2020, the CAA, which issued new relief provisions, extended certain provisions of the CARES Act, and provided additional stimulus funding, was signed into law. In addition, the ARPA was signed into law to provide additional relief for individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2021. The combination of the CAA and additional stimulus legislation passed in 2021 may further enhance economic recovery. 

As of March 31, 2021, the Company was not aware of any material commitments for capital expenditures in the foreseeable future and believes it has adequate liquidity resources to conduct operations and meet other needs in the ordinary course of business. Given the uncertainty and the rapidly changing market and economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company will continue to actively evaluate the nature and extent of the impact on its business and financial position. 

Consolidated Cash Flows Analysis 

The following table presents a summary of the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the periods indicated. While this information may be helpful to highlight business strategies and certain macroeconomic trends, the cash flow analysis may not be as relevant when analyzing changes in the Company&#8217;s net earnings and assets. The Company believes that in addition to this traditional cash flow analysis, the discussion related to liquidity in Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Risk Management &#8212; Liquidity Risk Management &#8212; Liquidity in this Form 10-Q may provide a useful context in evaluating the Company&#8217;s liquidity position and related activity. 

($ in thousands) Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 371,515 $ 91,703 Net cash used in investing activities (4,383,909) (1,405,330) Net cash provided by financing activities 4,475,275 1,119,028 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 138,281 13,492 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 601,162 (181,107) Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 4,017,971 3,261,149 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 4,619,133 &#160; $ 3,080,042 &#160; 

Operating Activities &#8212; Net cash provided by operating activities was $371.5 million and $91.7 million for the first quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively. During the first quarter of 2021, net cash provided by operating activities mainly reflected inflow of $205.0 million from net income, $185.7 million decrease in accrued interest receivable and other assets primarily driven by lower derivative assets, and net income adjusted for certain noncash items of $49.3 million, partially offset by $72.9 million decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities. In comparison, during the same period in 2020, net cash provided by operating activities mainly reflected inflow of $144.8 million from net income, net income adjusted for certain noncash items of $105.3 million primarily driven by higher provision for credit losses recognized and $304.7 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by $462.8 million increase in accrued interest receivable and other assets. 

Investing Activities &#8212; Net cash used in investing activities was $4.38 billion and $1.41 billion for the first quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively. During the first quarter of 2021, cash used in investing activities primarily reflected $2.45 billion from net purchases of AFS debt securities (net of sales, maturities and paydowns), $1.21 billion used cash for growth in the loan portfolio, and $700.0 million net increase in resale agreements (net of maturities and paydowns). During the same period in 2020, net cash used in investing activities primarily reflected growth in the loan portfolio of $1.14 billion in used cash, $372.0 million net purchases of AFS debt securities (net of sales, maturities and paydowns), and $115.4 million in cash used for interest-bearing deposits with banks. The cash used was partially offset by proceeds of $250.0 million from resale agreements. 

Financing Activities &#8212; Net cash provided by financing activities was $4.48 billion and $1.12 billion for the first quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively. During the first quarter of 2021, net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected a net increase of $4.56 billion in deposits, partially offset by $48.2 million in cash dividends paid. During the same period in 2020, net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected net increases of $1.37 billion in deposits and $40.0 million in short-term borrowings, partially offset by $146.0 million of cash used in shares repurchased, $100.0 million repayment in FHLB advances and $41.4 million in cash dividends paid. 

Market Risk Management 

Market risk is the risk that the Company&#8217;s financial condition may change resulting from adverse movements in market rates or prices including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, interest rate contracts, investment securities prices, credit spreads and related risk resulting from mismatches in rate sensitive assets and liabilities. In the event of market stress, the risk could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. 

The Board&#8217;s Risk Oversight Committee has primary oversight responsibility. At the management level, the ALCO establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market risk management activities. Corporate Treasury supports the ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks. 

Interest Rate Risk Management 

Interest rate risk results primarily from the Company&#8217;s traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans, which is the primary market risk for the Company. Economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates, and consumer preferences impact the level of noninterest-bearing funding sources at the Company, as well as affect the difference between the interest the Company earns on interest-earning assets and pays on interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, changes in interest rates can influence the rate of principal prepayments on loans and the speed of deposit withdrawals. Due to the pricing term mismatches and the embedded options inherent in certain products, changes in market interest rates not only affect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic value of these interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Other market risks include foreign currency exchange risk and equity price risk. These risks are not considered significant to the Company and no separate quantitative information concerning these risks is presented herein. 

With oversight by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, the ALCO coordinates the overall management of the Company&#8217;s interest rate risk. The ALCO meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing the Company&#8217;s open market positions and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk. Management of interest rate risk is carried out primarily through strategies involving the Company&#8217;s debt securities portfolio, loan portfolio, available funding channels and capital market activities. In addition, the Company&#8217;s policies permit the use of derivative instruments to assist in managing interest rate risk. 

The interest rate risk exposure is measured and monitored through various risk management tools, which include a simulation model that performs interest rate sensitivity analyses under multiple interest rate scenarios. The model incorporates the Company&#8217;s cash instruments, loans, debt securities, resale agreements, deposits, borrowings and repurchase agreements, as well as financial instruments from the Company&#8217;s foreign operations. The Company uses both a static balance sheet and a forward growth balance sheet to perform these analyses. The simulated interest rate scenarios include a non-parallel shift in the yield curve (&#8220;rate shock&#8221;) and a gradual non-parallel shift in the yield curve (&#8220;rate ramp&#8221;). In addition, the Company also performs simulations using alternative interest rate scenarios, including various permutations of the yield curve flattening, steepening or inverting. Results of these various simulations are used to formulate and gauge strategies to achieve a desired risk profile within the Company&#8217;s capital and liquidity guidelines. 

The net interest income simulation model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of the Company&#8217;s interest-rate sensitive assets, liabilities and related derivative contracts. It also incorporates various assumptions, which management believes to be reasonable but may have a significant impact on results. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the timing and magnitude of changes in interest rates, the yield curve evolution and shape, the correlation between various interest rate indices, financial instrument future repricing characteristics and spread relative to benchmark rates, and the effect of interest rate floors and caps. The modeled results are highly sensitive to deposit decay and deposit beta assumptions, which are derived from a regression analysis of the Company&#8217;s historical deposit data. Deposit beta commonly refers to the correlation of the changes in interest rates paid on deposits to changes in benchmark market interest rates. The model is also sensitive to the loan and investment prepayment assumptions, based on an independent model and the Company&#8217;s historical prepayment data, which consider anticipated prepayments under different interest rate environments. 

Simulation results are highly dependent on input assumptions. To the extent actual behavior is different from the assumptions in the models, there could be a material change in interest rate sensitivity. The assumptions applied in the model are documented and supported for reasonableness, and periodically back-tested to assess their effectiveness. The Company makes appropriate calibrations to the model as needed, continually refining the model, methodology and results. Changes to key model assumptions are reviewed by the ALCO. Scenario results do not reflect strategies that management could employ to limit the impact of changing interest rate expectations. 

Since the federal funds rate range was lowered to near zero in March 2020 and the Federal Reserve has committed its resources to support the financial markets, business, and state and local governments, it is not expected that rates will decline further, nor is it expected that rates will enter into the negative territory. Consequently, the simulation results for the downward interest rate scenarios as of March 31, 2021 are not provided. 

Twelve-Month Net Interest Income Simulation 

Net interest income simulation modeling looks at interest rate risk through earnings. It projects the changes in interest rate sensitive asset and liability cash flows, expressed in terms of net interest income, over a specified time horizon for defined interest rates scenarios. Net interest income simulations generate insight into the impact of market rates changes on earnings and guide risk management decisions. The Company assesses interest rate risk by comparing net interest income using different interest rate scenarios. 

The federal funds rate range was between 0.00% and 0.25% as of both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. After lowering the range to between 0.00% and 0.25% in March 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee (&#8220;FOMC&#8221;) pledged to maintain monetary support for the economy. Moreover, in December 2020, acknowledging the uncertain and likely lengthy path to a full post-pandemic economic recovery, the majority of FOMC members projected that the federal funds rate range will likely remain unchanged through 2023. The FOMC statement indicated that the federal funds target rate will remain unchanged until maximum employment has been reached and inflation rises to and remains at 2% for some time. In April 2021, the FOMC confirmed the federal funds target rate at between 0.00% and 0.25% and continuance of its quantitative easing program which suggests a low probability of increases in short term interest rates over the next two years. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s net interest income sensitivity related to an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates of 100 and 200 basis points in upward direction as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Change in Interest Rates (Basis Points) Net Interest Income Volatility (1) 

March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 +200 13.2 % 12.6 % +100 6.0 % 5.6 % -100 NM NM -200 NM NM 

NM &#8212; Not meaningful. 

(1) The percentage change represents net interest income over 12 months in a stable interest rate environment versus net interest income in the various rate scenarios. 

The Company&#8217;s net interest income profile as of March 31, 2021 reflects an asset sensitive position. Net interest income would be expected to increase if interest rates rise and to decrease if interest rates decline. The potential impact of rate decreases is somewhat muted due to the current low rate environment with the federal funds rate floored and the federal funds rate range between 0.00% and 0.25%. The Company is naturally asset sensitive due to the large share of variable rate loans in its loan portfolio, which are primarily linked to Prime and LIBOR indices. The Company&#8217;s interest income is vulnerable to changes in short-term interest rates. However, given the current low level of interest rates, the potential for further rate decreases is limited, which reduces the Bank&#8217;s exposure to risks associated with falling rates. The Company&#8217;s deposit portfolio is primarily comprised of non-maturity deposits, which are not directly tied to short-term interest rate indices, but are, nevertheless, sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates. 

The Company&#8217;s estimated twelve-month net interest income sensitivity as of March 31, 2021 was slightly higher as compared with the sensitivity as of December 31, 2020 under both higher rate scenarios. This reflects both an increased asset rate sensitivity in the Company&#8217;s assets and an increase in noninterest bearing deposits. 

While an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates was used in the simulation model described in the preceding paragraphs, the Company believes that any shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and would therefore have a more modest impact. The rate ramp table below shows the net income volatility under a gradual non-parallel shift of the yield curve upward direction, in even quarterly increments over the first 12 months, followed by rates held constant thereafter: 

Change in Interest Rates (Basis Points) Net Interest Income Volatility (1) 

March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 +200 Rate Ramp 5.4 % 4.9 % +100 Rate Ramp 2.2 % 2.2 % -100 Rate Ramp NM NM -200 Rate Ramp NM NM 

NM &#8212; Not meaningful. 

(1) The percentage change represents net interest income under a gradual non-parallel shift in even quarterly increments over 12 months. 

The Company believes that the rate ramp table, shown above, when evaluated together with the results of the rate shock simulation, presents a more meaningful indication of the potential impact of rising interest rates to the Company&#8217;s twelve-month net interest income. During the first quarter of 2021, the Company&#8217;s modeled asset sensitivity increased slightly under a ramp simulation for the up 200 basis point ramp scenario and remained virtually unchanged for the up 100 basis point ramp interest rate scenario. 

Economic Value of Equity at Risk 

Economic value of equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;) is a cash flow calculation that takes the present value of all asset cash flows and subtracts the present value of all liability cash flows. This calculation is used for asset/liability management and measures changes in the economic value of the bank. The fair market values of a bank's assets and liabilities are directly linked to interest rates. The economic value approach provides a comparatively broader scope than the net income volatility approach since it captures all anticipated cash flows. 

EVE simulation reflects the effect of interest rate shifts on the value of the Company and is used to assess the degree of interest rate risk exposure. In contrast to the earnings perspective, the economic perspective identifies risks arising from repricing or maturity gaps over the life of the balance sheet. Changes in economic value indicate anticipated changes in the value of the bank&#8217;s future cash flows. Thus, the economic perspective can provide a leading indicator of the bank&#8217;s future earnings and capital values. The economic value method also reflects sensitivity across the full maturity spectrum of the bank&#8217;s assets and liabilities. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s EVE sensitivity related to an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates of 100 and 200 basis points in an upward direction as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020: 

Change in Interest Rates (Basis Points) EVE Volatility (1) 

March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 +200 4.6 % 9.6 % +100 2.4 % 4.8 % -100 NM NM -200 NM NM 

NM &#8212; Not meaningful. 

(1) The percentage change represents net portfolio value of the Company in a stable interest rate environment versus net portfolio value in the various rate scenarios. 

The Company&#8217;s EVE sensitivity for the upward interest rate scenarios decreased as of March 31, 2021 compared with the results as of December 31, 2020. The changes in EVE sensitivity during this period were primarily due to changes in level and shape of the yield curve. 

The Company&#8217;s EVE profile as of March 31, 2021 reflects an asset sensitive EVE position under the higher interest rate scenarios. Given the uncertainty of the magnitude, timing and direction of future interest rate movements, and the shape of the yield curve, actual results may vary from those predicted by the Company&#8217;s model. 

Derivatives 

It is the Company&#8217;s policy not to speculate on the future direction of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. However, the Company will periodically enter into derivative transactions in order to reduce its exposure to market risks, primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The Company believes that these derivative transactions, when properly structured and managed, may provide a hedge against inherent risk in certain assets and liabilities and against risk in specific transactions. Hedging transactions may be implemented using a variety of derivative instruments such as swaps, forwards and options. Prior to entering into any hedging activities, the Company analyzes the costs and benefits of the hedge in comparison to alternative strategies. In addition, the Company enters into derivative transactions in order to assist customers with their risk management objectives, such as managing exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodity prices. To economically hedge against the derivative contracts entered into with the Company&#8217;s customers, the Company enters into mirrored derivative contracts with third-party financial institutions. The exposures from derivative transactions are collateralized by cash and/or eligible securities based on limits as set forth in the respective agreements entered between the Company and counterparty financial institutions. 

The Company is subject to credit risk associated with the counterparties to the derivative contracts. This counterparty credit risk is a multi-dimensional form of risk, affected by both the exposure and credit quality of the counterparty, both of which are sensitive to market-induced changes. The Company&#8217;s Credit Risk Management Committee provides oversight of credit risks and the Company has guidelines in place to manage counterparty concentration, tenor limits and collateral. The Company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties, by entering into legally enforceable master netting arrangements and by requiring collateral arrangements, where possible. The Company may also transfer counterparty credit risk-related to interest rate swaps to institutional third parties through the use of credit risk participation agreements. Certain derivative contracts are required to be centrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty credit risk. The Company incorporates credit value adjustments and other market standard methodologies to appropriately reflect its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty&#8217;s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements of its derivatives. 

The following table summarizes certain information concerning derivative financial instruments utilized by the Company in its management of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020:

Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments &#8212; Interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our asset and liability management activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage the Company&#8217;s interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. We use derivatives to hedge the risk of variable cash flows that the Company is exposed to from its variable interest rate borrowings, including repurchase agreements and FHLB advances. The Company also uses derivatives to hedge the risk of changes in the USD equivalent value of a designated monetary amount of the Company&#8217;s net investment in East West Bank (China) Limited. For both cash flow and net investment hedges, the change in the fair value of the hedging instruments is recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax , on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

The fluctuation in foreign currency translation of the hedged exposure is expected to be offset by changes in the fair value of the forwards. As of March 31, 2021, the outstanding foreign currency forwards effectively hedged approximately 50% of the Chinese Renminbi exposure in East West Bank (China) Limited. 

Changes to the composition of the Company&#8217;s derivatives designated as hedging instruments reflect actions taken for interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk management. The decisions to reposition our derivatives portfolio are based on the current assessment of economic and financial conditions, including the interest rate and foreign currency environments, balance sheet composition and trends, and the relative mix of our cash and derivative positions. 

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments &#8212; The Company enters into interest rate, foreign exchange and energy commodity contracts to support the business requirements of its customers. When derivative transactions are executed with its customers, the derivative contracts are offset by paired trades with third-party financial institutions. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are either exchange-traded, centrally cleared through a clearinghouse or over-the-counter. 

The Company offers various interest rate derivative contracts to its customers. For the interest rate contracts entered into with its customers, the Company managed its interest rate risk by entering into offsetting interest rate contracts with third-party financial institutions including with central clearing organizations. Certain derivative contracts entered with central clearing organizations are settled-to-market daily to the extent the central clearing organizations&#8217; rulebooks legally characterize the variation margin as settlement. Derivative contracts allow borrowers to lock in attractive intermediate and long-term fixed rate financing while not increasing the interest rate risk to the Company. These transactions are not linked to specific Company assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, or to forecasted transactions in a hedging relationship, and are therefore economic hedges. The contracts are marked-to-market at each reporting period. The changes in fair values of the derivative contracts traded with third-party financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the derivative transactions executed with customers throughout the terms of these contracts, except for the credit valuation adjustment component. The Company records credit valuation adjustments on derivatives to properly reflect the variances of credit worthiness between the Company and the counterparties, considering the effects of enforceable master netting agreements and collateral arrangements. 

The Company enters into foreign exchange contracts with its customers, consisting of forward, spot, swap and option contracts to accommodate the business needs of its customers. For the foreign exchange contracts entered into with its customers, the Company managed its foreign exchange and credit exposures by entering into offsetting foreign exchange contracts with third-party financial institutions and/or entering into bilateral collateral and master netting agreements with customer counterparties. The changes in the fair values entered with third-party financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the foreign exchange transactions executed with customers throughout the terms of these contracts. As of March 31, 2021, the Company anticipates performance by all counterparties and has not experienced nonperformance by any of its counterparties, and therefore did not incur any related losses. The Company also utilizes foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to mitigate the economic effect of fluctuations in certain foreign currency on-balance sheet assets and liabilities, primarily foreign currency denominated deposits offered to its customers. The Company&#8217;s policies permit taking proprietary currency positions within approved limits, in compliance with exemptions to proprietary trading restrictions provided under Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Volcker Rule. The Company does not speculate in the foreign exchange markets, and actively manages its foreign exchange exposures within prescribed risk limits and defined controls. 

The Company enters into energy commodity contracts with its customers to allow them to hedge against the risk of fluctuation in energy commodity prices. To economically hedge against the risk of fluctuation in commodity prices in the products offered to its customers, the Company enters into offsetting commodity contracts with third-party financial institutions, including with central clearing organizations. Certain derivative contracts entered into with central clearing organizations are settled to market daily, to the extent the central clearing organizations&#8217; rulebooks legally characterize the variation margin as settlement. The changes in fair values of the energy commodity contracts traded with third-party financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the energy commodity transactions executed with customers throughout the terms of these contracts. 

Additional information on the Company&#8217;s derivatives is presented in Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K and Note 3 &#8212; Fair Value Measurement and Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Note 6 &#8212; Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

Impact of Inflation 

The consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this report have been prepared according to GAAP, which require the measurement of financial and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs and the effect that inflation may have on both short- and long-term interest rates. Since almost all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than inflation. While inflation expectations do affect interest rates, interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The Company&#8217;s significant accounting policies and use of estimates are fundamental to understanding its results of operations and financial condition. Some accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments. In addition, some significant accounting policies require significant judgments in applying complex accounting principles to individual transaction and determining the most appropriate treatment. The Company has procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. For significant accounting policies and use of estimates, see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K. 

Certain accounting policies are considered to have a critical effect on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that require the most complex or subjective judgments and are reflective of significant uncertainties, and whose actual results could differ from the Company&#8217;s estimates. Future changes in the key variables could change future valuations and impact the results of operations. In each area, the Company has identified the most important variables in the estimation process. The Company has used the best information available to make the estimations necessary for the related assets and liabilities. The following accounting policies are critical to the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements as they require management to make subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain where actual results could differ materially from the Company&#8217;s estimates: 

&#8226; fair value of financial instruments; 

&#8226; allowance for loan losses and unfunded credit commitments; 

&#8226; goodwill impairment; and 

&#8226; income taxes.

Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

To supplement the Company&#8217;s unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company uses certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to GAAP. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company&#8217;s performance that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. A non-GAAP financial measure may also be a financial metric that is not required by GAAP or other applicable requirements. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance, and allow comparability to prior periods. These non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. 

The following tables present the reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for the periods presented:

Forward-Looking Statements 

Certain matters discussed in this Form 10-Q contain forward-looking statements that are intended to be covered by the safe harbor for such statements provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, the Company may make forward-looking statements in other documents that it files with, or furnishes to, the SEC and management may make forward-looking statements to analysts, investors, media members and others. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the Company&#8217;s industry, management&#8217;s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond the Company&#8217;s control, particularly with regard to developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These statements relate to the Company&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and/or business. They usually can be identified by the use of forward-looking language, such as &#8220;likely result in,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;forecasts,&#8221; &#8220;projects,&#8221; &#8220;intends to,&#8221; &#8220;assumes,&#8221; &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;trend,&#8221; &#8220;objective,&#8221; &#8220;continues,&#8221; &#8220;remains,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;might,&#8221; &#8220;can,&#8221; or similar expressions, and the negative thereof. You should not place undue reliance on these statements, as they are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in the documents incorporated by reference. When considering these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind these risks and uncertainties, as well as any cautionary statements the Company may make. Moreover, you should treat these statements as speaking only as of the date they are made and based only on information then actually known to the Company. 

There are a number of important factors that could cause future results to differ materially from historical performance and these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences, some of which are beyond the Company&#8217;s control, include, but are not limited to: 

&#8226; the impact of disease pandemics, such as the resurgences and subsequent waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, on the Company, its operations, customers and employees and the markets in which the Company operates and in which its loans are concentrated; and the measures that international, federal, state and local governments, agencies, law enforcement and/or health authorities implement to address such a pandemic, which may precipitate or exacerbate one or more of the below-mentioned or other risks, and significantly disrupt or prevent the Company from operating its business in the ordinary course for an extended period;
