 ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#160; 

Organization 

East West Bancorp, Inc. (referred to herein on an unconsolidated basis as &#8220;East West&#8221; and on a consolidated basis as the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, or &#8220;EWBC&#8221;) is a bank holding company incorporated in Delaware on August 26, 1998 and is registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (&#8220;BHC Act&#8221;). The Company commenced business on December 30, 1998 when, pursuant to a reorganization, it acquired all of the voting stock of East West Bank (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;), which became its principal asset. In addition to the Bank, East West has six subsidiaries as of December 31, 2019 that were established as statutory business trusts for the purpose of issuing junior subordinated debt to third party investors. East West also owns East West Insurance Services, Inc. (&#8220;EWIS&#8221;). In 2017, the Company sold the insurance brokerage business of EWIS, and EWIS remains a subsidiary of East West and continues to maintain its insurance broker license. In 2019, East West acquired Enstream Capital Markets, LLC, a private broker dealer and also established East West Investment Management LLC, a registered investment adviser. Both Enstream Capital Markets, LLC (subsequently renamed as East West Markets, LLC) and East West Investment Management LLC are wholly-owned subsidiaries of East West. 

East West&#8217;s principal business is to serve as a holding company for the Bank and other banking or banking-related subsidiaries that East West may establish or acquire. As a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries, East West&#8217;s principal source of funds is, and will continue to be, dividends that may be paid by its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company had $44.20 billion in total assets, $34.42 billion in total loans (including loans held-for-sale, net of allowance), $37.32 billion in total deposits and $5.02 billion in total stockholders&#8217; equity. 

As of December 31, 2019 , the Bank has four wholly-owned subsidiaries. The first subsidiary, East-West Investment, Inc., primarily acts as a trustee in connection with real estate secured loans. The second subsidiary, E-W Services, Inc., is a California corporation organized by the Bank in 1977 to hold properties used by the Bank in its operations. The third subsidiary is East West Bank (China) Limited, a banking subsidiary in China. The remaining subsidiary is East West Velo Technology Service (Beijing) Limited Company, which provides technological support for the Bank&#8217;s global digital banking services. 

On March 17, 2018, the Bank completed the sale of its eight Desert Community Bank (&#8220;DCB&#8221;) branches located in the High Desert area of Southern California to Flagstar Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. The sale resulted in a pretax gain of $31.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, which was reported as Net gain on sale of business on the Consolidated Statement of Income. 

The Bank continues to develop its international banking presence with its network of overseas branches and representative offices that include five full-service branches in Greater China, located in Hong Kong , Shanghai , Shantou and Shenzhen . The Bank has two branches in Shanghai with one in the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone. The Bank also has four representative offices in Greater China, located in Beijing , Chongqing , Guangzhou and Xiamen . In addition to facilitating traditional letters of credit and trade financing to businesses, these representative offices allow the Bank to assist existing clients and to develop new business relationships. Through these branches and offices, the Bank is focused on growing its cross-border client base between the U.S. and Greater China, helping U.S. based businesses expand in Greater China and companies based in Greater China pursue business opportunities in the U.S. 

The Bank continues to explore opportunities to establish other foreign offices, subsidiaries, strategic investments and partnerships to expand its international banking capabilities and to capitalize on long-term cross-border business opportunities between the U.S. and Greater China. 

Banking Services 

As of December 31, 2019 , the Bank was the fourth largest independent commercial bank headquartered in California based on total assets. The Bank is the largest bank in the U.S. focused on the financial service needs of individuals and businesses that operate both in the U.S. and Greater China. The Bank also has a strong focus on the Chinese-American community. Through its network of over 125 banking locations in the U.S. and Greater China, the Bank provides a wide range of personal and commercial banking services to businesses and individuals. The Bank provides multilingual services to its customers in English, Chinese, Spanish and Vietnamese. The Bank also offers a variety of deposit products that include personal and business checking and savings accounts, money market, time deposits and also offers foreign exchange and wealth management services. The Bank&#8217;s lending activities include commercial and residential real estate, lines of credit, construction, trade finance, letters of credit, commercial business, affordable housing lending, asset-based lending and equipment financing. In addition, the Bank is focused on providing financing to clients in need of a financial bridge to facilitate their business transactions between the U.S. and Greater China. 

Operating Segments 

The Bank&#8217;s three operating segments, (1) Consumer and Business Banking, (2) Commercial Banking and (3) Other, are based on the Bank&#8217;s core strategy. The Consumer and Business Banking segment primarily provides financial products and services to consumer and commercial customers through the Company&#8217;s domestic branch network. The Commercial Banking segment primarily generates commercial loans and deposits. The remaining centralized functions, including the corporate treasury activities of the Company and eliminations of inter-segment amounts, have been aggregated and included in the Other segment. For complete discussion and disclosure, see Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) &#8212; Operating Segment Results and Note 21 &#8212; Business Segments to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Market Area and Competition 

The Bank operates in a highly competitive environment. The Company faces competition from domestic and foreign lending institutions and numerous other providers of financial services. Competition is based on a number of factors including, among others, customer service, quality and range of products and services offered, reputation, interest rates on loans and deposits, lending limits and customer convenience. Competition also varies based on the types of customers and locations served. The Company has the leading banking market share among the Chinese-American community, and maintains a differentiated presence within selected markets by providing cross-border expertise to customers in a number of industry specializations between the U.S and Greater China. 

The Bank believes that its customers benefit from the Bank&#8217;s understanding of the Greater China markets through its physical presence, corporate and organizational ties in Greater China, as well as the Bank&#8217;s international banking products and services. The Bank believes that this approach, combined with its senior managements&#8217; and Board of Directors&#8217; extensive ties to Chinese business opportunities and Chinese-American communities, provides the Bank with a competitive advantage. The Bank utilizes its presence in Greater China to identify and build corporate relationships, which the Bank may leverage to create business opportunities in California and other U.S. markets. 

While the Company believes it is well positioned within a highly competitive industry, the industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory, economic, and technological changes, as well as continuing consolidation. 

Supervision and Regulation 

Overview 

East West and the Bank are subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under U.S. federal and state laws. Regulation and supervision by the federal and state banking agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) administered by the FDIC, consumers and the banking system as a whole, and not for the protection of our investors. As a bank holding company, East West is subject to primary inspection, supervision, regulation, and examination by the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act. The Bank is regulated, supervised, and examined by the Federal Reserve, the DBO, and, with respect to consumer laws, the CFPB. As insurer of the Bank&#8217;s deposits, the FDIC has back-up examination authority as well. In addition, the Bank is regulated by certain foreign regulatory agencies in international jurisdictions where we now, or may in the future wish to conduct business, including Greater China and Hong Kong. 

The Company is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), as amended, both as administered by the SEC. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol &#8220;EWBC&#8221; and is subject to NASDAQ rules for listed companies. The Company is also subject to the accounting oversight and corporate governance of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 

Described below are material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to East West and the Bank. The descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described. A change in applicable statutes, regulations or regulatory policies may have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s business. 

East West 

As a bank holding company and pursuant to its election of the financial holding company status, East West is subject to regulations and examinations by the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act. The BHC Act provides a federal framework for the supervision and regulation of all domestic and foreign companies that control a bank and the subsidiaries of such companies. The BHC Act and other federal statutes grant the Federal Reserve authority to, among other things: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

require periodic reports and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require in its discretion; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

require the Company to maintain certain levels of capital and, under the Dodd-Frank Act, limit the ability of bank holding companies to pay dividends or bonuses unless their capital levels exceed the capital conservation buffer (see Item 1. Business &#8212; Supervision and Regulation &#8212; Capital Requirements ); 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

require bank holding companies to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to subsidiary banks and commit resources, as necessary, to support each subsidiary bank, including at times when bank holding companies may not be inclined to do so, the failure to do so generally be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of Federal Reserve regulations or both; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

restrict dividends and other distributions from subsidiary banks to their parent bank holding companies; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

terminate an activity or terminate control of or liquidate or divest certain nonbank subsidiaries, affiliates or investments if the Federal Reserve believes that the activity or the control of the nonbank subsidiary or affiliate constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of the bank holding company; and if the activity, ownership, or control is inconsistent with the purposes of the BHC Act; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

regulate provisions of certain bank holding company debt, including the authority to impose interest ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt and require prior approval to purchase or redeem the Company&#8217;s securities in certain situations; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

approve in advance senior executive officer or director changes and prohibit (under certain circumstances) golden parachute payments to officers and employees, including change in control agreements and new employment agreements, that are contingent upon termination; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

approve in advance acquisitions of and mergers with bank holding companies, banks and other financial companies, and consider certain competitive, management, financial, financial stability and other factors in granting these approvals. DBO approvals may also be required for certain acquisitions and mergers. 

##TABLE_END 

East West&#8217;s election to be a financial holding company as permitted under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (&#8220;GLBA&#8221;), allows East West generally to engage in any activity, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity that the Federal Reserve has determined to be financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature without prior Federal Reserve approval. Activities that are considered to be financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance agency and underwriting, merchant banking activities and activities that the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity. &#8220;Complementary activities&#8221; are activities that the Federal Reserve determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a safety and soundness risk. To maintain financial holding company status, a financial holding company and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221;, &#8220;well managed&#8221; and in satisfactory compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;). A depository institution subsidiary is considered to be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if it satisfies the requirements for this status discussed in the sections captioned &#8220; Capital Requirements &#8221; and &#8220; Prompt Corrective Action ,&#8221; included elsewhere under this item. A depository institution subsidiary is considered &#8220;well managed&#8221; if it received a composite rating and a management rating of at least &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; in its most recent examination. See the section captioned &#8220; Community Reinvestment Act &#8221; included elsewhere under this item. As of December 31, 2019, East West is a financial holding company and has financial subsidiaries, as discussed in Item 1. Business &#8212; Organization . 

The Bank and its Subsidiaries 

East West Bank is a California state-chartered bank, a member of the Federal Reserve and a bank whose deposits are insured by the FDIC. The Bank&#8217;s foreign operations are regulated and supervised by the Federal Reserve and the DBO, as well as by regulatory authorities in the host countries in which the Bank&#8217;s overseas offices reside. Specific federal and state laws and regulations that are applicable to banks regulate, among other things, the scope of their business, their investments, their reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds, and the nature and amount of collateral for certain loans. The regulatory structure also gives the bank regulatory agencies extensive discretion to impose various restrictions on management or operations and to issue policies and guidance in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies. California law permits state chartered commercial banks to engage in any activity permissible for national banks, unless such activity is expressly prohibited by state law. Therefore, the Bank may form subsidiaries to engage in the many so-called &#8220;closely related to banking&#8221; or &#8220;nonbanking&#8221; activities commonly conducted by national banks in operating subsidiaries, and further, pursuant to the GLBA, the Bank may conduct certain &#8220;financial&#8221; activities in a subsidiary to the same extent permitted for a national bank, provided the Bank is and remains &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;well managed&#8221; and in &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; compliance with the CRA. 

Regulation of Subsidiaries/Branches 

The Bank&#8217;s foreign-based subsidiary, East West Bank (China) Limited, is subject to applicable foreign laws and regulations, such as those implemented by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission. Nonbank subsidiaries are subject to additional or separate regulation and supervision by other state, federal and self-regulatory bodies. The East West Bank Hong Kong branch is subject to applicable foreign laws and regulations, such as those implemented by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong. 

Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act 

The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, enhanced regulation and supervision of the financial services industry and made other sweeping changes in the U.S. financial system. In May 2018, the U.S. Congress enacted the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, (&#8220;EGRRCPA&#8221;), which amended provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act and other statutes administered by the Federal Reserve. The changes can be grouped into several areas that impact us: 

##TABLE_START 1. 

Regulatory relief for bank holding companies and state member banks with assets between $10 billion and $50 billion. We are among the bank holding companies and banks in this range. Dodd-Frank required that bank holding companies in this size range establish a risk committee that satisfied certain requirements and conduct an annual stress-test. The stress-test requirement was extended to state member banks (and other insured depository institutions) as well. EGRRCPA lifted the size threshold for a formal risk committee from $10 billion to $50 billion, but the Federal Reserve will still examine the risk management practices of companies with assets in the $10 billion to $50 billion range for consistency with safety and soundness and prudent practices. With respect to stress-testing by the Bank, EGRRCPA raised the asset size threshold for required testing from $10 billion to $250 billion. Regarding the Company, the Federal Reserve in rulemaking (based on broad EGRRCPA authority) lifted the asset size threshold from $10 billion to $100 billion for required stress-testing bank holding companies. Accordingly, neither the Company nor the Bank is now required to conduct stress-tests. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2. 

Regulatory relief for community banking organizations. Banks and bank holding companies with less than $10 billion in assets &#8212; that is, institutions smaller than the Company and the Bank &#8212; receive additional relief under EGRRCPA that may give them competitive advantages. Among other things, these banks and bank holding companies are generally exempt from the Volcker Rule, and they may maintain a new Community Bank Leverage Ratio of 9% in lieu of meeting existing risk-based capital ratio and leverage ratio requirements. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3. 

Regulatory relief for larger bank holding companies. Our larger competitors also receive a degree of regulatory relief from previous requirements. Bank holding companies designated as global systemically important banking organizations and those with more than $250 billion in assets are still automatically subject to enhanced regulation. However, bank holding companies with between $100 billion and $250 billion in assets are automatically subject only to supervisory stress tests, while the Federal Reserve has discretion to apply other individual enhanced prudential provisions to these companies. Bank holding companies with assets between $50 billion and $100 billion will no longer be subject to enhanced regulation, except for the risk committee requirement. In addition, EGRRCPA relaxes leverage requirements for large custody banks and allows certain municipal bonds to be counted toward large bank holding companies&#8217; liquidity requirements. 

##TABLE_END 

Capital Requirements 

The federal banking agencies have imposed risk-based capital adequacy guidelines intended to ensure that banking organizations maintain capital that is commensurate with the degree of risk associated with their operations. In July 2013, the federal banking agencies adopted final rules (the &#8220;Basel III Capital Rules&#8221;) establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The Basel III Capital Rules revised the definitions and the components of regulatory capital, in part through the introduction of a Common Equity Tier 1 (&#8220;CET1&#8221;) capital requirement and a related regulatory capital ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets, restricted the type of instruments that may be recognized in Tier 1 and 2 capital (including the phase out of trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital for bank holding companies). The Basel III Capital Rules also prescribed a new standardized approach for risk weighting assets and expanded the risk weighting categories to a larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories that affect the denominator in banking institutions&#8217; regulatory capital ratios. 

Under the Basel III Capital Rules, to be considered adequately capitalized, the Company and the Bank are required to maintain minimum capital ratios of 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets, 6.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, 8.0% total capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets and a 4.0% Tier 1 leverage ratio. The Basel III Capital Rules also introduced a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; of 2.5% that fully phased in on January 1, 2019, that is composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and discretionary bonus payments based on the amount of the shortfall. To avoid constraints, a banking organization must maintain the following capital ratios (after any distribution): (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets more than 7.0%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets more than 8.5% and (iii) total capital to risk-weighted assets more than 10.5%. 

With respect to the Bank, the Basel III Capital Rules also resulted in changes to the Prompt Corrective Action (&#8220;PCA&#8221;) regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (&#8220;FDIA&#8221;), as discussed below under the Prompt Corrective Action section. 

As of December 31, 2019 , the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s capital ratios exceeded the minimum capital adequacy guideline percentage requirements of the federal banking agencies for &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; institutions under the Basel III capital rules on a fully phased-in basis. For additional discussion and disclosure see Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Regulatory Capital and Ratios and Note 20 &#8212; Regulatory Requirements and Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

Recent Regulatory Capital-Related Developments 

From time to time, the regulatory agencies propose changes and amendments to, and issue interpretations of, risk-based capital guidelines and related reporting instructions. Such proposals and interpretations could, if implemented in the future, affect our reported capital ratios. 

Pursuant to the EGRRCPA, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule in July 2019 (the &#8220;Simplified Capital Rule&#8221;) to reduce regulatory compliance burden by simplifying certain risk-based and leverage capital requirements of the Basel III Capital Rule for non-advanced approaches banking organizations (i.e., banking organizations with less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets or with less than $10 billion of on-balance sheet foreign exposures), including the Company and the Bank. Among other things, the final rule simplified the existing Basel III Capital Rules by: (1) setting a 25% CET1 capital reduction threshold for mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences, investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions, resulting in potentially fewer deductions from CET1, together with revisions to the risk-weight treatment for investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions; and (2) simplifying the limits on the amount of a third-party minority interest in a consolidated subsidiary that could be included in regulatory capital. The Simplified Capital Rule also makes technical amendments to, and clarifies certain aspects of, the agencies&#8217; capital rule for non-advanced approaches banking organizations. The Simplified Capital rule is effective on January 1, 2020. Application of the Simplified Capital Rule to our consolidated balance sheet did not have a significant impact on the capital ratios of the Company and the Bank. 

EGRRCPA also amended the capital requirements for certain acquisition, development and construction (&#8220;ADC&#8221;) loans. The Basel III Capital Rule required that an institution risk weight commercial real estate (&#8220;CRE&#8221;) loans that did not meet certain prerequisites, among them a requirement that a borrower contribute cash or marketable securities or pay development expenses out of pocket equal to at least 15% of the equity in the financed project, at 150%, rather than 100%. EGRRCPA narrowed the scope of ADC loans subject to the higher risk weight in several ways, including a provision that allows a borrower to make the 15% equity contribution in the form of real estate or improvements. 

In December 2018, the regulatory agencies approved a final rule to address changes to credit loss accounting, including banking organizations&#8217; implementation of the new Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2016-13 Financial Instruments&#8212; Credit Losses (Topic 326) Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , which introduces the current expected credit losses (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) methodology. See Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information. The final rule provides banking organizations with the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital upon the adoption of ASU 2016-13. In addition, it revises the regulatory capital rule, stress testing rules, disclosure requirements to reflect CECL and amends other regulations that reference credit loss allowances. The final rule is applicable to banking organizations that are subject to the regulatory capital rule, including the Company and the Bank, and is effective on April 1, 2019 upon banking organizations&#8217; adoption of ASU 2016-13. 

In December 2017, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision completed updates to the Basel III Capital Rules, a process sometimes referred to as Basel IV. These changes to the regulatory framework are intended to restore credibility in the calculation of risk weighted assets. Changes potentially applicable to us include: (1) enhancement of the robustness and risk sensitivity of the standardized approaches for credit risk, credit valuation adjustment and operational risk, which will facilitate the comparability of banks&#8217; capital ratios; and (2) constraints on the use of internally modeled approaches. Other changes apply to advanced approaches institutions and global systemically important banks. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision intends that these standards become effective on January 1, 2022. The federal banking agencies have announced their support for these changes and have said that they will consider appropriate application of these revisions to the regulatory capital rules. Any changes to Basel III Capital Rules that are based on the Basel Committee&#8217;s reforms must go through the federal banking agencies&#8217; standard notice-and-comment rulemaking process. The agencies have not begun the process and have not indicated when they may do so. 

Prompt Corrective Action 

The FDIA, as amended, requires federal banking agencies to take PCA with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA includes the following five capital tiers: &#8220;well capitalized&#8221;, &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221;, &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221;, &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; and &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; A depository institution&#8217;s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. The Basel III Capital Rules revised the PCA requirements effective January 1, 2015. Under the revised PCA provisions of the FDIA, an insured depository institution generally is classified in the following categories based on the capital measures indicated:

An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios, if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. A bank&#8217;s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying PCA regulations and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank&#8217;s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes. 

The FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of any dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company, if the depository institution would thereafter be &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221;. &#8220;Undercapitalized&#8221; institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221;. &#8220;Significantly undercapitalized&#8221; depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221;, requirements to reduce total assets, cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks and/or restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits. &#8220;Critically undercapitalized&#8221; institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator. The FDIA also permits only &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; insured depository institutions to accept brokered deposits, but an &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; institution may apply to the FDIC for a waiver of this restriction. 

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Supervision 

The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which has the authority to implement, examine and enforce compliance with federal consumer financial laws that apply to banking institutions and certain other companies. The CFPB has exclusive authority to examine insured depository institutions with assets exceeding $10 billion (such as the Bank) and their affiliates and may also take enforcement action. The CFPB is focused on: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

risks to consumers and compliance with federal consumer financial laws when it evaluates the policies and practices of a financial institution; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices, which the Dodd-Frank Act empowers the CFPB to prevent through rulemaking, enforcement and examination; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

rulemaking to implement various federal consumer statutes such as the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Electronic Fund Transfer Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Credit Billing Act; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

the markets in which firms operate and risks to consumers posed by activities in those markets. 

##TABLE_END 

The statutes and regulations that the CFPB enforces mandate certain disclosure and other requirements, and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with consumers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting payments on loans and providing other services. Failure to comply with these laws can subject the Bank to various penalties, including, but not limited to, enforcement actions, injunctions, fines or criminal penalties, punitive damages or restitution to consumers, and the loss of certain contractual rights. The Bank and the Company are also subject to federal and state laws prohibiting unfair or fraudulent business practices, untrue or misleading advertising and unfair competition. 

Federal Home Loan Bank and the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Reserve Requirements 

The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) of San Francisco. As a FHLB member, the Bank is required to own a certain amount of capital stock in the FHLB. The Bank may also access the FHLB for both short-term and long-term secured credit. 

The Federal Reserve requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts either in the form of vault cash or an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve Bank, or a pass-through account as defined by the Federal Reserve. The Bank is also a member bank and stockholder of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (&#8220;FRB&#8221;). As of December 31, 2019 , the Bank was in compliance with these requirements. 

&#160; Dividends and Other Transfers of Funds 

The principal source of income of East West is dividends received from the Bank. The Bank is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends. In addition, the banking agencies have an authority to prohibit or limit the Bank from paying dividends, depending upon the Bank&#8217;s financial condition, if such payment is deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Furthermore, under the federal PCA regulations, the Federal Reserve or FDIC may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company&#8217;s bank subsidiary is classified as &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; or below. It is the Federal Reserve&#8217;s policy that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only if the organization&#8217;s net income available to common stockholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends, and if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization&#8217;s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. It is also the Federal Reserve&#8217;s policy that bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine the company&#8217;s ability to be a financial source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve requires bank holding companies to continuously review their dividend policy in light of their organizations&#8217; financial condition and compliance with regulatory capital requirements, and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels, unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. 

Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders 

Pursuant to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, as implemented by the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Regulation W, banks are subject to restrictions that strictly limit their ability to engage in transactions with their affiliates, including their parent bank holding companies. Regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve limit the types, terms and amounts of these transactions and generally require the transactions to be on an arm's-length basis. In general, these regulations require that &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; typically transactions that create credit risk for a bank between a subsidiary bank and any one affiliate (e.g., its parent company or the non-bank subsidiaries of the bank holding company) are limited to 10% of the subsidiary bank's capital and surplus and, with respect to the aggregate of all covered transactions with all affiliates, the limit is 20% of the subsidiary bank's capital and surplus. The Dodd-Frank Act treats derivative transactions resulting in credit exposure to an affiliate as covered transactions. In addition, East West and other affiliates may not borrow from, or enter into other credit transactions with the Bank or its operating subsidiaries, unless the loans or other credit transactions are secured by specified amounts of collateral. In addition, the Volcker Rule under the Dodd-Frank Act establishes certain prohibitions, restrictions and requirements (known as &#8220;Super 23A&#8221; and &#8220;Super 23B&#8221;) on transactions between a covered fund and a banking entity that serves as an investment manager, investment adviser, organizer and offeror, or sponsor with respect to that covered fund, regardless of whether the banking entity has an ownership interest in the fund. 

Federal law also limits a bank's authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons. Among other things, extensions of credit to insiders are required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons. The terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the bank's capital. 

Community Reinvestment Act 

Under the terms of the CRA as implemented by Federal Reserve regulations, an insured depository institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation to help serve the credit needs of its communities, including the extension of credit to low to moderate-income neighborhoods. When evaluating a bank&#8217;s performance under the applicable performance criteria, the FDIC assigns a rating of &#8220;outstanding&#8221;, &#8220;satisfactory&#8221;, &#8220;needs to improve&#8221; or &#8220;substantial noncompliance&#8221;. The Federal Reserve periodically evaluates the CRA performance of state member banks and takes this performance into account when reviewing applications to expand branches, relocate, add subsidiaries and affiliates, expand into new financial activities and merge with or purchase other financial institutions. Unsatisfactory CRA performance may result in the denial of such applications. 

FDIC Deposit Insurance Assessments 

The FDIC insures the Bank&#8217;s customer deposits through the DIF up to $250,000 for each depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, per ownership category. The DIF is funded mainly through quarterly assessments on member banks. The Dodd-Frank Act revised the FDIC's fund management authority by setting requirements for the Designated Reserve Ratio (reserve ratio or &#8220;DRR&#8221;) that the DIF must meet and redefining the assessment base, which is used to calculate banks' quarterly assessments. The reserve ratio is the DIF balance divided by estimated insured deposits. The Bank&#8217;s DIF quarterly assessment is calculated by multiplying its assessment base, which is defined as the average consolidated total assets less the average tangible equity of the Bank by the applicable assessment rate. The initial base assessment rate is assigned based on an institution&#8217;s capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market risk ratings, certain financial measures to assess an institution&#8217;s ability to withstand asset related stress and funding related stress, and a measure of loss severity that estimates the relative magnitude of potential losses to the FDIC in the event of the Bank&#8217;s failure. Assessment rates are subject to adjustment from the initial base assessment rate. 

In addition to the quarterly assessment, the Bank has in the past been required to pay a quarterly surcharge, along with many other banks. The Dodd-Frank Act established a minimum DRR of 1.35% and required that the FDIC return the reserve ratio to that level by September 30, 2020. In order to do so, the FDIC in 2016 required insured depository institutions with $10 billion or more in total assets, such as the Bank, to pay a quarterly surcharge equal to an annual rate of 4.5 basis points applied to the Bank&#8217;s assessment base (with certain adjustments), in addition to regular assessments. The DRR first reached 1.36% in September 2018 which exceeded the statutory required minimum of 1.35%. The temporary surcharge imposed on large banks was lifted on October 1, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, the DRR was 1.41%. The FDIA requires the FDIC's Board to set a target or DRR for the DIF annually. The FDIC views the 2.0% DRR as a long-term goal and the minimum level needed to withstand future crises of the magnitude of past crises. The FDIC has adopted a set of progressively lower assessment rates when the reserve ratios exceeds 2.0% and 2.5%. 

The FDIC may terminate a depository institution&#8217;s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution&#8217;s financial condition is unsafe or unsound, that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, or has violated any applicable rule, regulation, condition, or order imposed by the FDIC. 

Anti-Money Laundering and Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation 

The Bank Secrecy Act (&#8220;BSA&#8221;) and its implementing regulations and parallel requirements of the federal banking regulators require the Bank to maintain a risk-based Anti-Money Laundering (&#8220;AML&#8221;) program reasonably designed to prevent and detect money laundering and terrorist financing and to comply with the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the BSA, including the requirement to report suspicious activities. The Federal Reserve expects that the Bank will have an effective governance structure for the program which includes effective oversight by our Board of Directors and management. The program must include, at a minimum, a designated compliance officer, written policies, procedures and internal controls, training of appropriate personnel, and independent testing of the program and risk-based customer due diligence procedures. The U.S. Department of Treasury&#8217;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (&#8220;FinCEN&#8221;) and the federal banking agencies continue to issue regulations and guidance with respect to the application and requirements of the BSA and their expectations for effective AML programs. Banking regulators also examine banks for compliance with regulations administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;) for economic sanctions against targeted foreign countries, nationals and others. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate BSA/AML and OFAC programs, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. 

Privacy and Cybersecurity 

Several Federal statutes and regulations require state nonmember banks (and other insured depository institutions) to take several steps to protect nonpublic consumer financial information. The Bank has prepared a privacy policy, which it must disclose to consumers annually. In some cases, the Bank must obtain a consumer's consent before sharing information with an unaffiliated third party, and the Bank must allow a consumer to opt out of the Bank's sharing of information with its affiliates for marketing and certain other purposes. Additional conditions come into play in the Bank's information exchanges with credit reporting agencies. The Bank's privacy practices and the effectiveness of its systems to protect consumer privacy are one of the subjects covered in the Federal Reserve&#8217;s periodic compliance examinations. 

Consumer data privacy and data protection are also the subject of state laws. For example, on January 1, 2020, the Bank became subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (&#8220;CCPA&#8221;). This statute grants consumers several rights, including the right to request disclosure of information collected about them and whether that information has been sold or shared with others, the right to request deletion of personal information (subject to certain exceptions), and the right to opt out of the sale of their personal information. However, a consumer does not have these rights with respect to information that is collected, processed, sold, or disclosed pursuant to the GLBA. The California Attorney General has proposed but not yet finalized regulations to implement the CCPA. 

The Federal Reserve pays close attention to the cybersecurity practices of state nonmember banks and their holding companies and affiliates. The interagency council of the agencies, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, has issued several policy statements and other guidance for banks as new cybersecurity threats arise. FFIEC has recently focused on such matters as compromised customer credentials, cyber resilience and business continuity planning. Examinations by the banking agencies now include review of an institution&#8217;s information technology and its ability to thwart or mitigate cyber attacks. 

Future Legislation and Regulation 

From time to time, legislators, presidential administrations and regulators may enact rules, laws, and policies to regulate the financial services industry and public companies. Further legislative changes and additional regulations may change the Company&#8217;s operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such legislation and regulations could increase the cost of conducting business, impede the efficiency of the internal business processes, and restrict or expand the activities in which the Company may engage. The Company cannot predict whether future legislative proposals will be enacted and, if enacted, the impact they would have on the business strategy, results of operations or financial condition of the Company. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2019 , the Company had approximately 3,300 full-time equivalent employees. None of the Company&#8217;s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
