Company Overview 

East West is a bank holding company incorporated in Delaware on August 26, 1998 and is registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended.

Through over 125 locations in the U.S. and Greater China, the Company provides a full range of consumer and commercial products and services through three business segments: Consumer and Business Banking, Commercial Banking, with the remaining operations included in Other . The Company&#8217;s principal activity is lending to and accepting deposits from businesses and individuals.

Impact of COVID-19 

In December 2019, COVID-19 was reported in China, and rapidly spread to other countries, including the U.S. In March 2020, the World Health Organization (&#8220;WHO&#8221;) characterized COVID-19 as a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures. On January 31, 2020, the U.S. declared a national public health emergency, and the President announced a National Emergency on March 13, 2020. Many states and municipalities have declared emergencies as well. The COVID-19 outbreak and public health response to contain it have resulted in economic and financial market deterioration as of March 31, 2020, which did not exist at the beginning of the quarter. The recession resulting from government-mandated closures of certain businesses, and &#8220;stay-at-home&#8221; orders has significantly impacted business investment and consumer spending, and heightened volatility in the global financial markets. These conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have created financial difficulties for many of the Company&#8217;s customers and as a result, some borrowers may not be able to satisfy their obligations. Because many of the Company&#8217;s loans are secured by real estate, a potential decline in real estate markets could negatively impact the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition and the credit quality of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio, potentially increasing the level of loan charge-offs and the provision for credit losses. In the first quarter of 2020, the impact of COVID-19 pandemic was not yet evident in the Company&#8217;s balance sheet growth trends or in most of our asset quality metrics. However, the broad-based response to combat COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic impact had a material impact on the Company&#8217;s first quarter 2020 provision for credit losses. 

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (&#8220;CARES Act&#8221;) was enacted on March 27, 2020. As part of the CARES Act passed by Congress, various initiatives to protect individuals, businesses and local economies, such as the SBA Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;) were established. The Company participates in the SBA PPP, and intends to participate in additional new government-sponsored programs, as they are enacted. Through May 6, 2020, we funded over $1.84 billion of SBA-approved PPP loans to over 6,700 customers. In addition, to provide relief to customers during these turbulent times, we are providing payment accommodations for certain small-to medium-sized business, nonprofit organization and consumer customers impacted by COVID-19, and pausing action on collections and foreclosures on certain residential mortgage loans. Although we are uncertain of the full magnitude and duration of the business and economic impact from the unprecedented public health efforts to contain and combat the spread of COVID-19, we could experience material declines in revenues, profitability and/or cash flows in one or more periods in 2020, compared to the corresponding prior-year periods and compared to our expectations at the beginning of the 2020 fiscal year. Further discussion of the potential impacts on our business from the COVID-19 pandemic is provided below under Part II, Item 1A - Risk Factors . 

Accounting Standards Update 2016-13 Adoption 

On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2016-13, Financial Instruments &#8212; Credit Losses , often referred to as the current expected credit loss ("CECL") model, which establishes a single allowance framework for all financial assets carried at amortized cost, and for certain off-balance sheet exposures. Replacing the prior incurred loss model, this framework requires that management estimate credit losses over the full remaining expected life of a loan, and consider expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. The adoption of CECL increased the allowance for loan losses by $125.2 million, and the allowance for unfunded credit commitments by $10.5 million. As a result, the Company recorded an after-tax decrease to retained earnings of $98.0 million on January 1, 2020.

Tangible common equity, tangible common equity per share and adjusted efficiency ratio are non-GAAP financial measures. For a discussion of these measures, refer to Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) &#8212; Supplemental Information &#8212; Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Form 10-Q. 

(2) 

On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instrument s &#8212; Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments using the modified retrospective approach. The Company recorded an after-tax decrease to opening retained earnings of $98.0 million as of January 1, 2020. 

(3) 

The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income before provision for credit losses and noninterest income). 

Financial Highlights 

Noteworthy items about the Company&#8217;s performance for the first quarter of 2020 included: 

&#8226; 

Earnings: First quarter of 2020 net income was $144.8 million or $1.00 in diluted earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;), compared with first quarter of 2019 net income of $164.0 million or diluted EPS of $1.12 . The $19.2 million or 12% decrease in net income was primarily due to higher provision for credit losses resulting from the newly adopted CECL methodology and the deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and outlook as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

&#8226; 

Adjusted Earnings: There were no adjustments for non-recurring items during the first quarter of 2020 that affected non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS. During the first quarter of 2019 , the Company recorded a $7.0 million pre-tax or $4.9 million after-tax, impairment charge related to DC Solar and affiliates (&#8220;DC Solar&#8221;). (Refer to Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Results of Operations &#8212; Income Taxes in this Form 10-Q for a discussion related to the Company&#8217;s investment in DC Solar and see reconciliations of non-GAAP measures presented under Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Supplemental Information &#8212; Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Form 10-Q.) First quarter 2019 non-GAAP net income was $168.9 million and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.16. 

&#8226; 

Revenue: Revenue, or the sum of net interest income before provision for credit losses and noninterest income, was $416.8 million for the first quarter of 2020 , compared with $404.6 million for the first quarter of 2019 , an increase of $12.2 million or 3% . This increase was primarily due to increased noninterest income. 

&#8226; 

Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin: First quarter of 2020 net interest income was $362.7 million , compared with first quarter of 2019 net interest income of $362.5 million . First quarter of 2020 net interest margin was 3.44% , a 35 basis point decrease from 3.79% for the first quarter of 2019 . The decrease in the net interest margin reflected materially lower interest rates year-over-year, including a cumulative 225 basis points of cuts to the fed funds target rate in the second half of 2019 and in the first quarter of 2020. 

&#8226; 

Operating Efficiency: Efficiency ratio, calculated as noninterest expense divided by revenue, was 42.92% and 46.20% for the first quarters of 2020 and 2019 , respectively. Adjusting for amortization of tax credit and other investments, and core deposit intangibles, non-GAAP efficiency ratio for the first quarter of 2020 was 38.54% , a 121 basis point improvement from 39.75% for the first quarter of 2019 . (See reconciliations of non-GAAP measures presented under Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Supplemental Information &#8212; Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Form 10-Q.) 

&#8226; 

Tax: Income tax expense was $19.2 million and the effective tax rate was 11.7% for the first quarter of 2020 , compared with an income tax expense of $31.1 million and an effective tax rate of 15.9% for the first quarter of 2019 . 

&#8226; 

Profitability: First quarter of 2020 ROA was 1.30% and first quarter of 2019 ROA was 1.63% . First quarter of 2020 ROE was 11.60% and first quarter of 2019 ROE was 14.66% . Adjusting for non-recurring items, which occurred only in the first quarter of 2019, non-GAAP ROA and non-GAAP ROE for the first quarter of 2019 were 1.68% and 15.10%, respectively. (See reconciliations of non-GAAP measures presented under Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Supplemental Information &#8212; Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Form 10-Q.) 

&#8226; 

Loans: Total loans were $35.89 billion as of March 31, 2020 , an increase of $1.12 billion or 3% from $34.78 billion as of December 31, 2019 . Growth was well-diversified across commercial and industrial (&#8220;C&#38;I&#8221;), total commercial real estate (&#8220;CRE&#8221;) and residential mortgage loans. 

&#8226; 

Deposits: Total deposits were $38.69 billion as of March 31, 2020 , an increase of $1.36 billion or 4% from $37.32 billion as of December 31, 2019 . This increase was primarily driven by growth in noninterest-bearing demand deposits and money market accounts. 

&#8226; 

Asset Quality Metrics: The allowance for loan losses was $557.0 million or 1.55% of loans held-for-investment, as of March 31, 2020 , compared with $358.3 million or 1.03% of loans held-for-investment, as of December 31, 2019 . The increase in the allowance for loan losses was due to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, which increased the allowance for loan losses by $125.2 million; deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and outlook as a result of the 

COVID-19 pandemic, and loan growth. Nonperforming assets were $150.9 million or 0.33% of total assets, as of March 31, 2020 , an increase from $121.5 million , or 0.27% of total assets, as of December 31, 2019 . First quarter 2020 net charge-offs were $898 thousand , or annualized 0.01% of average loans held-for-investment, compared with $14.4 million , or annualized 0.18% of average loans held-for-investment, for the first quarter of 2019 .

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income 

The Company&#8217;s primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the interest income earned on interest-earning assets less interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average interest-earning assets. Net interest income and net interest margin are impacted by several factors, including changes in average balances and composition of interest-earning assets and funding sources, market interest rate fluctuations and the slope of the yield curve, repricing characteristics and maturity of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, volume of noninterest-bearing sources of funds, and asset quality. 

First quarter of 2020 net interest income was $362.7 million , an increase of $246 thousand or 0.07% , compared with $362.5 million for the first quarter of 2019 . This slight increase in net interest income reflected loan growth and a decrease in the average cost of funds, which was nearly offset by the year-over-year decline in interest-earning asset yields. First quarter of 2020 net interest margin was 3.44% , a 35 basis point decrease from 3.79% for the first quarter of 2019 . 

The average loan yield for the first quarter of 2020 was 4.71% , a 59 basis point decrease from 5.30% for the first quarter of 2019 . This decrease, compared with the same period a year ago, reflected the downward repricing of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio in response to materially lower interest rates. As of March 31, 2020, approximately 69% of total loans were variable-rate or hybrid in their adjustable rate period. First quarter of 2020 average loans were $35.15 billion , an increase of $2.74 billion or 8% from $32.41 billion for the first quarter of 2019 . Average loan growth was broad-based across all commercial loan categories and single-family residential loans. 

First quarter of 2020 average interest-earning assets were $42.36 billion , an increase of $3.62 billion or 9% from $38.75 billion for the first quarter of 2019 . This was primarily due to increase s of $2.74 billion in average loans and $632.4 million in AFS debt securities. 

Deposits are an important source of funds and impact both net interest income and net interest margin. Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits totaled $11.12 billion for the first quarter of 2020 , compared with $10.07 billion for the first quarter of 2019 , an increase of $1.05 billion or 10% . Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits comprised 30% and 29% of average total deposits for the first quarters of 2020 and 2019 , respectively. Average interest-bearing deposits of $26.36 billion for the first quarter of 2020 increased by $1.50 billion or 6% from $24.85 billion for the first quarter of 2019 . 

The average cost of funds was 0.90% for the first quarter of 2020 , a decrease of 25 basis points from 1.15% for the first quarter of 2019 . The decrease in the average cost of funds reflects the cumulative 225 basis points of cuts to the target fed funds rate in the second half of 2019 and in the first quarter of 2020. The average cost of deposits was 0.82% for the first quarter of 2020 , a decrease of 25 basis points from 1.07% for the first quarter of 2019 . The average cost of interest-bearing deposits decrease d 33 basis points to 1.17% for the first quarter of 2020 , from 1.50% for the first quarter of 2019 . Other sources of funding included in the calculation of the average cost of funds consist of FHLB advances, securities sold under repurchase agreements (&#8220;repurchase agreements&#8221;) and long-term debt. 

The Company utilizes various tools to manage interest rate risk. Refer to Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Risk Management &#8212; Market Risk Management in this Form 10-Q.

Noninterest income comprised 13% and 10% of total revenue for the first quarters of 2020 and 2019 , respectively. First quarter of 2020 noninterest income was $54.0 million , an increase of $11.9 million or 28% , compared with $42.1 million for the same period in 2019 . This increase was primarily due to increase s in interest rate contracts and other derivative income, foreign exchange income, wealth management fees, and other income. The following discussion provides the composition of the major changes in noninterest income. 

Foreign exchange income increase d by $2.8 million or 56% from the first quarter of 2019 to $7.8 million for the first quarter of 2020 . The increase was primarily driven by the favorable revaluation of certain foreign currency-denominated balance sheet items, partially offset by losses on foreign exchange transactions. 

Wealth management fees increase d by $1.5 million or 41% from the first quarter of 2019 to $5.4 million for the first quarter of 2020 . The increase was driven by higher customer activity. 

Interest rate contracts and other derivative income increase d $3.9 million or 120% to $7.1 million for the first quarter of 2020 . This increase reflected strong customer demand for interest rate swaps in response to interest rate volatility, partially offset by a negative credit valuation adjustment related to interest rate derivative contracts, reflecting the year-over-year decline in long-term interest rates. 

Other income increase d by $1.2 million or 61% from the first quarter of 2019 to $3.2 million for the first quarter of 2020 . The increase was driven by a gain recognized on the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance policies.

First quarter 2020 noninterest expense was $178.9 million , a decrease of $8.0 million or 4% , compared with $186.9 million for the same period in 2019 . This decrease was primarily due to decreases in amortization of tax credit and other investments, and other operating expense. 

Other operating expense primarily consists of loan related expenses, marketing, telecommunications and postage, travel, charitable contributions, and other miscellaneous expense categories. The $1.2 million or 5% decrease to $21.1 million for the first quarter of 2020 , was primarily due to decreases in marketing, other miscellaneous and travel expenses, partially offset by an increase in loan related expenses. 

Amortization of tax credit and other investments decrease d $7.6 million or 30% to $17.3 million for the first quarter of 2020 , compared with the first quarter of 2019 . In the first quarter of 2019 , the Company fully wrote off the tax credit investments related to DC Solar and recorded a $7.0 million impairment charge, which was included in Amortization of tax credit and other investments. There was no such impairment in the current period.

The income tax expense was $19.2 million and the effective tax rate was 11.7% in the first quarter of 2020 , compared with an income tax expense of $31.1 million and an effective tax rate of 15.9% for the first quarter of 2019 . A year-over-year increase in tax credits recognized from investments in renewable energy and solar tax credit projects, and a decrease in income before income taxes contributed to the lower effective tax rate during the three months ended March 31, 2020. 

Impact of Investment in DC Solar Tax Credit Funds 

The Company invested in four solar energy tax credit funds in the years 2014, 2015, 2017 and 2018 as a limited member. These tax credit funds engaged in the acquisition and leasing of mobile solar generators through DC Solar entities. Investors in DC Solar funds, including the Company, received tax credits for making renewable energy investments. Between 2014 and 2018, the Company had claimed energy tax credits of approximately $53.9 million , partially reduced by a deferred tax liability of $5.7 million related to the 50% tax basis reduction, for a net impact of $48.2 million to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During the first quarter of 2019, the Company fully wrote off its tax credit investments related to DC Solar and recorded a $7.0 million other-than-temporary impairment (&#8220;OTTI&#8221;) charge within Amortization of tax credit and other investments on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The Company concluded at that time that there would be no material future cash flows related to these investments, in part because DC Solar has ceased operations and its bankruptcy case had been converted from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7 on March 22, 2019. During the second quarter of 2019, the Company concluded that a portion of the previously claimed tax credits would be recaptured, and reversed $33.6 million of the $53.9 million previously claimed tax credits, and $3.5 million out of the $5.7 million deferred tax liability, resulting in $30.1 million of additional tax expense. For additional information related to DC solar, refer to Note 8 &#8212; Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Partnerships, Tax Credit and Other Investments, Net and Variable Interest Entities and Note 14 &#8212; Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company&#8217;s 2019 Form 10-K. 

Tax Impact of CARES Act 

On March 27, 2020, the President signed the CARES Act, a $2.2 trillion economic stimulus bill to help individuals and businesses that have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. Among other provisions, the CARES Act allows net operating losses, which were modified with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, to be carried back five years. It also modifies the useful lives of qualified leasehold improvements, relaxing the excess loss limitations on pass-through and increasing the interest expense limitation. The Company does not expect the CARES Act to have a material tax impact on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Operating Segment Results 

The Company organizes its operations into three reportable operating segments: (1) Consumer and Business Banking; (2) Commercial Banking; and (3) Other. These segments are defined by the type of customers served and the related products and services provided. The segments reflect how financial information is currently evaluated by management. For additional description of the Company&#8217;s internal management reporting process, including the segment cost allocation methodology, see Note 15 &#8212; Business Segments to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

Net interest income before provision for credit losses of each segment represents the difference between actual interest income earned on loans and interest expense paid on customer deposits of the segment, adjusted for funding charges for loans or funding credits for deposits through the Company&#8217;s internal funds transfer pricing (&#8220;FTP&#8221;) process. During the third quarter of 2019, the Company enhanced its FTP methodology related to deposits by setting a minimum floor rate for the FTP credits for deposits in consideration of the flattened and inverted yield curve. This methodology has been retrospectively applied to the segment financial results for the first quarter of 2019 .

Consumer and Business Banking 

The Consumer and Business Banking segment primarily provides financial products and services to consumer and commercial customers through the Company&#8217;s domestic branch network. This segment offers consumer and commercial deposits, mortgage and home equity loans, and other products and services. It also originates commercial loans for small and medium-sized enterprises through the Company&#8217;s branch network. Other products and services provided by this segment include wealth management, treasury management and foreign exchange services. 

First quarter of 2020 net interest income before provision for credit losses for this segment was $152.6 million , a decrease of $32.5 million or 18% , compared with $185.1 million for the same period in 2019. Year-over-year, interest income earned on loans increased by 1%, driven by average loan growth that was nearly entirely offset by a decrease in average loan yields; interest expense paid on deposits decreased by 19%, driven by a decline in the average cost of deposits; FTP funding charges assessed for loans decreased, reflecting a decline in the loans FTP rate, and FTP credits received for deposits also decreased, reflecting a decline in the deposits FTP rate. Combined, these factors drove the 18% year-over-year decrease in segment net interest income before provision for credit losses, with the largest driver of the negative variance being lower FTP credits received for deposits. 

Average loans for this segment were $11.27 billion , an increase of $917.7 million or 9% from $10.35 billion for the same period in 2019, primarily driven by an increase in single-family residential loans. Average deposits for this segment were $25.59 billion , essentially flat compared with average deposits of $25.05 billion for the same period in 2019. 

Commercial Banking 

The Commercial Banking segment primarily generates commercial loans and deposits. Commercial loan products include commercial business loans and lines of credit, trade finance loans and letters of credit, CRE loans, construction and land lending, affordable housing loans and letters of credit, asset-based lending, and equipment financing. Commercial deposit products and other financial services include treasury management, foreign exchange services, and interest rate and commodity risk hedging. 

The Commercial Banking segment reported segment net income of $57.1 million for the first quarter of 2020, compared with $62.3 million for the same period in 2019. The $5.2 million or 8% decrease in segment net income reflected an increase in provision for credit losses, partially offset by increases in net interest income before provision for credit losses and noninterest income. First quarter 2020 provision for credit losses was $66.1 million , an increase of $46.5 million or 238% , compared with $19.6 million for the same period in 2019. This increase was primarily due to the deterioration in macroeconomic conditions and outlook as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic during the first quarter of 2020. 

Net interest income before provision for credit losses for this segment was $183.5 million , an increase of $30.8 million or 20% compared with $152.7 million for the same period in 2019. Year-over-year, interest income earned on loans decreased by 5%, driven by a decrease in average loan yields, which more than offset income growth from average loan growth; interest expense paid on deposits decreased by 14%, driven by a decline in the average cost of deposits; FTP funding charges assessed for loans decreased, reflecting a decline in the loans FTP rate, and FTP credits received for deposits also decreased, reflecting a decline in the deposits FTP rate. Combined, these factors drove the 20% year-over-year increase in segment net interest income before provision for credit losses, with the largest driver of the positive variance being lower FTP funding charges assessed for loans. 

Average loans for this segment were $23.88 billion , an increase of $1.82 billion or 8% from $22.06 billion for the same period in 2019, primarily driven by growth in CRE loans. Average deposits for this segment were $9.18 billion , an increase of $1.16 billion or 14% from $8.02 billion for the same period in 2019, primarily driven by growth in time deposits and noninterest-bearing demand deposits. 

First quarter 2020 noninterest income was $32.5 million , an increase of $8.0 million or 32% , compared with $24.5 million for the same period in 2019. This increase was mainly attributable to increases in interest rate contracts and other derivative income and foreign exchange income. The increase in interest rate contracts and other derivative income was driven by strong customer demand for interest rate swaps in response to manage risk associated with increased interest rate volatility, partially offset by a negative credit valuation adjustment of related derivative products. The increase in foreign exchange income was primarily driven by favorable revaluation of certain foreign currency-denominated balance sheet items and an increased volume of foreign exchange transactions. 

Other 

Centralized functions, including the corporate treasury activities of the Company and eliminations of inter-segment amounts, have been aggregated and included in the Other segment, which provides broad administrative support to the two core segments, namely the Consumer and Business Banking and the Commercial Banking segments. 

The Other segment reported segment income before income taxes of $10.0 million and segment net income of $34.5 million for the first quarter of 2020, reflecting an income tax benefit of $24.5 million . The Other segment reported segment income before income taxes of $37 thousand and segment net income of $24.5 million for the first quarter of 2019, reflecting an income tax benefit of $24.5 million . The increase in segment income before income taxes was primarily driven by a decrease in noninterest expense. First quarter of 2020 noninterest expense was $21.8 million , a decrease of $6.7 million or 23% , compared with $28.5 million for the same period in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in amortization of tax credit and other investments, which was elevated by a nonrecurring pre-tax impairment charge of $7.0 million related to DC Solar during the first quarter of 2019. 

The income tax expense or benefit in the Other segment consists of the remaining unallocated income tax expense or benefit after allocating income tax expense to the two core segments. Income tax expense is allocated to the Consumer and Business Banking and the Commercial Banking segments by applying statutory income tax rates to the segment income before income taxes.

As of March 31, 2020 , total assets were $45.95 billion , an increase of $1.75 billion or 4% from December 31, 2019 , primarily due to loan growth and an increase in AFS debt securities. The loan growth was driven by strong increases in C&#38;I, CRE, as well as single-family residential loans. 

As of March 31, 2020 , total liabilities were $41.05 billion , an increase of $1.87 billion or 5% from December 31, 2019 , primarily due to an increase in deposits, which was largely driven by increases in noninterest-bearing demand and money market accounts. 

As of March 31, 2020 , total stockholders&#8217; equity was $4.90 billion , a decrease of $114.6 million or 2% from December 31, 2019 . This decrease was primarily driven by stock repurchase transactions and a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings due to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, partially offset by first quarter of 2020 net income. 

Debt Securities 

The Company maintains a debt securities portfolio that consists of high quality and liquid securities with relatively short durations to minimize overall interest rate and liquidity risks. The Company&#8217;s AFS debt securities provide: 

&#8226; 

interest income for earnings and yield enhancement; 

&#8226; 

availability for funding needs arising during the normal course of business; 

&#8226; 

the ability to execute interest rate risk management strategies in response to changes in economic or market conditions; and 

&#8226; 

collateral to support pledging agreements as required and/or to enhance the Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity. 

Available-for-Sale Debt Securities 

As of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , the Company&#8217;s AFS debt securities portfolio primarily consisted of mortgage-backed securities and debt securities issued by U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, foreign bonds, collateralized loan obligations (&#8220;CLOs&#8221;), and U.S. Treasury securities. Debt securities classified as AFS are carried at their fair value with the corresponding changes in fair value recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax , as a component of Stockholders&#8217; equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

(1) There were no securities of a single non-governmental agency issuer that exceeded 10% of stockholder&#8217;s equity as of both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. 

The fair value of AFS debt securities totaled $3.70 billion as of March 31, 2020 , compared with $3.32 billion as of December 31, 2019 . The $378.7 million or 11% increase was primarily attributable to the purchases of U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities, and municipal securities; partially offset by the sales, repayments, and maturities of U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities, U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise debt securities, foreign bonds, and U.S treasury securities. 

The Company&#8217;s debt securities portfolio had an effective duration of 2.7 years as of March 31, 2020 , which shortened from 3.1 years as of December 31, 2019 , primarily due to the decline in interest rates. In addition, the spread between central government-guaranteed securities and private issuers widened, as relatively higher risk premiums were paid for securities issued by private entities. As of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , 96% and 97% , respectively, of the carrying value of the Company&#8217;s debt securities portfolio was rated &#8220;AA-&#8221; or &#8220;Aa3&#8221; or higher by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. Credit ratings of BBB- or higher by Standard and Poor&#8217;s (&#8220;S&#38;P&#8221;) and Fitch Ratings (&#8220;Fitch&#8221;), or Baa3 or higher by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service (&#8220;Moody&#8217;s&#8221;), are considered investment grade. 

The Company&#8217;s AFS debt securities are carried at fair value with noncredit-related unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in Other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. If a credit loss exists, the Company records impairment related to credit losses through allowance for credit losses with a corresponding Provision for credit losses on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Pre-tax net unrealized gains on AFS debt securities were $35.5 million as of March 31, 2020 , which improved from net unrealized losses of $3.4 million as of December 31, 2019 . This change was primarily due to the decrease in interest rates during the period, partially offset by increased spreads. 

Gross unrealized losses on AFS debt securities totaled $48.8 million as of March 31, 2020 , compared with $23.2 million as of December 31, 2019 . Of the securities with gross unrealized losses, substantially all were rated investment grade as of both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , as classified primarily based upon the lowest of the credit ratings issued by S&#38;P, Moody&#8217;s, or Fitch. The Company believes that the gross unrealized losses were due to non-credit related factors and the gross unrealized losses across all major security types were primarily attributable to widened spreads arising from the negative outlook and uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and yield curve movement. The Company believes that the credit support levels of the AFS debt securities are strong and, based on current assessments and macroeconomic forecasts, expects that full contractual cash flows will be received, even if the credit performance deteriorates from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agencies are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, and the U.S. government-sponsored debt securities have the implicit guarantee of the U.S. government. Further, the Company&#8217;s portfolio of debt securities issued by supranational organizations are AAA-rated and have strong financial profiles. Based on current assessments and economic outcome expectations, the Company believes that the private entity issuers of CLOs, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities continue to have strong credit profiles or have issued securities with strong credit profiles, and that the securities issued by municipalities continue to have strong credit profiles. 

As of March 31, 2020 , the Company had no intention to sell securities with unrealized losses and believed it is more-likely-than-not that it would not be required to sell such securities before recovery of their amortized cost. The Company assesses individual securities for credit losses for each reporting period. There were no credit losses recognized in earnings for the first quarter of 2020 , and no OTTI credit losses recognized in earnings for the first quarter of 2019 . For additional information of the Company&#8217;s accounting policies, valuation and composition, see Note 3 &#8212; Fair Value Measurement and Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Note 5 &#8212; Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

The following table presents the weighted-average yields and contractual maturity distribution, excluding periodic principal payments, of the Company&#8217;s debt securities as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . Actual maturities of mortgage-backed securities can differ from contractual maturities as the borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties. In addition, factors such as prepayments and interest rates may affect the yields on the carrying values of mortgage-backed securities.

(1) 

On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13. Total loans include net deferred loan fees, unearned fees, unamortized premiums and unaccreted discounts of $(50.3) million and $(43.2) million as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. 

(2) 

Consists of single-family residential loans as of both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . 

Commercial 

The commercial loan portfolio, which comprised 75% of total loans as of both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , is discussed as follows. 

Commercial &#8212; Commercial and Industrial Loans. C&#38;I loans totaled $12.59 billion and $12.15 billion as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively, and accounted for 35% of total loans as of both dates. The majority of the C&#38;I loans have variable interest rates. The C&#38;I loan portfolio includes loans and financing for businesses in a wide spectrum of industries, and includes asset-based lending, equipment financing and leasing, project-based finance, revolving lines of credit, SBA lending, structured finance, term loans and trade finance. The Company also had a portfolio of broadly syndicated C&#38;I loans, comprised primarily of Term B loans, which totaled $962.1 million and $894.6 million as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. 

The C&#38;I portfolio is well-diversified by industry. The Company monitors the concentrations within the C&#38;I loan portfolio by customer exposure and industry classification, setting diversification targets and limits for specialized underwriting portfolios. The Company&#8217;s exposure to C&#38;I borrowers that are potentially more impacted by the economic disruption stemming from COVID-19 pandemic include those in the travel and leisure, hospitality, restaurant and restaurant supply industries. These exposures are included in the Other C&#38;I category in the graphs below. Combined, these industries represented 4% of total C&#38;I loans as of both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . There were no industry concentrations exceeding 10% of total loans as of both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . 

Oil &#38; gas loans comprised 11% of C&#38;I loans and 4% of total loans as of both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . As of March 31, 2020, oil &#38; gas total loans outstanding were $1.37 billion and total exposure, including unfunded commitments, amounted to $1.77 billion. Based on total exposure, 64% of the oil &#38; gas portfolio was reserve-based lending to upstream (exploration and production) companies, 27% was to midstream and downstream companies, and 9% was to companies in oilfield services and other. The oil &#38; gas lending portfolio is geographically diversified. The production mix of upstream borrowers was approximately 61% oil, 29% gas and 10% natural gas liquids in 2019. The majority of the upstream borrowers had commodity hedges in place for 2020 to hedge against the fluctuation in oil and gas prices. The COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the high volatility and downward pressure on oil and gas prices, has impacted the credit risk of the oil &#38; gas industry sector. Accordingly, the Company increased its allowance for loan loss coverage against the oil &#38; gas portfolio to 8% as of March 31, 2020 , up from 5% as of December 31, 2019 . 

Commercial &#8212; Total Commercial Real Estate Portfolio. The total CRE loan portfolio, which consists of income-producing CRE, multifamily residential, and construction and land loans, totaled $14.19 billion and $13.76 billion as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively, accounting for 40% of total loans as of both dates. 

As of March 31, 2020 , the average loan size of total CRE loans was $2.3 million and the weighted-average loan-to-value (&#8220;LTV&#8221;) ratio was 51%. As of December 31, 2019 , the average loan size of total CRE loans was $2.1 million and the weighted-average LTV ratio was 50%. The consistency of the Company&#8217;s low LTV underwriting standards have resulted in historically lower levels of credit losses in the income-producing CRE and multifamily residential loans. 

The Company&#8217;s total CRE portfolio is broadly diversified by property type, which serves to mitigate some of the geographical concentration in California. The following table summarizes the Company&#8217;s total CRE loan portfolio by property type as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 : &#160;

Changes in California&#8217;s economy and real estate values could have a significant impact on the collectability of these loans and the required level of allowance for loan losses.

Loans net of ASC 310-30 discount. 

Consumer &#8212; Single-Family Residential Loans. Single-family residential loans totaled $7.40 billion and $7.11 billion as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively, and accounted for 20% of total loans as of both dates. The Company was in a first lien position for virtually all single-family residential loans as of both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . Many of these loans are reduced documentation loans where a substantial down payment is required, resulting in a low LTV ratio at origination, typically 60% or less. These loans have historically experienced low delinquency and loss rates. As of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , 57% and 58% of the Company&#8217;s single-family residential loans, respectively, were concentrated in California. The Company offers a variety of first lien mortgage loan programs, including fixed- and variable-rate loans, as well as hybrid loans with interest rates that adjust annually after an initial fixed rate period. 

Consumer &#8212; Home Equity Lines of Credit. HELOCs totaled $1.45 billion and $1.47 billion as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively, and accounted for 4% of total loans as of both dates. The Company was in a first lien position for 84% of total HELOCs as of both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . Many of the loans within this portfolio are reduced documentation loans, where a substantial down payment is required, resulting in a low LTV ratio at origination, typically 60% or less. These loans have historically experienced low delinquency and loss rates. As of both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , 69% of the Company&#8217;s HELOCs were concentrated in California. The HELOC portfolio is comprised largely of variable-rate loans. 

All commercial and consumer loans originated are subject to the Company&#8217;s underwriting guidelines and loan origination standards. Management believes that the Company&#8217;s underwriting criteria and procedures adequately consider the unique risks associated with these products. The Company conducts a variety of quality control procedures and periodic audits, including the review of lending and legal requirements, to ensure that the Company is in compliance with these requirements. 

Purchased Credit-Deteriorated Loans 

The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 using the prospective transition approach for purchased credit deterioration (&#8220;PCD&#8221;) loans that were previously classified as purchased credit impaired (&#8220;PCI&#8221;) and accounted for under ASC 310-30. On January 1, 2020, the amortized cost basis of the PCD loans was adjusted to reflect the $1.2 million addition of allowance for loan losses. The Company did not acquire any PCD loans during the first quarter of 2020. For additional details regarding PCD loans, see Note 2 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7 &#8212; Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, the carrying value of PCI loans totaled $222.9 million as of December 31, 2019 . 

Loans Held-for-Sale 

As of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , loans held-for-sale totaled $1.6 million and $434 thousand , respectively, and consisted of single-family residential loans. At the time of commitment to originate or purchase a loan, a loan is determined to be held-for-investment if it is the Company&#8217;s intent to hold the loan to maturity or for the &#8220;foreseeable future,&#8221; subject to periodic reviews under the Company&#8217;s evaluation processes, including liquidity and credit risk management. If the Company subsequently changes its intent to hold certain loans, those loans are transferred from held-for-investment to held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value. 

Loan Purchases, Transfers and Sales 

All loans originated by the Company are underwritten pursuant to the Company&#8217;s policies and procedures. Although the Company&#8217;s primary focus is on directly originated loans, in certain circumstances the Company also purchases loans and participates in loans with other banks. The Company also participates out interests in commercial loans to other financial institutions and sells loans in the normal course of business. 

The following tables provide information on loan purchases, transfers and sales during the first quarters of 2020 and 2019 :

Deposits 

The Company offers a wide variety of deposit products to both consumer and commercial customers. The Company&#8217;s deposit strategy is to grow and retain relationship-based deposits, which provides a stable and low-cost source of funding and liquidity to the Company. 

Total deposits were $38.69 billion as of March 31, 2020 , an increase of $1.36 billion or 4% from $37.32 billion as of December 31, 2019 .This growth was primarily due to a $753.4 million or 7% increase in noninterest-bearing demand and a $590.3 million or 7% increase in money market, partially offset by a $247.8 million or 2% decrease in time deposits. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits comprised 30% of total deposits as of both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . Additional information regarding the impact of deposits on net interest income and a comparison of average deposit balances and rates are provided in Item 2. MD&#38;A &#8212; Results of Operations &#8212; Net Interest Income in this Form 10-Q. 

Other Funds 

The Company&#8217;s other sources of funding consist of short-term borrowings, FHLB advances, repurchase agreements and long-term debt. 

The Company had $66.9 million of short-term borrowings outstanding as of March 31, 2020 , compared with $28.7 million as of December 31, 2019 . This funding was entered into by the Company&#8217;s subsidiary, East West Bank (China) Limited, and will mature in 2020 and the first quarter of 2021. As of March 31, 2020 , short-term borrowings had fixed interest rates ranging from 3.65% to 3.73% . 

FHLB advances were $646.3 million as of March 31, 2020 , a decrease of $99.6 million or 13% from $745.9 million as of December 31, 2019 . As of March 31, 2020 , FHLB advances had fixed and floating interest rates ranging from 1.18% to 2.34% with remaining maturities between 1.1 years and 2.6 years. 

Gross repurchase agreements totaled $450.0 million as of both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . Resale and repurchase agreements are reported net, pursuant to ASC 210-20-45-11, Balance Sheet Offsetting: Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements . As of March 31, 2020 , the Company did not have gross resale agreements that were eligible for netting pursuant to ASC 210-20-45-11. In comparison, net repurchase agreements totaled $200.0 million as of December 31, 2019 , after netting $250.0 million of gross repurchase agreements against gross resale agreements. As of March 31, 2020 , gross repurchase agreements had interest rates ranging from 3.23% to 4.06% , original terms between 4.0 years and 9.0 years and remaining maturities between 2.6 years and 3.4 years. 

Repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and recorded as liabilities based on the values at which the securities are sold. As of March 31, 2020 , the collateral for the repurchase agreements was comprised of U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities. To ensure the market value of the underlying collateral remains sufficient, the Company monitors the fair value of collateral pledged relative to the principal amounts borrowed under repurchase agreements. The Company manages liquidity risks related to the repurchase agreements by sourcing funds from a diverse group of counterparties and entering into repurchase agreements with longer durations, when appropriate. For additional details, see Note 4 &#8212; Securities Purchased under Resale Agreements and Sold under Repurchase Agreements to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

The Company uses long-term debt to provide funding to acquire interest-earning assets, as well as to enhance liquidity and regulatory capital. Long-term debt totaled $147.2 million and $147.1 million as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. Long-term debt is comprised of junior subordinated debt, which qualifies as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes. The junior subordinated debt was issued in connection with the Company&#8217;s various pooled trust preferred securities offerings and includes the value of the common stock issued by six wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company in conjunction with these offerings. The junior subordinated debt had a weighted-average interest rate of 3.13% and 4.30% for the first quarters of 2020 and 2019 , respectively, with remaining maturities ranging between 14.7 years and 17.5 years as of March 31, 2020 . 

Foreign Outstandings 

The Company&#8217;s overseas offices, which include the branch in Hong Kong and the subsidiary bank in China, are subject to the general risks inherent in conducting business in foreign countries, such as regulations, or economic and political uncertainties. In addition, the Company&#8217;s financial assets held in the Hong Kong branch and the subsidiary bank in China may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors. The Company&#8217;s country risk exposure is largely concentrated in China and Hong Kong. The following table presents the major financial assets held in the Company&#8217;s overseas offices as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 :

Capital 

The Company maintains a strong capital base to support its anticipated asset growth, operating needs and credit risks, and to ensure that the Company and the Bank are in compliance with all regulatory capital guidelines. The Company engages in regular capital planning processes on at least an annual basis to optimize the use of available capital and to appropriately plan for future capital needs, allocating capital to existing and future business activities. Furthermore, the Company conducts capital stress tests as part of its capital planning process. The stress tests enable the Company to assess the impact of adverse changes in the economy and interest rates on its capital base. 

In March 2020, the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of the Company&#8217;s common stock. This $500.0 million repurchase authorization is inclusive of the Company&#8217;s $100.0 million stock repurchase authorization previously outstanding. The Company determines the timing and amount of repurchases, based on its assessment of various factors, including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity and the economic environment. The Company repurchased 4,471,682 shares at a total cost of $146.0 million during the first quarter of 2020 . The Company's total remaining available share repurchase authorization as of March 31, 2020 was $354.0 million . 

The Company&#8217;s stockholders&#8217; equity was $4.90 billion as of March 31, 2020 , a $114.6 million or 2% decrease from $5.02 billion as of December 31, 2019 . The decrease in the Company&#8217;s stockholders&#8217; equity was primarily due to share repurchase activity of $146.0 million; a decrease in opening retained earnings of $98.0 million as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-13, and cash dividends declared of $40.5 million during the first quarter of 2020 , offset by first quarter 2020 net income of $144.8 million . For other factors that contributed to the changes in stockholders&#8217; equity, refer to Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements &#8212; Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders&#8217; Equit y in this Form 10-Q. 

Book value was $34.67 per common share as of March 31, 2020 , compared with $34.46 per common share as of December 31, 2019 . The Company paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.275 and $0.230 per common share for the first quarters of 2020 and 2019 , respectively. In April 2020 , the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors declared second quarter 2020 cash dividends of $0.275 per common share. The dividend will be paid on May 15, 2020 to stockholders of record as of May 4, 2020 . 

Regulatory Capital and Ratios 

The federal banking agencies have risk-based capital adequacy guidelines intended to ensure that banking organizations maintain capital that is commensurate with the degree of risk associated with a banking organization&#8217;s operations. See Item 1. Business &#8212; Supervision and Regulation &#8212; Capital Requirements of the Company&#8217;s 2019 Form 10-K for additional details. 

The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020. The Company has elected the phase-in option provided by regulatory guidance, which delays the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital for two years and phases the impact over three years beginning in 2022. As a result, the March 31, 2020 ratios exclude the impact of the increased allowance for credit losses. The following table presents the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s capital ratios as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 under the Basel III Capital Rules, and those required by regulatory agencies for capital adequacy and well-capitalized classification purposes:

As of January 1, 2019, the 2.5% capital conservation buffer above the minimum capital ratios is required in order to avoid limitations on distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. 

The Company is committed to maintaining strong capital levels to assure the Company&#8217;s investors, customers and regulators that the Company and the Bank are financially sound. As of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , both the Company and the Bank continued to exceed all &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; capital requirements and the fully phased-in required minimum capital requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules. Total risk-weighted assets were $36.55 billion as of March 31, 2020 , an increase of $1.41 billion or 4% from $35.14 billion as of December 31, 2019 . The increase in the risk-weighted assets was primarily due to loan growth and an increase in derivative fair values. 

Other Matters 

LIBOR Transition 

On July 27, 2017 , the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;), announced that it will no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. Given LIBOR&#8217;s extensive use across financial markets, the transition away from LIBOR presents various risks and challenges to financial markets and institutions, including to the Company. The Company&#8217;s commercial and consumer businesses issue, trade, and hold various products that are currently indexed to LIBOR. A portion of the Company&#8217;s loans, derivatives, debt securities, resale agreements, FHLB advances, and deposits, as well as junior subordinated debt and repurchase agreements are indexed to LIBOR and mature after 2021. The volume of the Company&#8217;s products that are indexed to LIBOR is significant, and if not sufficiently planned for, the discontinuation of LIBOR could result in financial, operational, legal, reputational or compliance risks. 

The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (&#8220;ARRC&#8221;) has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. In early 2019, the ARRC released final recommended fallback contract language for new issuances of LIBOR indexed bilateral business loans, syndicated loans, floating-rate notes and securitizations. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. is in the process of developing detailed guidance on fallback contract language. 

The Company has been closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19 and any potential delay in the cessation of LIBOR. Although the Financial Conduct Authority has expressed that it is assessing the potential impacts of COVID-19 on transition timelines, the target date currently remains unchanged. 

Due to the uncertainty surrounding the future of LIBOR, the transition is anticipated to span several reporting periods through the end of 2021, unless there is a delay in the cessation of LIBOR due to impacts of COVID-19. Certain actions already taken by the Company related to the transition of LIBOR include (1) establishing a cross-functional team to identify, assess and monitor risks associated with the transition of LIBOR and other benchmark rates, (2) developing an inventory of LIBOR indexed products, and (3) implementing more robust fallback contract language for new loans, which identifies LIBOR cessation trigger events, provides for an alternative index and permits an adjustment to the margin as applicable. The Company continues to monitor this activity and evaluate the related risks. The Company&#8217;s cross-functional team also manages communication of the Company&#8217;s transition plans with both internal and external stakeholders and ensures that the Company appropriately updates its business processes, analytical tools, information systems and contract language to minimize disruption during and after the LIBOR transition. For additional information related to the potential impact surrounding the transition from LIBOR on the Company&#8217;s business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company&#8217;s 2019 Form 10-K. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the course of the Company&#8217;s business, the Company may enter into or be a party to transactions that are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are considered to be off-balance sheet arrangements. Off-balance sheet arrangements are any contractual arrangements to which a nonconsolidated entity is a party and under which the Company has: (1) any obligation under a guarantee contract; (2) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets; (3) any obligation under certain derivative instruments; or (4) any obligation under a material variable interest held by the Company in a nonconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the Company. 

Commitments to Extend Credit 

As a financial service provider, the Company routinely enters into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, commercial letters of credit for foreign and domestic trade, standby letters of credit (&#8220;SBLCs&#8221;) and financial guarantees to meet the financing needs of our customers. Many of these commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. The credit policies used in underwriting loans to customers are also used to extend these commitments. Under some of these contractual agreements, the Company may also have liabilities contingent upon the occurrence of certain events. The Company&#8217;s liquidity sources have been, and are expected to be, sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its lending activities. Information about the Company&#8217;s loan commitments, commercial letters of credit and SBLCs is provided in Note 10 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

Guarantees 

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into various guarantee agreements in which the Company sells or securitizes loans with recourse. Under these guarantee arrangements, the Company is contingently obligated to repurchase the recourse component of the loans when the loans default. Additional information regarding guarantees is provided in Note 10 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

A discussion of significant contractual arrangements under which the Company may be held contingently liable is included in Note 10 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. In addition, the Company has commitments and obligations under post-retirement benefit plans as described in Note 17 &#8212; Employee Benefit Plans to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company&#8217;s 2019 Form 10-K, and has contractual obligations for future payments on debts, borrowings and lease obligations as detailed in Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations of the Company&#8217;s 2019 Form 10-K. 

Risk Management 

Overview 

In the course of conducting its businesses, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent to the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to the Company&#8217;s businesses. The Company operates under a Board approved enterprise risk management (&#8220;ERM&#8221;) framework, which outlines its company-wide approach to risk management and oversight and describes the structures and practices employed to manage the current and emerging risks inherent to the Company. The Company&#8217;s ERM program incorporates risk management throughout the organization in identifying, managing, monitoring, and reporting risks. It identifies the Company&#8217;s major risk categories as capital risk, strategic risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk, operational risk, reputational risk, and legal and compliance risk. 

The Board of Directors monitors the ERM program to ensure independent review and oversight of the Company&#8217;s risk appetite and control environment. The Risk Oversight Committee provides focused oversight of the Company&#8217;s identified enterprise risk categories on behalf of the full Board of Directors. Under the direction of the Risk Oversight Committee, management committees apply targeted strategies to reduce the risks to which the Company&#8217;s operations are exposed. 

The Company&#8217;s ERM program is executed along the three lines of defense model, which provides for a consistent and standardized risk management control environment across the enterprise. The first line of defense is comprised of production, operational, and support units. The second line of defense is comprised of various risk management and control functions charged with monitoring and managing specific major risk categories and/or risk subcategories. The third line of defense is comprised of the Internal Audit function and Independent Asset Review. Internal Audit provides assurance and evaluates the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes as established by the Company. Internal Audit has organizational independence and objectivity, reporting directly to the Board&#8217;s Audit Committee. Further discussion and analyses of each major risk area are included in the following sub-sections of Risk Management. 

Credit Risk Management 

Credit risk is the risk that a borrower or counterparty will fail to perform according to terms and conditions of a loan or investment and expose the Company to loss. Credit risk exists with many of our assets and exposures such as loans and certain derivatives. The majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities. 

The Risk Oversight Committee has primary oversight responsibility of identifying enterprise risk categories including credit risk. The Risk Oversight Committee monitors management&#8217;s assessment of asset quality and credit risk trends, credit quality administration and underwriting standards, portfolio credit risk management and processes to enable management to control credit risk including diversification and liquidity. At the management level, the Credit Risk Management Committee has primary oversight responsibility for credit risk. The Senior Credit Supervision function manages credit policy and provides the resources to manage the line of business transactional credit risk, assuring that all exposure is risk rated according to the requirements of the credit risk rating policy. The Senior Credit Supervision function reports on the overall credit risk portfolio to senior management and the Risk Oversight Committee. The Independent Asset Review function supports a strong credit risk management culture by providing independent and objective assessments of the quality of underwriting and documentation, reporting directly to the Board&#8217;s Risk Oversight Committee. A key to our credit risk management is adherence to a well-controlled underwriting process. 

A meaningful way to assess overall credit quality performance of our held-for-investment portfolio is through an analysis of specific performance ratios. This approach forms the basis of the discussion in the sections immediately following: Non-performing Assets, Troubled Debt Restructurings (&#8220;TDRs&#8221;), and Allowance for Credit Losses. 

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets are comprised of nonaccrual loans, other real estate owned (&#8220;OREO&#8221;), and other nonperforming assets. OREO and other nonperforming assets are repossessed assets and properties acquired through foreclosure, or through full or partial satisfaction of loans held-for-investment. Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due or when the full collection of principal or interest becomes uncertain regardless of the length of past due status. Collectability is generally assessed based on economic and business conditions, the borrower&#8217;s financial condition and the adequacy of collateral, if any. For additional details regarding the Company&#8217;s nonaccrual loan policy, see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Loans Held-for-Investmen t to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company&#8217;s 2019 Form 10-K.

Period-over-period changes to nonaccrual loans represent loans that are placed on nonaccrual status in accordance with the Company&#8217;s accounting policy, offset by reductions for loan repayments and for loans that are paid down, charged off, sold, foreclosed, or no longer classified as nonaccrual as a result of continued performance and improvement in the borrowers&#8217; financial condition. Nonaccrual loans were $126.7 million as of March 31, 2020 , an increase of $6.4 million or 5% from $120.2 million as of December 31, 2019 . This increase is primarily due to new additions from C&#38;I and residential mortgage loans, partially offset by charge-offs and loans returned to accrual status, paid down or paid off. Nonaccrual loans as a percentage of loans held-for-investment were 0.35% as of both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . C&#38;I nonaccrual loans were 70% and 62% of total nonaccrual loans as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. Credit risk related to the C&#38;I nonaccrual loans were partially mitigated by the collateral in place. As of March 31, 2020 , $61.9 million , or 49% , of the $126.7 million nonaccrual loans were less than 90 days delinquent. In comparison, $35.6 million or 30% , of the $120.2 million nonaccrual loans were less than 90 days delinquent as of December 31, 2019 . 

OREO was $19.5 million as of March 31, 2020, a quarter-over-quarter increase of $19.4 million because the Company took possession of a retail CRE property located in Southern California.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

TDRs are loans, for which contractual terms have been modified by the Company for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, and for which a concession to the borrower was granted that the Company would not otherwise consider. Our loan modifications are handled on a case-by-case basis and are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan collectibility and meet the borrower&#8217;s financial needs. The Company has implemented various consumer and commercial loan modification programs to provide its borrowers relief from the economic impacts of COVID-19. In accordance with the CARES Act, the Company has elected to not apply TDR classification to any COVID-19 related loan modifications. On April 7, 2020, the federal banking regulators issued the &#8220; Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customer Affected by the Coronovirus (Revised)&#8221; (the Interagency Statement). The Interagency Statement provides additional TDR relief as it clarifies that it is not necessary to consider the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial condition of a borrower in connection with a short-term (e.g., six months) COVID-19 related loan modification provided that the borrower is current at the date the modification program is implemented. For COVID-19 related loan modifications in the form of payment deferrals, the delinquency status will not advance and loans that were accruing at the time that the relief is provided will generally not be placed on nonaccrual status during the deferral period. Interest income will continue to be recognized over the contractual life of the loan.

Performing TDRs were $67.9 million as of March 31, 2020 , a decrease of $10.0 million or 13% from $77.9 million as of December 31, 2019 . This decrease reflects performing C&#38;I loans no longer classified as TDR, loan pay-offs and loan paydowns, offset by three C&#38;I loans that were newly designated as TDR. Nonperforming TDRs were $34.4 million as of March 31, 2020 , a decrease of $20.2 million , or 37% from $54.6 million as of December 31, 2019 . This decrease primarily reflects one CRE loan transferred to OREO. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses includes the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded credit commitments. 

Allowance for Loan Losses &#8212; The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that is deducted from, or added to, the amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. Loans are charged off against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed. Expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off. 

Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical loan loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loan loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level as well as for changes in environmental conditions. 

Allowance for loan losses is measured on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not included in the collective evaluation. When management determines that foreclosure is probable or when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral, adjusted for selling cost as appropriate. 

Allowance for Unfunded Credit Commitments &#8212; The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for unfunded credit commitments is adjusted through Provision for credit losses . The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. The allowance for unfunded credit commitments include reserves provided for unfunded lending commitments, SBLCs, and recourse obligations for loans sold. 

The allowance for loan losses is reported separately on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, whereas the allowance for unfunded credit commitments is included in Accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Provision for credit losses is reported on the Consolidated Statement of Income. 

The Company is committed to maintaining the allowance for credit losses at a level that is commensurate with the estimated inherent losses in the loan portfolio, including unfunded credit facilities. In addition to regular quarterly reviews of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, the Company performs ongoing assessments of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio. While the Company believes that the allowance for credit losses was appropriate as of March 31, 2020 , future allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to, accounting standard and regulatory changes, loan growth, portfolio performance and general economic conditions. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020. For additional information, see Note 2 &#8212; &#160; Current Accounting Developments and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; &#160; New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted. The calculation of the allowance for credit losses involves subjective and complex judgments. For additional details about the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses, including the methodologies used, see Note 7 &#8212; Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in this Form 10-Q.

As of March 31, 2020 , the allowance for loan losses amounted to $557.0 million or 1.55% of loans held-for-investment, compared with $358.3 million or 1.03% and $317.9 million or 0.97% of loans held-for-investment as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019 , respectively. The increase in allowance for loan losses was largely due to a combination of factors: the adoption of ASU 2016-13 which increased allowance for loan losses by $125.2 million, a deterioration in the forecasted macroeconomic variables related to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and loan growth that resulted in a $73.9 million increase in provision for credit losses. Gross charge-offs of $13.0 million were primarily from C&#38;I loans, which were almost entirely offset by recoveries, primarily from CRE loans. C&#38;I charge-offs in the first quarter of 2020 of $12.0 million, primarily resulted from our oil and gas loan portfolio. 

The allowance for unfunded credit commitments was $20.8 million as of March 31, 2020 and $11.2 million as of December 31, 2019 . The allowance for unfunded credit commitments as of March 31, 2020 included a cumulative-effect adjustment due to the adoption of ASU 2016-13. The Company believes that the allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was adequate. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by portfolio segment and the ratio of each loan type to total loans held-for-investment as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 :

The allowance for loan losses increased $198.7 million or 55% from December 31, 2019 , primarily driven by ASU 2016-13 adoption impact of $74.2 million in C&#38;I and $72.2 million in CRE loans, as well as first quarter 2020 provision for C&#38;I credit losses of $60.6 million mainly due to the significant deterioration in the economic outlook from the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Upon adoption of ASU 2016-13, allowance for loan losses for PCD loans is determined using the same methodology as other loans held-for-investment. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company had no allowance for loan losses against $222.9 million of PCI loans. 

Liquidity Risk Management 

Liquidity 

Liquidity is a financial institution&#8217;s capacity to meet its deposit and other counterparties&#8217; obligations as they come due, or to obtain adequate funding at a reasonable cost to meet those obligations. The objective of liquidity management is to manage the potential mismatch of asset and liability cash flows. Maintaining an adequate level of liquidity depends on the institution&#8217;s ability to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected cash flows, and collateral needs without adversely affecting daily operations or the financial condition of the institution. To achieve this objective, the Company analyzes its liquidity risk, maintains readily available liquid assets and utilizes diverse funding sources including its stable core deposit base. 

The Board of Directors&#8217; Risk Oversight Committee has primary oversight responsibility. At the management level, the Company&#8217;s Asset/Liability Committee (&#8220;ALCO&#8221;) sets the liquidity guidelines that govern the day-to-day active management of the Company&#8217;s liquidity position. The ALCO regularly monitors the Company&#8217;s liquidity status and related management processes, and provides regular reports to the Board of Directors. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Liquidity Sources. The Company&#8217;s primary source of funding is from deposits generated by its banking business, which is relatively stable and low-cost. Total deposits amounted to $38.69 billion as of March 31, 2020 , compared with $37.32 billion as of December 31, 2019 . The Company&#8217;s loan-to-deposit ratio was 93% as of both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . In addition, the Company has access to various sources of wholesale funding, as well as borrowing capacity at the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (&#8220;FRB&#8221;) to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio, meet daily cash demands and allow management flexibility to execute its business strategy. Economic conditions and the stability of capital markets impact the Company&#8217;s access to and the cost of wholesale financing. The Company&#8217;s access to capital markets is also affected by the ratings received from various credit rating agencies. See Item 2 &#8212; MD&#38;A &#8212; Balance Sheet Analysis &#8212; Deposits and Other Sources of Funds in this Form 10-Q for further detail related to the Company&#8217;s funding sources. 

The Company&#8217;s liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing deposits with banks, short-term resale agreements and AFS debt securities. The following table presents the Company&#8217;s liquid assets as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 :

Unencumbered liquid assets totaled $6.73 billion and $6.70 billion as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. AFS debt securities included as part of liquidity sources are primarily comprised of mortgage-backed securities and debt securities issued by U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, municipal securities, and foreign bonds. The Company believes these AFS debt securities provide quick sources of liquidity to obtain financing, regardless of market conditions, through sale or pledging. 

As a means of augmenting the Company&#8217;s liquidity, the Company maintains available borrowing capacity under secured borrowing lines with the FHLB and FRB, unsecured federal funds lines of credit with various correspondent banks, and several master repurchase agreements with major brokerage companies. The Company&#8217;s available borrowing capacity with the FHLB and FRB was $6.68 billion and $2.91 billion , respectively, as of March 31, 2020 . Unencumbered loans and/or securities were pledged to the FHLB and FRB discount window as collateral. Eligibility of collateral is defined in guidelines from the FHLB and FRB and is subject to change at their discretion. The Bank&#8217;s unsecured federal funds lines of credit, subject to availability, totaled $875.0 million with correspondent banks as of March 31, 2020 . Estimated borrowing capacity from unpledged AFS debt securities totaled $2.51 billion as of March 31, 2020. In sum, the Company had available borrowing capacity of $13.0 billion as of March 31, 2020, and the Company believes that its liquidity sources are sufficient to meet all reasonably foreseeable short-term needs over the next 12 months. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Liquidity for East West. East West&#8217;s primary source of liquidity is from cash dividends by its subsidiary, East West Bank. The Bank is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends as discussed in Item 1 . Business &#8212; Supervision and Regulation &#8212; Dividends and Other Transfers of Funds of the Company&#8217;s 2019 Form 10-K. During the first quarters of 2020 and 2019 , the Bank paid total dividends of $211.0 million and $40.0 million to East West, respectively. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Liquidity Stress Testing. Liquidity stress testing is performed at the Company level, as well as at the foreign subsidiary and foreign branch levels. Stress testing and scenario analysis are intended to quantify the potential impact of a liquidity event on the financial and liquidity position of the entity. These scenarios include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources, market triggers and potential uses of funding and economic conditions in certain countries. In addition, Company specific events are incorporated into the stress testing. Liquidity stress tests are conducted to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons, both immediate and longer term, and over a variety of stressed conditions. Given the range of potential stresses, the Company maintains a series of contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for individual entities. 

In response to recent developments relating to COVID-19, the Company is closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on its business. The uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 and in the financial service industry in general could potentially impact the liquidity of the Company. The strained economic, capital, credit and/or financial market conditions may expose the Company to liquidity risk. As of March 31, 2020, the Company was not aware of any material commitments for capital expenditures in the foreseeable future and believes it has adequate liquidity resources to conduct operations and meet other needs in the ordinary course of business. Given the uncertainty and the rapidly changing market and economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company will continue to actively evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business and financial position.

Operating Activities &#8212; Net cash provided by operating activities was $91.7 million and $139.2 million for the first quarters of 2020 and 2019 , respectively. During the first quarters of 2020 and 2019 , net cash provided by operating activities mainly reflected inflows of $144.8 million and $164.0 million from net income, respectively. During the first quarter of 2020 , net operating cash inflows also benefited from $105.3 million of non-cash adjustments to reconcile net income to net operating cash, as well as $304.7 million of net changes in accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by $462.8 million of net changes in accrued interest receivable and other assets. In comparison, during the same period in 2019 , net operating cash inflows benefited from $62.2 million of non-cash adjustments to reconcile net income to net operating cash, which was offset by $60.8 million of net changes in accrued expenses and other liabilities, and $27.6 million of net changes in accrued interest receivable and other assets. 

Investing Activities &#8212; Net cash used in investing activities was $1.41 billion and $118.7 million for the first quarters of 2020 and 2019 , respectively. During the first quarter of 2020 , net cash used in investing activities primarily reflected cash outflows of $1.14 billion from loans held-for-investment, $372.0 million from AFS debt securities, $115.4 million from interest-bearing deposits with banks, and $27.6 million from net funding of investments in qualified affordable housing partnerships, tax credit and other investments. The cash outflows from loans held-for-investment were primarily due to C&#38;I, CRE and single-family residential loan growth during the first quarter of 2020. These cash outflows used in investing activities were partially offset by cash inflows of $250.0 million from resale agreements. During the same period in 2019 , net cash used in investing activities primarily reflected cash outflows of $465.0 million from loans held-for-investment and $33.3 million from net funding of investments in qualified affordable housing partnerships, tax credit and other investments, partially offset by a $245.4 million increase in interest-bearing deposits with banks and net cash inflows from AFS debt securities of $137.2 million . 

Financing Activities &#8212; Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.12 billion and $749.4 million for the first quarters of 2020 and 2019 , respectively. During the first quarters of 2020 , net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected net increases of $1.37 billion in deposits and $40.0 million in short-term borrowings, partially offset by $146.0 million in shares repurchased, $100.0 million repayment of FHLB advances, and $41.4 million in cash dividends. During the same period in 2019 , net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected a net increase of $800.1 million in deposits, partially offset by $34.9 million in cash dividends. 

Market Risk Management 

Market risk is the risk that the Company&#8217;s financial condition may change resulting from adverse movements in market rates or prices including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, interest rate contracts, investment securities prices, and related risk resulting from mismatches in rate sensitive assets and liabilities. 

The Board&#8217;s Risk Oversight Committee has primary oversight responsibility. At the management level, the ALCO establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market risk management activities. Corporate Treasury supports the ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks. 

Interest Rate Risk Management 

Interest rate risk results primarily from the Company&#8217;s traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans, and is the primary market risk for the Company. Economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates, and consumer preferences impact the level of noninterest-bearing funding sources at the Company, and affect the difference between the interest the Company earns on interest-earning assets and pays on interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, changes in interest rates can influence the rate of principal prepayments on loans and the speed of deposit withdrawals. Due to the pricing term mismatches and the embedded options inherent in certain products, changes in market interest rates not only affect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic value of these interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Other market risks include foreign currency exchange risk and equity price risk. These risks are not considered significant to the Company and no separate quantitative information concerning these risks is presented herein. 

With oversight by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, the ALCO coordinates the overall management of the Company&#8217;s interest rate risk. The ALCO meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing the Company&#8217;s open market positions and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk. Management of interest rate risk is carried out primarily through strategies involving the Company&#8217;s investment securities portfolio, loan portfolio, available funding channels and capital market activities. In addition, the Company&#8217;s policies permit the use of derivative instruments to assist in managing interest rate risk. 

The interest rate risk exposure is measured and monitored through various risk management tools, which include a simulation model that performs interest rate sensitivity analyses under multiple interest rate scenarios. The model incorporates the Company&#8217;s cash instruments, loans, debt securities, resale agreements, deposits, borrowings and repurchase agreements, as well as financial instruments from the Company&#8217;s foreign operations. The Company incorporates both a static balance sheet and a forward growth balance sheet in order to perform these analyses. The simulated interest rate scenarios include a non-parallel shift in the yield curve (&#8220;rate shock&#8221;) and a gradual non-parallel shift in the yield curve (&#8220;rate ramp&#8221;). In addition, the Company also performs simulations using alternative interest rate scenarios, including various permutations of the yield curve flattening, steepening or inverting. Results of these various simulations are used to formulate and gauge strategies to achieve a desired risk profile within the Company&#8217;s capital and liquidity guidelines. 

The net interest income simulation model is based on the actual maturity and re-pricing characteristics of the Company&#8217;s interest-rate sensitive assets, liabilities and related derivative contracts. It also incorporates various assumptions, which management believes to be reasonable but may have a significant impact on results. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the timing and magnitude of changes in interest rates, the yield curve evolution and shape, the correlation between various interest rate indices, financial instrument future repricing characteristics and spread relative to benchmark rates, and the effect of interest rate floors and caps. The modeled results are highly sensitive to deposit decay and deposit beta assumptions, derived from a regression analysis of the Company&#8217;s historical deposit data. Deposit beta commonly refers to the correlation of the change in interest rates paid on deposits to changes in benchmark market interest rates. The model is also sensitive to the loan and investment prepayment assumptions, based on an independent model and the Company&#8217;s historical prepayment data, which consider anticipated prepayments under different interest rate environments. 

Simulation results are highly dependent on input assumptions. To the extent actual behavior is different from the assumptions in the models, there could be a material change in interest rate sensitivity. The assumptions applied in the model are documented and supported for reasonableness, and periodically back-tested to assess their effectiveness. The Company makes appropriate calibrations to the model as needed, continually refining the model, methodology and results. Changes to key model assumptions are reviewed by the ALCO. Scenario results do not reflect strategies that management could employ to limit the impact of changing interest rate expectations. 

Twelve-Month Net Interest Income Simulation 

Net Interest Income simulation modeling looks at interest rate risk through earnings. It projects the changes in interest rate sensitive asset and liability cash flows, expressed in terms of net interest income, over a specified time horizon for defined interest rates scenarios. Net interest income simulations generate insight into the impact of market rates changes on earnings and guide risk management decisions. The Company assesses interest rate risk by comparing net interest income using different interest rate scenarios. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s net interest income sensitivity as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 related to an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates of 100 and 200 basis points in both directions:

The percentage change represents net interest income over 12 months in a stable interest rate environment versus net interest income in the various rate scenarios. 

The Company&#8217;s estimated twelve-month net interest income sensitivity as of March 31, 2020 was lower when compared with the sensitivity as of December 31, 2019 , for both the upward 100 and upward 200 basis point rate scenarios. This reflects a greater rate of upward repricing in the Company&#8217;s deposit portfolio, which offsets simulated increases in interest income from higher interest rates on assets. The reduction in simulated increases in interest income is also impacted by the increase in the population of floating rate loans that are currently at their floors, which has increased under the current low interest rate environment. In both of the simulated downward interest rate scenarios, sensitivity is primarily decreased as a result of the 150 basis point reduction in the federal funds target rate range to 0.00% and 0.25% during March 2020. 

The Company&#8217;s net interest income profile as of March 31, 2020 reflects an asset sensitive position. Net interest income would be expected to increase if interest rates rise and to decrease if interest rates decline, albeit the federal funds rate is floored at the target range between 0.00% and 0.25% . The Company is naturally asset sensitive due to the large share of variable rate loans in its loan portfolio, which are primarily linked to Prime and LIBOR indices. The Company&#8217;s interest income is vulnerable to changes in short-term interest rates. The Company&#8217;s deposit portfolio is primarily comprised of non-maturity deposits, which are not directly tied to short-term interest rate indices, but are, nevertheless, sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates. 

The federal funds target rate was between 0.00% and 0.25% as of March 31, 2020 and between 1.50% and 1.75% as of December 31, 2019 . In its statement released on March 3, 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to a range of between 1.00% to 1.25% and, on March 15, 2020, further announced its decision to lower the target range to 0.00% and 0.25% . The Fed deemed that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will weigh on economic activity in the near term and pose risks to the economic outlook. 

While an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates was used in the simulation model described in the preceding paragraphs, the Company believes that any shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and would therefore have a more modest impact. The rate ramp table below shows the net income volatility under a gradual non-parallel shift upward and downward of the yield curve in even quarterly increments over the first twelve months, followed by rates held constant thereafter:

The percentage change represents net interest income under a gradual non-parallel shift in even quarterly increments over 12 months. 

The Company believes that the rate ramp table, shown above, when evaluated together with the results of the rate shock simulation, presents a better indication of the potential impact to the Company&#8217;s twelve-month net interest income in a rising and falling rate scenario. Between March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , the Company&#8217;s modeled sensitivity slightly decreased under a ramp simulation. 

Economic Value of Equity at Risk 

Economic value of equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;) is a cash flow calculation that takes the present value of all asset cash flows and subtracts the present value of all liability cash flows. This calculation is used for asset/liability management and measures changes in the economic value of the bank. The fair market values of a bank's assets and liabilities are directly linked to interest rates. In some ways, the economic value approach provides a broader scope than the net income volatility approach since it captures all anticipated cash flows. 

EVE simulation reflects the effect of interest rate shifts on the value of the Company and is used to assess the degree of interest rate risk exposure. In contrast to the earnings perspective, the economic perspective identifies risk arising from repricing or maturity gaps for the life of the balance sheet. Changes in economic value indicate anticipated changes in the value of the bank&#8217;s future cash flows. Thus, the economic perspective can provide a leading indicator of the bank&#8217;s future earnings and capital values. The economic valuation method also reflects those sensitivities across the full maturity spectrum of the bank&#8217;s assets and liabilities. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s EVE sensitivity as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 related to an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates of 100 and 200 basis points in both directions:

The percentage change represents net portfolio value of the Company in a stable interest rate environment versus net portfolio value in the various rate scenarios. 

The Company&#8217;s EVE sensitivity for the upward interest rate scenarios increased as of March 31, 2020 . The sensitivity for the downward 100 basis points scenario decreased while the sensitivity for the downward 200 basis points scenario increased as of March 31, 2020 , as compared with the results as of December 31, 2019 . The changes in EVE sensitivity during this period were primarily due to the reduced base EVE and the change in level and shape of the yield curve. 

The Company&#8217;s EVE profile as of March 31, 2020 reflects an asset sensitive EVE position. Given the uncertainty of the magnitude, timing and direction of future interest rate movements, and the shape of the yield curve, actual results may vary from those predicted by the Company&#8217;s model. 

Derivatives 

It is the Company&#8217;s policy not to speculate on the future direction of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. However, the Company will, from time to time, enter into derivative transactions in order to reduce its exposure to market risks, primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The Company believes that these derivative transactions, when properly structured and managed, may provide a hedge against inherent risk in certain assets and liabilities and against risk in specific transactions. Hedging transactions may be implemented using a variety of derivative instruments such as swaps, forwards and options. Prior to entering into any hedging activities, the Company analyzes the costs and benefits of the hedge in comparison to alternative strategies. In addition, the Company enters into derivative transactions in order to assist customers with their risk management objectives, primarily to manage exposures to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodity prices. To economically hedge against the derivative contracts entered into with the Company&#8217;s customers, the Company enters into mirrored derivative contracts with third-party financial institutions. The exposures from derivative transactions are collateralized by cash and/or eligible securities based on limits as set forth in the respective agreements entered between the Company and the financial institutions. 

The Company is subject to credit risk associated with the counterparties to the derivative contracts. This counterparty credit risk is a multidimensional form of risk, affected by both the exposure and credit quality of the counterparty, both of which are sensitive to market-induced changes. The Company&#8217;s Credit Risk Management Committee provides oversight of credit risks and the Company has guidelines in place to manage counterparty concentration, tenor limits and collateral. The Company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties, entering into legally enforceable master netting arrangements and requiring collateral arrangements, where possible. The Company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to institutional third parties through the use of credit risk participation agreements (&#8220;RPAs&#8221;). Certain derivative contracts are required to be centrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty credit risk. The Company incorporates credit value adjustments and other market standard methodologies to appropriately reflect its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty&#8217;s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements of its derivatives. 

Fair Value Hedges &#8212; As of March 31, 2020 , the Company had two cancellable interest rate swap contracts with original terms of 20 years. These swap contracts involve the exchange of variable rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amounts. The changes in fair value of the hedged brokered certificates of deposit are expected to be effectively offset by the changes in fair value of the swaps throughout the terms of these contracts. 

Net Investment Hedges &#8212; ASC 830-20, Foreign Currency Matters &#8212; Foreign Currency Transactions and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, allow hedging of the foreign currency risk of a net investment in a foreign operation. The Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its investment in East West Bank (China) Limited, a non-U.S. dollar (&#8220;USD&#8221;) functional currency subsidiary in China. The hedging instruments designated as net investment hedges, involve hedging the risk of changes in the USD equivalent value of a designated monetary amount of the Company&#8217;s net investment in East West Bank (China) Limited, against the risk of adverse changes in the foreign currency exchange rate of the Chinese Renminbi (&#8220;RMB&#8221;). As of March 31, 2020 , the outstanding foreign currency forwards effectively hedged approximately 92% of the RMB exposure in East West Bank (China) Limited. The fluctuation in foreign currency translation of the hedged exposure is expected to be offset by changes in the fair value of the forwards. 

Interest Rate Contracts &#8212; The Company offers various interest rate derivative contracts to its customers. When derivative transactions are executed with its customers, the derivative contracts are offset by paired trades with third-party financial institutions including with central clearing organizations. Certain derivative contracts entered with central clearing organizations are settled-to-market daily to the extent the central clearing organizations&#8217; rulebooks legally characterize the variation margin as settlement. Derivative contracts allow borrowers to lock in attractive intermediate and long-term fixed rate financing while not increasing the interest rate risk to the Company. These transactions are not linked to specific Company assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet or to forecasted transactions in a hedging relationship and, therefore, are economic hedges. The contracts are marked-to-market at each reporting period. The changes in fair values of the derivative contracts traded with third-party financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the derivative transactions executed with customers throughout the terms of these contracts, except for the credit valuation adjustment component. The Company records credit valuation adjustments on derivatives to properly reflect the variances of credit worthiness between the Company and the counterparties, considering the effects of enforceable master netting agreements and collateral arrangements. 

Foreign Exchange Contracts &#8212; The Company enters into foreign exchange contracts with its customers, consisting of forward, spot, swap and option contracts to accommodate the business needs of its customers. For the foreign exchange contracts entered into with its customers, the Company managed its foreign exchange exposure by entering into offsetting foreign exchange contracts with third-party financial institutions and/or entering into bilateral collateral and master netting agreements with customer counterparties to manage its credit exposure. The changes in the fair values entered with third-party financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the foreign exchange transactions executed with the customers throughout the terms of these contracts. The Company also utilizes foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to mitigate the economic effect of fluctuations in certain foreign currency on-balance sheet assets and liabilities, primarily foreign currency denominated deposits offered to its customers. The Company&#8217;s policies permit taking proprietary currency positions within approved limits, in compliance with the proprietary trading exemption provided under Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;). The Company does not speculate in the foreign exchange markets, and actively manages its foreign exchange exposures within prescribed risk limits and defined controls. 

Credit Contracts &#8212; The Company may periodically enter into RPAs to manage the credit exposure on interest rate contracts associated with its syndicated loans. The Company may enter into protection sold or protection purchased RPAs with institutional counterparties. Under the RPA, the Company will receive or make a payment if a borrower defaults on the related interest rate contract. The Company manages its credit risk on the RPAs by monitoring the credit worthiness of the borrowers, which is based on the Company&#8217;s normal credit review process. 

Equity Contracts &#8212; As part of the loan origination process, from time to time, the Company obtained warrants to purchase preferred and/or common stock of technology and life sciences companies it provides loans to. The warrants included on the Consolidated Financial Statements were from public and private companies. 

Commodity Contracts &#8212; The Company entered into energy commodity contracts with its customers to allow them to hedge against the risk of fluctuation in energy commodity prices. To economically hedge against the risk of fluctuation in commodity prices in the products offered to its customers, the Company enters into offsetting commodity contracts with third-party financial institutions including with central clearing organizations. Certain derivative contracts entered with central clearing organizations are settled to market daily to the extent the central clearing organizations&#8217; rulebooks legally characterize the variation margin as settlement. The changes in fair values of the energy commodity contracts traded with third-party financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the energy commodity transactions executed with customers throughout the terms of these contracts. 

Additional information on the Company&#8217;s derivatives is presented in Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company&#8217;s 2019 Form 10-K , Note 3 &#8212; Fair Value Measurement and Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Note 6 &#8212; Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q. 

Impact of Inflation 

The consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this report have been prepared according to GAAP, which require the measurement of financial and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs and the effect that general inflation may have on both short-term and long-term interest rates. Since almost all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than do general levels of inflation. Although inflation expectations do affect interest rates, interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The Company&#8217;s significant accounting policies and use of estimates (for significant accounting policies and use of estimates of allowance for credit losses, see Note 2 &#8212; Current Accounting Developments and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in this Form 10-Q and for all other significant accounting policies and use of estimates, see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Company&#8217;s 2019 Form 10-K) are fundamental to understanding its results of operations and financial condition. Some accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments. In addition, some significant accounting policies require significant judgment in applying complex accounting principles to individual transactions to determine the most appropriate treatment. The Company has procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. 

Certain accounting policies are considered to have a critical effect on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company&#8217;s judgment. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that require the most complex or subjective judgments and are reflective of significant uncertainties, and whose actual results could differ from the Company&#8217;s estimates. Future changes in the key variables could change future valuations and impact the results of operations. In each area, the Company has identified the most important variables in the estimation process. The Company has used the best information available to make the estimations necessary for the related assets and liabilities. The following accounting policies are critical to the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements as they require management to make subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain where actual results could differ materially from the Company&#8217;s estimates: 

&#8226; 

fair value of financial instruments; 

&#8226; 

allowance for credit losses; 

&#8226; 

goodwill impairment; and 

&#8226; 

income taxes.

Supplemental Information &#8212; Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

To supplement the Company&#8217;s unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company uses certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to GAAP. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company&#8217;s performance that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. A non-GAAP financial measure may also be a financial metric that is not required by GAAP or other applicable requirement. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance, and allow comparability to prior periods. These non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. 

During the first quarter of 2019, the Company recorded a $7.0 million pre-tax impairment charge related to DC Solar. 

The following tables present the reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for the periods presented:

Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts. These statements relate to the Company&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance or business. They usually can be identified by the use of forward-looking language, such as &#8220;likely result in,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;forecasts,&#8221; &#8220;projects,&#8221; &#8220;intends to,&#8221; &#8220;assumes,&#8221; or may include other similar words or phrases, such as &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;trend,&#8221; &#8220;objective,&#8221; &#8220;continues,&#8221; &#8220;remains,&#8221; or similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs, such as &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;might,&#8221; &#8220;can,&#8221; or similar verbs, and the negative thereof. You should not place undue reliance on these statements, as they are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in the documents incorporated by reference. When considering these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind these risks and uncertainties, as well as any cautionary statements the Company may make. Moreover, you should treat these statements as speaking only as of the date they are made and based only on information then actually known to the Company.
