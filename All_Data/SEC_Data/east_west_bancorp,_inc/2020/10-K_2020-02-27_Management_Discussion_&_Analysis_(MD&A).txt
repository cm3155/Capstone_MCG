During 2019 , the Company recorded a $5.4 million net pre-tax impairment charge (equivalent to $3.8 after-tax) and $30.1 million in additional income tax expense to reverse certain previously claimed tax credits related to DC Solar.

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income 

The Company&#8217;s primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets less interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average interest-earning assets. Net interest income and net interest margin are impacted by several factors, including changes in average balances and composition of interest-earning assets and funding sources, market interest rate fluctuations and slope of the yield curve, repricing characteristics and maturity of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, volume of noninterest-bearing sources of funds and asset quality.

Net interest income for 2019 was $1.47 billion , an increase of $81.3 million or 6% , compared with $1.39 billion in 2018 . The increase in net interest income for 2019 was primarily driven by loan growth and higher loan yields, partially offset by a higher cost of deposits. Net interest income for 2018 was $1.39 billion , an increase of $201.4 million or 17% , compared with $1.19 billion in 2017 . The increase in net interest income for 2018 was primarily due to the expansion of loan yields and loan growth, partially offset by a higher cost of funds. Net interest margin for 2019 was 3.64% , a 14 basis point decrease from 3.78% in 2018 . Net interest margin for 2018 increased 30 basis points from 3.48% in 2017 . 

Average loan yield for 2019 was 5.15% , an 18 basis point increase from 4.97% in 2018 . Average loan yield in 2018 increased 57 basis points from 4.40% in 2017 . The increases in the average loan yield in 2019 and 2018 reflected the upward repricing of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio in response to higher short-term interest rates during the periods. Approximately 64%, 66% and 69% of total loans were variable-rate or hybrid that were in their adjustable rate periods as of December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The increase in the 2019 average loan yield was primarily due to the higher prime rate during the first half of 2019, which increased the yield on prime-based loans. Approximately 32% of loans were tied to the prime index as of December 31, 2019. Average loans were $33.37 billion in 2019 , an increase of $3.14 billion or 10% from $30.23 billion in 2018 . Average loans in 2018 increased $2.98 billion or 11% from $27.25 billion in 2017 . Loan growth in both 2019 and 2018 was broad-based across single-family residential, commercial and industrial (&#8220;C&#38;I&#8221;) and CRE loan portfolios. 

Average interest-earning assets were $40.32 billion in 2019 , an increase of $3.61 billion or 10% from $36.71 billion in 2018 . This was primarily due to increases of $3.14 billion in average loans and $441.5 million in average interest-bearing cash and deposits with banks. Average interest-earning assets were $36.71 billion in 2018 , an increase of $2.67 billion or 8% from $34.03 billion in 2017 . This was primarily due to increases of $2.98 billion in average loans and $367.2 million in average interest-bearing cash and deposits with banks, partially offset by decreases of $417.9 million in average securities purchased under resale agreements (&#8220;resale agreements&#8221;) and $253.5 million in average investment securities. 

Deposits are an important source of funds and impact both net interest income and net interest margin. Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits totaled $10.50 billion in 2019 , compared with $11.09 billion in 2018 , a decrease of $586.9 million or 5% . Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits in 2018 increased $461.8 million or 4% from $10.63 billion in 2017 . Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits made up 29% , 33% and 34% of average total deposits in 2019, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Average interest-bearing deposits of $25.54 billion in 2019 increased $3.40 billion or 15% from $22.14 billion in 2018 . Average interest-bearing deposits in 2018 increased $1.95 billion or 10% from $20.19 billion in 2017 . 

The average cost of funds was 1.12% , 0.78% and 0.44% in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The year-over-year increases in the average cost of funds were primarily due to increase s in the cost of interest-bearing deposits. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 41 basis points to 1.47% in 2019 , and 48 basis points to 1.06% in 2018 , up from 0.58% in 2017 . Other sources of funding included in the calculation of the average cost of funds primarily consist of FHLB advances, long-term debt and securities sold under repurchase agreements (&#8220;repurchase agreements&#8221;).

NM &#8212; Not meaningful 

Noninterest income represented 12% , 13% and 18% of total revenue for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. 2019 noninterest income was $209.4 million , a decrease of $ 1.5 million or 1% , compared with $210.9 million in 2018 . This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net gain on sale of business and a decrease in net gains on sales of fixed assets, partially offset by increases in interest rate contracts and other derivative income, and foreign exchange income. 2018 noninterest income was $210.9 million , a decrease of $46.8 million or 18%, compared with $257.7 million in 2017 . This decrease was primarily due to decreases in net gains on sales of fixed assets, other income, and net gains on sales of AFS investment securities, partially offset by increases in net gain on sale of business and foreign exchange income. 

Foreign exchange income increase d $5.1 million or 24% to $26.4 million in 2019 , primarily driven by an increased volume of foreign exchange transactions, partially offset by revaluation losses of certain foreign currency-denominated balance sheet items. The $11.4 million or 115% increase in foreign exchange income to $21.3 million in 2018 was primarily due to the favorable revaluation of certain foreign currency-denominated balance sheet items, partially offset by a decrease in foreign exchange derivative gains. 

Interest rate contracts and other derivative income increased $20.9 million or 110% to $39.9 million in 2019 , which primarily reflected strong customer demand for interest rate swaps in response to the inverted yield curve and overall low level of interest rates. This increase was partially offset by the fair value changes of the interest rate derivative contracts that were primarily driven by the decline in long-term interest rates. The $1.3 million or 7% increase in interest rate contracts and other derivative income from $17.7 million in 2017 to $19.0 million in 2018 was primarily related to energy commodity contracts which the Bank began offering during the year. 

Net gains on sales of AFS investment securities increased $1.4 million or 55% to $3.9 million in 2019 , and decreased $5.5 million or 68% from $8.0 million in 2017 to $2.5 million in 2018. These changes were primarily due to the quantities of AFS investment securities sold each year. 

Net gains on sales of fixed assets decreased to $114 thousand in 2019, down from $6.7 million in 2018. This was due to the Company&#8217;s adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) on January 1, 2019, under which deferred gains on sale and leaseback transactions were no longer amortized to gain on sales of fixed assets in 2019. In 2017, net gains on sales of fixed assets included the $71.7 million pre-tax gain recognized from the sale of a commercial property in California. During 2017, East West Bank completed the sale and leaseback of a commercial property in California for cash consideration of $120.6 million and entered into a lease agreement for part of the property, consisting of a retail branch and office facilities. 

Net gain on sale of business in 2018 reflected the $31.5 million pre-tax gain recognized from the sale of the Bank&#8217;s eight DCB branches while the net gain on sale of business in 2017 reflected the $3.8 million pre-tax gain recognized from the sale of the EWIS insurance brokerage business, as discussed in Note 2 &#8212; Dispositions to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

Other income increased $1.3 million or 14% to $10.8 million in 2019 , primarily due to interest earned on cash collateral. The $6.0 million or 39% decrease in other income to $9.5 million in 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in rental income due to the aforementioned sale of the commercial property in California.

##TABLE_END

2019 noninterest expense was $734.6 million , an increase of $20.1 million or 3% , compared with $714.5 million in 2018 . This increase was primarily due to increases in compensation and employee benefits, computer software expense, deposit related expenses and other operating expense, partially offset by lower deposit insurance premiums and regulatory assessments and a decrease in amortization of tax credit and other investments. 2018 noninterest expense of $714.5 million , increased $53.0 million or 8% , compared with $661.5 million in 2017 . This increase was primarily due to increases in compensation and employee benefits, other operating expense and computer software expense. 

Compensation and employee benefits increase d $22.1 million or 6% to $401.7 million in 2019 from $379.6 million in 2018 , and increased $44.3 million or 13% from $335.3 million in 2017. These increases were primarily attributable to the annual employee merit increases and staffing growth to support the Company&#8217;s growing business. The larger increase in 2018, compared with 2017, was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation and severance costs recognized in 2018 as a result of the departure of one of the Company&#8217;s executives. 

Deposit insurance premiums and regulatory assessments decreased $8.3 million or 39% to $12.9 million in 2019 , and decreased $2.5 million or 11% to $21.2 million in 2018 . These decreases were primarily due to lower FDIC assessment rates. Effective October 1, 2018, the FDIC eliminated the temporary surcharge applied on the larger banks&#8217; assessment base. 

Computer software expense increase d $4.2 million or 19% to $26.5 million in 2019 , and increased $4.1 million or 23% to $22.3 million in 2018 . The increases in both 2019 and 2018 were due to new system implementations and software upgrades to support the Company&#8217;s growing business. 

Other operating expense primarily consists of marketing, travel, telecommunication and postage expenses, charitable contributions, loan related expenses and other miscellaneous expense categories. The $4.2 million or 5% increase to $92.2 million in 2019 , was primarily due to an increase in marketing expense and a decrease in gains on sale of other real estate owned (&#8220;OREO&#8221;), partially offset by a decrease in charitable contributions. Other operating expense increase d $5.1 million or 6% to $88.0 million in 2018 primarily due to increases in charitable contributions, marketing, travel, and telecommunication and postage expenses, partially offset by an increase in gains on sale of OREO. 

Amortization of tax credit and other investments decreased $4.1 million or 5% from $89.6 million in 2018 to $85.5 million in 2019 . This decrease in 2019 compared with 2018 , was primarily due to fewer tax credit investments placed in service during 2019, partially offset by $7.6 million of OTTI charges related to five historic tax credit investments and a CRA investment and the $5.4 million net write-off of the DC Solar tax credit investments. The $1.7 million or 2% increase in amortization of tax credit and other investments to $89.6 million in 2018 , compared with 2017 , was primarily due to an increase in renewable energy tax credit investments placed in service in 2018 , partially offset by a reduction in historical tax credit investments.

##TABLE_END

The increase in 2019 effective tax rate and income tax expense, compared with 2018, was primarily due to $30.1 million of income tax expense recorded to reverse certain previously claimed tax credits related to the Company&#8217;s investment in DC Solar, as well as $14.7 million decrease in tax credits recognized from investments in renewable energy and historic rehabilitation tax credit projects as further discussed below. Excluding the $30.1 million income tax expense, 2019 non-GAAP effective tax rate was 16.6% . The 2018 effective tax rate of 14.0%, compared to 2017 effective tax rate of 31.2%, reflected the reduction of the U.S. federal income tax rate from 35% in 2017 to 21% in 2018 as a result of the Tax Act enactment in December 2017. GAAP requires companies to recognize the effect of tax law changes on deferred tax assets and liabilities and other recognized assets in the period of enactment. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded $41.7 million in income tax expense related to the impact of the Tax Act, of which this amount was primarily related to the remeasurements of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities of $33.1 million, as well as the remeasurements of tax credits and other tax benefits related to qualified affordable housing partnerships of $7.9 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 31.2% during 2017. Excluding the $41.7 million in income tax expense related to the impact of the Tax Act, 2017 non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.5%. See reconciliations of non-GAAP measures presented under Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Supplemental Information &#8212; Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Form 10-K. In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.118 (&#8220;SAB 118&#8221;). SAB 118 allows the recording of a provisional estimate to reflect the income tax impact of the U.S. tax legislation and provides a measurement period up to one year from the enactment date. During 2018, management finalized its assessment of the initial impact of the Tax Act, which resulted in an increase in income tax expense by $985 thousand during the same period ensuing from the remeasurements of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The overall impact of the Tax Act was a one-time increase in income tax expense of $42.7 million. 

Management regularly reviews the Company&#8217;s tax positions and deferred tax balances. Factors considered in this analysis include the Company&#8217;s ability to generate future taxable income, implement tax-planning strategies (as defined in ASC 740, Income Taxes ) and utilize taxable income from prior carryback years (if such carryback is permitted under the applicable tax law), as well as future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach, the objective of which is to establish deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized and settled. Net deferred tax assets decreased $11.2 million or 9% to $106.5 million as of December 31, 2019 , compared with $117.6 million as of December 31, 2018 , mainly attributable to the decreases in tax credit carryover and unrealized loss on securities, offset by the write-off of deferred tax liabilities related to DC Solar. 

A valuation allowance is used, as needed, to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realized. To determine whether a valuation allowance is needed, the Company considers evidence such as the Company&#8217;s ability to generate future taxable income, implement tax-planning strategies (as defined in ASC 740, Income Taxes ), and utilize taxable income from prior carryback years (if such carryback is permitted under the applicable tax law), as well as future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. The Company expects to have sufficient taxable income in future years to fully realize its deferred tax assets. The Company also performed an overall assessment by weighing all positive evidence against all negative evidence and concluded that it is more-likely-than-not that all of the benefits of the deferred tax assets will be realized, with the exception of the deferred tax assets related to certain state net operating losses (&#8220;NOL&#8221;) carryforwards. For states other than California, Georgia, Massachusetts and New York, because management believes that the state NOL carryforwards may not be fully utilized, a valuation allowance of $21 thousand and $128 thousand was recorded for such carryforwards as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. For additional details on the components of net deferred tax assets, see Note 14 &#8212; Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Impact of Investment in DC Solar Tax Credit Funds 

The Company invested in four solar energy tax credit funds in the years 2014, 2015, 2017 and 2018 as a limited member. These tax credit funds engaged in the acquisition and leasing of mobile solar generators through DC Solar entities. The Company&#8217;s investments in the DC Solar tax credit funds qualified for federal energy tax credit under Section 48 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Company also received a &#8220;should&#8221; level legal opinion from an external law firm supporting the legal structure of the investments for tax credit purposes. These investments were recorded in Investments in tax credit and other investments, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and were accounted for under the equity method of accounting. DC Solar had its assets frozen in December 2018 and filed for bankruptcy protection in February 2019. In February 2019, an affidavit from a Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent stated that DC Solar was operating a fraudulent &#8220;Ponzi-like scheme&#8221; and that the majority of the mobile solar generators sold to investors and managed by DC Solar, as well as the majority of the related lease revenues claimed to have been received by DC Solar might not have existed. 

During the first quarter of 2019, the Company fully wrote off its tax credit investments related to DC Solar and recorded a $7.0 million OTTI charge within Amortization of tax credit and other investments on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The Company concluded at that time that there would be no material future cash flows related to these investments, in part because of the fact that DC Solar has ceased operations and its bankruptcy case had been converted from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7 on March 22, 2019. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recorded a $1.6 million pre-tax impairment recovery related to DC Solar. There were no balances recorded in Accrued expenses and other liabilities &#8212; Unfunded commitments related to DC Solar as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . More discussion on the Company&#8217;s impairment evaluation and monitoring process of tax credit investments is provided in Note 3 &#8212; Fair Value Measurement and Fair Value of Financial Instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

ASC 740-10-25-6 states in part, that an entity shall initially recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more-likely-than-not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. The term &#8220;more-likely-than-not&#8221; means a likelihood of more than 50 percent; the terms &#8220;examined&#8221; and &#8220;upon examination&#8221; include resolution of the related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The level of evidence that is necessary and appropriate to support the technical merits of a tax position is subject to judgment and depends on available information as of the balance sheet date. The Company received a &#8220;should&#8221; level legal opinion from an external law firm supporting the legal structure of these investments for tax credit purposes. A subsequent measurement of a tax position is based on management&#8217;s best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the latest quarterly reporting date. A change in judgment that results in a subsequent derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position is recognized as a discrete item in the period in which the change occurs. 

Investors in DC Solar funds, including the Company, received tax credits for making renewable energy investments. Between 2014 and 2018, the Company had invested in four DC Solar energy tax credit funds and claimed tax credits of approximately $53.9 million, partially reduced by a deferred tax liability of $5.7 million related to the 50% tax basis reduction, for a net impact of $48.2 million to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Company, in coordination with other fund investors, engaged an unaffiliated third party inventory firm to investigate the actual number of mobile solar generators in existence. Based on the inventory report, none of the mobile service generators that had been purchased by the Company&#8217;s 2017 and 2018 tax credit funds were found. On the other hand, a vast majority of the mobile solar generators purchased by the Company&#8217;s 2014 and 2015 tax credit funds were found. Based on the inventory information, as well as management&#8217;s best judgments regarding the future settlement of the related tax positions with the IRS, the Company concluded that a portion of the previously claimed tax credits would be recaptured. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company reversed $33.6 million out of the $53.9 million previously claimed tax credits, and $3.5 million out of the $5.7 million deferred tax liability, resulting in $30.1 million of additional income tax expense. The Company continues to conduct an ongoing investigation related to this matter. For additional information on the risks surrounding the Company&#8217;s investments in tax-advantaged projects, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Form 10-K. Management regularly reviews the Company&#8217;s tax positions and deferred tax balances. Factors considered in this analysis include the Company&#8217;s ability to generate future taxable income, implement tax-planning strategies (as defined in ASC 740, Income Taxes ) and utilize taxable income from prior carryback years (if such carryback is permitted under the applicable tax law), as well as future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach, the objective of which is to establish deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized and settled. Net deferred tax assets decreased $11.2 million or 9% to $106.5 million as of December 31, 2019 , compared to $117.6 million as of December 31, 2018 , mainly attributable to a decrease in tax credit carryforwards. For additional details on the components of net deferred tax assets, see Note 14 &#8212; Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Operating Segment Results 

The Company organizes its operations into three reportable operating segments: (1) Consumer and Business Banking; (2) Commercial Banking; and (3) Other. These segments are defined by the type of customers and the related products and services provided, and reflect how financial information is currently evaluated by management. For additional description of the Company&#8217;s internal management reporting process, including the segment cost allocation methodology, see Note 21 &#8212; Business Segments to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

During the first quarter of 2019, the Company enhanced its segment cost allocation methodology related to stock compensation expense and bonus accrual. Effective first quarter of 2019, stock compensation expense is allocated to all three segments, whereas it was previously recorded in the Other segment as a corporate expense. In addition, bonus expense is now allocated at a more granular level at the segment level at the time of accrual. For comparability, segment information for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 have been restated to conform to the current presentation. During the third quarter of 2019, the Company enhanced its funds transfer pricing (&#8220;FTP&#8221;) methodology related to deposits by setting a minimum floor rate for the FTP credits for deposits in consideration of the flattened and inverted yield curve. This methodology has been retrospectively applied to segment financial results throughout the year of 2019. This change in FTP methodology related to deposits had no impact on 2018 and 2017 segment results. 

The following tables present the selected segment information in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 :

##TABLE_END

Consumer and Business Banking 

The Consumer and Business Banking segment primarily provides financial products and services to consumer and commercial customers through the Company&#8217;s domestic branch network. This segment offers consumer and commercial deposits, mortgage and home equity loans, and other products and services. It also originates commercial loans for small and medium-sized enterprises through the Company&#8217;s branch network. Other products and services provided by this segment include wealth management, treasury management, and foreign exchange services. 

The Consumer and Business Banking segment reported net income of $284.2 million in 2019 , compared with $330.7 million in 2018 . The $46.5 million or 14% decrease in segment income reflected decreases in net interest income before provision for credit losses and noninterest income, partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense. Net interest income before provision for credit losses for this segment was $696.6 million in 2019 , a decrease of $30.7 million or 4% , compared with $727.2 million in 2018 . This decrease was primarily due to an increase in deposit cost of funds, partially offset by the impact of loan growth. Noninterest income was $57.9 million in 2019 , a decrease of $27.7 million or 32% , compared with $85.6 million in 2018 . Noninterest income in 2018 included a pre-tax gain of $31.5 million recognized in 2018 from the sale of the Bank&#8217;s eight DCB branches. Excluding the impact of this non-recurring item, Consumer and Business Banking&#8217;s noninterest income in 2019 increased $3.8 million or 7% from $54.1 million in 2018 . The decrease in income tax expense reflected the decrease in segment income before income taxes between 2019 and 2018. Average loans for this segment was $10.65 billion in 2019, an increase of $1.18 billion or 12% from $9.47 billion in 2018, which was primarily driven by an increase in single-family residential loans. Average deposits for this segment was $25.12 billion in 2019, which remained relatively flat as compared with average deposits of $24.7 billion in 2018. 

The Consumer and Business Banking segment reported net income of $330.7 million in 2018 , compared with $187.6 million in 2017 . The $143.1 million or 76% increase in segment net income reflected increases in net interest income before provision for credit losses and noninterest income, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense. Net interest income before provision for credit losses was $727.2 million in 2018, an increase of $136.4 million or 23%, compared with $590.8 million in 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to higher FTP credits received for deposits, partially offset by the impact of an increase in deposit cost of funds. Noninterest income was $85.6 million in 2018, an increase of $31.2 million or 57%, compared with $54.5 million in 2017. Excluding the impact of the aforementioned non-recurring sale of the Bank&#8217;s eight DCB branches, noninterest income in 2018 remained relatively flat compared with 2017. Noninterest expense was $341.4 million in 2018, an increase of $18.1 million or 6%, compared with $323.3 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation and employee benefits driven by increased investment in human capital and technology. Average loans for this segment were $9.47 billion in 2018, an increase of $1.36 billion or 17% from $8.11 billion in 2017, which was primarily driven by an increase in single-family residential loans. Average deposits for this segment were $24.70 billion in 2018 which remained relatively flat as compared with average deposits of $24.65 billion in 2017. 

Commercial Banking 

The Commercial Banking segment primarily generates commercial loans and deposits. Commercial loan products include commercial business loans and lines of credit, trade finance loans and letters of credit, CRE loans, construction lending, affordable housing loans and letters of credit, asset-based lending, and equipment financings. Commercial deposit products and other financial services include treasury management, foreign exchange services, and interest rate and commodity risk hedging. 

The Commercial Banking segment reported net income of $313.8 million in 2019 , compared with $303.6 million in 2018 . The $10.3 million or 3% increase in segment net income reflected increases in net interest income before provision for credit losses and noninterest income, partially offset by increases in provision for credit losses and noninterest expense. Net interest income before provision for credit loss was $651.4 million in 2019 , an increase of $45.7 million or 8% , compared with $605.7 million in 2018 . This increase was primarily due to loan growth. Noninterest income was $134.6 million in 2019, an increase of $24.3 million or 22%, compared with $110.3 million in 2018. This increase was mainly attributable to an increase in interest rate contracts and other derivative income driven by strong customer demand for interest rate swaps. Provision for credit losses was $84.5 million in 2019, an increase of $29.6 million or 54%, compared with $54.9 million in 2018. This increase was primarily due to loan portfolio growth, increased charge-offs, and a downward migration in the credit risk ratings of C&#38;I loans. Noninterest expense was $263.1 million in 2019 , an increase of $25.6 million or 11% , compared with $237.5 million in 2018 . The increase was primarily due to increases in compensation and employee benefits driven by increased investments in human capital to support the business growth. Average Loans for this segment were $22.73 billion in 2019, an increase of $1.97 billion or 9% from $20.76 billion in 2018, which was primarily driven by growth in C&#38;I and CRE loans. Average deposits for this segment was $8.59 billion in 2019, an increase of $1.69 billion or 25% from $6.90 billion in 2018, which was primarily driven by growth in time deposits and interest-bearing checking deposits. 

The Commercial Banking segment reported net income of $303.6 million in 2018, compared with $246.4 million in 2017. The $57.2 million or 23% increase in segment net income reflected a decrease in income tax expense and an increase in net interest income before provision for credit losses, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to the decrease of the effective income tax rate as a result of the enactment of the Tax Act. Net interest income before provision for credit losses was $605.7 million in 2018, an increase of $51.9 million or 9%, compared with $553.8 million in 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to loan growth and higher FTP credits received for deposits, partially offset by higher FTP charges on loans. Noninterest expense was $237.5 million in 2018, an increase of $37.3 million or 19% from $200.2 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to increases in compensation and employee benefits driven by increased investments in human capital. Average loans for this segment were $20.76 billion in 2018, an increase of $1.61 billion or 8% from $ 19.15 billion in 2017, which was primarily driven by increases in CRE and C&#38;I loans. Average deposits for this segment was $6.90 billion in 2018, an increase of $2.01 billion or 41% from $4.89 billion in 2017, which was primarily driven by growth in noninterest-bearing demand deposits, money market accounts and time deposits. 

Other 

Centralized functions, including the corporate treasury activities of the Company and eliminations of inter-segment amounts, have been aggregated and included in the Other segment, which provides broad administrative support to the two core segments, the Consumer and Business Banking and the Commercial Banking segments. 

The Other segment reported segment income before income taxes of $8.2 million and segment net income of $76.0 million in 2019 , reflecting an income tax benefit of $67.9 million. The Other segment reported segment loss before income taxes of $66.9 million and segment net income of $69.5 million in 2018 , reflecting income tax benefit of $136.4 million. The increase in segment income before income taxes between 2019 and 2018 was primarily driven by an increase in net interest income before provision for credit losses and a decrease in noninterest expense. Net interest income before provision for credit loss was $119.8 million in 2019 , an increase of $66.2 million or 123% , compared with $53.6 million in 2018 . This increase reflected an increase in the net spread between the total internal FTP charges for loans and the total internal FTP credits for deposits, which widened due to the flattened and inverted yield curve in 2019. Noninterest expense was $128.5 million in 2019, a decrease of $7.0 million or 5%, compared with $135.6 million in 2018, primarily due to a decrease in compensation and employee benefits. This decrease reflected a one-time stock-based compensation and severance expense recognized in 2018. 

The Other segment reported segment loss before income taxes of $66.9 million and segment net income of $69.5 million in 2018, reflecting income tax benefit of $136.4 million. The Other segment reported segment loss before income taxes of $4.3 million and segment net income of $71.6 million in 2017, reflecting income tax benefit of $76.0 million. This change in segment loss before income taxes was primarily driven by a decrease in noninterest income, partially offset by an increase in net interest income before provision for credit loss. Noninterest income was $15.0 million in 2018, a decrease of $78.2 million or 84%, compared with $93.2 million in 2017. Noninterest income in 2017 included a pre-tax gain of $71.7 million from the sale of a commercial property in California. Excluding the impact of this nonrecurring item, noninterest income for this segment decreased $6.5 million or 30% during 2018. This $6.5 million decrease was primarily driven by decreases in rental income and lower net gains on sales of AFS investment securities, partially offset by an increase in foreign exchange income due to remeasurement of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Net interest income before provision for credit loss was $53.6 million in 2018, an increase of $13.2 million or 33%, compared with $40.4 million in 2017. This increase reflected an increase in the net spread between the total internal FTP charges for loans and the total internal FTP credits for deposits provided to the Consumer and Business Banking and Commercial Banking segments. 

The income tax expense or benefit in the Other segment consists of the remaining unallocated income tax expense or benefit after allocating income tax expense to the two core segments. Income tax expense is allocated to the Consumer and Business Banking, as well as the Commercial Banking segments by applying segment effective tax rates to the segment income before income taxes.

##TABLE_END

As of December 31, 2019 , total assets were $44.20 billion , an increase of $3.15 billion or 8% from December 31, 2018 , primarily due to loan growth and an increase in AFS investment securities. The loan growth was primarily driven by strong increases in single-family residential and CRE loans. These increases were partially offset by decrease s in resale agreements and interest-bearing deposits with banks. 

As of December 31, 2019 , total liabilities were $39.18 billion , an increase of $2.56 billion or 7% from December 31, 2018 , primarily due to an increase in deposits, which was largely driven by an increase in time deposits. 

As of December 31, 2019 , total stockholders&#8217; equity was $5.02 billion , an increase of $593.6 million or 13% from December 31, 2018 . This increase was primarily due to $674.0 million in net income and a $39.8 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by $155.3 million of cash dividends declared on common stock.

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START (1) 

There were no securities of a single non-governmental agency issuer that exceeded 10% of stockholder&#8217;s equity as of December 31, 2019 . As of December 31, 2018 , securities issued by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development with an amortized cost of $474.9 million and a fair value of $448.6 million, exceeded 10% of stockholders&#8217; equity. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) 

Other securities are comprised of mutual funds, which are equity securities with readily determinable fair value. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments &#8212; Overall (Subtopic 825-10) : Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, these securities were reported as AFS investment securities with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). Upon adoption of ASU 2016-01, which became effective January 1, 2018, these securities were reclassified from AFS investment securities, at fair value to Investments in tax credit and other investments, net , on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with changes in fair value recorded in net income. 

##TABLE_END 

The fair value of AFS investment securities totaled $3.32 billion as of December 31, 2019 , compared with $2.74 billion as of December 31, 2018 . The $575.4 million or 21% increase was primarily attributable to purchases of U.S. government agency and U.S. government sponsored enterprise debt securities, U.S. government agency and U.S. government sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities and CLOs, partially offset by the sales, repayments and redemptions of U.S. government agency and U.S. government sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities and U.S. government agency and U.S. government sponsored enterprise debt securities, and maturities and sales of U.S. Treasury securities. 

The Company&#8217;s investment securities portfolio had an effective duration of 3.1 years as of December 31, 2019 , which shortened from 4.1 years as of December 31, 2018 , primarily due to the decline in interest rates. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , 97% and 99% , respectively, of the carrying value of the investment securities portfolio was rated &#8220;AA-&#8221; or &#8220;Aa3&#8221; or higher by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. Credit ratings of BBB- or higher by S&#38;P and Fitch Ratings (&#8220;Fitch&#8221;), or Baa3 or higher by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service (&#8220;Moody&#8217;s&#8221;), are considered investment grade. 

The Company&#8217;s AFS investment securities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in Other comprehensive income (loss) unless a security is deemed to be OTTI. Net unrealized losses on AFS investment securities were $3.4 million as of December 31, 2019 , which improved from net unrealized losses of $65.1 million as of December 31, 2018 . This change was primarily due to the decrease in interest rates. Gross unrealized losses on AFS investment securities totaled $23.2 million as of December 31, 2019 , compared with $70.8 million as of December 31, 2018 . Of the securities with gross unrealized losses, substantially all were rated investment grade as of both December 31, 2019 and 2018 , classified primarily based upon the lowest of the credit ratings issued by S&#38;P, Moody&#8217;s, or Fitch. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company had no intention to sell securities with unrealized losses and believed it was more-likely-than-not that it would not be required to sell such securities before recovery of their amortized cost. 

The Company assesses individual securities for OTTI for each reporting period. There were no OTTI credit losses recognized in earnings for both 2019 and 2018 . For a complete discussion and disclosure related to the Company&#8217;s investment securities, see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , Note 3 &#8212; Fair Value Measurement and Fair Value of Financial Instruments , and Note 5 &#8212; Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

The following table presents the weighted-average yields and contractual maturity distribution, excluding periodic principal payments, of the Company&#8217;s investment securities as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 . Actual maturities of mortgage-backed securities can differ from contractual maturities as the borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties. In addition, factors such as prepayments and interest rates may affect the yields on the carrying values of mortgage-backed securities.

Commercial 

The commercial loan portfolio, which comprised 75% of total loans as of both December 31, 2019 and 2018 , is discussed as follows. 

Commercial &#8212; Commercial and Industrial Loans. C&#38;I loans totaled $12.15 billion or 35% of total loans as of December 31, 2019 and $12.06 billion or 37% of total loans as of December 31, 2018 . The C&#38;I loan portfolio is well diversified by industry, with higher concentrations in the wholesale trade, manufacturing, energy, private equity, entertainment, and technology and life sciences. The Company monitors concentrations within C&#38;I loan portfolio by customer exposure and industry classifications, setting diversification targets and limits for specialized portfolios. The Company&#8217;s wholesale trade exposure largely consists of U.S. domiciled companies, many of which are based in California, that import goods from Greater China for U.S. consumer consumption. The Company also had a portfolio of broadly syndicated C&#38;I term loans, which totaled $894.6 million and $778.7 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The majority of the C&#38;I loans have variable interest rates. 

Commercial &#8212; Commercial Real Estate Loans. CRE loans totaled $10.28 billion or 30% of total loans as of December 31, 2019 , and $9.26 billion or 28% of total loans as of December 31, 2018 . The Company focuses on providing financing to experienced real estate investors and developers who have moderate levels of leverage, many of whom are long-time customers. Loans are underwritten with conservative standards for cash flows, debt service coverage and loan-to-value. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , 20% and 21% , respectively, of the total CRE loans were owner occupied properties; the remainder were non-owner occupied properties where 50% or more of the debt service for the loan is primarily provided by unaffiliated rental income from a third party. Interest rates on CRE loans may be fixed, variable or hybrid.

As illustrated by the above tables, the distribution of the CRE loan portfolio reflects the Company&#8217;s geographical footprint, with a primary concentration in California accounting for 76% and 79% of the CRE loan portfolio as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Changes in California&#8217;s economy and real estate values could have a significant impact on the collectability of these loans and the required level of allowance for loan losses. 

The Company&#8217;s CRE portfolio is broadly diversified by property type, which serves to mitigate some of the geographical concentration in California. The following table summarizes the Company&#8217;s CRE loan portfolio by property type, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 :

Purchased Credit-Impaired Loans 

Loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration since their origination and where it is probable that the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments are PCI loans. PCI loans are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. The carrying value of PCI loans totaled $222.9 million and $308.0 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. PCI loans are considered to be accruing due to the existence of the accretable yield, which represents the cash expected to be collected in excess of their carrying value, and which is not based on consideration given to contractual interest payments. The accretable yield was $50.5 million and $74.9 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. A nonaccretable difference is established for PCI loans to absorb losses expected on the contractual amounts of those loans, in excess of the fair value recorded as of the date of acquisition. Loan amounts absorbed by the nonaccretable difference do not affect the Consolidated Statement of Income or the allowance for credit losses. For additional details regarding PCI loans, see Note 7 &#8212; Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

Loans Held-for-Sale 

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , loans held-for-sale of $434 thousand and $275 thousand , respectively, consisted of single-family residential loans. At the time of commitment to originate or purchase a loan, a loan is determined to be held-for-investment if it is the Company&#8217;s intent to hold the loan to maturity or for the &#8220;foreseeable future&#8221;, subject to periodic reviews under the Company&#8217;s evaluation processes, including asset/liability and credit risk management. If the Company subsequently changes its intent to hold certain loans, those loans are transferred from held-for-investment to held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value. 

Loan Purchases, Transfers and Sales 

All loans originated by the Company are underwritten pursuant to the Company&#8217;s policies and procedures. Although the Company&#8217;s primary focus is on directly originated loans, in certain circumstances the Company also invests in broadly syndicated and participation loans. The broadly syndicated C&#38;I loans are marketed and sold primarily to institutional investors and generally more liquid than the Company&#8217;s directly originated loans. The Company may participate in these loans in the primary syndication market, or may purchase an interest in the post-syndication secondary market. As the Company typically receives more attractive financing terms on these loans, the Company is able to leverage the broadly syndicated portion of the loan portfolio in such a way that maximizes the levered return potential of the loan portfolio. The Company participates out interests in commercial loans to other financial institutions and also purchases participation loans from lead banks.

Net repurchase agreements totaled $200.0 million as of December 31, 2019 , after netting $250.0 million of gross repurchase agreements against gross resale agreements. This compares with net repurchase agreements which totaled $50.0 million as of December 31, 2018 , after netting $400.0 million of gross repurchase agreements against gross resale agreements. As of December 31, 2019 , gross repurchase agreements had interest rates ranging from 4.12% to 4.21% , original terms between 4.0 years and 9.0 years and remaining maturities between 2.8 years and 3.7 years. 

Repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and recorded as liabilities based on the values at which the securities are sold. As of December 31, 2019 , the collateral for the repurchase agreements was comprised of U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. government agency and U.S. government sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities. To ensure the market value of the underlying collateral remains sufficient, the Company monitors the fair value of collateral pledged relative to the principal amounts borrowed under repurchase agreements. The Company manages liquidity risks related to the repurchase agreements by sourcing funds from a diverse group of counterparties and entering into repurchase agreements with longer durations, when appropriate. For additional details, see Note 4 &#8212; Securities Purchased under Resale Agreements and Sold under Repurchase Agreements to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

Long-term debt totaled $147.1 million and $146.8 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Long-term debt is comprised of junior subordinated debt, which qualifies as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes. The junior subordinated debt was issued in connection with the Company&#8217;s various pooled trust preferred securities offerings and includes the value of the common stock issued by six wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company in conjunction with these offerings. The junior subordinated debt had a weighted-average interest rate of 3.98% and 3.77% during 2019 and 2018 , respectively, with remaining maturities ranging between 14.9 years to 17.7 years as of December 31, 2019 . 

Foreign Outstandings 

The Company&#8217;s overseas offices, which include the branch in Hong Kong and the subsidiary bank in China, are subject to the general risks inherent in conducting business in foreign countries, such as regulations, or economic and political uncertainties. In addition, the Company&#8217;s financial assets held in the Hong Kong branch and the subsidiary bank in China may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors. The Company&#8217;s country risk exposure is largely concentrated in China and Hong Kong. The following table presents the major financial assets held in the Company&#8217;s overseas offices as of December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 :

In addition, the beginning balance of retained earnings increased $10.5 million as of January 1, 2019, because the Company recognized a cumulative adjustment related to the deferred gains on the sale and leaseback transactions, which had occurred prior to the date of adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). For other factors that contributed to the changes in stockholders&#8217; equity, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data &#8212; Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders&#8217; Equity in this Form 10-K.

Regulatory Capital and Ratios 

The federal banking agencies have risk-based capital adequacy guidelines intended to ensure that banking organizations maintain capital that is commensurate with the degree of risk associated with a banking organization&#8217;s operations. See Item 1. Business &#8212; Supervision and Regulation &#8212; Capital Requirements in this Form 10-K for additional details. 

The Company is committed to maintaining capital at a level sufficient to assure the Company&#8217;s investors, customers and regulators that the Company and the Bank are financially sound. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , both the Company and the Bank were considered &#8220;well-capitalized,&#8221; meeting all capital requirements on a fully phased-in basis under the Basel III Capital Rules. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s capital ratios as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 under the Basel III Capital Rules, and those required by regulatory agencies for capital adequacy and well-capitalized classification purposes:

Other Matters 

LIBOR Transition 

On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom&#8217;s FCA, which regulates the LIBOR, announced that it will no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. Given LIBOR&#8217;s extensive use across financial markets, the transition away from LIBOR presents various risks and challenges to financial markets and institutions, including to the Company. The Company&#8217;s commercial and consumer businesses issue, trade, and hold various products that are currently indexed to LIBOR. A portion of the Company&#8217;s loans, derivatives, investment securities, resale agreements, FHLB advances, and deposits, as well as all the junior subordinated debt and repurchase agreements are indexed to LIBOR and mature after 2021. The volume of the Company&#8217;s products that are indexed to LIBOR is significant, and if not sufficiently planned for, the discontinuation of LIBOR could result in financial, operational, legal, reputational or compliance risks. 

The ARRC has proposed the SOFR as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. In early 2019, the ARRC released final recommended fallback contract language for new issuances of LIBOR indexed bilateral business loans, syndicated loans, floating-rate notes and securitizations. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. is expected to provide guidance on fallback contract language. 

Due to the uncertainty surrounding the future of LIBOR, the transition is anticipated to span several reporting periods through the end of 2021. Certain actions already taken by the Company related to the transition of LIBOR include (1) establishing a cross-functional team to identify, assess and monitor risks associated with the transition of LIBOR and other benchmark rates, (2) developing an inventory of LIBOR indexed products, and (3) implementing more robust fallback contract language for new loans, which identifies LIBOR cessation trigger events, provides for an alternative index and permits an adjustment to the margin as applicable. The Company monitors this activity and continues to evaluate the related risks. The Company&#8217;s cross-functional team also manages communication of the Company&#8217;s transition plans with both internal and external stakeholders and ensures that the Company appropriately updates its business processes, analytical tools, information systems and contract language to minimize disruption during and after the LIBOR transition. For additional information related to the potential impact surrounding the transition from LIBOR on the Company&#8217;s business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Form 10-K . 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 

In the course of the Company&#8217;s business, the Company may enter into or be a party to transactions that are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are considered to be off-balance sheet arrangements. Off-balance sheet arrangements are any contractual arrangements to which a nonconsolidated entity is a party and under which the Company has: (1) any obligation under a guarantee contract; (2) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets; (3) any obligation under certain derivative instruments; or (4) any obligation under a material variable interest held by the Company in a nonconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the Company. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Commitments to extend credit 

As a financial service provider, the Company routinely enters into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, commercial letters of credit for foreign and domestic trade, standby letters of credit (&#8220;SBLCs&#8221;), and financial guarantees to meet the financing needs of our customers. Many of these commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. The credit policies used in underwriting loans to customers are also used to extend these commitments. Under some of these contractual agreements, the Company may also have liabilities contingent upon the occurrence of certain events. The Company&#8217;s liquidity sources have been, and are expected to be, sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its lending activities. Information about the Company&#8217;s loan commitments, commercial letters of credit and SBLCs is provided in Note 15 &#8212; Commitments, Contingencies and Related Party Transactions to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

Guarantees 

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into various guarantee agreements in which the Company sells or securitizes loans with recourse. Under these guarantee arrangements, the Company is contingently obligated to repurchase the recourse component of the loans when the loans default. Additional information regarding guarantees is provided in Note 15 &#8212; Commitments, Contingencies and Related Party Transactions to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

Risk Management 

Overview 

In the course of conducting the Company&#8217;s businesses, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent to the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to the Company&#8217;s businesses. The Company operates under a Board approved ERM framework, which outlines its company-wide approach to risk management and oversight and describes the structures and practices employed to manage the current and emerging risks inherent to the Company. The Company&#8217;s ERM program incorporates risk management throughout the organization in identifying, managing, monitoring, and reporting risks. Our ERM program identifies EWBC&#8217;s major risk categories as capital risk, strategic risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk, operational risk, reputational risk, and legal and compliance risk. ERM is comprised of senior management of the Company and headed by the Chief Risk Officer. 

The Board of Directors monitors the ERM program to ensure independent review and oversight of the Company&#8217;s risk appetite and control environment. The Risk Oversight Committee provides focused oversight of the Company&#8217;s identified enterprise risk categories on behalf of the full Board of Directors. Management applies various strategies to reduce the risks to which the Company&#8217;s operations are exposed and the risks are overseen by the various management committees of which the Risk Oversight Committee is the focal point for the monitoring and review of enterprise risk. 

Our ERM program is executed along the three lines of defense model, which provides for a consistent and standardized risk management control environment enterprise-wide. The first line of defense is comprised of production, operational, and support units. The second line of defense is comprised of various risk management and control functions charged with monitoring and managing specific major risk categories and/or risk subcategories. The third line of defense is comprised of the Internal Audit function and Independent Asset Review. Internal Audit provides assurance and evaluates the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes as established by the Company. Internal Audit has organizational independence and objectivity, and reports directly to the Board&#8217;s Audit Committee. Further discussion and analyses of each major risk area are included in the following sub-sections of the Risk Management. 

Credit Risk Management 

Credit risk is the risk that a borrower or counterparty will fail to perform according to terms and conditions of a loan or investment and expose the Company to loss. Credit risk exists with many of our assets and exposures such as loans and certain derivatives. The majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities. 

The Risk Oversight Committee has primary oversight responsibility of identifying enterprise risk categories including credit risk. The Risk Oversight Committee monitors management&#8217;s assessment of asset quality and credit risk trends, credit quality administration and underwriting standards, portfolio credit risk management and processes to enable management to control credit risk including diversification and liquidity. At the management level, the Credit Risk Management Committee has primary oversight responsibility for credit risk. The Credit Risk Management Committee keeps senior management and the Board&#8217;s Risk Oversight Committee informed about enterprise-wide credit risk issues. The Senior Credit Supervision function manages credit policy and provides the resources to manage the line of business transactional credit risk, assuring that all exposure is risk rated according to the requirements of the credit risk rating policy. The Senior Credit Supervision function reports on the overall credit risk portfolio to senior management and the Risk Oversight Committee. The Independent Asset Review function supports a strong credit risk management culture by providing independent and objective assessments of the quality of underwriting and documentation, reporting directly to the Board&#8217;s Risk Oversight Committee. 

Non-PCI Nonperforming Assets 

Non-PCI nonperforming assets are comprised of nonaccrual loans, OREO, and other nonperforming assets. OREO and other nonperforming assets are repossessed assets and properties acquired through foreclosure, or through full or partial satisfaction of loans held-for-investment. Generally, loans are placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due or when the full collection of principal or interest becomes uncertain regardless of the length of past due status. Collectability is generally assessed based on economic and business conditions, the borrower&#8217;s financial conditions and the adequacy of collateral, if any. For additional details regarding the Company&#8217;s non-PCI nonaccrual loan policy, see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Loans Held-for-Investment to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

Total assets and loans held-for-investment include PCI loans of $222.9 million , $308.0 million , $482.3 million , $642.4 million and $970.8 million as of December 31, 2019 , 2018 , 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. 

##TABLE_END 

Period-over-period changes to nonaccrual loans represent loans that are placed on nonaccrual status in accordance with the Company&#8217;s accounting policy, offset by reductions for loans that are paid down, charged off, sold, foreclosed, or no longer classified as nonaccrual as a result of continued performance and improvement in the borrowers&#8217; financial conditions and loan repayments. Nonaccrual loans were $120.2 million as of December 31, 2019 , an increase of $34.5 million or 40% from $85.7 million as of December 31, 2018 . This increase in nonaccrual loans was primarily driven by three energy loans totaling $33.0 million from our C&#38;I loan portfolio. These loans were primarily secured by collateral. Nonaccrual loans as a percentage of loans held-for-investment increased to 0.35% as of December 31, 2019 from 0.26% as of December 31, 2018 . C&#38;I nonaccrual loans were 62% and 51% of total nonaccrual loans as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Credit risks related to the C&#38;I nonaccrual loans were partially mitigated by the collateral in place. As of December 31, 2019 , $35.6 million or 30% of the $120.2 million non-PCI nonaccrual loans consisted of nonaccrual loans that were less than 90 days delinquent. In comparison, $23.8 million or 28% of the $85.7 million non-PCI nonaccrual loans consisted of nonaccrual loans that were less than 90 days delinquent as of December 31, 2018 . 

TDR are loans, where contractual terms have been modified by the Company for economic or legal reasons related to borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, and grants a concession to the borrower that the Company would not otherwise consider. For additional details regarding the Company&#8217;s TDR policy, see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Troubled Debt Restructurings to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

##TABLE_END

As of December 31, 2019 , performing TDRs were $77.9 million , an increase of $44.7 million or 134% from $33.2 million as of December 31, 2018 . This increase mainly reflected performing C&#38;I, construction and HELOC loans that were newly designated as TDRs and the transfer of C&#38;I, CRE and HELOC loans from nonperforming status, partially offset by paydowns and payoffs. Nonperforming TDRs were $54.6 million as of December 31, 2019 , an increase of $24.3 million or 80% from $30.3 million as of December 31, 2018 . This increase reflected nonperforming C&#38;I, single-family residential and HELOC loans that were newly designated as TDRs, partially offset by paydowns and payoffs of several nonperforming C&#38;I and CRE loans, and the transfer of C&#38;I, CRE and HELOC loans to performing status . 

The Company&#8217;s impaired loans are predominantly made up of non-PCI loans held-for-investment on nonaccrual status and any non-PCI loans modified as a TDR, on either accrual or nonaccrual status. For additional details regarding the Company&#8217;s impaired loan policy, see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Impaired Loans to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

##TABLE_END

As of December 31, 2019 , the allowance for loan losses included $5.6 million for impaired loans with a total recorded investment balance of $68.4 million . In comparison, the allowance for loan losses included $4.0 million for impaired loans with a total recorded investment balance of $31.1 million as of December 31, 2018 . 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

Allowance for credit losses consists of allowance for loan losses and allowance for unfunded credit commitments. Allowance for loan losses is comprised of reserves for two components, performing loans with unidentified incurred losses, as well as nonperforming loans and TDRs (collectively, impaired loans), and excludes loans held-for-sale. The allowance for loan losses is calculated after analyzing internal historical loan loss experience, internal loan risk ratings, economic conditions, bank risks, portfolio risks and any other pertinent information. Unfunded credit reserves include reserves provided for unfunded lending commitments, SBLCs, and recourse obligations for loans sold. The allowance for credit losses is increased by the provision for credit losses, which is charged against the current period&#8217;s results of operations, and increased or decreased by the net amount of recoveries or charge-offs during the period. The allowance for unfunded credit commitments is included in Accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Net adjustments to the allowance for unfunded credit commitments are included in Provision for credit losses on the Consolidated Statement of Income. 

The Company is committed to maintaining the allowance for credit losses at a level that is commensurate with the estimated inherent losses in the loan portfolio, including unfunded credit reserves. In addition to regular quarterly reviews of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, the Company performs ongoing assessments of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio. While the Company believes that the allowance for loan losses is appropriate as of December 31, 2019 , future allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to, accounting standard and regulatory changes, loan growth, portfolio performance and general economic conditions. T he Company adopted ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments &#8212; Credit Losses &#160;(Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instrument on January 1, 2020. For additional information, see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; Recent Accounting Pronouncements &#8212; Standards Adopted in 2020. The calculation of the allowance for credit losses involves subjective and complex judgments. For additional details about the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses, including the methodologies used, see Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7 &#8212; Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

##TABLE_END

As of December 31, 2019 , the allowance for loan losses amounted to $358.3 million or 1.03% of loans held-for-investment, compared with $311.3 million or 0.96% and $287.1 million or 0.99% of loans held-for-investment as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The increase in the allowance for loan losses was largely due to loan portfolio growth, as well as downward migration in the credit risk ratings of C&#38;I loans. 

The provision for credit losses includes provision for loan losses and unfunded credit reserves. A provision for credit losses is charged to income to bring the allowance for credit losses to a level deemed appropriate by the Company based on the calculation methodology. The provision for credit losses was $98.7 million for 2019 , compared with $64.3 million and $46.3 million for 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The increase in the provision for credit losses for 2019 , compared to 2018 and 2017 , was reflective of the overall loan portfolio growth and increased charge-offs in C&#38;I loans and a downward migration in the credit risk ratings of C&#38;I loans during 2019 . 

The Company believes the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was appropriate to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments, on each respective date. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type and the ratio of each loan type to total loans held-for-investment as of the periods indicated:

##TABLE_END

The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses for both non-PCI and PCI loans. An allowance for loan losses for PCI loans is based on the Company&#8217;s estimates of cash flows expected to be collected from PCI loans. PCI loan losses are estimated collectively for groups of loans with similar characteristics. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company had no allowance for loan losses on $222.9 million of PCI loans. In comparison, the Company established an allowance of $22 thousand and $58 thousand on $308.0 million and $482.3 million of PCI loans as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The allowance balances of the PCI loans for these periods were attributed mainly to CRE loans. 

Liquidity Risk Management 

Liquidity 

Liquidity is a financial institution&#8217;s capacity to meet its deposit and other counterparties&#8217; obligations as they come due, or to obtain adequate funding at a reasonable cost to meet those obligations. The objective of liquidity management is to manage the potential mismatch of asset and liability cash flows. Maintaining an adequate level of liquidity depends on the institution&#8217;s ability to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected cash flows, and collateral needs without adversely affecting daily operations or the financial condition of the institution. To achieve this objective, the Company analyzes its liquidity risk, maintains readily available liquid assets and utilizes diverse funding sources including its stable core deposit base. 

The Board of Directors&#8217; Risk Oversight Committee has primary oversight responsibility. At the management level, the Company&#8217;s Asset/Liability Committee (&#8220;ALCO&#8221;) sets the liquidity guidelines that govern the day-to-day active management of the Company&#8217;s liquidity position. The ALCO regularly monitors the Company&#8217;s liquidity status and related management processes, and provides regular reports to the Board of Directors. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Liquidity Sources. The Company&#8217;s primary source of funding is from its deposits generated by its banking business, which is relatively stable and low-cost. Total deposits amounted to $37.32 billion as of December 31, 2019 , compared with $35.44 billion as of December 31, 2018 . The Company&#8217;s loan-to-deposit ratio was 93% and 91% as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. In addition, the Company has access to various sources of wholesale funding, and has borrowing capacity at the FHLB and FRB to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio, meet daily cash demands and allow management flexibility to execute its business strategy. Economic conditions and the stability of capital markets impact the Company&#8217;s access to and the cost of wholesale financing. The Company&#8217;s access to capital markets is also affected by the ratings received from various credit rating agencies. See Item 7 &#8212; MD&#38;A &#8212; Balance Sheet Analysis &#8212; Deposits and Other Sources of Funds in this Form 10-K for further detail related to the Company&#8217;s funding sources. 

The Company&#8217;s liquid asset portfolio includes cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing deposits with banks, short-term resale agreements and AFS investment securities. The following table presents the Company&#8217;s liquid asset portfolio as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 :

##TABLE_END

Unencumbered assets totaled $6.70 billion and $6.05 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Investment securities included as part of liquidity sources are primarily comprised of mortgage-backed securities and debt securities issued by U.S. government agency and U.S. government sponsored enterprises, foreign bonds and U.S. Treasury securities. The Company believes these AFS investment securities provide quick sources of liquidity to obtain financing, regardless of market conditions, through sale or pledging. 

As a means of augmenting the Company&#8217;s liquidity, the Company maintains available borrowing capacity under secured borrowing lines with the FHLB and FRB, unsecured federal funds lines of credit with various correspondent banks and several master repurchase agreements with major brokerage companies. The Company&#8217;s available borrowing capacity with the FHLB and FRB was $6.83 billion and $2.97 billion , respectively, as of December 31, 2019 . Unencumbered loans and/or securities were pledged to the FHLB and FRB discount window as collateral. Eligibility of collateral is defined in guidelines from the FHLB and FRB and is subject to change at their discretion. The Bank&#8217;s unsecured federal funds lines of credit, subject to availability, totaled $600.0 million with correspondent banks as of December 31, 2019 . The Company believes that its liquidity sources are sufficient to meet all reasonably foreseeable short-term needs over the next 12 months. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Liquidity for East West. East West&#8217;s primary source of liquidity is from cash dividends by its subsidiary, East West Bank. The Bank is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends as discussed in Item 1 . Business &#8212; Supervision and Regulation &#8212; Dividends and Other Transfers of Funds in this Form 10-K. The Bank paid total dividends of $190.0 million and $160.0 million to East West in 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 

Liquidity Risk &#8212; Liquidity Stress Testing. Liquidity stress testing is performed at the Company level, as well as at the foreign subsidiary and foreign branch levels. Stress testing and scenario analysis are intended to quantify the potential impact of a liquidity event on the financial and liquidity position of the entity. These scenarios include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources, market triggers and potential uses of funding and economic conditions in certain countries. In addition, Company specific events are incorporated into the stress testing. Liquidity stress tests are conducted to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons, both immediate and longer term, and over a variety of stressed conditions. Given the range of potential stresses, the Company maintains a series of contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for individual entities. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company was not aware of any trends, events or uncertainties that would or were reasonably likely to, have a material effect on its liquidity position. Furthermore, the Company is not aware of any material commitments for capital expenditures in the foreseeable future. 

Consolidated Cash Flows Analysis 

The following table presents a summary of the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the periods indicated, which may be helpful to highlight business strategies and macro trends. In addition to this cash flow analysis, the discussion related to liquidity in Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Risk Management &#8212; Liquidity Risk Management &#8212; Liquidity may provide a more useful context in evaluating the Company&#8217;s liquidity position and related activity.

Market Risk Management 

Market risk is the risk that the Company&#8217;s financial condition may change resulting from adverse movements in market rates or prices including: interest rates, foreign exchange rates, interest rate contracts, investment securities prices, and related risk resulting from mismatches in rate sensitive assets and liabilities. 

The Board&#8217;s Risk Oversight Committee has primary oversight responsibility. At the management level, the ALCO establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market risk management activities. Corporate Treasury supports the ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks. 

Interest Rate Risk Management 

Interest rate risk results primarily from the Company&#8217;s traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans, and is the primary market risk for the Company. Economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates and consumer preferences impact the level of noninterest-bearing funding sources at the Company, and affect the difference between the interest the Company earns on interest-earning assets and pays on interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, changes in interest rates can influence the rate of principal prepayments on loans and the speed of deposit withdrawals. Due to the pricing term mismatches and the embedded options inherent in certain products, changes in market interest rates not only affect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic value of these interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Other market risks include foreign currency exchange risk and equity price risk. These risks are not considered significant to the Company and no separate quantitative information concerning these risks is presented herein. 

With oversight by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, the ALCO coordinates the overall management of the Company&#8217;s interest rate risk. The ALCO meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing the Company&#8217;s open market positions and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk. Management of interest rate risk is carried out primarily through strategies involving the Company&#8217;s investment securities portfolio, loan portfolio, available funding channels and capital market activities. In addition, the Company&#8217;s policies permit the use of derivative instruments to assist in managing interest rate risk. Refer to Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Risk Management &#8212; Market Risk Management &#8212; Derivatives in this Form 10-K for additional information. 

The interest rate risk exposure is measured and monitored through various risk management tools, which include a simulation model that performs interest rate sensitivity analyses under multiple interest rate scenarios. The model incorporates the Company&#8217;s cash instruments, loans, investment securities, resale agreements, deposits, borrowings and repurchase agreements, as well as financial instruments from the Company&#8217;s foreign operations. The Company incorporates both a static balance sheet and a forward growth balance sheet in order to perform these analyses. The simulated interest rate scenarios include a non-parallel shift in the yield curve (&#8220;rate shock&#8221;) and a gradual non-parallel shift in the yield curve (&#8220;rate ramp&#8221;). In addition, the Company also performs simulations using alternative interest rate scenarios, including various permutations of the yield curve flattening, steepening or inverting. Results of these various simulations are used to formulate and gauge strategies to achieve a desired risk profile within the Company&#8217;s capital and liquidity guidelines. 

The net interest income simulation model is based on the actual maturity and re-pricing characteristics of the Company&#8217;s interest-rate sensitive assets, liabilities and related derivative contracts. It also incorporates various assumptions, which management believes to be reasonable but may have a significant impact on results. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the timing and magnitude of changes in interest rates, the yield curve evolution and shape, the correlation between various interest rate indices, financial instrument future repricing characteristics and spread relative to benchmark rates, and the effect of interest rate floors and caps. The modeled results are highly sensitive to deposit decay and deposit beta assumptions, derived from a regression analysis of the Company&#8217;s historical deposit data. Deposit beta commonly refers to the correlation of the change in interest rates paid on deposits to changes in benchmark market interest rates. The model is also sensitive to the loan and investment prepayment assumptions, based on an independent model and the Company&#8217;s historical prepayment data, which consider anticipated prepayments under different interest rate environments. 

Simulation results are highly dependent on input assumptions. To the extent actual behavior is different from the assumptions in the models, there could be a material change in interest rate sensitivity. The assumptions applied in the model are documented and supported for reasonableness, and periodically back-tested to assess their effectiveness. The Company makes appropriate calibrations to the model as needed, continually refining the model, methodology and results. Changes to key model assumptions are reviewed by the ALCO. Scenario results do not reflect strategies that management could employ to limit the impact of changing interest rate expectations. 

Twelve-Month Net Interest Income Simulation . Net Interest Income simulation is a modeling technique that looks at interest rate risk through earnings. It projects the changes in interest rate sensitive asset and liability cash flows, expressed in terms of Net Interest Income, over a specified time horizon for defined interest rates scenarios. Net Interest Income simulations generate insight into the impact of changes in market rates on earnings and guide risk management decisions. The Company assesses interest rate risk by comparing net interest income using different interest rate scenarios. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s net interest income sensitivity as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 related to an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates of 100 and 200 basis points in both directions:

##TABLE_END 

The Company&#8217;s estimated twelve-month net interest income sensitivity as of December 31, 2019 was lower compared with December 31, 2018 for both the upward 100 and 200 basis point rate scenarios. This reflects a greater rate of upward repricing in the Company&#8217;s deposit portfolio, offsetting simulated increases in interest income from higher interest rates on assets. In both simulated downward interest rate scenarios, sensitivity decreased mainly due to the impact of the changes in the yield curve between December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. 

The Company&#8217;s net interest income profile as of December 31, 2019 reflects an asset sensitive position. Net interest income would be expected to increase if interest rates rise and to decrease if interest rates decline. The Company is naturally asset sensitive due to the large share of variable rate loans in its loan portfolio, which are primarily linked to Prime and LIBOR indices. The Company&#8217;s interest income is vulnerable to changes in short-term interest rates. The Company&#8217;s deposit portfolio is primarily comprised of non-maturity deposits, which are not directly tied to short-term interest rate indices, but are, nevertheless, sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates. 

The federal funds target rate was between 1.50% and 1.75% as of December 31, 2019 and between 2.25% and 2.50% as of December 31, 2018 . In its statement released on December 11, 2019, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate to a range of between 1.50% to 1.75% and signaled it would stay on hold through 2020 amid muted inflation. 

While an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates was used in the simulation model described in the preceding paragraphs, the Company believes that any shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and would therefore have a more modest impact. The rate ramp table below shows the net income volatility under a gradual non-parallel shift upward and downward of the yield curve in even quarterly increments over the first twelve months, followed by rates held constant thereafter:

##TABLE_END 

The Company believes that the rate ramp table, shown above, when evaluated together with the results of the rate shock simulation, presents a better indication of the potential impact to the Company&#8217;s twelve-month net interest income in a rising and falling rate scenario. Between December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the Company&#8217;s modeled sensitivity slightly decreased under a ramp simulation. This reflects model refinements to better incorporate the current yield curve in the analysis, as well as the gradual spreading of interest rate changes over 12 months, rather than at the end of each quarter. 

Economic Value of Equity at Risk . Economic value of equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;) is a cash flow calculation that takes the present value of all asset cash flows and subtracts the present value of all liability cash flows. This calculation is used for asset/liability management and measures changes in the economic value of the bank. The fair market values of a bank's assets and liabilities are directly linked to interest rates. In some ways, the economic value approach provides a broader scope than the net income volatility approach since it captures all anticipated cash flows. 

EVE simulation reflects the effect of interest rate shifts on the value of the Company and is used to assess the degree of interest rate risk exposure. In contrast to the earnings perspective, the economic perspective identifies risk arising from repricing or maturity gaps for the life of the balance sheet. Changes in economic value indicate anticipated changes in the value of the bank&#8217;s future cash flows. Thus, the economic perspective can provide a leading indicator of the bank&#8217;s future earnings and capital values. The economic valuation method also reflects those sensitivities across the full maturity spectrum of the bank&#8217;s assets and liabilities. 

The following table presents the Company&#8217;s EVE sensitivity as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 related to an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates of 100 and 200 basis points in both directions:

The percentage change represents net portfolio value of the Company in a stable interest rate environment versus net portfolio value in the various rate scenarios. 

##TABLE_END 

The Company&#8217;s EVE sensitivity for the upward interest rate scenarios as of December 31, 2019 increased while the sensitivity for the downward interest rate scenarios as of December 31, 2019 decreased, as compared with the results as of December 31, 2018 . The changes in EVE sensitivity during this period were primarily due to the shape and level of the yield curve. 

The Company&#8217;s EVE profile as of December 31, 2019 reflects an asset sensitive EVE position. Given the uncertainty of the magnitude, timing and direction of future interest rate movements, and the shape of the yield curve, actual results may vary from those predicted by the Company&#8217;s model. 

Derivatives 

It is the Company&#8217;s policy not to speculate on the future direction of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. However, the Company will, from time to time, enter into derivative transactions in order to reduce its exposure to market risks, primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The Company believes that these derivative transactions, when properly structured and managed, may provide a hedge against inherent risk in certain assets and liabilities and against risk in specific transactions. Hedging transactions may be implemented using a variety of derivative instruments such as swaps, forwards and options. Prior to entering into any hedging activities, the Company analyzes the costs and benefits of the hedge in comparison to alternative strategies. In addition, the Company enters into derivative transactions in order to assist customers with their risk management objectives, primarily to manage exposures to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodity prices. To economically hedge against the derivative contracts entered into with the Company&#8217;s customers, the Company enters into mirrored derivative contracts with third-party financial institutions. The exposures from derivative transactions are collateralized by cash and/or eligible securities based on limits as set forth in the respective agreements entered between the Company and the financial institutions. 

The Company is subject to credit risk associated with the counterparties to the derivative contracts. This counterparty credit risk is a multidimensional form of risk, affected by both the exposure and credit quality of the counterparty, both of which are sensitive to market-induced changes. The Company&#8217;s Credit Risk Management Committee provides oversight of credit risks and the Company has guidelines in place to manage counterparty concentration, tenor limits and collateral. The Company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties, entering into legally enforceable master netting arrangements and requiring collateral arrangements, where possible. The Company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to institutional third parties through the use of credit risk participation agreements (&#8220;RPAs&#8221;). Certain derivative contracts are required to be centrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty credit risk. The Company incorporates credit value adjustments and other market standard methodologies to appropriately reflect its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty&#8217;s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements of its derivatives. 

Fair Value Hedges &#8212; As of December 31, 2019 , the Company had two cancellable interest rate swap contracts with original terms of 20 years. These swap contracts involve the exchange of variable rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amounts. The changes in fair value of the hedged brokered certificates of deposit are expected to be effectively offset by the changes in fair value of the swaps throughout the terms of these contracts. 

Net Investment Hedges &#8212; ASC 830-20, Foreign Currency Matters &#8212; Foreign Currency Transactions and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, allow hedging of the foreign currency risk of a net investment in a foreign operation. The Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its investment in East West Bank (China) Limited, a non-USD functional currency subsidiary in China. The hedging instruments designated as net investment hedges, involve hedging the risk of changes in the USD equivalent value of a designated monetary amount of the Company&#8217;s net investment in East West Bank (China) Limited, against the risk of adverse changes in the foreign currency exchange rate of the RMB. As of December 31, 2019 , the outstanding foreign currency forwards effectively hedged approximately 50% of the RMB exposure in East West Bank (China) Limited. The fluctuation in foreign currency translation of the hedged exposure is expected to be offset by changes in the fair value of the forwards. 

Interest Rate Contracts &#8212; The Company offers various interest rate derivative contracts to its customers. When derivative transactions are executed with its customers, the derivative contracts are offset by paired trades with third-party financial institutions including with central clearing organizations. Certain derivative contracts entered with central clearing organizations are settled-to-market daily to the extent the central clearing organizations&#8217; rulebooks legally characterize the variation margin as settlement. Derivative contracts allow borrowers to lock in attractive intermediate and long-term fixed rate financing while not increasing the interest rate risk to the Company. These transactions are not linked to specific Company assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet or to forecasted transactions in a hedging relationship and, therefore, are economic hedges. The contracts are marked to market at each reporting period. The changes in fair values of the derivative contracts traded with third-party financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the derivative transactions executed with customers throughout the terms of these contracts, except for the credit valuation adjustment component. The Company records credit valuation adjustments on derivatives to properly reflect the variances of credit worthiness between the Company and the counterparties, considering the effects of enforceable master netting agreements and collateral arrangements. 

Foreign Exchange Contracts &#8212; The Company enters into foreign exchange contracts with its customers, consisting of forward, spot, swap and option contracts to accommodate the business needs of its customers. For a portion of the foreign exchange contracts entered into with its customers, the Company either enters into offsetting foreign exchange contracts with third-party financial institutions or acquires collateral primarily in the form of cash on a portfolio basis to manage its exposure. The changes in the fair values entered with third-party financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the foreign exchange transactions executed with the customers throughout the terms of these contracts. The Company also utilizes foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to mitigate the economic effect of fluctuations in certain foreign currency on-balance sheet assets and liabilities, primarily foreign currency denominated deposits offered to its customers. The Company&#8217;s policies permit taking proprietary currency positions within approved limits, in compliance with the proprietary trading exemption provided under Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Company does not speculate in the foreign exchange markets, and actively manages its foreign exchange exposures within prescribed risk limits and defined controls. 

Credit Contracts &#8212; The Company may periodically enter into RPAs to manage the credit exposure on interest rate contracts associated with its syndicated loans. The Company may enter into protection sold or protection purchased RPAs with institutional counterparties. Under the RPA, the Company will receive or make a payment if a borrower defaults on the related interest rate contract. The Company manages its credit risk on the RPAs by monitoring the credit worthiness of the borrowers, which is based on the Company&#8217;s normal credit review process. 

Equity Contracts &#8212; As part of the loan origination process, from time to time, the Company obtained equity warrants to purchase preferred and/or common stock of technology and life sciences companies it provides loans to. The warrants included in the Consolidated Financial Statements were from public and private companies. 

Commodity Contracts &#8212; The Company entered into energy commodity contracts with its customers to allow them to hedge against the risk of fluctuation in energy commodity prices. To economically hedge against the risk of fluctuation in commodity prices in the products offered to its customers, the Company enters into offsetting commodity contracts with third-party financial institutions including with central clearing organizations. Certain derivative contracts entered with central clearing organizations are settled to market daily to the extent the central clearing organizations&#8217; rulebooks legally characterize the variation margin as settlement. The changes in fair values of the energy commodity contracts traded with third-party financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the energy commodity transactions executed with customers throughout the terms of these contracts. 

Additional information on the Company&#8217;s derivatives is presented in Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , Note 3 &#8212; Fair Value Measurement and Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Note 6 &#8212; Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

Impact of Inflation 

The consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this report have been prepared according to GAAP, which require the measurement of financial and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs and the effect that general inflation may have on both short-term and long-term interest rates. Since almost all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than do general levels of inflation. Although inflation expectations do affect interest rates, interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are fundamental to understanding the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. Some accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments. In addition, some accounting policies require significant judgment in applying complex accounting principles to individual transactions to determine the most appropriate treatment. The Company has procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. 

Certain accounting policies are considered to have a critical effect on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company&#8217;s judgment. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that require the most complex or subjective judgments and are reflective of significant uncertainties, and whose actual results could differ from the Company&#8217;s estimates. Future changes in the key variables could change future valuations and impact the results of operations. The following is a discussion of the critical accounting policies including significant estimates. In each area, the Company has identified the most important variables in the estimation process. The Company has used the best information available to make the estimations necessary for the related assets and liabilities. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

In determining the fair value of financial instruments, the Company uses market prices of the same or similar instruments whenever such prices are available. The Company does not use prices involving distressed sellers in determining fair value. Changes in the market conditions such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities, may increase variability or reduce the availability of market price used to determine fair value. If observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain, then fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flows analysis. These modeling techniques incorporate management&#8217;s assessments regarding assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability, including assumptions about the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique and the risk of nonperformance. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Company could result in different estimates of fair value of financial instruments. 

Significant judgment is also required to determine the fair value hierarchy for certain financial instruments. When fair values are based on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement, the financial assets and liabilities are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. Total recurring Level 3 assets were $421 thousand and $673 thousand as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and there were no recurring Level 3 liabilities as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 . For a complete discussion on the Company&#8217;s fair value hierarchy of financial instruments, fair value measurement techniques and assumptions, and the impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements, see Note 3 &#8212; Fair Value Measurement and Fair Value of Financial Instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded credit commitments. Allowance for credit losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve sufficient to absorb losses inherent in our credit portfolio. Management&#8217;s determination of the appropriateness of the allowance is based on periodic evaluation of the loan portfolio, lending-related commitments and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires numerous estimates as further discussed below. The allowance for loan losses consists of general and specific reserves. Non-impaired loans are evaluated as part of the general reserve while impaired loans are subject to a specific reserve. In determining the allowance for credit losses, the Company individually evaluates impaired loans, applies loss rates to non-impaired loans and unfunded lending commitments, SBLCs and recourse obligations for loans sold. General reserves are calculated by utilizing both qualitative and quantitative factors. 

The Company&#8217;s methodology to determine the overall appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is based on a classified asset migration model (the &#8220;Model&#8221;) with quantitative factors and qualitative considerations. The Model examines pools of loans having similar characteristics and analyzes their loss rates over a historical period. The Company assigns loss rates to each loan grade within each pool of loans. Loss rates derived by the migration model are based predominantly on historical loss trends that may not be entirely indicative of the actual or inherent loss potential within its current loan portfolio. Additionally, the Company utilizes qualitative and environmental factors as adjusting mechanisms to supplement the historical results of the Model. Qualitative and environmental factors are reflected as percentage adjustments and are added to the historical loss rates derived from the Model to determine the appropriate allowance for each loan pool. The evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires numerous estimates and judgments that are susceptible to revision as more information becomes available. To the extent actual results differ from estimates or management&#8217;s judgment, the allowance for credit losses may be greater or less than future charge-offs. 

Quantitative factors include the Company&#8217;s historical loss experience, delinquency and net charge-off trends, collateral values, changes in nonperforming loans, probability of commitment usage, and other factors. Qualitative considerations include, but are not limited to, prevailing economic or market conditions, relative risk profiles of various loan segments, volume concentrations, growth trends, delinquency and nonaccrual status, problem loan trends, geographic concentrations, credit risk factors for loans outstanding and the terms and expiration dates of the unfunded credit facilities. 

The specific reserve is measured by the difference between the recorded value of impaired loans and their impaired value. Impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at a designated discount rate or, as appropriate, at the loan&#8217;s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent, less cost to sell. 

On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , which requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses to be based on management&#8217;s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Company&#8217;s relevant financial assets. The Company&#8217;s lifetime expected credit losses are determined using macroeconomic forecast assumptions and management judgments applicable to and through the expected life of the loan portfolios, and are net of expected recoveries on loans that were previously charged off. Management believes the newly adopted methodologies are appropriate given the Company&#8217;s size and level of complexity. As the Company adds new products, increases the complexity of the loan portfolio and expands the geographic coverage, the Company expects to continue to enhance its methodologies to keep pace with the changing credit environment and the size and complexity of the loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments. Changes in any of the factors cited above could have a significant impact on the allowance for credit loss calculation. For additional information on allowance for credit losses, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7 &#8212; Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

Goodwill Impairment 

Under ASC 350, Intangibles &#8212; Goodwill and Other , goodwill is required to be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment at least annually. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business, indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test. Impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level (which is the same level as the Company&#8217;s major operating segments identified in Note 21 &#8212; Business Segments to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K). The Company conducts a two-step goodwill impairment test. The first step is to identify potential impairment by determining the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing such fair value to its corresponding carrying value. In order to determine the fair value of the reporting units, a combined income approach and market approach is used (additional information on process and methodology used to conduct goodwill impairment testing is described in Note 9 &#8212; Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K). If the fair value is less than the carrying value, then the second step of the test is needed to measure the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination. If the carrying value of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, then the Company would recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess, which would be recorded as a charge to noninterest expense. The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. 

Significant judgment is applied and assumptions are made when estimating the fair value of the reporting units. Estimates of fair value are dependent upon various factors including estimates of the profitability of the Company&#8217;s reporting units, long term growth rates and the estimated market cost of equity. Imprecision in estimating these factors can affect the estimated fair value of the reporting units. Certain events or circumstances could have a negative effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting units, including declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions and adverse regulatory or legislative changes, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period. 

In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test on all reporting units, and no goodwill impairment was recognized as a result of the test. For additional information on goodwill, see Note 9 &#8212; Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

Income Taxes 

The Company is subject to income tax laws of the various tax jurisdictions in which it conducts business, including the U.S., its states and the municipalities, and the tax jurisdictions in Hong Kong and China. The Company estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to these various tax jurisdictions. The estimated income tax expense or benefit is reported on the Consolidated Statement of Income. 

Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from various tax jurisdictions and are reported in Accrued expenses and other liabilities or Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In estimating accrued taxes, the Company assesses the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent, and other pertinent information. The income tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the Company and the relevant government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining the tax accruals and in evaluating the tax positions, including evaluating uncertain tax positions. Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, the status of examinations by the tax authorities, and newly enacted statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance that could impact the relative merits and risks of tax positions. These changes, when they occur, impact tax expense and can materially affect the operating results. The Company reviews its tax positions on a quarterly basis and makes adjustments to accrued taxes as new information becomes available. 

Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. Such assets arise due to temporary differences between the financial accounting basis and the income tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as from NOL and tax credit carryforwards. The Company regularly evaluates the realizability of deferred tax assets. The available evidence used in connection with the evaluations includes taxable income, potential tax-planning strategies, and projected future reversals of deferred tax items. 

A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. It reduces the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realized. The Company has concluded that it is more-likely-than-not that all of the benefit of the deferred tax assets will be realized, with the exception of the deferred tax assets related to certain state NOLs. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded for these amounts. 

The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, in an income tax return. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that management believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of realization upon settlement. Tax benefits not meeting our realization criteria represent unrecognized tax benefits. The Company establishes a liability for potential taxes, interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions based on facts and circumstances, including the interpretation of existing law, new judicial or regulatory guidance, and the status of tax audits. The Company believes that adequate provisions have been recorded for all income tax uncertainties consistent with ASC 740, Income Taxes as of December 31, 2019 . See Note 14 &#8212; Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information on income taxes. 

Recently Issued Accounting Standards 

For detailed discussion and disclosure on new accounting pronouncements adopted and recent accounting standards, see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

Supplemental Information &#8212; Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

To supplement the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company uses certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to GAAP. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company&#8217;s performance that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. A non-GAAP financial measure may also be a financial metric that is not required by GAAP or other applicable requirement. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance, and allow comparability to prior periods. These non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes.
