 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; that follow and our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes presented in Item 1. Our Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) on February 24, 2021 (&#8220;2020 10-K&#8221;), as well as our current reports on Form 8-K and other publicly available information. References below to &#8220;Ameriprise Financial,&#8221; &#8220;Ameriprise,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to Ameriprise Financial, Inc. exclusively, to our entire family of companies, or to one or more of our subsidiaries. 

Overview 

Ameriprise Financial is a diversified financial services company with a more than 125-year history of providing financial solutions. We are a long-standing leader in financial planning and advice with $1.2 trillion in assets under management and administration as of June 30, 2021. We offer a broad range of products and services designed to achieve individual and institutional clients&#8217; financial objectives. 

The coronavirus disease 2019 (&#8216;&#8216;COVID-19&#8217;&#8217;) pandemic has presented ongoing significant economic and societal disruption and market unpredictability, which has affected our business and operating environment driven by a low interest rate environment and volatility and changes in the equity markets and the potential associated implications to client behavior. In early 2020, we implemented a work-from-home protocol for virtually all of our employee population, restricted business travel, and provided resources for complying with the guidance from the World Health Organization, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and governments. We are thoughtfully transitioning back to our office locations, where it is reasonable to do so, while complying with applicable health agencies&#8217; guidelines and governmental orders. Though there are indications that the effects of the virus are lessening in some areas, COVID-19 continues to deeply impact other areas and has been occurring in multiple waves, so there are still no reliable estimates of how long the implications from the pandemic will last, the effects new variants will ultimately have, how many people are likely to be affected by it, or its impact on the overall economy. Given the impact of the pandemic, financial results may not be comparable to previous years and the results presented in this report may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results. For further information regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any potentially material effects, see Part 1 - Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of our 2020 10-K. 

The products and services we provide retail clients and, to a lesser extent, institutional clients, are the primary source of our revenues and net income. Revenues and net income are significantly affected by investment performance and the total value and composition of assets we manage and administer for our retail and institutional clients as well as the distribution fees we receive from other companies. These factors, in turn, are largely determined by overall investment market performance and the depth and breadth of our individual client relationships. 

Financial markets and macroeconomic conditions have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our operating and performance results. In addition, the business, political and regulatory environments in which we operate are subject to elevated uncertainty and substantial, frequent change. Accordingly, we expect to continue focusing on our key strategic objectives and obtaining operational and strategic leverage from our core capabilities. The success of these and other strategies may be affected by the factors discussed in Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in our 2020 10-K and other factors as discussed herein. 

Equity price, credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the value of deferred acquisition costs (&#8220;DAC&#8221;) and deferred sales inducement costs (&#8220;DSIC&#8221;) assets, the values of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits and the &#8220;spread&#8221; income generated on our fixed deferred annuities, fixed insurance, the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts and deposit products. 

Earnings, as well as adjusted operating earnings after tax, will be negatively impacted by the ongoing low interest rate environment should it continue. In addition to continuing spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines, a sustained low interest rate environment may result in increases to our reserves and changes in various rate assumptions we use to amortize DAC and DSIC, which may negatively impact our adjusted operating earnings after tax. For additional discussion on our interest rate risk, see Item 3. &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8221; and the information set forth in this Item 2, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Market Risk.&#8221; 

During the third quarter of 2020, as we continue to reposition the business and implement strategies focusing on product features and sales, the composition of our reportable segments changed from five to four segments. The Chief Operating Decision Maker (&#8220;CODM&#8221;) now manages the Annuities and Protection business as one operating segment, referred to as Retirement &#38; Protection Solutions. The Retirement &#38; Protection Solutions segment includes Retirement Solutions (Variable Annuities and Payout Annuities) and Protection Solutions (Life and Disability Insurance). In addition, we moved the Fixed Annuities and Fixed Indexed Annuities business to the Corporate &#38; Other segment as a closed block. These segment reporting changes align with the way our CODM began assessing the performance of our reportable segments and other business activities effective in the third quarter of 2020. Certain prior

period amounts have been revised to conform to the current presentation. These changes have no impact on previously reported consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, or cash flows. 

On April 12, 2021, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire the European-based asset management business of BMO Financial Group for &#163;615 million, or approximately $845 million (subject to customary and other closing adjustments as well as foreign currency spot rates in effect on the closing date that drive the approximate amount in U.S. dollars). The all-cash transaction is expected to add approximately $124 billion of assets under management (&#8220;AUM&#8221;) in Europe and is currently expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021, subject to regulatory approvals in the relevant jurisdictions. 

On June 2, 2021, we filed an application to convert Ameriprise Bank, FSB to a state-chartered industrial bank regulated by the Utah Department of Financial Institutions and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. We also filed an application to transition the FSB&#8217;s personal trust services business to a new limited purpose national trust bank regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. If the applications are approved, the proposed changes are not expected to impact our long-term strategy for the bank and should enable us to continue our strong lineup of banking solutions, including deposits, credit cards, mortgages and securities-based lending to our wealth management clients without interruption. 

On June 29, 2021, our life insurance companies, RiverSource Life Insurance Company (&#8220;RiverSource Life&#8221;) and RiverSource Life Insurance Co. of New York (&#8220;RiverSource Life of New York&#8221;) signed an agreement to reinsure approximately $8.0 billion of fixed deferred and immediate annuity policies. The transaction, effective on July 1, 2021, with RiverSource Life closed on July 8, 2021. The transaction with RiverSource Life of New York is subject to regulatory approval. 

We consolidate certain variable interest entities for which we provide asset management services. These entities are defined as consolidated investment entities (&#8220;CIEs&#8221;). While the consolidation of the CIEs impacts our balance sheet and income statement, our exposure to these entities is unchanged and there is no impact to the underlying business results. For further information on CIEs, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The results of operations of the CIEs are reflected in the Corporate &#38; Other segment. On a consolidated basis, the management fees we earn for the services we provide to the CIEs and the related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities related to the CIEs, primarily syndicated loans and debt, are reflected in net investment income. We include the fees from these entities in the management and financial advice fees line within our Asset Management segment. 

While our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;), management believes that adjusted operating measures, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, net of the related DSIC and DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; the market impact on non-traditional long-duration products (including variable and fixed deferred annuity contracts and universal life (&#8220;UL&#8221;) insurance contracts, net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; mean reversion related impacts (the impact on variable annuity and variable universal life (&#8220;VUL&#8221;) products for the difference between assumed and updated separate account investment performance on DAC, DSIC, unearned revenue amortization, reinsurance accrual and additional insurance benefit reserves); the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate and currency changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments; gain or loss on disposal of a business that is not considered discontinued operations; integration and restructuring charges; income (loss) from discontinued operations; and the impact of consolidating CIEs, best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters. Throughout our Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis, these non-GAAP measures are referred to as adjusted operating measures. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures. 

It is management&#8217;s priority to increase shareholder value over a multi-year horizon by achieving our on-average, over-time financial targets. 

Our financial targets are: 

&#8226; Adjusted operating earnings per diluted share growth of 12% to 15%, and 

&#8226; Adjusted operating return on equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) of over 30%.

Assets Under Management and Administration 

AUM include external client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the Columbia Threadneedle Investments funds, institutional clients and clients in our advisor platform held in wrap accounts as well as assets managed by sub-advisors selected by us. AUM also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we provide investment management services and recognize management fees in our Asset Management segment, such as the assets of the general account and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries and CIEs. 

Assets under administration (&#8220;AUA&#8221;) include assets for which we provide administrative services such as client assets invested in other companies&#8217; products that we offer outside of our wrap accounts. These assets include those held in clients&#8217; brokerage accounts. We generally record revenues received from administered assets as distribution fees. We do not exercise management discretion over these assets and do not earn a management fee. These assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. AUA also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we do not provide investment management services and do not recognize management fees, such as investments in non-affiliated funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries. 

AUM and AUA do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide advisory services such as model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority.

Overall 

Pretax income increased $1.2 billion to $721 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to pretax loss of $526 million for the prior year period. The following impacts were significant drivers of the period-over-period change in pretax income: 

&#8226; The market impact on non-traditional long duration products (including variable and fixed deferred annuity contracts and UL insurance contracts), net of hedges and related DSIC and DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual was an expense of $87 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to an expense of $1.1 billion for the prior year period. 

&#8226; A favorable impact from higher average equity markets for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the prior year period. 

&#8226; A favorable impact from continued client net inflows from Advice &#38; Wealth Management and Asset Management. 

&#8226; The mean reversion related impact was a benefit of $42 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to a benefit of $14 million for the prior year period. 

Net Revenues 

Net revenues increased $706 million, or 26%, to $3.4 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to $2.7 billion for the prior year period. 

Management and financial advice fees increased $549 million, or 32%, to $2.3 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to $1.7 billion for the prior year period reflecting higher average equity markets and higher wrap account net inflows. 

Distribution fees increased $77 million, or 21%, to $452 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to $375 million for the prior year period due to increased transactional activity and higher average equity markets. 

Net investment income decreased $27 million, or 9%, to $278 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to $305 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: 

&#8226; Net realized investment gains of $11 million, for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to net realized investment losses of $3 million for the prior year period. Net realized investment gains for the three months ended June 30, 2021 included net 

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

realized gains of $14 million on Available-for-Sale securities due to sales, calls, and tenders, which was mostly offset by a $13 million loss associated with certain Available-for-Sale securities for which we have the intent to sell. Also included in net realized investment gains was a $13 million net gain primarily related to commercial mortgage loans and syndicated loans, reflecting reductions in the allowance for credit losses partially offset by the recording of a valuation allowance related to loans reclassified to held for sale. Net realized investment losses for the three months ended June 30, 2020 included a $4 million increase in the allowance for credit losses for Available-for-Sale securities and financing receivables. 

&#8226; A $17 million unfavorable change in the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate and currency changes on certain investments. 

&#8226; The unfavorable impact of continued low interest rates, including lower investment yields on the investment portfolio supporting the certificate and on-balance sheet brokerage cash products. 

Premiums, policy and contract charges increased $92 million, or 34% to $364 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to $272 million for the prior year primarily reflecting a favorable change in unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual offset to the market impact on IUL benefits. 

Banking and deposit interest expense decreased $16 million, or 89%, to $2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to $18 million due to lower average crediting rates on certificates and lower average certificate balances. 

Expenses 

Total expenses decreased $541 million, or 17%, to $2.7 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to $3.2 billion for the prior year period. 

Distribution expenses increased $293 million, or 31%, to $1.2 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to $940 million for the prior year period reflecting higher advisor compensation due to an increase in average wrap account balances and increased transactional activity. 

Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $138 million, or 53%, to $124 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to $262 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: 

&#8226; A $180 million decrease in expense from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on IUL benefits. The unfavorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $13 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to an unfavorable impact of $193 million for the prior year period. 

&#8226; A $49 million increase in expense from other market impacts on IUL benefits, net of hedges, which was a benefit of $50 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to a benefit of $99 million for the prior year period. The increase in expense was primarily due to a decrease in the IUL embedded derivative in the prior year period, which reflected lower option costs due to lower credit spreads. 

Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses decreased $1.1 billion to $404 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to a benefit of $1.5 billion for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: 

&#8226; A $1.0 billion decrease in expense primarily reflecting the impact of year-over-year changes in the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. The favorable impact of $63 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 was driven by changes in the undiscounted embedded derivative liability compared to an unfavorable impact of $953 million for the prior year period primarily as a result of the nonperformance credit spread decreasing by 115 basis points in the prior year quarter due to improvement in credit markets following market volatility related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As the undiscounted embedded derivative liability on which the nonperformance credit spread is applied increases (decreases), the impact of the nonperformance credit spread is favorable (unfavorable) to expense. Additionally, as the estimate of the nonperformance credit spread over the LIBOR swap curve tightens or widens, the embedded derivative liability will increase or decrease. 

&#8226; A $77 million decrease in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks and the related DSIC amortization. This increase was the result of a favorable $2.0 billion change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits, partially offset by an unfavorable $1.9 billion change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits reserves. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below: 

&#8226; Equity market impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a lower expense for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the prior year period. 

&#8226; Interest rate impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in an expense for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to a benefit for the prior year period. 

&#8226; Volatility impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in an expense for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to a benefit for the prior year period. 

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

&#8226; Other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a lower net benefit for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the prior year period. 

&#8226; The mean reversion related impact was a benefit of $25 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to an expense of $5 million for the prior year period. 

Amortization of DAC increased $311 million to $63 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to a benefit of $248 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: 

&#8226; The DAC offset to the market impact on non-traditional long-duration products was an expense of $5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to a benefit of $265 million for the prior year period. 

&#8226; The mean reversion related impact was a benefit of $16 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to a benefit of $18 million for the prior year period. 

&#8226; A higher level of normalized amortization due to the growth of variable annuities and unlocked market and policyholder assumptions in the prior year. 

General and administrative expense increased $54 million, or 7%, to $830 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to $776 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting higher volume related expenses, an unfavorable foreign exchange impact and higher performance-based compensation. 

Income Taxes 

Our effective tax rate was 18.1% for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to (2.4)% for the prior year period. The higher effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the prior year period is primarily the result of the net operating loss benefit reversal in the prior year period. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on income taxes.

The United Kingdom&#8217;s (&#8220;U.K.&#8221;) and the European Union&#8217;s (&#8220;EU&#8221;) trade and cooperation agreement did not include cross-border financial services. As a result, our U.K. asset management business is no longer able to market its services into the EU on a passporting basis and must now comply with local EU and country requirements as a non-EU firm, which includes leveraging our Luxembourg-based management company affiliate to provide services and marketing to EU clients and investors. As a result, the full impact of Brexit remains uncertain. 

Total segment AUM increased $29.3 billion, or 5%, during the three months ended June 30, 2021.

Our Corporate &#38; Other segment pretax adjusted operating loss increased $20 million, or 35%, to $77 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to $57 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting higher claims in LTC insurance and lower investment income, including a $7 million impairment in our affordable housing partnerships.

Banking and deposit interest expense decreased $36 million, or 84%, to $7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to $43 million due to lower average crediting rates on certificates and lower average certificate balances. 

Expenses 

Total expenses increased $1.7 billion, or 43%, to $5.6 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to $3.9 billion for the prior year period. 

Distribution expenses increased $473 million, or 24%, to $2.4 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to $1.9 billion for the prior year period reflecting higher advisor compensation due to an increase in average wrap account balances and increased transactional activity. 

Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $70 million, or 20%, to $283 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to $353 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: 

&#8226; A $55 million increase in expense from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on IUL benefits. The unfavorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $14 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to a favorable impact of $41 million for the prior year period. 

&#8226; A $119 million decrease in expense from other market impacts on IUL benefits, net of hedges, which was a benefit of $52 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to an expense of $67 million for the prior year period. The decrease in expense was primarily due to a decrease in the IUL embedded derivative in the current period, which reflected lower option costs due to higher discount rates compared to an increase in the IUL embedded derivative in the prior year period, which reflected higher option costs due to lower discount rates. 

Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $1.3 billion to $1.1 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to a benefit of $280 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: 

&#8226; A $795 million increase in expense primarily reflecting the impact of year-over-year changes in the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. The unfavorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $162 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and was driven by changes in the undiscounted embedded derivative liability compared to a favorable impact of $633 million for the prior year period. As the undiscounted embedded derivative liability on which the nonperformance credit spread is applied increases (decreases), the impact of the nonperformance credit spread is favorable (unfavorable) to expense. Additionally, as the estimate of the nonperformance credit spread over the LIBOR swap curve tightens or widens, the embedded derivative liability will increase or decrease 

&#8226; A $649 million increase in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks and the related DSIC amortization. This increase was the result of an unfavorable $4.6 billion change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits, partially offset by a favorable $3.9 billion change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits reserves. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below: 

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

&#8226; Equity market impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in an expense for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to a benefit in the prior year period. 

&#8226; Interest rate impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a higher expense for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the prior year period. 

&#8226; Volatility impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a lower expense for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the prior year period. 

&#8226; Other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a net benefit for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to a net expense for the prior year period. 

&#8226; The mean reversion related impact was a benefit of $59 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to an expense of $29 million for the prior year period. 

&#8226; A decrease in LTC claims reflecting fewer LTC clients entering nursing homes as well as increased mortality-related client terminations due to COVID-19. 

&#8226; A $13 million decrease in reserves for immediate annuities with a life contingent feature primarily due to lower sales. This impact is offset by a decrease in premiums. 

Amortization of DAC decreased $196 million, or 74%, to $68 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to $264 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: 

&#8226; The DAC offset to the market impact on non-traditional long-duration products was a benefit of $40 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to an expense of $152 million for the prior year period. 

&#8226; The mean reversion related impact was a benefit of $38 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to an expense of $18 million for the prior year period. 

General and administrative expense increased $124 million, or 8%, to $1.7 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to $1.5 billion for the prior year period primarily reflecting higher performance related compensation, higher expenses from CIEs, and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact, partially offset by disciplined expense management and reengineering. 

Income Taxes 

Our effective tax rate was 15.4% for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to 18.0% for the prior year period. The lower effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to June 30, 2020 is primarily the result of an increase in tax preferred items, including foreign tax credits and incentive compensation, partially offset by lower income in the quarter relative to income expected for the full year. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on income taxes.

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

Market Risk 

Our primary market risk exposures are interest rate, equity price, foreign currency exchange rate and credit risk. Equity price and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the spread income generated on our fixed deferred annuities, fixed insurance, brokerage client cash balances, banking deposits, face-amount certificate products and the fixed portion of our variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of DAC and DSIC assets, the value of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the value of derivatives held to hedge these benefits. 

Our earnings from fixed deferred annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts are based upon the spread between rates earned on assets held and the rates at which interest is credited to accounts. We primarily invest in fixed rate securities to fund the rate credited to clients. We guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products. Investment assets and client liabilities generally differ as it relates to basis, repricing or maturity characteristics. Rates credited to clients&#8217; accounts generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on the underlying investments. Therefore, in an increasing interest rate environment, higher interest rates may be reflected in crediting rates to clients sooner than in rates earned on invested assets, which could result in a reduced spread between the two rates, reduced earned income and a negative impact on pretax income. However, the current low interest rate environment is resulting in interest rates below the level of some of our liability guaranteed minimum interest rates (&#8220;GMIRs&#8221;). Hence, a modest rise in interest rates would not necessarily result in changes to all the liability credited rates while projected asset purchases would capture the full increase in interest rates. This dynamic would result in widening spreads under a modestly rising rate scenario given the current relationship between the current level of interest rates and the underlying GMIRs on the business. 

As a result of the low interest rate environment, our current reinvestment yields are generally lower than the current portfolio yield. We expect our portfolio income yields to continue to decline in future periods if interest rates remain low. The carrying value and weighted average yield of non-structured fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans that may generate proceeds to reinvest through June 30, 2023 due to prepayment, maturity or call activity at the option of the issuer, excluding securities with a make-whole provision, were $4.4 billion and 2.3%, respectively, as of June 30, 2021. In addition, residential mortgage backed securities, which are subject to prepayment risk as a result of the low interest rate environment, totaled $9.7 billion and had a weighted average yield of 1.6% as of June 30, 2021. While these amounts represent investments that could be subject to reinvestment risk, it is also possible that these investments will be used to fund liabilities or may not be prepaid and will remain invested at their current yields. In addition to the interest rate environment, the mix of benefit payments versus product sales as well as the timing and volumes associated with such mix may impact our investment yield. Furthermore, reinvestment activities and the associated investment yield may also be impacted by corporate strategies implemented at management&#8217;s discretion. The average yield for investment purchases during the six months ended June 30, 2021 was approximately 1.3%. 

The reinvestment of proceeds from maturities, calls and prepayments at rates below the current portfolio yield, which may be below the level of some liability GMIRs, will have a negative impact to future operating results. To mitigate the unfavorable impact that the low interest rate environment has on our spread income, we assess reinvestment risk in our investment portfolio and monitor this risk in accordance with our asset/liability management framework. In addition, we may reduce the crediting rates on our fixed products when warranted, subject to guaranteed minimums. 

In addition to the fixed rate exposures noted above, RiverSource Life has the following variable annuity guarantee benefits: guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (&#8220;GMWB&#8221;), guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (&#8220;GMAB&#8221;), guaranteed minimum death benefits (&#8220;GMDB&#8221;) and guaranteed minimum income benefits (&#8220;GMIB&#8221;). Each of these benefits guarantees payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the underlying invested assets. 

The variable annuity guarantees continue to be managed by utilizing a hedging program which attempts to match the sensitivity of the assets with the sensitivity of the liabilities. This approach works with the premise that matched sensitivities will produce a highly effective hedging result. Our comprehensive hedging program focuses mainly on first order sensitivities of assets and liabilities: Equity Market Level (Delta), Interest Rate Level (Rho) and Volatility (Vega). Additionally, various second order sensitivities are managed. We use various options, swaptions, swaps and futures to manage risk exposures. The exposures are measured and monitored daily, and adjustments to the hedge portfolio are made as necessary. 

We have a macro hedge program to provide protection against the statutory tail scenario risk arising from variable annuity reserves on our statutory surplus and to cover some of the residual risks not covered by other hedging activities. We assess the residual risk under a range of scenarios in creating and executing the macro hedge program. As a means of economically hedging these risks, we may use a combination of futures, options, swaps and swaptions. Certain of the macro hedge derivatives used contain settlement provisions linked to both equity returns and interest rates; the remaining are interest rate contracts or equity contracts. The macro hedge program could result in additional earnings volatility as changes in the value of the macro hedge derivatives, which are designed to reduce statutory capital volatility, may not be closely aligned to changes in the variable annuity guarantee embedded derivatives. 

To evaluate interest rate and equity price risk we perform sensitivity testing which measures the impact on pretax income from the sources listed below for a 12-month period following a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a hypothetical 10%

decline in equity prices. The interest rate risk test assumes a sudden 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, with rates then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. The equity price risk test assumes a sudden 10% drop in equity prices, with equity prices then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. In estimating the values of variable annuities, fixed deferred indexed annuities, stock market certificates, IUL insurance and the associated hedge assets, we assume no change in implied market volatility despite the 10% drop in equity prices. 

The following tables present our estimate of the impact on pretax income from the above defined hypothetical market movements as of June 30, 2021:

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

The above results compare to an estimated negative net impact to pretax income of $73 million related to a 10% equity price decline and an estimated positive net impact to pretax income of $2 million related to a 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2020. The change in interest rate exposure as of June 30, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 was driven by variable annuity riders, specifically GMWB, primarily due to changes in market rates. 

Net impacts shown in the above table from GMWB riders result largely from differences between the liability valuation basis and the hedging basis. Liabilities are valued using fair value accounting principles, with risk margins incorporated in contractholder behavior assumptions and with discount rates increased to reflect a current market estimate of our risk of nonperformance specific to these liabilities. Our hedging is based on our determination of economic risk, which excludes certain items in the liability valuation including the nonperformance spread risk. 

Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above as they are based on a number of estimates and assumptions. These include assuming that implied market volatility does not change when equity prices fall by 10% and that the 100 basis point increase in interest rates is a parallel shift of the yield curve. Furthermore, we have not tried to anticipate changes in client preferences for different types of assets or other changes in client behavior, nor have we tried to anticipate all strategic actions management might take to increase revenues or reduce expenses in these scenarios. 

The selection of a 100 basis point interest rate increase as well as a 10% equity price decline should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Impacts of larger or smaller changes in interest rates or equity prices may not be proportional to those shown for a 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a 10% decline in equity prices. 

Fair Value Measurements 

We report certain assets and liabilities at fair value; specifically, separate account assets, derivatives, embedded derivatives and most investments and cash equivalents. Fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale. We include actual market prices, or observable inputs, in our fair value measurements to the extent available. Broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available. We validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as: price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our fair value measurements. 

Fair Value of Liabilities and Nonperformance Risk 

Companies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant (an exit price). Since there is not a market for our obligations of our variable annuity riders, fixed deferred indexed annuities, structured variable annuities, and IUL insurance, we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price. As a result, we adjust the valuation of variable annuity riders, fixed deferred indexed annuities, structured annuities, and IUL insurance by updating certain contractholder assumptions, adding explicit margins to provide for profit, risk and expense, and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of our nonperformance risk. The nonperformance risk adjustment is based on observable market data adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities. Consistent with general market conditions, this estimate resulted in a spread over the LIBOR swap curve as of June 30, 2021. As our estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase. If this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the LIBOR swap curve, the reduction to future net income would be approximately $360 million, net of DAC, DSIC, unearned revenue amortization, the reinsurance accrual and income taxes (calculated at the statutory tax rate of 21%), based on June 30, 2021 credit spreads. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Overview 

We maintained substantial liquidity during the six months ended June 30, 2021. At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we had $7.1 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents excluding CIEs and other restricted cash on a consolidated basis. 

At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the parent company had $1.6 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, in cash, cash equivalents, and unencumbered liquid securities. Liquid securities predominantly include U.S. government agency mortgage back securities. Additional sources of liquidity include a line of credit with an affiliate up to $ 1.0 billion and an unsecured revolving committed credit facility for up to $1.0 billion that expires in June 2026. Management&#8217;s estimate of liquidity available to the parent company in a volatile and uncertain economic environment as of June 30, 2021 was $3.0 billion which includes cash, cash equivalents, unencumbered liquid securities, the line of credit with an affiliate and a portion of the committed credit facility. 

Under the terms of the committed credit facility, we can increase the availability to $1.25 billion upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements. Available borrowings under this facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. At June 30, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and had $1.1 million of outstanding letters of credit. Our credit facility contains various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. Compliance with these covenants is not currently impaired by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we remain in compliance with all such covenants at June 30, 2021. 

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

In addition, we have access to collateralized borrowings, which may include repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) advances. Our subsidiaries, RiverSource Life, and Ameriprise Bank, FSB are members of the FHLB of Des Moines, which provides access to collateralized borrowings. We had $200 million of borrowings from the FHLB, which is collateralized with commercial mortgage backed securities and residential mortgage backed securities for both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. We believe cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances and our availability of revolver borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs and stress requirements. 

We continue to monitor and respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Our risk management strategy is designed to provide proactive protection during stress events such as the current pandemic. We believe our process is working as intended, and our liquidity and capital resources have remained a source of balance sheet strength during the six months ended June 30, 2021. 

Dividends from Subsidiaries 

Ameriprise Financial is primarily a parent holding company for the operations carried out by our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Because of our holding company structure, our ability to meet our cash requirements, including the payment of dividends on our common stock, substantially depends upon the receipt of dividends or return of capital from our subsidiaries, particularly our life insurance subsidiary, RiverSource Life, our face-amount certificate subsidiary, Ameriprise Certificate Company (&#8220;ACC&#8221;), AMPF Holding Corporation, which is the parent company of our retail introducing broker-dealer subsidiary, Ameriprise Financial Services, LLC (&#8220;AFS&#8221;) and our clearing broker-dealer subsidiary, American Enterprise Investment Services, Inc. (&#8220;AEIS&#8221;), our transfer agent subsidiary, Columbia Management Investment Services Corp., our investment advisory company, Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC, and Ameriprise International Holdings GmbH, which is the parent company of Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings S&#224;rl. The payment of dividends by many of our subsidiaries is restricted and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements. 

Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements for our wholly owned subsidiaries subject to regulatory capital requirements were as follows:

(1) Actual capital is determined on a statutory basis. 

(2) Regulatory capital requirement is the company action level and is based on the statutory risk-based capital filing. 

(3) Regulatory capital requirement is based on the applicable regulatory requirement, calculated as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

(4) Actual capital is determined on an adjusted GAAP basis. 

(5) ACC is required to hold capital in compliance with the Minnesota Department of Commerce and SEC capital requirements. 

(6) Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements are determined in accordance with U.K. regulatory legislation. The regulatory capital requirements at June 30, 2021 represent calculations at December 31, 2020 of the rule based requirements, as specified by FCA regulations. 

(7) Regulatory capital requirement is based on minimum requirements for well capitalized banks in accordance with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;). Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, Ameriprise Bank transitioned to the Simplified Supervisory Formula Approach (&#8220;SSFA&#8221;) for risk-weighting non-agency securitized investments, resulting in a significant reduction in risk-weighted assets and an improvement in regulatory capital ratios that were already in a well-capitalized position. 

In addition to the particular regulations restricting dividend payments and establishing subsidiary capitalization requirements, we take into account the overall health of the business, capital levels and risk management considerations in determining a strategy for payments to our parent holding company from our subsidiaries, and in deciding to use cash to make capital contributions to our subsidiaries. 

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

During the six months ended June 30, 2021, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $1.6 billion (including $750 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $71 million (including $7 million to Ameriprise Bank, FSB). During the six months ended June 30, 2020, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $1.0 billion (including $500 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $203 million (including $150 million to Ameriprise Bank, FSB). 

In 2009, RiverSource Life established an agreement to protect its exposure to Genworth Life Insurance Company (&#8220;GLIC&#8221;) for its reinsured LTC. In 2016, substantial enhancements to this reinsurance protection agreement were finalized. The terms of these confidential provisions within the agreement have been shared, in the normal course of regular reviews, with our domiciliary regulator and rating agencies. GLIC is domiciled in Delaware so in the event GLIC were subjected to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings, such proceedings would be located in (and governed by) Delaware laws. Delaware courts have a long tradition of respecting commercial and reinsurance affairs as well as contracts among sophisticated parties. Similar credit protections to what we have with GLIC have been tested and respected in Delaware and elsewhere in the United States, and as a result we believe our credit protections would be respected even in the unlikely event that GLIC becomes subject to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings in Delaware. Accordingly, while no credit protections are perfect, we believe the correct way to think about the risks represented by our counterparty credit exposure to GLIC is not the full amount of the gross liability that GLIC reinsures, but a much smaller net exposure to GLIC (if any that might exist after taking into account our credit protections). Thus, management believes that our agreement and offsetting non LTC legacy arrangements with Genworth will enable RiverSource Life to recover on all net exposure in all material respects in the event of a rehabilitation or insolvency of GLIC. 

Dividends Paid to Shareholders and Share Repurchases 

We paid regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders totaling $263 million and $257 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. On July 26, 2021, we announced a quarterly dividend of $1.13 per common share. The dividend will be paid on August 20, 2021 to our shareholders of record at the close of business on August 9, 2021. 

In August 2020, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $2.5 billion of our common stock through September 30, 2022. As of June 30, 2021, we had $1.5 billion remaining under this share repurchase authorizations. We intend to fund share repurchases through existing working capital, future earnings and other customary financing methods. The share repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. Acquisitions under the share repurchase program may be made in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or block trades or other means. During the six months ended June 30, 2021, we repurchased a total of 3.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $237.52 per share. 

Cash Flows 

Cash flows of CIEs and restricted and segregated cash and cash equivalents are reflected in our cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash held by CIEs is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial, nor is Ameriprise Financial cash available for general use by its CIEs. Cash and cash equivalents segregated under federal and other regulations is held for the exclusive benefit of our brokerage customers and is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial. 

Operating Activities 

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $3.8 billion to net cash used in operating activities of $931 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $4.7 billion for the prior year period primarily reflecting a $2.3 billion decrease in policyholder account balances, future policy benefits and claims, net, a $469 million decrease in net income, a $309 decrease in deferred taxes, net, and a $296 million decrease in cash from changes in brokerage deposits. 

Investing Activities 

Our investing activities primarily relate to our Available-for-Sale investment portfolio. Further, this activity is significantly affected by the net flows of our investment certificate, fixed annuity and universal life products reflected in financing activities. 

Net cash used in investing activities increased $13 million to $909 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to $896 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting a $1.6 billion increase in proceeds from maturities, sinking fund payments and calls of Available-for-Sale securities, partially offset by a $913 million decrease in proceeds from sales of Available-for-Sale securities and a $589 million decrease in net cash flows related to investments of consolidated investment entities 

Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities decreased $218 million to net cash used of $101 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to net cash provided by of $117 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting a $945 million decrease in net cash flows from investment certificates, a $717 million decrease in repayments of debt by consolidated investment entities and a $242 million decrease in cash from changes in banking deposits, partially offset by a $1.4 billion increase in borrowings by consolidated investment entities and a $358 million increase in net cash flows related to purchased options with deferred premiums.
