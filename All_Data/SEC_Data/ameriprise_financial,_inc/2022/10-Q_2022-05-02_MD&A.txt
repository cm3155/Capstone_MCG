 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; that follow and our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes presented in Item 1. Our Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) on February 25, 2022 (&#8220;2021 10-K&#8221;), as well as our current reports on Form 8-K and other publicly available information. References below to &#8220;Ameriprise Financial,&#8221; &#8220;Ameriprise,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to Ameriprise Financial, Inc. exclusively, to our entire family of companies, or to one or more of our subsidiaries. 

Overview 

Ameriprise Financial is a diversified financial services company with a more than 125-year history of providing financial solutions. We are a long-standing leader in financial planning and advice with $1.3 trillion in assets under management and administration as of March 31, 2022. We offer a broad range of products and services designed to achieve individual and institutional clients&#8217; financial objectives. 

The coronavirus disease 2019 (&#8216;&#8216;COVID-19&#8217;&#8217;) pandemic has presented ongoing significant economic and societal disruption and market unpredictability, which has affected our business and operating environment driven by what has been a low interest rate environment and volatility and changes in the equity markets and the potential associated implications to client behavior. COVID-19 continues its ongoing impact and has been occurring in multiple waves, so there are still no reliable estimates of how long the implications from the pandemic will last, the effects current and other new variants will ultimately have, how many people are likely to be affected by it, or its impact on the overall economy. There is still significant uncertainty around the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition, which depends on current and future developments, including the ultimate scope, duration and severity of the pandemic, success of worldwide vaccination efforts, multiple mutations of COVID-19 or similar diseases, the effectiveness of our office reopenings, the additional measures that may be taken by various governmental authorities in response to the outbreak, the actions of third parties in response to the pandemic, and the possible further impacts on the global economy. Given the ongoing impact of the pandemic, financial results may not be comparable to previous years and the results presented in this report may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results. For further information regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any potentially material effects, see Part 1 - Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of our 2021 10-K. 

The products and services we provide retail clients and, to a lesser extent, institutional clients, are the primary source of our revenues and net income. Revenues and net income are significantly affected by investment performance and the total value and composition of assets we manage and administer for our retail and institutional clients as well as the distribution fees we receive from other companies. These factors, in turn, are largely determined by overall investment market performance and the depth and breadth of our individual client relationships. 

Financial markets and macroeconomic conditions have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our operating and performance results. In addition, the business, political and regulatory environments in which we operate are subject to elevated uncertainty and substantial, frequent change. Accordingly, we expect to continue focusing on our key strategic objectives and obtaining operational and strategic leverage from our core capabilities. The success of these and other strategies may be affected by the factors discussed in Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in our 2021 10-K and other factors as discussed herein. 

Equity price, credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the value of deferred acquisition costs (&#8220;DAC&#8221;) and deferred sales inducement costs (&#8220;DSIC&#8221;) assets, the values of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits and the &#8220;spread&#8221; income generated on our fixed deferred annuities, fixed insurance, the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts and deposit products. 

Earnings, as well as adjusted operating earnings after tax, may be impacted by the ongoing low interest rate environment. Although interest rates could rise in the future, we continue to operate within a comparatively low interest rate environment. In addition to continuing spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines, a sustained low interest rate environment may result in increases to our reserves and changes in various rate assumptions we use to amortize DAC and DSIC, which may negatively impact our adjusted operating earnings after tax. For additional discussion on our interest rate risk, see Item 3. &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8221; and the information set forth in this Item 2, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Market Risk.&#8221; 

On June 2, 2021, we filed an application to convert Ameriprise Bank, FSB to a state-chartered industrial bank regulated by the Utah Department of Financial Institutions and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. We also filed an application to transition the FSB&#8217;s personal trust services business to a new limited purpose national trust bank regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. If the applications are approved, the proposed changes are not expected to impact our long-term strategy for the bank and 

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

should enable us to continue our strong lineup of banking solutions, including deposits, credit cards, mortgages and securities-based lending to our wealth management clients without interruption. 

We consolidate certain variable interest entities for which we provide asset management services. These entities are defined as consolidated investment entities (&#8220;CIEs&#8221;). While the consolidation of the CIEs impacts our balance sheet and income statement, our exposure to these entities is unchanged and there is no impact to the underlying business results. For further information on CIEs, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The results of operations of the CIEs are reflected in the Corporate &#38; Other segment. On a consolidated basis, the management fees we earn for the services we provide to the CIEs and the related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities related to the CIEs, primarily syndicated loans and debt, are reflected in net investment income. We include the fees from these entities in the management and financial advice fees line within our Asset Management segment. 

While our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;), management believes that adjusted operating measures, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, net of the related DSIC and DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; the market impact on non-traditional long-duration products (including variable and fixed deferred annuity contracts and universal life (&#8220;UL&#8221;) insurance contracts, net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; mean reversion related impacts (the impact on variable annuity and variable universal life (&#8220;VUL&#8221;) products for the difference between assumed and updated separate account investment performance on DAC, DSIC, unearned revenue amortization, reinsurance accrual and additional insurance benefit reserves); the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate and currency changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments; block transfer reinsurance transaction impact; gain or loss on disposal of a business that is not considered discontinued operations; integration and restructuring charges; income (loss) from discontinued operations; and the impact of consolidating CIEs, best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters. Throughout our Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis, these non-GAAP measures are referred to as adjusted operating measures. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures. 

It is management&#8217;s priority to increase shareholder value over a multi-year horizon by achieving our on-average, over-time financial targets. 

Our financial targets are: 

&#8226; Adjusted operating earnings per diluted share growth of 12% to 15%, and 

&#8226; Adjusted operating return on equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) of over 30%.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The accounting and reporting policies that we use affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and, in some cases, the application of these policies can be significantly affected by the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis &#8212; Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; in our 2021 10-K.

Assets Under Management and Administration 

Assets under management (&#8220;AUM&#8221;) include external client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the Columbia Threadneedle Investments funds, institutional clients and clients in our advisor platform held in wrap accounts as well as assets managed by sub-advisors selected by us. AUM also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we provide investment management services and recognize management fees in our Asset Management segment, such as the assets of the general account and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries and CIEs. 

Assets under administration (&#8220;AUA&#8221;) include assets for which we provide administrative services such as client assets invested in other companies&#8217; products that we offer outside of our wrap accounts. These assets include those held in clients&#8217; brokerage accounts. We generally record revenues received from administered assets as distribution fees. We do not exercise management discretion over these assets and do not earn a management fee. These assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. AUA also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we do not provide investment management services and do not recognize management fees, such as investments in non-affiliated funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries. 

AUM and AUA do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide advisory services such as model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority.

Overall 

Pretax income increased $430 million, or 87%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period. The following impacts were significant drivers of the period-over-period change in pretax income: 

&#8226; The market impact on non-traditional long duration products (including variable and fixed deferred annuity contracts and UL insurance contracts), net of hedges and related DSIC and DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual was a benefit of $134 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to an expense of $396 million for the prior year period. 

&#8226; A favorable impact from higher average equity markets for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period. 

&#8226; A favorable impact from continued client net inflows from Advice &#38; Wealth Management. 

&#8226; A $20 million favorable impact of higher asset management net performance fees. 

&#8226; The mean reversion related impact was an expense of $59 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to a benefit of $56 million for the prior year period. 

&#8226; A $45 million unfavorable impact due to more normalized long term care (&#8220;LTC&#8221;) insurance claims in the current period compared to the benefit of COVID-19 related impacts in the year ago period. 

Net Revenues 

Management and financial advice fees increased $357 million, or 17%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period reflecting higher average equity markets, revenue associated with the acquisition of the BMO Global Asset Management (EMEA) business, continued wrap account net inflows, and a $53 million increase in performance fees. 

Distribution fees decreased $12 million, or 3%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period due to decreased transactional activity, partially offset by higher average equity markets. 

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

Net investment income decreased $116 million, or 31%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: 

&#8226; Net realized investment gains of $20 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to net realized investment gains of $69 million for the prior year period. Net realized investment gains included a $15 million gain on a strategic investment in the prior year period. 

&#8226; The unfavorable impact of lower average invested assets due to the sale of investments to a reinsurer as a result of the fixed deferred and immediate annuity reinsurance transaction. 

&#8226; A $17 million decrease in net investment income of CIEs. 

&#8226; The unfavorable impact of continued low interest rates, including lower investment yields on the investment portfolio supporting the certificate products. 

Premiums, policy and contract charges increased $21 million, or 6%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting a favorable change in unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual offset to the market impact on IUL benefits. 

Other revenues increased $52 million, or 73%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the yield on deposit receivables arising from reinsurance transactions. 

Banking and deposit interest expense decreased $3 million, or 60%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period due to lower average crediting rates on certificates and lower average certificate balances. 

Expenses 

Distribution expenses increased $122 million, or 10%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period reflecting higher advisor compensation primarily due to an increase in average wrap account balances, partially offset by decreased transactional activity. 

Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $18 million, or 11%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: 

&#8226; A $29 million decrease in expense from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on IUL benefits. The favorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $28 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to an unfavorable impact of $1 million for the prior year period. 

&#8226; A $14 million increase in expense from other market impacts on IUL benefits, net of hedges, which was an expense of $12 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to a benefit of $2 million for the prior year period. The increase in expense was primarily due to an increase in the IUL embedded derivative in the current period, which reflected higher option costs due to a higher new money rate. 

Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses decreased $442 million, or 68%, the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: 

&#8226; A $207 million decrease in expense primarily reflecting the impact of year-over-year changes in the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. The unfavorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $18 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to an unfavorable impact of $225 million for the prior year period. As the undiscounted embedded derivative liability on which the nonperformance credit spread is applied increases (decreases), the impact of the nonperformance credit spread on benefits expenses is favorable (unfavorable). Additionally, as the estimate of the nonperformance credit spread over the LIBOR swap curve tightens or widens, the embedded derivative liability will increase or decrease. 

&#8226; A $339 million decrease in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks and the related DSIC amortization. This decrease was the result of a favorable $1.3 billion change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits, partially offset by an unfavorable $950 million change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits reserves. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below: 

&#8226; Equity market impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a benefit for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to an expense for the prior year period. 

&#8226; Interest rate impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a higher expense for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period. 

&#8226; Volatility impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a lower expense for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period. 

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

&#8226; Other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a net expense for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to a net benefit for the prior year period. 

&#8226; The mean reversion related impact was an expense of $34 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to a benefit of $34 million for the prior year period. 

&#8226; A $41 million increase in expense on LTC insurance as claims returned to more normalized levels compared to the prior year period which benefited from COVID-19 related impacts. 

Amortization of DAC increased $91 million, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: 

&#8226; The DAC offset to the market impact on non-traditional long-duration products was an expense of $11 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to a benefit of $46 million for the prior year period. 

&#8226; The mean reversion related impact was an expense of $25 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to a benefit of $22 million for the prior year period. 

&#8226; A decrease in amortization reflecting lower than expected client exit rates. 

General and administrative expense increased $124 million, or 15%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the operating expenses of the acquired BMO Global Asset Management (EMEA) business, higher performance fee related compensation, and $10 million of integration related expenses, partially offset by an unfavorable change in the mark-to-market impact on share-based compensation in the prior year period. 

Income Taxes 

Our effective tax rate was 17.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to 11.3% for the prior year period. The higher effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to March 31, 2021 is primarily the result of higher pretax income and a decrease in low income housing tax credits, partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation in the current period compared to the prior period. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on income taxes. 

Results of Operations by Segment for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 

Adjusted operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss management uses to evaluate segment performance. Adjusted operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP pretax income. We believe the presentation of segment adjusted operating earnings as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitating a more meaningful trend analysis. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the presentation of segment results and our definition of adjusted operating earnings.

Variable annuity account balances decreased 1% to $85.8 billion as of March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period due to net outflows of $1.9 billion, partially offset by market appreciation. Variable annuity sales decreased 27% compared to the prior year period reflecting a decrease in sales of variable annuities with living benefit guarantees. The risk profile of our in force block continues to improve, with account values with living benefit riders down to 60% as of March 31, 2022 compared to 63% a year ago. This trend is expected to continue and meaningfully shift the mix of business away from products with living benefit guarantees over time. 

We continue to optimize our risk profile and shift our business mix to lower risk offerings. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we made the decision to discontinue new sales of substantially all of our variable annuities with living benefit guarantees at the end of 2021, with a full exit by mid-2022. In addition, we discontinued new sales of our universal life insurance with secondary guarantees and our single-pay fixed universal life with a long term care rider products at the end of 2021. 

Net Revenues 

Net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $12 million, or 10%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period primarily due to lower yields on the investment portfolio. 

Expenses 

Distribution expenses decreased $10 million, or 8%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting decreased variable annuity sales. 

Amortization of DAC, which excludes mean reversion related impacts, the DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity contracts and IUL contracts and the DAC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $10 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting lower than expected client exit rates.

Our Corporate &#38; Other segment pretax adjusted operating loss increased $55 million, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period. 

LTC insurance had a pretax adjusted operating earnings of $1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to pretax adjusted operating earnings of $46 million for the prior year period reflecting the return to more normalized results compared to the COVID-19 related impacts in the year ago period. 

FA business had a pretax adjusted operating loss of $5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to a pretax adjusted operating loss of $4 million. Fixed deferred annuity account balances declined 4% to $7.5 billion as of March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period as policies continue to lapse and the discontinuance of new sales of fixed deferred annuities. During the third quarter of 2021, we closed on a transaction to reinsure RiverSource Life&#8217;s fixed deferred and immediate annuity policies. 

Net Revenues 

Net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate and currency changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments, block transfer reinsurance transaction impacts, integration and restructuring charges, and the impact of consolidating CIEs, decreased $67 million, or 67%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting lower average invested assets due to the sale of investments to a reinsurer as a result of the fixed deferred and immediate annuity reinsurance transaction and a $15 million gain on a strategic investment in the prior year period. 

Other revenues increased $44 million to $59 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the yield on deposit receivables arising from reinsurance transactions. 

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

Expenses 

Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which excludes DSIC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $41 million, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting more normalized claims on LTC insurance, which benefited from COVID-19 related impacts in the prior year period. 

General and administrative expense decreased $10 million, or 14%, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the unfavorable mark-to-market impact on share-based compensation expense in the prior year period. 

Market Risk 

Our primary market risk exposures are interest rate, equity price, foreign currency exchange rate and credit risk. Equity price and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the spread income generated on our fixed insurance, brokerage client cash balances, banking deposits, face-amount certificate products, fixed portion of our variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of DAC and DSIC assets, the value of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the value of derivatives held to hedge these benefits. 

Our earnings from fixed insurance, the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, and fixed deferred annuities are based upon the spread between rates earned on assets held and the rates at which interest is credited to accounts. We primarily invest in fixed rate securities to fund the rate credited to clients. We guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products. Investment assets and client liabilities generally differ as it relates to basis, repricing or maturity characteristics. Rates credited to clients&#8217; accounts generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on the underlying investments. Therefore, in an increasing interest rate environment, higher interest rates may be reflected in crediting rates to clients sooner than in rates earned on invested assets, which could result in a reduced spread between the two rates, reduced earned income and a negative impact on pretax income. However, the current low interest rate environment is resulting in interest rates below the level of some of our liability guaranteed minimum interest rates (&#8220;GMIRs&#8221;). Hence, a modest rise in interest rates would not necessarily result in changes to all the liability credited rates while projected asset purchases would capture the full increase in interest rates. This dynamic would result in widening spreads under a modestly rising rate scenario given the current relationship between the current level of interest rates and the underlying GMIRs on the business. 

As a result of the current interest rate environment, our reinvestment yields are generally lower than the current portfolio yield. We expect our portfolio income yields to continue to decline in future periods should interest rates remain comparatively low. The carrying value and weighted average yield of non-structured fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans that may generate proceeds to reinvest through March 31, 2024 due to prepayment, maturity or call activity at the option of the issuer, excluding securities with a make-whole provision, were $2.5 billion and 1.9%, respectively, as of March 31, 2022. In addition, residential mortgage backed securities, which could be subject to prepayment risk if the low interest rate environment continues, totaled $11.7 billion and had a weighted average yield of 1.8% as of March 31, 2022. While these amounts represent investments that could be subject to reinvestment risk, it is also possible that these investments will be used to fund liabilities or may not be prepaid and will remain invested at their current yields. In addition to the interest rate environment, the mix of benefit payments versus product sales as well as the timing and volumes associated with such mix may impact our investment yield. Furthermore, reinvestment activities and the associated investment yield may also be impacted by corporate strategies implemented at management&#8217;s discretion. The average yield for investment purchases during the three months ended March 31, 2022 was approximately 2.4%. 

The reinvestment of proceeds from maturities, calls and prepayments at rates below the current portfolio yield, which may be below the level of some liability GMIRs, will have a negative impact to future operating results. To mitigate the unfavorable impact that the low interest rate environment has on our spread income, we assess reinvestment risk in our investment portfolio and monitor this risk in accordance with our asset/liability management framework. In addition, we may reduce the crediting rates on our fixed products when warranted, subject to guaranteed minimums. 

In addition to the fixed rate exposures noted above, RiverSource Life has the following variable annuity guarantee benefits: guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (&#8220;GMWB&#8221;), guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (&#8220;GMAB&#8221;), guaranteed minimum death benefits (&#8220;GMDB&#8221;) and guaranteed minimum income benefits (&#8220;GMIB&#8221;). Each of these benefits guarantees payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the underlying invested assets. 

The variable annuity guarantees continue to be managed by utilizing a hedging program which attempts to match the sensitivity of the assets with the sensitivity of the liabilities. This approach works with the premise that matched sensitivities will produce a highly effective hedging result. Our comprehensive hedging program focuses mainly on first order sensitivities of assets and liabilities: Equity Market Level (Delta), Interest Rate Level (Rho) and Volatility (Vega). Additionally, various second order sensitivities are managed. We use various options, swaptions, swaps and futures to manage risk exposures. The exposures are measured and monitored daily, and adjustments to the hedge portfolio are made as necessary. 

We have a macro hedge program to provide protection against the statutory tail scenario risk arising from variable annuity reserves on our statutory surplus and to cover some of the residual risks not covered by other hedging activities. We assess the residual risk under 

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

a range of scenarios in creating and executing the macro hedge program. As a means of economically hedging these risks, we may use a combination of futures, options, swaps and swaptions. Certain of the macro hedge derivatives used contain settlement provisions linked to both equity returns and interest rates; the remaining are interest rate contracts or equity contracts. The macro hedge program could result in additional earnings volatility as changes in the value of the macro hedge derivatives, which are designed to reduce statutory capital volatility, may not be closely aligned to changes in the variable annuity guarantee embedded derivatives. 

To evaluate interest rate and equity price risk we perform sensitivity testing which measures the impact on pretax income from the sources listed below for a 12-month period following a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a hypothetical 10% decline in equity prices. The interest rate risk test assumes a sudden 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, with rates then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. The equity price risk test assumes a sudden 10% drop in equity prices, with equity prices then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. In estimating the values of variable annuities, indexed annuities, stock market certificates, indexed universal life (&#8220;IUL&#8221;) insurance and the associated hedge assets, we assume no change in implied market volatility despite the 10% drop in equity prices. 

The following tables present our estimate of the impact on pretax income from the above defined hypothetical market movements as of March 31, 2022:

(5) The market impact of the macro hedge program is modeled net of any related impact to DAC and DSIC amortization. 

(6) Represents the net impact to pretax income. The estimated net impact to pretax adjusted operating income is approximately $(335) million. 

The above results compare to an estimated negative net impact to pretax income of $190 million related to a 10% equity price decline and an estimated positive net impact to pretax income of $80 million related to a 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2021. The change in interest rate exposure as of March 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021 was driven by variable annuity riders, specifically GMWB, primarily due to changes in market rates. 

Net impacts shown in the above table from GMWB riders result largely from differences between the liability valuation basis and the hedging basis. Liabilities are valued using fair value accounting principles, with risk margins incorporated in contractholder behavior assumptions and with discount rates increased to reflect a current market estimate of our risk of nonperformance specific to these liabilities. Our hedging is based on our determination of economic risk, which excludes certain items in the liability valuation including the nonperformance spread risk. 

Actual results will differ materially from those illustrated above as they are based on a number of estimates and assumptions. These include assuming that implied market volatility does not change when equity prices fall by 10% and that the 100 basis point increase in interest rates is a parallel shift of the yield curve. Furthermore, we have not tried to anticipate changes in client preferences for different types of assets or other changes in client behavior, nor have we tried to anticipate all strategic actions management might take to increase revenues or reduce expenses in these scenarios. 

The selection of a 100 basis point interest rate increase as well as a 10% equity price decline should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Impacts of larger or smaller changes in interest rates or equity prices may not be proportional to those shown for a 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a 10% decline in equity prices. 

Fair Value Measurements 

We report certain assets and liabilities at fair value; specifically, separate account assets, derivatives, embedded derivatives and most investments and cash equivalents. Fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale. We include actual market prices, or observable inputs, in our fair value measurements to the extent available. Broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available. We validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as: price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our fair value measurements. 

Fair Value of Liabilities and Nonperformance Risk 

Companies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant (an exit price). Since there is not a market for our obligations of our variable annuity riders, fixed deferred indexed annuities, structured variable annuities, and IUL insurance, we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price. As a result, we adjust the valuation of variable annuity riders, fixed deferred indexed annuities, structured annuities, and IUL insurance by updating certain contractholder assumptions, adding explicit margins to provide for risk, and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of our nonperformance risk. The nonperformance risk adjustment is based on observable market data adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities. Consistent with general market conditions, this estimate resulted in a spread over the LIBOR swap curve as of March 31, 2022. As our estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase. If this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the LIBOR swap curve, the reduction to future net income would be approximately $420 million, net of DAC, DSIC, unearned revenue amortization, the reinsurance accrual and income taxes (calculated at the statutory tax rate of 21%), based on March 31, 2022 credit spreads. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Overview 

We maintained substantial liquidity during the three months ended March 31, 2022. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had $6.6 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents excluding CIEs and other restricted cash on a consolidated basis. 

At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the parent company had $316 million and $841 million, respectively, in cash, cash equivalents, and unencumbered liquid securities. Liquid securities predominantly include U.S. government agency mortgage back securities. Additional sources of liquidity include a line of credit with an affiliate up to $729 million and an unsecured revolving committed credit facility for up to $1.0 billion that expires in June 2026. Management&#8217;s estimate of liquidity available to the parent company in a volatile and uncertain economic environment as of March 31, 2022 was $1.5 billion which includes cash, cash equivalents, unencumbered liquid securities, the line of credit with an affiliate and a portion of the committed credit facility. 

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

Under the terms of the committed credit facility, we can increase the availability to $1.25 billion upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements. Available borrowings under this facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. At March 31, 2022, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and had $1 million of outstanding letters of credit. Our credit facility contains various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We remain in compliance with all such covenants at March 31, 2022. 

In addition, we have access to collateralized borrowings, which may include repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) advances. Our subsidiaries, RiverSource Life Insurance Company (&#8220;RiverSource Life&#8221;), and Ameriprise Bank, FSB are members of the FHLB of Des Moines, which provides access to collateralized borrowings. As of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had $8.2 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively, under the FHLB facilities, of which $200 million was outstanding as of both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and is collateralized with commercial mortgage backed securities and residential mortgage backed securities. We believe cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances and our availability of revolver borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs and stress requirements. 

There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations disclosed in our 2021 10-K. 

We repaid $500 million principal amount of its 3.0% senior notes at maturity on March 22, 2022. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about our long-term debt maturities. 

We believe cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances, our availability of revolver borrowings and dividends from our subsidiaries will be sufficient to fund our short-term and long-term operating liquidity needs and stress requirements. 

We continue to monitor and respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Our risk management strategy is designed to provide proactive protection during stress events such as the current pandemic. We believe our process is working as intended, and our liquidity and capital resources have remained a source of balance sheet strength during the three months ended March 31, 2022. 

Dividends from Subsidiaries 

Ameriprise Financial is primarily a parent holding company for the operations carried out by our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Because of our holding company structure, our ability to meet our cash requirements, including the payment of dividends on our common stock, substantially depends upon the receipt of dividends or return of capital from our subsidiaries, particularly our life insurance subsidiary, RiverSource Life, our face-amount certificate subsidiary, Ameriprise Certificate Company (&#8220;ACC&#8221;), AMPF Holding Corporation, which is the parent company of our retail introducing broker-dealer subsidiary, Ameriprise Financial Services, LLC (&#8220;AFS&#8221;) and our clearing broker-dealer subsidiary, American Enterprise Investment Services, Inc. (&#8220;AEIS&#8221;), our transfer agent subsidiary, Columbia Management Investment Services Corp., our investment advisory company, Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC, TAM UK International Holdings Ltd, which includes Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings S&#224;rl and Ameriprise International Holdings GmbH within its organizational structure, and Columbia Threadneedle Investments UK International Ltd. The payment of dividends by many of our subsidiaries is restricted and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements. 

Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements for our wholly owned subsidiaries subject to regulatory capital requirements were as follows:

In addition to the particular regulations restricting dividend payments and establishing subsidiary capitalization requirements, we take into account the overall health of the business, capital levels and risk management considerations in determining a strategy for payments to our parent holding company from our subsidiaries, and in deciding to use cash to make capital contributions to our subsidiaries. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $777 million (including $300 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $129 million (including $95 million to Ameriprise Bank, FSB). During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $621 million (including $250 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $34 million. 

In 2009, RiverSource Life established an agreement to protect its exposure to Genworth Life Insurance Company (&#8220;GLIC&#8221;) for its reinsured LTC. In 2016, substantial enhancements to this reinsurance protection agreement were finalized. The terms of these confidential provisions within the agreement have been shared, in the normal course of regular reviews, with our domiciliary regulator and rating agencies. GLIC is domiciled in Delaware so in the event GLIC were subjected to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings, such proceedings would be located in (and governed by) Delaware laws. Delaware courts have a long tradition of respecting commercial and reinsurance affairs as well as contracts among sophisticated parties. Similar credit protections to what we have with GLIC have been tested and respected in Delaware and elsewhere in the United States, and as a result we believe our credit protections would be respected even in the unlikely event that GLIC becomes subject to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings in Delaware. Accordingly, while no credit protections are perfect, we believe the correct way to think about the risks represented by our counterparty credit exposure to GLIC is not the full amount of the gross liability that GLIC reinsures, but a much smaller net exposure to GLIC (if any that might exist after taking into account our credit protections). Thus, management believes that our agreement and offsetting non LTC legacy arrangements with Genworth will enable RiverSource Life to recover on all net exposure in all material respects in the event of a rehabilitation or insolvency of GLIC. 

Dividends Paid to Shareholders and Share Repurchases 

We paid regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders totaling $133 million and $129 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. On April 25, 2022, we announced a quarterly dividend of $1.25 per common share. The dividend will be paid on May 20, 2022 to our shareholders of record at the close of business on May 9, 2022. 

In August 2020, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $2.5 billion of our common stock through September 30, 2022. In January 2022, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors authorized an additional $3.0 billion for the repurchase of the Company&#8217;s common stock through March 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2022, we had $3.0 billion remaining under these share repurchase authorizations. We intend to fund share repurchases through existing working capital, future earnings and other customary financing methods. The share repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. Acquisitions under the share repurchase program may be made in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or block trades or other means. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we repurchased a total of 1.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $299.14 per share. 

Cash Flows 

Cash flows of CIEs and restricted and segregated cash and cash equivalents are reflected in our cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities.

Cash and cash equivalents segregated under federal and other regulations is held for the exclusive benefit of our brokerage customers and is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial.
