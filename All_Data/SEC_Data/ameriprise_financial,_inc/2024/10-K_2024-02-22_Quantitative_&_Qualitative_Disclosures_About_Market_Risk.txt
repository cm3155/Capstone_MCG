 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Market Risk 

Our primary market risk exposures are interest rate, equity price, foreign currency exchange rate and credit risk. Equity price and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the spread income generated on our brokerage client cash balances, banking deposits, face-amount certificate products, fixed portion of our variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, fixed annuity and insurance contracts, the value of market risk benefits and other liabilities associated with our variable annuities and the value of derivatives held to hedge related benefits. 

Market risk benefits continue to be managed by utilizing a hedging program which attempts to match the sensitivity of the assets with the sensitivity of the benefits. This approach works with the premise that matched sensitivities will produce a highly effective hedging result. Our comprehensive hedging program focuses mainly on first order sensitivities of assets and liabilities: Equity Market Level (Delta), Interest Rate Level (Rho) and Volatility (Vega). Additionally, various second order sensitivities are managed. We use various options, swaptions, swaps and futures to manage risk exposures. The exposures are measured and monitored daily, and adjustments to the hedge portfolio are made as necessary. 

To evaluate interest rate and equity price risk we perform sensitivity testing which measures the impact on pretax income from the sources listed below for a 12-month period following a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a hypothetical 10% decline in equity prices. The interest rate risk test assumes a sudden 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, with rates then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. The equity price risk test assumes a sudden 10% drop in equity prices, with equity prices then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. In estimating the values of variable annuities, indexed annuities, stock market certificates, indexed universal life (&#8220;IUL&#8221;) insurance and the associated hedging instruments, we assume no change in implied market volatility despite the 10% drop in equity prices.

(1) Excludes incentive income which is impacted by market and fund performance during the period and cannot be readily estimated. 

(2) Represents the net impact to pretax income. The estimated net impact to pretax adjusted operating income is $(319) million as of December 31, 2023 and $(283) million as of December 31, 2022, respectively. 

Net impacts shown in the above tables from market risk benefits result largely from differences between the liability valuation basis and the hedging basis. Liabilities are valued using fair value accounting principles, with risk margins incorporated in contractholder behavior assumptions. Our hedging is based on our determination of economic risk, which excludes certain items in the liability valuation. 

Actual results could and likely will differ materially from those illustrated above as fair values have a number of estimates and assumptions. For example, the illustration above includes assuming that implied market volatility does not change when equity prices fall by 10% and that the 100 basis point increase in interest rates is a parallel shift of the yield curve. Furthermore, we have not tried to anticipate changes in client preferences for different types of assets or other changes in client behavior, nor have we tried to anticipate all strategic actions management might take to increase revenues or reduce expenses in these scenarios. 

The selection of a 100 basis point interest rate increase as well as a 10% equity price decline should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Impacts of larger or smaller changes in interest rates or equity prices may not be proportional to those shown for a 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a 10% decline in equity prices. 

Asset-Based Management and Distribution Fees 

We earn asset-based management fees and distribution fees on our assets under management. As of December 31, 2023, the value of our assets under management was $1.1 trillion. These sources of revenue are subject to both interest rate and equity price risk since the value of these assets and the fees they earn fluctuate inversely with interest rates and directly with equity prices. We currently only hedge certain equity price risk for this exposure, primarily using futures and swaps. We currently do not hedge any of the interest rate risk for this exposure. 

Market Risk Benefits 

The total contract value of all variable annuities as of December 31, 2023 was $80.8 billion. See Note 13 for details of the reserves associated with market risk benefits. The changes in fair value of variable annuity market risk benefits are recorded through earnings, with the exception of the portion of the change in fair value due to a change in our nonperformance risk, which is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). Fair value is calculated based on projected, discounted cash flows over the life of the contract, including projected, discounted benefits and fees. 

Equity Price Risk 

The variable annuity guaranteed benefits guarantee payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the investment assets. For this reason, when equity prices decline, the returns from the separate account assets coupled with guaranteed benefit fees from annuity holders may not be sufficient to fund expected payouts. In that case, reserves must be increased with a negative impact to earnings. 

The core derivative instruments with which we hedge the equity price risk of these benefits are longer dated put and call options; these core instruments are supplemented with equity futures and total return swaps. See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our derivative instruments. 

Ameriprise Financial, Inc. 

Interest Rate Risk 

Increases in interest rates reduce the fair value of the liabilities and may result in market risk benefits in an asset position. The interest rate exposure is hedged with a portfolio of interest rate swaps, futures and swaptions. We have entered into interest rate swaps according to risk exposures along maturities, thus creating both fixed rate payor and variable rate payor terms. If interest rates were to increase, we would have to pay more to the swap counterparty, and the fair value of our equity puts would decrease, resulting in a negative impact to our pretax income. 

Structured Variable Annuities 

Structured variable annuities offer the contractholder the ability to allocate account value to either an account that earns fixed interest (fixed account) or an account that is impacted by the performance of various equity indices (indexed account) subject to a cap, floor or buffer. Our earnings are based upon the spread between investment income earned and the credits made to the fixed account and benefits reflected in an indexed account of the structured variable annuities. As of December 31, 2023, we had $10.7 billion in liabilities related to structured variable annuities. 

Equity Price Risk 

The equity-linked return to contractholders creates equity price risk as the amount paid to contractholders depends on changes in equity prices. The equity price risk for structured variable annuities is evaluated together with the variable annuity riders as part of a hedge program using the derivative instruments consistent with our hedging on variable annuity riders. 

Interest Rate Risk 

The fair value of the embedded derivative associated with structured variable annuities is based on a discounted cash flow approach. Changes in interest rates impact the discounting of the embedded derivative liability. The spread between the investment income earned and amounts transferred to contractholders is also affected by changes in interest rates. These interest rate risks associated with structured variable annuities are not currently hedged. 

Fixed Annuities, Fixed Insurance and Fixed Portion of Variable Annuities and Variable Insurance Contracts 

Our earnings from fixed deferred annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts are based upon the spread between rates earned on assets held and the rates at which interest is credited to accounts. We primarily invest in fixed rate securities to fund the rate credited to clients. We guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products. Investment assets and client liabilities generally differ as it relates to basis, repricing or maturity characteristics. Rates credited to clients&#8217; accounts generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on the underlying investments. Therefore, in an increasing interest rate environment, higher interest rates may be reflected in crediting rates to clients sooner than in rates earned on invested assets, which could result in a reduced spread between the two rates, reduced earned income and a negative impact on pretax income. While interest rates under the current environment have relieved some pressure from the liability guaranteed minimum interest rates (&#8220;GMIRs&#8221;), there are still some GMIRs above current levels. Hence, liability credited rates will move more slowly under a modest rise in interest rates while projected asset purchases would capture the full increase in interest rates. This dynamic would result in widening spreads under a modestly rising rate scenario given the current relationship between the current level of interest rates and the underlying GMIRs on the business. Of the $37.5 billion in Policyholder account balances, future policy benefits and claims as of December 31, 2023, $16.9 billion is related to liabilities created by these products. We do not hedge this exposure. 

As a result of the current market environment, reinvestment yields are becoming more aligned with the current portfolio yield. We would expect the recent decline in our portfolio income yields to slow and begin to stabilize in future periods under the current environment. The carrying value and weighted average yield of non-structured fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans that may generate proceeds to reinvest through 2025 due to prepayment, maturity or call activity at the option of the issuer, excluding securities with a make-whole provision, were $5.6 billion and 4.9%, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. In addition, residential mortgage backed securities, which can be subject to prepayment risk under a low interest rate environment, totaled $21.1 billion and had a weighted average yield of 4.4% as of December 31, 2023. While these amounts represent investments that could be subject to reinvestment risk, it is also possible that these investments will be used to fund liabilities or may not be prepaid and will remain invested at their current yields. In addition to the interest rate environment, the mix of benefit payments versus product sales as well as the timing and volumes associated with such mix may impact our investment yield. Furthermore, reinvestment activities and the associated investment yield may also be impacted by corporate strategies implemented at management&#8217;s discretion. The average yield for investment purchases during the year ended December 31, 2023 was approximately 5.8%. 

The reinvestment of proceeds from maturities, calls and prepayments at rates near the current portfolio yield will have a limited impact to future operating results. In this volatile rate environment, we assess reinvestment risk in our investment portfolio and monitor this risk in accordance with our asset/liability management framework. In addition, we may update the crediting rates on our fixed products when warranted, subject to guaranteed minimums.

See Note 11 for more information on the account values of fixed deferred annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts by range of GMIRs and the range of the difference between rates credited to policyholders and contractholders as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the respective guaranteed minimums, as well as the percentage of account values subject to rate reset in the time period indicated. 

Banking Deposits and Brokerage Client Cash Balances 

We pay interest on banking deposits and certain brokerage client cash balances and have the ability to reset these rates from time to time based on prevailing economic and business conditions. We earn revenue to fund the interest paid from interest-earning assets or fees from off-balance sheet deposits at Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured institutions, which are indexed to short-term interest rates. In general, the change in interest paid lags the change in revenues earned. 

Certificate Products 

Fixed Rate Certificates 

We have interest rate risk from our investment certificates generally ranging in amounts from $1 thousand to $2 million with interest crediting rate terms ranging from 3 to 36 months. We guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products. Payments collected from clients are primarily invested in fixed income securities to fund the client credited rate with the spread between the rate earned from investments and the rate credited to clients recorded as earned income. Client liabilities and investment assets generally differ as it relates to basis, repricing or maturity characteristics. Rates credited to clients generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on underlying investments. This exposure is not currently hedged although we monitor our investment strategy and make modifications based on our changing liabilities and the expected interest rate environment. Of the $37.3 billion in customer deposits as of December 31, 2023, $13.3 billion related to reserves for our fixed rate certificate products. 

Indexed Universal Life 

IUL insurance is similar to UL in many regards, although the rate of credited interest above the minimum guarantee for funds allocated to an indexed account is linked to the performance of the specified index for the indexed account (subject to stated account parameters, which include a cap and floor, or a spread and floor). The policyholder may allocate all or a portion of the policy value to a fixed or any available indexed account. As of December 31, 2023, we had $2.7 billion in liabilities related to the indexed accounts of IUL. 

Equity Price Risk 

The equity-linked return to investors creates equity price risk as the amount credited depends on changes in equity prices. Most of the proceeds received from IUL insurance are invested in fixed income securities. To hedge the equity exposure, a portion of the investment earnings received from the fixed income securities is used to purchase call spreads which generate returns to replicate what we must credit to client accounts. 

Interest Rate Risk 

As mentioned above, most of the proceeds received from IUL insurance are invested in fixed income securities with the return on those investments intended to fund the purchase of call spreads and options. There are two risks relating to interest rates. First, we have the risk that investment returns are such that we do not have enough investment income to purchase the needed call spreads. Second, in the event the policy is surrendered we pay out a book value surrender amount and there is a risk that we will incur a loss upon having to sell the fixed income securities backing the liability (if interest rates have risen). This risk is not currently hedged. 

Foreign Currency Risk 

We have foreign currency risk through our net investment in foreign subsidiaries and our operations in foreign countries. We are primarily exposed to changes in British Pounds related to our net investment in Threadneedle, which was approximately &#163;1.3 billion as of December 31, 2023. We also have exposure related to operations in foreign countries to Euros, Indian Rupees and other currencies. We monitor the foreign exchange rates that we have exposure to and enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate risk when economically prudent. As of December 31, 2023, the notional value of outstanding contracts and our remaining foreign currency risk related to operations in foreign countries were not material. 

Interest Rate Risk on External Debt 

The stated interest rates on our $3.4 billion of senior unsecured notes are fixed. 

Credit Risk 

We are exposed to credit risk within our investment portfolio, including our loan portfolio, and through our derivative and reinsurance activities. Credit risk relates to the uncertainty of an obligor&#8217;s continued ability to make timely payments in accordance with the contractual terms of the financial instrument or contract. We consider our total potential credit exposure to each counterparty and its affiliates to ensure compliance with pre-established credit guidelines at the time we enter into a transaction which would potentially increase our credit risk. These guidelines and oversight of credit risk are managed through a comprehensive enterprise risk management program that includes members of senior management. 

Ameriprise Financial, Inc. 

We manage the risk of credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties by applying disciplined fundamental credit analysis and underwriting standards, prudently limiting exposures to lower-quality, higher-yielding investments, and diversifying exposures by issuer, industry, region and underlying investment type. We remain exposed to occasional adverse cyclical economic downturns during which default rates may be significantly higher than the long-term historical average used in pricing. 

We manage our credit risk related to over-the-counter derivatives by entering into transactions with creditworthy counterparties, maintaining collateral arrangements and through the use of master netting arrangements that provide for a single net payment to be made by one counterparty to another at each due date and upon termination. Generally, our current credit exposure on over-the-counter derivative contracts is limited to a derivative counterparty&#8217;s net positive fair value of derivative contracts after taking into consideration the existence of netting arrangements and any collateral received. This exposure is monitored and managed to an acceptable threshold level. 

The counterparty risk for centrally cleared over-the-counter derivatives is transferred to a central clearing party through contract novation. The central clearing party requires both daily settlement of mark-to-market and initial margin. Because the central clearing party monitors open positions and adjusts collateral requirements daily, we have minimal credit exposure from such derivative instruments. 

Exchange-traded derivatives are effected through regulated exchanges that require contract standardization and initial margin to transact through the exchange. Because exchange-traded futures are marked to market and generally cash settled on a daily basis, we have minimal exposure to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to such derivative instruments. Other exchange-traded derivatives would be exposed to nonperformance by counterparties for amounts in excess of initial margin requirements only if the exchange is unable to fulfill the contract. 

We manage our credit risk related to reinsurance treaties by evaluating the financial condition of reinsurance counterparties prior to entering into new reinsurance treaties. In addition, we regularly evaluate their financial strength during the terms of the treaties. As of December 31, 2023, our largest reinsurance credit risks are related to coinsurance treaties with Global Atlantic Financial Group&#8217;s subsidiary Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company and with life insurance subsidiaries of Genworth Financial, Inc. See Note 7 and Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on reinsurance.
