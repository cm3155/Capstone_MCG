 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; that follow and our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes presented in Item 1. Our Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) on February 22, 2024 (&#8220;2023 10-K&#8221;), as well as our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. References below to &#8220;Ameriprise Financial,&#8221; &#8220;Ameriprise,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to Ameriprise Financial, Inc. exclusively, to our entire family of companies, or to one or more of our subsidiaries. 

Overview 

Ameriprise Financial is a diversified financial services company with a 130-year history of providing financial solutions. We are a long-standing leader in financial planning and advice with $1.5 trillion in assets under management and administration as of September 30, 2024. We offer a broad range of products and services designed to achieve individual and institutional clients&#8217; financial objectives. 

The products and services we provide retail clients and, to a lesser extent, institutional clients, are the primary source of our revenues and net income. Revenues and net income are significantly affected by investment performance and the total value and composition of assets we manage and administer for our retail and institutional clients as well as the distribution fees we receive from other companies. These factors, in turn, are largely determined by overall investment market performance and the depth and breadth of our individual client relationships. 

We operate our business in the broader context of the macroeconomic forces around us, including the global and U.S. economies, changes in interest and inflation rates, financial market volatility, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, geopolitical strain, pandemics, the competitive environment, client and customer activities and preferences, and the various regulatory and legislative developments. Financial markets and macroeconomic conditions have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our operating and performance results. In addition, the business, political and regulatory environments in which we operate are subject to elevated uncertainty and substantial, frequent change. Accordingly, we expect to continue focusing on our key strategic objectives and obtaining operational and strategic leverage from our core capabilities. The success of these and other strategies may be affected by the factors discussed in Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in our 2023 10-K and other factors as discussed herein. 

Equity price, credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the values of market risk benefits and embedded derivatives associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits and the &#8220;spread&#8221; income generated on our deposit products, fixed insurance, the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts and fixed deferred annuities. A higher (lower) interest rate environment may result in decreases (increases) to our long-duration contract reserves, which may impact our adjusted operating earnings after tax. For additional discussion on our interest rate risk, see Item 3. &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.&#8221; 

In the third quarter, we conducted our annual review of life insurance, annuity and long term care (&#8220;LTC&#8221;) valuation assumptions relative to current experience and management expectations including modeling changes. These annual assumption updates are collectively referred to as unlocking throughout this document. See our Consolidated and Segment Results of Operations sections for the pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking. 

We consolidate certain variable interest entities for which we provide asset management services. These entities are defined as consolidated investment entities (&#8220;CIEs&#8221;). While the consolidation of the CIEs impacts our balance sheet and income statement, our exposure to these entities is unchanged and there is no impact to the underlying business results. For further information on CIEs, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The results of operations of the CIEs are reflected in the Corporate &#38; Other segment. On a consolidated basis, the management fees we earn for the services we provide to the CIEs and the related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities related to the CIEs, primarily syndicated loans and debt, are reflected in Net investment income. We include the fees from these entities in the Management and financial advice fees line within our Asset Management segment. 

While our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;), management believes that adjusted operating earnings measures, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, net of reinsurance accrual; the market impact on non-traditional long-duration products (including variable and fixed deferred annuity contracts and universal life (&#8220;UL&#8221;) insurance contracts), net of hedges and the reinsurance accrual; mean reversion related impacts (the impact on variable universal life (&#8220;VUL&#8221;) products for the difference between assumed and updated separate account investment performance on the reinsurance accrual and additional insurance benefit reserves); the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate and currency changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments; block transfer reinsurance transaction impact; gain or loss on disposal of a business that is not considered discontinued operations; integration and restructuring charges; income (loss) from 

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

discontinued operations; and the impact of consolidating CIEs, best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. 

The market impact on non-traditional long-duration products includes changes in market risk benefits and embedded derivative values caused by changes in financial market conditions, net of changes in economic hedge values and unhedged items including the difference between assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and certain policyholder contract elections. The market impact also includes certain valuation adjustments made in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure s, including the impact on embedded derivative values of discounting projected benefits to reflect a current estimate of our life insurance subsidiary&#8217;s nonperformance spread. 

In the first quarter of 2023, management introduced an adjusted capital measure (&#8220;Available Capital for Capital Adequacy&#8221;), which management believes best reflects the available capital resources of our core operations and facilitates a meaningful trend analysis. Available Capital for Capital Adequacy adjusts GAAP total equity and excludes accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;); goodwill and intangibles; RiverSource Life Insurance Company&#8217;s GAAP equity excluding AOCI; and includes RiverSource Life Insurance Company&#8217;s statutory total adjusted capital prepared in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the State of Minnesota Department of Commerce; and other adjustments, primarily certain deferred tax balances. 

Management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance and available capital on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters. Throughout our Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis, these non-GAAP measures are referred to as adjusted operating measures. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures. 

It is management&#8217;s priority to increase shareholder value over a multi-year horizon by achieving our on-average, over-time financial targets. 

Our financial targets are: 

&#8226; Adjusted operating earnings per diluted share growth of 12% to 15%, and 

&#8226; Adjusted operating return on equity of over 30%.

Assets Under Management and Administration 

Assets under management (&#8220;AUM&#8221;) include external client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the Columbia Threadneedle Investments funds, institutional clients and clients in our advisor platform held in wrap accounts as well as assets managed by sub-advisors selected by us. AUM also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we provide investment management services and recognize management fees in our Asset Management segment, such as the assets of the general account and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries and CIEs. 

Assets under administration (&#8220;AUA&#8221;) include assets for which we provide administrative services such as client assets invested in other companies&#8217; products that we offer outside of our wrap accounts. These assets include those held in clients&#8217; brokerage accounts. We generally record revenues received from administered assets as distribution fees. We do not exercise management discretion over these assets and do not earn a management fee. These assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. AUA also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we do not provide investment management services and do not recognize management fees, such as investments in non-affiliated funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries. 

AUM and AUA do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide advisory services such as model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority.

Total AUA increased $71.8 billion, or 30%, to $314.2 billion as of September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily driven by equity market appreciation and an increase in third-party money market funds and brokered CDs.

Overall 

Pretax income decreased $472 million, or 42%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. The following impacts were significant drivers of the period-over-period change in pretax income: 

&#8226; The market impact on non-traditional long duration products (including variable and fixed deferred annuity contracts and UL insurance contracts), net of hedges and the reinsurance accrual was an expense of $402 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a benefit of $211 million for the prior year period. 

&#8226; An unfavorable impact from the cumulative impact of Asset Management net outflows. 

&#8226; A favorable impact from the trend in rising investment portfolio yields, along with higher balances in Ameriprise Bank, FSB (&#8220;Ameriprise Bank&#8221;) customer deposits and structured variable annuities (&#8220;SVA&#8221;) products. 

&#8226; A favorable impact from higher average equity markets compared to the prior year period. Our average WEI, which is a proxy for equity movements on AUM, increased 22% in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. The average S&#38;P 500 index was 24% higher in the quarter compared to the prior year period.

Refer to Results of Operations by Segment for the impact to pretax adjusted operating earnings attributable to unlocking. 

The primary driver of the unlocking impact was lowered surrender assumptions on variable annuities with living benefits resulting in an expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by the updated claims incident rates on disability insurance. The primary driver of the unlocking impact was lowered surrender assumptions on variable annuities with living benefits resulting in an expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net Revenues 

Management and financial advice fees increased $286 million, or 13%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period reflecting market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by the cumulative impact of Asset Management net outflows. 

Distribution fees increased $50 million, or 11%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher transactional activity and market appreciation, partially offset by $26 million of lower fees on off-balance sheet brokerage cash. 

Net investment income increased $125 million, or 15%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: 

&#8226; The favorable impact of growth in Ameriprise Bank customer deposits and SVA products. 

&#8226; The favorable impact of the trend in rising investment portfolio yields. 

Banking and deposit interest expense increased $12 million, or 8%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting higher average crediting rates on certificates and Ameriprise Bank cash deposits. 

Expenses 

Distribution expenses increased $242 million, or 19%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting higher market appreciation and higher transactional activity. 

Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $21 million, or 15%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: 

&#8226; A $20 million decrease in expense from other market impacts on indexed universal life (&#8220;IUL&#8221;) benefits, net of hedges, which was a benefit of $35 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a benefit of $15 million for the prior year period. The decrease in expense was primarily due to a decrease in the IUL embedded derivative in the current period, which reflected model changes and lower option costs due to a lower new money rate, offset by less discounting due to lower Treasury rates. 

&#8226; A $3 million increase in expense from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on IUL benefits. The unfavorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an unfavorable impact of $2 million for the prior year period. 

Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $310 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting a $221 million increase in expense from market impacts on SVA embedded derivative, net of 

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

hedges in place to offset those risks. This increase was primarily the result of an unfavorable $683 million change in the market impact on SVA embedded derivative and a favorable $464 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the SVA embedded derivative. The main market driver contributing to these changes was the equity market impact on the SVA embedded derivative net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in an expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a benefit in the prior year period. The increase in expense also reflects the impact of increased volume in SVAs and the impact of higher sales of life contingent payout annuities. 

Change in fair value of market risk benefits increased $398 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: 

&#8226; A $401 million increase in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks. This increase was the result of an unfavorable $983 million change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits reserves, partially offset by a favorable $595 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below: 

&#8226; Equity market impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an expense in the prior year period. 

&#8226; Interest rate and bond impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in an expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a benefit in the prior year period. 

&#8226; Volatility impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an expense in the prior year period. 

&#8226; Other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a higher net expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. 

General and administrative expense increased $25 million, or 3%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily due to $17 million of higher severance expense, expenses to accelerate our transition to cloud-based technology, higher compensation accruals related to strong performance and the mark-to-market impacts on share-based compensation, partially offset by our continued focus on operational efficiency and effectiveness and a $20 million accrual for a regulatory matter relating to electronic communication recordkeeping requirements in the prior year period. 

Income Taxes 

Our effective tax rate was 20.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 21.8% for the prior year period. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to lower pretax income in the current period compared to the prior period and the related impact on tax preferred items, a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits, and a decrease in foreign taxes, partially offset by an increase in state income taxes, net of federal benefit. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on income taxes. 

Results of Operations by Segment for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Adjusted operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss management uses to evaluate segment performance. Adjusted operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP pretax income. We believe the presentation of segment adjusted operating earnings as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitating a more meaningful trend analysis. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the presentation of segment results and our definition of adjusted operating earnings.

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

Net Revenues 

Management and financial advice fees increased $805 million, or 12%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period reflecting market appreciation and continued wrap account net inflows, partially offset by the cumulative impact of Asset Management net outflows. 

Distribution fees increased $62 million, or 4%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period due to market appreciation and strong transactional activity, partially offset by $146 million of lower fees on off-balance sheet brokerage cash. 

Net investment income increased $438 million, or 19%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting: 

&#8226; The favorable impact of growth in Ameriprise Bank customer deposits and SVA products, along with higher average certificate balances. 

&#8226; The favorable impact of the trend in rising investment portfolio yields. 

Premiums, policy and contract charges increased $45 million, or 4%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period due to higher sales of life contingent payout annuities. 

Banking and deposit interest expense increased $129 million, or 34%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting higher average crediting rates and higher average volumes on certificates and Ameriprise Bank cash deposits. 

Expenses 

Distribution expenses increased $637 million, or 17%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting higher advisor compensation from higher average wrap account assets and increased transactional activity, as well as continued investments in recruiting experienced advisors. 

Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $29 million, or 6%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: 

&#8226; A $39 million decrease in expense from other market impacts on IUL benefits, net of hedges, which was a benefit of $23 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an expense of $16 million for the prior year period. The decrease in expense was primarily due to a decrease in the IUL embedded derivative in the current period, which reflected model changes and more discounting due to higher Treasury rates, partially offset by higher option costs due to a higher option budget. 

&#8226; A $23 million increase in expense from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on IUL benefits. The unfavorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $17 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a favorable impact of $6 million for the prior year period. 

Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $308 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting a $130 million increase in expense from market impacts on SVA embedded derivative, net of hedges in place to offset those risks. This increase was primarily the result of a favorable $804 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the SVA embedded derivative and an unfavorable $916 million change in the market impact on SVA embedded derivative. The main market driver contributing to these changes was the equity market impact on the SVA embedded derivative net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a higher expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. This increase also reflects the impact of higher sales of life contingent payout annuities and increased volume in SVAs. 

Change in fair value of market risk benefits increased $100 million, or 18%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: 

&#8226; A $69 million increase in expense from market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks. This increase was the result of an unfavorable $437 million change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits reserves and a favorable $392 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below: 

&#8226; Equity market impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a higher benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. 

&#8226; Interest rate and bond impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in an expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a benefit for the prior year period. 

&#8226; Volatility impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a higher expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period.

Fair Value Measurements 

We report certain assets and liabilities at fair value; specifically, separate account assets, derivatives, market risk benefits, embedded derivatives, and most investments and cash equivalents. Fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale. We include actual market prices, or observable inputs, in our fair value measurements to the extent available. Broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available. We validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as: price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our fair value measurements. 

Fair Value of Liabilities and Nonperformance Risk 

Companies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant (an exit price). Since there is not a market for our obligations of our market risk benefits, fixed deferred indexed annuities, structured variable annuities, and IUL insurance, we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price. As a result, we adjust the valuation of market risk benefits, fixed deferred indexed annuities, structured variable annuities, and IUL insurance by updating certain contractholder assumptions, adding explicit margins to provide for risk, and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of our nonperformance risk. The nonperformance risk adjustment is based on observable market data adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities. Consistent with general market conditions, this estimate resulted in a spread over the U.S. Treasury curve as of September 30, 2024. As our estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase, respectively. If this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the U.S. Treasury curve, the reduction to future total equity would be approximately $639 million, net of the reinsurance accrual and income taxes (calculated at the statutory tax rate of 21%), based on September 30, 2024 credit spreads. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Overview 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had Available Capital for Capital Adequacy of $5.5 billion and $5.4 billion, respectively. Available Capital for Capital Adequacy best reflects the available capital resources of our core operations. 

We maintained substantial liquidity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had $10.6 billion and $7.5 billion, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents excluding CIEs and other restricted cash on a consolidated basis. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the parent company had $1.4 billion and $544 million, respectively, in cash, cash equivalents, and unencumbered liquid securities. Liquid securities predominantly include U.S. government agency mortgage backed securities. Additional sources of liquidity at the parent company include a line of credit with an affiliate up to $714 million and an unsecured revolving committed credit facility for up to $1.0 billion that expires in June 2026. Management&#8217;s estimate of liquidity available to the parent company in a volatile and uncertain economic environment as of September 30, 2024 was $2.6 billion which includes cash, cash equivalents, unencumbered liquid securities, the line of credit with an affiliate and a portion of the committed credit facility. 

Under the terms of the committed credit facility, we can increase the availability to $1.25 billion upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements. Available borrowings under this facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. At September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and had $1 million of letters of credit issued against the facility. Our credit facility contains various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We remained in compliance with all such covenants at September 30, 2024. 

In addition, we have access to collateralized borrowings, which may include repurchase agreements, Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) advances, and advances at the Federal Reserve. Our subsidiaries, RiverSource Life Insurance Company (&#8220;RiverSource Life&#8221;), and Ameriprise Bank are members of the FHLB of Des Moines, which provides access to collateralized borrowings. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had $8.5 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively, of estimated borrowing capacity under the FHLB facilities, of which $201 million was outstanding as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and is collateralized with commercial mortgage backed securities and residential mortgage backed securities. In addition, Ameriprise Bank maintains access to borrowings from the Federal Reserve which are collateralized with residential mortgage backed securities, commercial mortgage backed securities and corporate debt securities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we estimated $11.9 billion and $12.3 billion, respectively, of borrowing capacity from the Federal Reserve in addition to the FHLB capacity and there were no outstanding obligations. 

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations disclosed in our 2023 10-K. 

See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about our long-term debt maturities, including $550 million maturing in October 2024. 

We believe cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances, our availability of internal and external borrowings, access to debt markets, and dividends from our subsidiaries will be sufficient to fund our short-term and long-term operating liquidity needs and stress requirements. 

On August 16, 2022, federal legislation commonly referred to as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (&#8220;IRA&#8221;) was enacted. We have evaluated the tax provisions of the IRA, the most significant of which are the corporate alternative minimum tax (&#8220;CAMT&#8221;) and the share repurchase excise tax. Both the CAMT and share repurchase tax were effective beginning in 2023. We are an applicable corporation required to compute CAMT; and, based on current estimates, we recorded a CAMT liability for 2024. The U.S. Department of the Treasury issued proposed CAMT regulations in the current quarter. The proposed regulations are subject to public review and comment prior to finalizing. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of the proposed regulations. We are a covered corporation subject to the 1% excise tax on the net shares repurchased. We have recorded in shareholders&#8217; equity an estimate of the excise tax liability based on our interpretation of the current guidance. As additional guidance is issued related to the IRA, we will continue to evaluate any impact to our consolidated financial statements. 

In December 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development published the Pillar Two model rules which introduce new taxing mechanisms aimed at ensuring multinational enterprises pay a minimum level of tax on profits from each jurisdiction in which they operate. Various jurisdictions in which we operate have enacted or substantively enacted Pillar Two legislation that became effective beginning January 1, 2024. We intend to rely on Pillar Two transitional safe harbors where available and, based on the current estimate, have not recorded any Pillar Two tax liabilities. We continue to monitor the adoption and implementation of these rules and evaluate the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

Dividends from Subsidiaries 

Ameriprise Financial is primarily a parent holding company for the operations carried out by our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Because of our holding company structure, our ability to meet our cash requirements, including the payment of dividends on our common stock, substantially depends upon the receipt of dividends or return of capital from our subsidiaries, particularly our life insurance subsidiary, RiverSource Life, our face-amount certificate subsidiary, Ameriprise Certificate Company (&#8220;ACC&#8221;), Ameriprise Bank, AMPF Holding, LLC, which is the parent company of our retail introducing broker-dealer subsidiary, Ameriprise Financial Services, LLC (&#8220;AFS&#8221;) and our clearing broker-dealer subsidiary, American Enterprise Investment Services, Inc. (&#8220;AEIS&#8221;), our transfer agent subsidiary, Columbia Management Investment Services Corp. (&#8220;CMIS&#8221;), our investment advisory company, Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC (&#8220;CMIA&#8221;), TAM UK International Holdings Ltd, which includes Ameriprise International Holdings GmbH within its organizational structure, and Columbia Threadneedle Investments UK International Ltd. The payment of dividends by many of our subsidiaries is restricted and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements. For example, RiverSource Life payments in excess of statutory unassigned funds require advanced notice to the Minnesota Department of Commerce (&#8220;MN DOC&#8221;), RiverSource Life&#8217;s primary regulator, and are subject to potential disapproval. In addition, dividends and other distributions whose fair market value, together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater of the previous year&#8217;s statutory net gain from operations or 10% of the previous year-end statutory capital and surplus are referred to as &#8220;extraordinary dividends.&#8221; Extraordinary dividends also require advanced notice to MN DOC, and are subject to potential disapproval. 

Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Rule 15c3-1 provides an &#8220;alternative net capital requirement&#8221; which AEIS and AFS (significant broker dealers) have elected. Regulations require that minimum net capital, as defined, be equal to the greater of $250 thousand or 2% of aggregate debit items arising from client balances. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;) may impose certain restrictions, such as restricting withdrawals of equity capital, if a member firm were to fall below a certain threshold or fail to meet minimum net capital requirements. 

Ameriprise Bank is subject to regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in its role as insurer of its deposits. Ameriprise Bank is required to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), Tier 1 Capital to average assets (as defined), and under rules defined under the Basel III capital framework, Common equity Tier 1 capital (&#8220;CEIT&#8221;) to risk-weighted assets. Ameriprise Bank calculates these ratios under the Basel III standardized approach in order to assess compliance with both regulatory requirements and Ameriprise Bank&#8217;s internal capital policies. As permitted under the rules of the Basel III capital framework, we have elected to exclude AOCI from the calculation of regulatory capital. 

ACC is registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the &#8220;1940 Act&#8221;). ACC markets and sells investment certificates to clients. ACC is subject to various capital requirements under the 1940 Act, laws of the State of Minnesota 

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

and understandings with the SEC and the Minnesota Department of Commerce. The terms of the investment certificates issued by ACC and the provisions of the 1940 Act also require the maintenance by ACC of qualified assets. 

Actual capital and the regulatory capital requirement for TAM UK International Holdings Ltd. and Columbia Threadneedle Investments UK International Ltd. are calculated and reported as a single consolidated group under TAM UK International Holdings Ltd. Required capital for these entities is predominantly based on the requirements specified by its regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;), under its Capital Adequacy Requirements for investment firms. 

Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements for our wholly owned subsidiaries subject to regulatory capital requirements were as follows:

In October 2023, the Federal Reserve Board (&#8220;FRB&#8221;) issued its final rule establishing a consolidated capital framework termed the &#8220;Building Block Approach&#8221; for savings and loan holding companies like Ameriprise Financial that are significantly engaged in insurance activities. The rule became effective January 1, 2024, with reporting to the FRB beginning in 2025. 

In addition to the particular regulations restricting dividend payments and establishing subsidiary capitalization requirements, we take into account the overall health of the business, capital levels and risk management considerations in determining a strategy for payments to our parent holding company from our subsidiaries, and in deciding to use cash to make capital contributions to our subsidiaries. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $3.2 billion (including $525 million from Ameriprise Bank, $600 million from RiverSource Life and $1.2 billion from AMPF Holding, LLC) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $95 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $2.3 billion (including $500 million from RiverSource Life and $1.1 billion from AMPF Holding, LLC) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $277 million. 

In 2009, RiverSource Life established an agreement to protect its exposure to Genworth Life Insurance Company (&#8220;GLIC&#8221;) for its reinsured LTC. In 2016, substantial enhancements to this reinsurance protection agreement were finalized. The terms of these confidential provisions within the agreement have been shared, in the normal course of regular reviews, with our domiciliary regulator and rating agencies. GLIC is domiciled in Delaware, so in the event GLIC was subjected to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings, such proceedings would be located in (and governed by) Delaware laws. Delaware courts have a long tradition of respecting commercial and reinsurance affairs as well as contracts among sophisticated parties. Similar credit protections to what we have with GLIC have been tested and respected in Delaware and elsewhere in the United States, and as a result we believe our credit protections would be respected even in the unlikely event that GLIC becomes subject to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings in Delaware. Accordingly, while no credit protections are perfect, we believe the correct way to think about the risks represented by our 

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

counterparty credit exposure to GLIC is not the full amount of the gross liability that GLIC reinsures, but a much smaller net exposure to GLIC (if any that might exist after taking into account our credit protections). Thus, management believes that our agreement and offsetting non-LTC legacy arrangements with Genworth Financial, Inc. will enable RiverSource Life to recover on all net exposure in all material respects in the event of a rehabilitation or insolvency of GLIC. 

Dividends Paid to Shareholders and Share Repurchases 

We paid regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders totaling $444 million and $427 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. On October 23, 2024, we announced a quarterly dividend of $1.48 per common share. The dividend will be paid on November 15, 2024 to our shareholders of record at the close of business on November 4, 2024. 

On July 24, 2023, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $3.5 billion for the repurchase of our common stock through September 30, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, we had $1.5 billion remaining under this share repurchase authorization. We intend to fund share repurchases through existing excess capital, future free cash flow generation and other customary financing methods. The share repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. Acquisitions under the share repurchase program may be made in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or block trades or other means. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased a total of 3.8 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $426.72 per share. 

Cash Flows 

Cash flows of CIEs and restricted and segregated cash and cash equivalents are reflected in our cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash held by CIEs is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial, nor is Ameriprise Financial cash available for general use by its CIEs. Cash and cash equivalents segregated under federal and other regulations is held for the exclusive benefit of our brokerage customers and is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial. 

Operating Activities 

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $3.7 billion to $6.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $2.5 billion for the prior year period primarily reflecting earnings from our fee based business operations, net cash inflows in brokerage deposits, lower income taxes paid, and higher investment income. 

Investing Activities 

Our investing activities primarily relate to our Available-for-Sale investment portfolio and in recent quarters is significantly affected by the net flows of our face amount certificates and bank deposit activity. 

Net cash provided by investing activities was $232 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $7.3 billion for the prior year period. The increase in net cash provided by investing activities primarily reflects a $4.5 billion increase in proceeds from maturities, sinking fund payments and calls of Available-for-Sale securities, a $2.6 billion decrease in purchases of Available-for-Sale securities and a $1.1 billion increase in proceeds from sales of Available-for-Sale securities. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash used in financing activities was $3.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $4.0 billion for the prior year period. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflects a $4.8 billion decrease in net cash flows from investment certificates and a $2.4 billion decrease in the change in banking deposits, net due to the strong growth in the prior year period.
