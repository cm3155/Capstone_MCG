 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; that follow and our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes presented in Item 1. Our Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) on February 26, 2020 (&#8220;2019 10-K&#8221;), as well as our current reports on Form 8-K and other publicly available information. References below to &#8220;Ameriprise Financial,&#8221; &#8220;Ameriprise,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to Ameriprise Financial, Inc. exclusively, to our entire family of companies, or to one or more of our subsidiaries. 

Overview 

Ameriprise Financial is a diversified financial services company with a more than 125-year history of providing financial solutions. We are a long-standing leader in financial planning and advice with nearly $1 trillion in assets under management and administration as of September 30, 2020. We offer a broad range of products and services designed to achieve individual and institutional clients&#8217; financial objectives. 

The coronavirus disease 2019 (&#8216;&#8216;COVID-19&#8217;&#8217;) pandemic presents ongoing significant economic and societal disruption and market volatility, which has had and will continue to have ongoing impacts to our business and operating environment driven by a low interest rate environment and significant volatility in the equity markets and the potential associated implications to client behavior. There are no reliable estimates of how long the pandemic will last, how many people are likely to be affected by it, or its impact on the overall economy. 

We continue to implement comprehensive strategies to navigate the operating environment spurred by the pandemic. During the first quarter, we implemented a work-from-home protocol for virtually all of our employee population, restricted business travel, and provided resources for complying with the guidance from the World Health Organization, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and governments. We have begun a thoughtful phased reopening of our office locations while complying with applicable health agencies&#8217; guidelines and governmental orders. We continue to operate successfully and satisfy elevated customer service volumes in this unique time - client service and the health and safety of our clients, advisors and employees remain our priorities while our employees and advisors have various work arrangements. The pandemic strategy we have employed is flexible and scalable, recognizing this pandemic is widespread and may occur in multiple waves, affecting different communities at different times with varying levels of severity. 

There was significant economic volatility during 2020 and our results of operations have been, and will likely continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. There is still uncertainty surrounding the magnitude, duration, speed and reach of the ongoing global pandemic, as well as the impact of actions that have been or could be taken by governmental authorities, clients or other third parties. While we have successfully adapted to a virtual work environment and deployed numerous adaptive business strategies so far this year, we believe the pandemic and its accompanying impact on the global financial markets and on our operations and financial results may cause results not to be comparable to the same period in previous years. The results presented in this report are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. For further information regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any potentially material effects, see Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in this report. 

The products and services we provide retail clients and, to a lesser extent, institutional clients, are the primary source of our revenues and net income. Revenues and net income are significantly affected by investment performance and the total value and composition of assets we manage and administer for our retail and institutional clients as well as the distribution fees we receive from other companies. These factors, in turn, are largely determined by overall investment market performance and the depth and breadth of our individual client relationships. 

Financial markets and macroeconomic conditions have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our operating and performance results. In addition, the business, political and regulatory environments in which we operate are subject to elevated uncertainty and substantial, frequent change, particularly given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, we expect to continue focusing on our key strategic objectives and obtaining operational and strategic leverage from our core capabilities. The success of these and other strategies may be affected by the factors discussed in Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in our 2019 10-K and other factors as discussed herein. 

Equity price, credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the value of deferred acquisition costs (&#8220;DAC&#8221;) and deferred sales inducement costs (&#8220;DSIC&#8221;) assets, the values of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits and the &#8220;spread&#8221; income generated on our fixed deferred annuities, fixed insurance, the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts and deposit products. 

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

Earnings, as well as adjusted operating earnings after tax, will be negatively impacted by the ongoing low interest rate environment should it continue. In addition to continuing spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines, a sustained low interest rate environment may result in increases to our reserves and changes in various rate assumptions we use to amortize DAC and DSIC, which may negatively impact our adjusted operating earnings after tax. For additional discussion on our interest rate risk, see Item 3. &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.&#8221; 

In the third quarter, we updated our market-related assumptions and implemented model changes related to our living benefit valuation. In addition, we conducted our annual review of life insurance and annuity valuation assumptions relative to current experience and management expectations including modeling changes. These aforementioned changes are collectively referred to as unlocking. We also reviewed our active life future policy benefit reserve adequacy for our long term care (&#8220;LTC&#8221;) business in the third quarter. See our Consolidated and Segment Results of Operations sections for the pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking and LTC loss recognition. 

During the third quarter of 2020, as we continue to reposition the business and implement strategies focusing on product features and sales, the composition of our reportable segments changed from five to four segments. The Chief Operating Decision Maker (&#8220;CODM&#8221;) now manages the Annuities and Protection business as one operating segment, referred to as Retirement &#38; Protection Solutions. The Retirement &#38; Protection Solutions segment will include Retirement Solutions (Variable Annuities and Payout Annuities) and Protection Solutions (Life and Disability Insurance). In addition, we moved the Fixed Annuities and Fixed Indexed Annuities business to the Corporate &#38; Other segment as a closed block. These segment reporting changes align with the way our CODM began assessing the performance of our reportable segments and other business activities effective in the third quarter of 2020. Certain prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current presentation. These changes have no impact on previously reported consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, or cash flows. 

On October 1, 2019, we completed the sale of our Ameriprise Auto &#38; Home Insurance business (&#8220;AAH&#8221;) to American Family Insurance Mutual Holding Company (American Family Insurance). This sale is consistent with our focus on our core growth areas of Advice &#38; Wealth Management and Asset Management. 

We consolidate certain variable interest entities for which we provide asset management services. These entities are defined as consolidated investment entities (&#8220;CIEs&#8221;). While the consolidation of the CIEs impacts our balance sheet and income statement, our exposure to these entities is unchanged and there is no impact to the underlying business results. For further information on CIEs, see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The results of operations of the CIEs are reflected in the Corporate &#38; Other segment. On a consolidated basis, the management fees we earn for the services we provide to the CIEs and the related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities related to the CIEs, primarily syndicated loans and debt, are reflected in net investment income. We include the fees from these entities in the management and financial advice fees line within our Asset Management segment. 

While our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;), management believes that adjusted operating measures, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, net of the related DSIC and DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization; the market impact on indexed universal life (&#8220;IUL&#8221;) benefits, net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; the market impact on fixed index annuity benefits, net of hedges and the related DAC amortization; mean reversion related impacts (the impact on variable annuity and variable universal life (&#8220;VUL&#8221;) products for the difference between assumed and updated separate account investment performance on DAC, DSIC, unearned revenue amortization, reinsurance accrual and additional insurance benefit reserves); the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments; gain or loss on disposal of a business that is not considered discontinued operations; integration and restructuring charges; income (loss) from discontinued operations; and the impact of consolidating CIEs, best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters. Throughout our Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis, these non-GAAP measures are referred to as adjusted operating measures. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures. 

It is management&#8217;s priority to increase shareholder value over a multi-year horizon by achieving our on-average, over-time financial targets. 

Our financial targets are: 

&#8226; Adjusted operating earnings per diluted share growth of 12% to 15%, and 

&#8226; Adjusted operating return on equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) of over 30%.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The accounting and reporting policies that we use affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and, in some cases, the application of these policies can be significantly affected by the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis &#8212; Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; in our 2019 10-K. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

For information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Assets Under Management and Administration 

Assets under management (&#8220;AUM&#8221;) include external client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the Columbia Threadneedle Investments funds, institutional clients and clients in our advisor platform held in wrap accounts as well as assets managed by sub-advisors selected by us. AUM also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we provide investment management services and recognize management fees in our Asset Management segment, such as the assets of the general account and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries and CIEs. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide advisory services such as model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority. 

Assets under administration (&#8220;AUA&#8221;) include assets for which we provide administrative services such as client assets invested in other companies&#8217; products that we offer outside of our wrap accounts. These assets include those held in clients&#8217; brokerage accounts. We generally record revenues received from administered assets as distribution fees. We do not exercise management discretion over these assets and do not earn a management fee. These assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. AUA also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we do not provide investment management services and do not recognize management fees, such as investments in non-affiliated funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries.

Overall 

Pretax loss was $184 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to pretax income of $641 million for the prior year period. The following impacts were significant drivers of the period-over-period change in pretax income: 

&#8226; The unfavorable impact of unlocking and LTC loss recognition was $454 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $16 million for the prior year period. 

&#8226; The market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) was an expense of $427 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to an expense of $2 million for the prior year period. 

&#8226; A negative impact of $116 million in the Advice &#38; Wealth Management segment from lower short-term interest rates. 

&#8226; The market impact on IUL benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual) was an expense of $4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to a benefit of $48 million for the prior year period. 

&#8226; The mean reversion related impact was a benefit of $17 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to an expense of $36 million for the prior year period. 

&#8226; A favorable impact from higher average equity markets for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the prior year period. 

The following table presents the total pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking and LTC loss recognition for the three months ended September 30:

(1) Includes a $12 million net expense and $4 million net benefit related to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which is excluded from adjusted operating earnings. Refer to Results of Operations by Segment for the impact to pretax adjusted operating earnings attributable to unlocking and LTC loss recognition. 

The primary drivers of the unfavorable unlocking impact excluding LTC in the third quarter of 2020 were consistent with the prior year period and include the following items: 

&#8226; Updates to our interest rate assumptions resulted in a higher expense in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the prior year period. 

&#8226; Lower surrenders assumptions on variable annuities with living benefit guarantees resulted in a higher expense in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the prior year period. 

&#8226; Changes in equity market volatility and correlation assumptions on variable annuities resulted in a lower benefit in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the prior year period. 

The primary drivers of the unfavorable LTC unlocking and loss recognition in the third quarter of 2020 were consistent to the prior year period and include the following items: 

&#8226; Updates to our interest rates assumptions resulted in a higher expense in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the prior year period. 

&#8226; Assumptions regarding morbidity, mortality and persistency were more in line with experience and resulted in a lower expense in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the prior year period. 

&#8226; Approved and expected premium rate increases and benefit reductions resulted in a lower benefit in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the prior year period. 

The total unfavorable impact of updates to our interest rate assumptions noted above for unlocking and LTC loss recognition was $405 million. The non-cash unfavorable impact was primarily driven by the reduction of our 10-year Treasury rate assumption from 5% to 3.5% due to recent interest rate trends and extending the grading period from three years to 6.5 years with no grading in 2020. 

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

Net Revenues 

Net revenues decreased $314 million, or 9%, to $3.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $3.3 billion for the prior year period. 

Management and financial advice fees increased $99 million, or 6%, to $1.9 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $1.8 billion for the prior year period reflecting higher average equity markets and higher wrap account net inflows partially offset by lower performance fees. 

Distribution fees decreased $80 million, or 17%, to $400 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $480 million for the prior year period due to $90 million of lower fees on off-balance sheet brokerage cash primarily due to a decrease in short-term interest rates, variable annuity net outflows and lower transactional activity partially offset by higher average equity markets. 

Net investment income decreased $56 million, or 16%, to $300 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $356 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: 

&#8226; The unfavorable impact of lower short-term interest rates on certificates and on-balance sheet brokerage cash, and lower certificate balances due to lower average invested assets. 

&#8226; Net realized investment gains of $4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to net realized investment losses of $10 million for the prior year period. 

&#8226; The favorable impact of higher invested assets related to the bank. 

&#8226; Lower impairments of our investments in affordable housing partnerships. 

Premiums decreased $294 million, or 79% to $80 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $374 million for the prior year primarily reflecting the sale of AAH and lower sales of immediate annuities with a life contingent feature. Premiums in the prior year period included $281 million from AAH. 

Other revenues decreased $7 million, or 2%, to $340 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $347 million primarily due to a $1 million unfavorable impact from unlocking for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to a $5 million favorable impact in the prior year period. 

Banking and deposit interest expense decreased $24 million, or 71%, to $10 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $34 million due to lower average crediting rates on certificates and lower average certificate balances. 

Expenses 

Total expenses increased $511 million, or 19%, to $3.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $2.7 billion for the prior year period. 

Distribution expenses increased $57 million, or 6%, to $1.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $971 million for the prior year period reflecting higher average markets and higher advisor compensation due to an increase in average wrap account balances. 

Interest credited to fixed accounts increased $43 million, or 34%, to $170 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $127 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: 

&#8226; A $13 million increase in expense from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on IUL benefits. The unfavorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $18 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to an unfavorable impact of $5 million for the prior year period. 

&#8226; A $31 million increase in expense from other market impacts on IUL benefits, net of hedges, which was a benefit of $14 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to a benefit of $45 million for the prior year period. The increase in expense was primarily due to a an increase in the IUL embedded derivative, which is reflecting higher option costs. 

Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $510 million, or 86% to $1.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $594 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: 

&#8226; A $214 million increase in expense from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. The unfavorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $103 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to a favorable impact of $111 million for the prior year period. As the estimate of the nonperformance credit spread over the LIBOR swap curve tightens or widens, the embedded derivative liability will increase or decrease. As the embedded derivative liability on which the nonperformance credit spread is applied increases (decreases), the impact of the nonperformance credit spread is favorable (unfavorable) to expense. 

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

&#8226; A $288 million increase in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks and the related DSIC amortization. This increase was the result of an unfavorable $1.5 billion change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits, partially offset by a favorable $1.3 billion change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits reserves. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below: 

&#8226; Equity market impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in an expense for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to a benefit for the prior year period. 

&#8226; Interest rate impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a lower expense for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the prior year period. 

&#8226; Volatility impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a higher benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the prior year period. 

&#8226; Other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a net unfavorable impact compared to the prior year period. 

&#8226; The impact of unlocking excluding LTC was an expense of $212 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to a benefit of $1 million for the prior year period. The unlocking impact for the third quarter of 2020 primarily reflected a higher unfavorable impact from updates to our interest rate assumptions and lower surrenders on variable annuities with living benefit guarantees partially offset by a lower benefit from changes in equity market volatility and correlation assumptions on variable annuities compared to the prior year period. 

&#8226; Our annual review of LTC active life future policy benefit reserve adequacy in the third quarter of 2020 resulted in unlocking and loss recognition of $141 million compared to $8 million in the prior year period. The unlocking and loss recognition in the third quarter of 2020 was primarily due to a higher unfavorable impact from updates to our interest rates assumptions, a lower unfavorable impact from lesser changes to assumptions regarding morbidity, mortality and persistency and a lower benefit from approved and expected premium rate increases and benefit reductions compared to the prior year period. 

&#8226; A $259 million decrease in auto and home expenses reflecting the sale of AAH. 

&#8226; The mean reversion related impact was a benefit of $8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to an expense of $25 million for the prior year period. 

&#8226; A $12 million decrease in reserves for immediate annuities with a life contingent feature primarily due to lower sales. This impact is offset by a decrease in premiums. 

Amortization of DAC decreased $27 million, or 24% to $85 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to an expense of $112 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: 

&#8226; The DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits was a benefit of $64 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to an expense of $8 million for the prior year period. 

&#8226; The mean reversion related impact was a benefit of $9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to an expense of $11 million for the prior year period. 

&#8226; A $14 million decrease in auto and home expenses reflecting the sale of AAH. 

&#8226; The impact of unlocking in the third quarter of 2020 was an expense of $100 million compared to an expense of $14 million in the prior year period. The unlocking impact for the third quarter of 2020 primarily reflected a higher unfavorable impact from updates to our interest rate assumptions and lower surrenders on variable annuities with living benefit guarantees compared to the prior year period. 

&#8226; The DAC offset to the market impact on IUL benefits, net of hedges was an expense of $1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $9 million for the prior year period. 

Interest and debt expense decreased $15 million, or 29%, to $37 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $52 million for the prior year period primarily due to a decrease in interest expense of CIEs. 

General and administrative expense decreased $57 million, or 7%, to $763 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $820 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting a $29 million decrease in auto and home expenses reflecting the sale of AAH, disciplined expense management and reengineering. 

Income Taxes 

Our effective tax rate was 23.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to 15.4% for the prior year period. The higher effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the prior year period is primarily the result of pretax loss. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on income taxes.

Banking and deposit interest expense decreased $25 million, or 71%, to $10 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $35 million for the prior year period primarily due to lower average crediting rates on certificates and lower average certificate balances.

The performance of each fund is measured on a consistent basis against the most appropriate benchmark &#8211; a peer group of similar funds or an index. Prior period rankings have been adjusted to reflect foreign exchange forward and spot contract transactions executed by those funds, and also to include cash items, primarily fee rebates, that were previously excluded from the gross performance calculations. 

Equal weighted: Counts the number of funds with above median ranking (if measured against peer group) or above index performance (if measured against an index) divided by the total number of funds. Asset size is not a factor. 

Asset weighted: Sums the assets of the funds with above median ranking (if measured against peer group) or above index performance (if measured against an index) divided by the total sum of assets in the funds. Funds with more assets will receive a greater share of the total percentage above or below median or index. 

Aggregated Allocation (Managed) Funds include funds that invest in other funds of the Threadneedle range including those funds that invest in both equity and fixed income. 

Aggregated Threadneedle data includes funds on the Threadneedle platform sub-advised by Columbia Management as well as advisors not affiliated with Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

The United Kingdom (&#8220;UK&#8221;) withdrew from the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) on January 31, 2020, pursuant to a transitionary withdrawal agreement with the EU that in substance maintains the pre-withdrawal, status quo until the end of 2020. The full impact of the British exit from the EU (commonly known as &#8220;Brexit&#8221;) and its related consequences remain uncertain, including with respect to the UK reaching agreement with the EU on cross border financial services (which appears to be increasingly unlikely) as well as new trade agreements with the EU and other global trading partners. This uncertainty may have a negative impact on our UK and European net flows (as well as foreign currency translation if the British Pound weakens) and depending on the outcome of negotiations, may increase costs to provide our services. 

Total segment AUM increased $21.9 billion, or 5%, during the three months ended September 30, 2020. Net outflows were $1.6 billion in the third quarter of 2020, a $0.3 billion decrease compared to the prior year period. Global retail inflows were $2.0 billion. Global institutional net outflows were $3.6 billion and included a $3.5 billion quant mandate redemption from a sovereign wealth client primarily related to an asset allocation change, a $0.9 billion net redemption from an insurance client following the sale of a business and $0.9 billion of outflows from former parent-related assets.

Our Asset Management segment pretax adjusted operating earnings, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, increased $25 million, or 14%, to $198 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $173 million for the prior year period primarily due to market appreciation and disciplined expense management. 

Net Revenues 

Net revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $3 million to $739 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $742 million for the prior year period. 

Management and financial advice fees increased $5 million, or 1%, to $641 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $636 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher average equity markets, partially offset by a $33 million decrease in performance fees. 

Net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $8 million to a loss of $6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to income of $2 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting an impairment of an investment and lower interest income.

Total expenses decreased $28 million, or 5%, to $541 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $569 million for the prior year period. 

General and administrative expense decreased $28 million, or 9%, to $297 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $325 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting disciplined expense management and reengineering.

RiverSource variable annuity account balances increased 3% to $79.8 billion as of September 30, 2020 compared to the prior year period due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of $2.4 billion. Variable annuity sales increased 2% compared to the prior year period reflecting a decrease in sales of variable annuities with living benefit guarantees that was more than offset by sales of structured variable annuities launched earlier in 2020. This trend is expected to continue and meaningfully shift the mix of business away from products with living benefit guarantees over time. 

Net Revenues 

Management and financial advice fees increased $4 million, or 2%, to $213 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $209 million for the prior year period primarily due to market appreciation, partially offset by variable annuity net outflows. 

Net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $7 million, or 5% to $121 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $128 million reflecting lower fixed maturity investment yields. 

Premiums decreased $15 million, or 20%, to $61 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $76 million for the prior year period reflecting lower sales of immediate annuities with a life contingent feature. 

Other revenues, which exclude the unearned revenue amortization and reinsurance accrual offset to net realized investment gains or losses and the market impact on IUL benefits, increased $12 million, or 5%, to $275 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $263 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting an increase in insurance charges related to favorable persistency and higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates, partially offset by the impact of unlocking. 

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

Expenses 

Distribution expenses decreased $12 million, or 10% to $110 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $122 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting a decrease in net outflows due to lower insurance sales and annuity product mix. 

Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization) and mean reversion related impacts, increased $170 million, or 68%, to $421 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $251 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the impact of unlocking partially offset by lower sales of immediate annuities with a life contingent feature. The unlocking impact for the third quarter of 2020 was an expense of $189 million compared to an expense of $6 million for the prior year period and primarily reflected a higher unfavorable impact from updates to our interest rate assumptions and lower surrenders on variable annuities with living benefit guarantees, partially offset by a lower benefit from changes in equity market volatility and correlation assumptions on variable annuities with living benefit guarantees compared to the prior year period. 

Amortization of DAC, which excludes mean reversion related impacts and the DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, increased $89 million to $157 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $68 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the impact of unlocking. The impact of unlocking for the third quarter of 2020 was an expense of $108 million compared to an expense of $15 million in the prior year period.

Our Corporate &#38; Other segment pretax adjusted operating loss decreased $123 million to $202 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $79 million for the prior year period. 

Our Corporate &#38; Other segment includes our closed blocks of long term care (&#8220;LTC&#8221;) insurance and fixed annuity and fixed indexed annuity (&#8220;FA&#8221;) business. 

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

LTC insurance had a pretax adjusted operating loss of $135 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to a pretax adjusted operating loss of $8 million for the prior year period reflecting the impact from unlocking and loss recognition. Our annual review of LTC active life future policy benefit reserve adequacy resulted in unlocking and loss recognition of $141 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $8 million in the prior year period. The unlocking and loss recognition in the third quarter of 2020 was primarily due a higher unfavorable impact from updates to our interest rates assumptions, a lower unfavorable impact from lesser changes to assumptions regarding morbidity, mortality and persistency and a lower benefit from approved and expected premium rate increases and benefit reductions compared to the prior year period. 

FA business had a pretax adjusted operating loss of $9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to a pretax adjusted operating earnings of $12 million for the prior year period reflecting the low interest rate impact on spread and the impacts from unlocking. The unlocking impact for the third quarter of 2020 was an expense of $3 million compared to a benefit of $4 million for the prior year period. 

RiverSource fixed deferred annuity account balances declined 4% to $8.0 billion as of September 30, 2020 compared to the prior year period as policies continue to lapse and the discontinuance of new sales of fixed deferred annuities and fixed index annuities due to the low interest rate environment as well as our strategic decisions regarding our fixed annuity business. 

Auto and home pretax adjusted operating loss was $10 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019. We sold AAH on October 1, 2019. 

Net Revenues 

Net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments, integration and restructuring charges, and the impact of consolidating CIEs, decreased $25 million, or 21%, to $93 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $118 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the sale of AAH and lower average invested assets due to fixed annuity net outflows and lower asset earned rates, partially offset by lower impairments of our investments in affordable housing partnerships. 

Premiums decreased $280 million, or 92%, to $26 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $306 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the sale of AAH.

See our Consolidated Results of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 for a table and discussion of total pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking and LTC loss recognition. 

Net Revenues 

Net revenues decreased $964 million, or 10%, to $8.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $9.7 billion for the prior year period. 

Management and financial advice fees increased $212 million, or 4%, to $5.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $5.2 billion for the prior year period reflecting higher average equity markets and higher wrap account net inflows, partially offset by lower performance fees. 

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

Distribution fees decreased $211 million, or 15%, to $1.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $1.5 billion due to $248 million of lower fees on off-balance sheet brokerage cash due to a decrease in short-term interest rates, partially offset by higher average equity markets. 

Net investment income decreased $188 million, or 17%, to $933 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $1.1 billion for the prior year period primarily reflecting: 

&#8226; Net realized investment losses of $18 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to net realized investment losses of $6 million for the prior year period. 

&#8226; The unfavorable impact of fixed annuity net outflows and the fixed annuities reinsurance transaction. 

&#8226; The unfavorable impact of lower short-term interest rates on certificates and on-balance sheet brokerage cash, and lower certificate balances due to lower average invested assets. 

&#8226; The unfavorable market impact of hedges on investments of $37 million in the prior year period. 

&#8226; A decrease of $16 million in net investment income of CIEs. 

&#8226; A decrease of $40 million due to the sale of AAH. 

&#8226; The favorable impact of higher average invested assets related to the bank. 

Premiums decreased $872 million, or 78% to $249 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $1.1 billion due to the sale of AAH and lower sales of immediate annuities with a life contingent feature. Premiums in the prior year period included $828 million from AAH. 

Other revenues increased $42 million, or 4%, to $983 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $941 million due to higher fees on variable annuity riders, higher cost of insurance charges on universal life (&#8220;UL&#8221;) and VUL insurance, partially offset by the impact of unlocking. 

Banking and deposit interest expense decreased $53 million, or 50%, to $53 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $106 million due to lower average crediting rates on certificates and lower average certificate balances. 

Expenses 

Total expenses decreased $907 million, or 11%, to $7.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $8.0 billion for the prior year period. 

Distribution expenses increased $144 million, or 5%, to $3.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $2.8 billion for the prior year period reflecting higher average markets and higher advisor compensation due to an increase in average wrap account balances. 

Interest credited to fixed accounts increased $6 million, or 1%, to $523 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $517 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: 

&#8226; A $70 million decrease in expense from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on IUL benefits. The favorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $23 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to an unfavorable impact of $47 million for the prior year period. 

&#8226; A $74 million increase in expense from other market impacts on IUL benefits, net of hedges, which was an expense of $53 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to a benefit of $21 million for the prior year period. The increase in expense was primarily due to an increase in the IUL embedded derivative, which is reflecting higher option costs. 

Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses decreased $1.0 billion, or 55%, to $824 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to an expense of $1.8 billion for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: 

&#8226; A $521 million decrease in expense from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. The favorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $530 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to a favorable impact of $9 million for the prior year period. As the estimate of the nonperformance credit spread over the LIBOR swap curve tightens or widens, the embedded derivative liability will increase or decrease. As the embedded derivative liability on which the nonperformance credit spread is applied increases (decreases), the impact of the nonperformance credit spread is favorable (unfavorable) to expense. 

&#8226; An $80 million decrease in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks and the related DSIC amortization. This decrease was the result of a favorable $1.5 billion change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits, partially offset by an unfavorable $1.5 billion change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits reserves. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below: 

&#8226; Equity market impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a lower benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the prior year period. 

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

&#8226; Interest rate impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in an expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to a benefit in the prior year period. 

&#8226; Volatility impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a higher benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the prior year period. 

&#8226; Other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a net unfavorable impact compared to the prior year period. 

&#8226; The impact of unlocking excluding LTC was an expense of $212 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to a benefit of $1 million for the prior year period. The unlocking impact for the third quarter of 2020 primarily reflected a higher unfavorable impact from updates to our interest rate assumptions and lower surrenders on variable annuities with living benefit guarantees partially offset by a lower benefit from changes in equity market volatility and correlation assumptions on variable annuities compared to the prior year period. 

&#8226; Our annual review of LTC active life future policy benefit reserve adequacy in the third quarter of 2020 resulted in unlocking and loss recognition of $141 million compared to $8 million in the prior year period. The unlocking and loss recognition in the third quarter of 2020 was primarily due to a higher unfavorable impact from updates to our interest rates assumptions, a lower unfavorable impact from lesser changes to assumptions regarding morbidity, mortality and persistency and a lower benefit from approved and expected premium rate increases and benefit reductions compared to the prior year period. 

&#8226; A $719 million decrease in auto and home expenses reflecting the sale of AAH. 

&#8226; The mean reversion related impact was an expense of $21 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to a benefit of $2 million for the prior year period. 

&#8226; A $27 million decrease in reserves for immediate annuities with a life contingent feature primarily due to lower sales. This impact is offset by a decrease in premiums.

&#8226; The impact of unlocking in the third quarter of 2020 was an expense of $100 million compared to an expense of $14 million in the prior year period. The unlocking impact for the third quarter of 2020 primarily reflected a higher unfavorable impact from updates to our interest rate assumptions and lower surrenders on variable annuities with living benefit guarantees compared to the prior year period. 

&#8226; The DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits was an expense of $94 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to a benefit of $24 million for the prior year period. 

&#8226; The mean reversion related impact was an expense of $9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to a benefit of $16 million for the prior year period. 

&#8226; A $43 million decrease in auto and home expenses reflecting the sale of AAH. 

Interest and debt expense decreased $40 million, or 24%, to $124 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $164 million for the prior year period primarily due to a decrease in interest expense of CIEs. 

General and administrative expense decreased $156 million, or 6%, to $2.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $2.4 billion for the prior year period primarily reflecting a $90 million decrease in auto and home expenses reflecting the sale of AAH, lower performance fee compensation, disciplined expense management and reengineering.

Net Revenues 

Net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $19 million, or 5%, to $380 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $399 million for the prior year period reflecting lower fixed maturity investment yields. 

Premiums decreased $46 million, or 19%, to $196 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $242 million for the prior year period primarily due to lower sales of immediate annuities with a life contingent feature. 

Other revenues, which exclude the unearned revenue amortization and reinsurance accrual offset to net realized investment gains or losses and the market impact on IUL benefits, increased $30 million, or 4%, to $785 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $755 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting an increase in insurance charges related to favorable persistency and higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates, partially offset by the impact of unlocking. 

Expenses 

Distribution expenses decreased $19 million, or 5% to $331 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $350 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting a decrease in net outflows due to lower insurance sales and annuity product mix. 

Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization) and mean reversion related impacts, increased $143 million, or 19%, to $878 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $735 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the impact of unlocking partially offset by lower sales of immediate annuities with a life contingent feature. The unlocking impact for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was an expense of $189 million compared to an expense of $6 million for the prior year period and primarily reflected a higher unfavorable impact from updates to our interest rate assumptions and lower surrenders on variable

Amortization of DAC, which excludes mean reversion related impacts and the DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, increased $68 million, or 39%, to $241 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $173 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the impact of unlocking, partially offset by a lower DAC amortization rate which is the result of lower surrenders on variable annuities. The impact of unlocking for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was an expense of $108 million compared to an expense of $15 million in the prior year period. The unlocking impact for the third quarter of 2020 primarily reflected a higher unfavorable impact from updates to our interest rate assumptions and lower surrenders on variable annuities with living benefit guarantees compared to the prior year period.

Our Corporate &#38; Other segment pretax adjusted operating loss increased $122 million, or 65%, to $309 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $187 million for the prior year period. 

LTC insurance had a pretax adjusted operating loss of $116 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to a pretax adjusted operating earnings of $2 million for the prior year period reflecting the impact from unlocking and loss recognition, partially offset by the impacts from COVID-19, with fewer clients entering nursing homes as well as increased mortality-related terminations from clients on claim. 

FA business had a pretax adjusted operating loss of $6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to a pretax adjusted operating earnings of $28 million for the prior year period reflecting fixed annuity net outflows, the impact of low interest rates and the impacts from unlocking. 

Auto and home pretax adjusted operating earnings were $13 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. We sold AAH on October 1, 2019.

General and administrative expense, which excludes integration and restructuring charges, decreased $134 million, or 44%, to $172 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $306 million for the prior year period primarily due to the sale of AAH and lower project expenses. 

Market Risk 

Our primary market risk exposures are interest rate, equity price, foreign currency exchange rate and credit risk. Equity price and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the spread income generated on our fixed deferred annuities, fixed insurance, brokerage client cash balances, banking deposits, face-amount certificate products and the fixed portion of our variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of DAC and DSIC assets, the value of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the value of derivatives held to hedge these benefits. 

Our earnings from fixed deferred annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts are based upon the spread between rates earned on assets held and the rates at which interest is credited to accounts. We primarily invest in fixed rate securities to fund the rate credited to clients. We guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products. Investment assets and client liabilities generally differ as it relates to basis, repricing or maturity characteristics. Rates credited to clients&#8217; accounts generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on the underlying investments. Therefore, in an increasing interest rate environment, higher interest rates may be reflected in crediting rates to clients sooner than in rates earned on invested assets, which could result in a reduced spread between the two rates, reduced earned income and a negative impact on pretax income. However, the current low interest rate environment is resulting in interest rates below the level of some of our liability guaranteed minimum interest rates (&#8220;GMIRs&#8221;). Hence, a modest rise in interest rates would not necessarily result in changes to all the liability credited rates while projected asset purchases would capture the full increase in interest rates. This dynamic would result in widening spreads under a modestly rising rate scenario given the current relationship between the current level of interest rates and the underlying GMIRs on the business. 

As a result of the low interest rate environment, our current reinvestment yields are generally lower than the current portfolio yield. We expect our portfolio income yields to continue to decline in future periods if interest rates remain low. The carrying value and weighted average yield of non-structured fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans that may generate proceeds to reinvest through September 30, 2021 due to prepayment, maturity or call activity at the option of the issuer, excluding securities with a make-whole provision, were $4.6 billion and 2.3%, respectively, as of September 30, 2020. In addition, residential mortgage backed securities, which are subject to prepayment risk as a result of the low interest rate environment, totaled $10.3 billion and had a weighted average yield of 1.7% as of September 30, 2020. While these amounts represent investments that could be subject to reinvestment risk, it is also possible that these investments will be used to fund liabilities or may not be prepaid and will remain invested at their current yields. In addition to the interest rate environment, the mix of benefit payments versus product sales as well as the timing and volumes associated with such mix may impact our investment yield. Furthermore, reinvestment activities and the associated investment yield may also be impacted by corporate strategies implemented at management&#8217;s discretion. The average yield for investment purchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was approximately 1.7%. 

The reinvestment of proceeds from maturities, calls and prepayments at rates below the current portfolio yield, which may be below the level of some liability GMIRs, will have a negative impact to future operating results. To mitigate the unfavorable impact that the low interest rate environment has on our spread income, we assess reinvestment risk in our investment portfolio and monitor this risk 

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

in accordance with our asset/liability management framework. In addition, we may reduce the crediting rates on our fixed products when warranted, subject to guaranteed minimums. 

In addition to the fixed rate exposures noted above, RiverSource Life has the following variable annuity guarantee benefits: guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (&#8220;GMWB&#8221;), guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (&#8220;GMAB&#8221;), guaranteed minimum death benefits (&#8220;GMDB&#8221;) and guaranteed minimum income benefits (&#8220;GMIB&#8221;). Each of these benefits guarantees payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the underlying invested assets. 

The variable annuity guarantees continue to be managed by utilizing a hedging program which attempts to match the sensitivity of the assets with the sensitivity of the liabilities. This approach works with the premise that matched sensitivities will produce a highly effective hedging result. Our comprehensive hedging program focuses mainly on first order sensitivities of assets and liabilities: Equity Market Level (Delta), Interest Rate Level (Rho) and Volatility (Vega). Additionally, various second order sensitivities are managed. We use various options, swaptions, swaps and futures to manage risk exposures. The exposures are measured and monitored daily, and adjustments to the hedge portfolio are made as necessary. 

We have a macro hedge program to provide protection against the statutory tail scenario risk arising from variable annuity reserves on our statutory surplus and to cover some of the residual risks not covered by other hedging activities. We assess the residual risk under a range of scenarios in creating and executing the macro hedge program. As a means of economically hedging these risks, we may use a combination of futures, options, swaps and swaptions. Certain of the macro hedge derivatives used contain settlement provisions linked to both equity returns and interest rates; the remaining are interest rate contracts or equity contracts. The macro hedge program could result in additional earnings volatility as changes in the value of the macro hedge derivatives, which are designed to reduce statutory capital volatility, may not be closely aligned to changes in the variable annuity guarantee embedded derivatives. 

To evaluate interest rate and equity price risk we perform sensitivity testing which measures the impact on pretax income from the sources listed below for a 12-month period following a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a hypothetical 10% decline in equity prices. The interest rate risk test assumes a sudden 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, with rates then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. The equity price risk test assumes a sudden 10% drop in equity prices, with equity prices then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. In estimating the values of variable annuities, fixed deferred indexed annuities, stock market certificates, IUL insurance and the associated hedge assets, we assume no change in implied market volatility despite the 10% drop in equity prices. 

The following tables present our estimate of the impact on pretax income from the above defined hypothetical market movements as of September 30, 2020:

(5) The market impact of the macro hedge program is modeled net of any related impact to DAC and DSIC amortization. 

(6) Represents the net impact to pretax income. The estimated net impact to pretax adjusted operating income is approximately $(266) million. 

The above results compare to an estimated negative net impact to pretax income of $90 million related to a 10% equity price decline and an estimated positive net impact to pretax income of $37 million related to a 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2019. The change in interest rate exposure as of September 30, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 was driven by variable annuity riders, specifically GMWB, primarily due to changes in market rates. 

Net impacts shown in the above table from GMWB riders result largely from differences between the liability valuation basis and the hedging basis. Liabilities are valued using fair value accounting principles, with risk margins incorporated in contractholder behavior assumptions and with discount rates increased to reflect a current market estimate of our risk of nonperformance specific to these liabilities. Our hedging is based on our determination of economic risk, which excludes certain items in the liability valuation including the nonperformance spread risk. 

Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above as they are based on a number of estimates and assumptions. These include assuming that implied market volatility does not change when equity prices fall by 10% and that the 100 basis point increase in interest rates is a parallel shift of the yield curve. Furthermore, we have not tried to anticipate changes in client preferences for different types of assets or other changes in client behavior, nor have we tried to anticipate all strategic actions management might take to increase revenues or reduce expenses in these scenarios. 

The selection of a 100 basis point interest rate increase as well as a 10% equity price decline should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Impacts of larger or smaller changes in interest rates or equity prices may not be proportional to those shown for a 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a 10% decline in equity prices. 

Fair Value Measurements 

We report certain assets and liabilities at fair value; specifically, separate account assets, derivatives, embedded derivatives and most investments and cash equivalents. Fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale. We include actual market prices, or observable inputs, in our fair value measurements to the extent available. Broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available. We validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as: price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price 

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 

comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our fair value measurements. 

Fair Value of Liabilities and Nonperformance Risk 

Companies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant (an exit price). Since there is not a market for our obligations of our variable annuity riders, indexed annuities and IUL insurance, we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price. As a result, we adjust the valuation of variable annuity riders, indexed annuities and IUL insurance by updating certain contractholder assumptions, adding explicit margins to provide for profit, risk and expenses, and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of our nonperformance risk. The nonperformance risk adjustment is based on observable market data adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities. Consistent with general market conditions, this estimate resulted in a spread over the LIBOR swap curve as of September 30, 2020. As our estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase. If this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the LIBOR swap curve, the reduction to future net income would be approximately $731 million, net of DAC, DSIC, unearned revenue amortization, the reinsurance accrual and income taxes (calculated at the statutory tax rate of 21%), based on September 30, 2020 credit spreads. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Overview 

We maintained substantial liquidity during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had $7.4 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents excluding CIEs and other restricted cash on a consolidated basis. 

At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the parent company had $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, in cash, cash equivalents, and unencumbered liquid securities. Liquid securities predominantly include U.S. government agency mortgage back securities. Additional sources of liquidity include a line of credit with an affiliate up to $867 million and an unsecured revolving committed credit facility for up to $750 million that expires in October 2022. Management&#8217;s estimate of liquidity available to the parent company in a volatile and uncertain economic environment as of September 30, 2020 was $ 2.8 billion which includes cash, cash equivalents, unencumbered liquid securities, the line of credit with an affiliate and a portion of the committed credit facility. 

Under the terms of the committed credit facility, we can increase the availability to $1.0 billion upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements. Available borrowings under this facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. At September 30, 2020, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and had $1 million of outstanding letters of credit. Our credit facility contains various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. Compliance with these covenants is not currently impaired by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we remain in compliance with all such covenants at September 30, 2020. 

On April 2, 2020, we issued $500 million of 3.0% unsecured senior notes due 2025 and incurred debt issuance costs of $4 million. The net proceeds from the sale of the notes will be used for general corporate purposes. 

In addition, we have access to collateralized borrowings, which may include repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) advances. Our subsidiaries, RiverSource Life Insurance Company (&#8220;RiverSource Life&#8221;), and Ameriprise Bank, FSB are members of the FHLB of Des Moines, which provides access to collateralized borrowings. We had $200 million and $201 million of borrowings from the FHLB, which is collateralized with commercial mortgage backed securities and residential mortgage backed securities, as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. We believe cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances and our availability of revolver borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs and stress requirements. 

On November 3, 2020, S&#38;P Global lowered our issuer credit and senior unsecured debt rating from A with a negative outlook to A-with a stable outlook due to gradual expansion in our non-insurance businesses driving a S&#38;P ratings methodology change. We do not believe this rating change will have a material impact on our access to or cost of capital or otherwise materially impact our liquidity. 

We continue to monitor and respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Our risk management strategy is designed to provide proactive protection during stress events such as the current pandemic. We believe our process is working as intended, and our liquidity and capital resources have remained a source of balance sheet strength during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. 

Dividends from Subsidiaries 

Ameriprise Financial is primarily a parent holding company for the operations carried out by our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Because of our holding company structure, our ability to meet our cash requirements, including the payment of dividends on our common stock, substantially depends upon the receipt of dividends or return of capital from our subsidiaries, particularly our life insurance subsidiary, RiverSource Life, our face-amount certificate subsidiary, Ameriprise Certificate Company (&#8220;ACC&#8221;), AMPF Holding Corporation, which is the parent company of our retail introducing broker-dealer subsidiary, Ameriprise Financial Services, LLC (&#8220;AFS&#8221;) and our clearing broker-dealer subsidiary, American Enterprise Investment Services, Inc.

(7) Regulatory capital requirement is based on minimum requirements for well capitalized banks in accordance with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;). 

In addition to the particular regulations restricting dividend payments and establishing subsidiary capitalization requirements, we take into account the overall health of the business, capital levels and risk management considerations in determining a strategy for payments to our parent holding company from our subsidiaries, and in deciding to use cash to make capital contributions to our subsidiaries. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $1.5 billion (including $650 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $284 million (including $210 million to Ameriprise Bank, FSB). During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $1.9 billion (including $850 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $233 million (including $180 million to Ameriprise Bank, FSB). 

In 2009, RiverSource established an agreement to protect its exposure to Genworth Life Insurance Company (&#8220;GLIC&#8221;) for its reinsured LTC. In 2016, substantial enhancements to this reinsurance protection agreement were finalized. The terms of these confidential provisions within the agreement have been shared, in the normal course of regular reviews, with our domiciliary regulator and rating agencies. GLIC is domiciled in Delaware so in the event GLIC were subjected to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings, such proceedings would be located in (and governed by) Delaware laws. Delaware courts have a long tradition of respecting commercial and reinsurance affairs as well as contracts among sophisticated parties. Similar credit protections to what we have with GLIC have been tested and respected in Delaware and elsewhere in the United States, and as a result we believe our credit protections would be respected even in the unlikely event that GLIC becomes subject to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings in Delaware. Accordingly, while no credit protections are perfect, we believe the correct way to think about the risks represented by our counterparty credit exposure to GLIC is not the full amount of the gross liability that GLIC reinsures, but a much smaller net exposure to GLIC (if any that might exist after taking into account our credit protections). Thus, management believes that our agreement and offsetting non LTC legacy arrangements with Genworth will enable RiverSource to recover on all net exposure in all material respects in the event of a rehabilitation or insolvency of GLIC.

Dividends Paid to Shareholders and Share Repurchases 

We paid regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders totaling $386 million and $390 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. On October 28, 2020, we announced a quarterly dividend of $1.04 per common share. The dividend will be paid on November 20, 2020 to our shareholders of record at the close of business on November 9, 2020. 

In February 2019, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $2.5 billion of our common stock through March 31, 2021. In August 2020, our Board of Directors authorized an additional expenditure of up to $2.5 billion for the repurchase of shares of our common stock through September 30, 2022. As of September 30, 2020, we had $2.7 billion remaining under these share repurchase authorizations. We intend to fund share repurchases through existing working capital, future earnings and other customary financing methods. The share repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. Acquisitions under the share repurchase program may be made in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or block trades or other means. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we repurchased a total of 6.3 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $150.91 per share.
