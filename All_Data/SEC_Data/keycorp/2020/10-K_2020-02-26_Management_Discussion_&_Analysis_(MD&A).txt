Long-term financial targets 

##TABLE_START (a) 

See the section entitled &#8220;GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliations,&#8221; which presents the computations of certain financial measures related to &#8220;cash efficiency.&#8221; The section includes tables that reconcile the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures, which provides a basis for period-to-period comparisons. 

##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START (a) 

See the section entitled &#8220;GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliations,&#8221; which presents the computations of certain financial measures related to &#8220;tangible common equity.&#8221; The section includes tables that reconcile the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures, which provides a basis for period-to-period comparisons. 

##TABLE_END 

&#160;

Positive Operating Leverage 

Generate positive operating leverage and a cash efficiency ratio in the range of 54.0% to 56.0% . 

Full year expenses were down 1.9% from the prior year, as we completed our $200 million cost reduction program and drove further savings through our continuous improvement efforts. Overall, we have generated positive operating leverage over the past three years as our cash efficiency ratio has declined 390 basis points. We expect to make continued progress on our cash efficiency ratio during 2020 as we focus on expenses and strategically invest back into our business. 

Moderate Risk Profile 

Maintain a moderate risk profile by targeting a net loan charge-offs to average loans ratio in the range of .40% to .60% through a credit cycle. 

During 2019, our net loan charge-offs to average loans ratio was impacted by $139 million of net loan charge-offs related to a previously disclosed fraud loss. Overall, credit quality remains strong as we continue to remain consistent and disciplined in our credit underwriting and portfolio management and are committed to maintaining our moderate risk profile. 

Financial Return 

A return on average tangible common equity in the range of 16.00% to 19.00%. 

During 2019, our return on average tangible common equity ratio was impacted by the previously disclosed fraud loss of $106 million, after taxes. During 2019, we repurchased $868 million of Common Shares. Our full-year dividend for 2019 was $.71, a 26% increase from the previous year. In 2020, we remain committed to consistently delivering on our stated priorities of supporting organic growth, increasing dividends, and prudently repurchasing Common Shares. 

Corporate strategy 

We remain committed to enhancing long-term shareholder value by continuing to execute our relationship-based business model, growing our franchise, and being disciplined in our capital management. Our strategic focus is to deliver ease, value, and expertise to help our clients make better financial decisions and build enduring relationships. We intend to pursue this strategy by growing profitably; acquiring and expanding targeted client relationships; effectively managing risk and rewards; maintaining financial strength; and engaging, retaining, and inspiring our diverse and high-performing workforce. These strategic priorities for enhancing long-term shareholder value are described in more detail below. 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Grow profitably &#8212; We intend to continue to focus on generating positive operating leverage by growing revenue and creating a more efficient operating environment. We expect our relationship business model to keep generating organic growth as it helps us expand engagement with existing clients and attract new customers. We plan to leverage our continuous improvement culture to maintain an efficient cost structure that is aligned, sustainable, and consistent with the current operating environment and that supports our relationship business model. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Acquire and expand targeted client relationships &#8212; We seek to be client-centric in our actions and have taken purposeful steps to enhance our ability to acquire and expand targeted relationships. We seek to provide solutions to serve our clients' needs. We focus on markets and clients where we can be the most relevant. In aligning our businesses and investments against these targeted client segments, we are able to make a meaningful impact for our clients. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Effectively manage risk and rewards &#8212; Our risk management activities are focused on ensuring we properly identify, measure, and manage risks across the entire company to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Maintain financial strength &#8212; With the foundation of a strong balance sheet, we intend to remain focused on sustaining strong reserves, liquidity and capital. We plan to work closely with our Board and regulators to manage capital to support our clients&#8217; needs and drive long-term shareholder value. Our capital remains a competitive advantage for us. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Engage a high-performing, talented, and diverse workforce &#8212; Every day our employees provide our clients with great ideas, extraordinary service, and smart solutions. We intend to continue to engage our high-performing, talented, and diverse workforce to create an environment where they can make a difference, own their careers, be respected, and feel a sense of pride. 

##TABLE_END

Strategic developments 

We took the following actions during 2019 in support of our corporate strategy: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

We continued to grow profitably during 2019 . Our cash efficiency ratio improved to 59.6% and we achieved our seventh consecutive year of positive operating leverage. Full year expenses were down 1.9% from the prior year as we completed our $200 million cost reduction program. Revenue was slightly down for the year, reflecting the impact of lower interest rates. We continued to see strong balance sheet growth as average loans were up 3.6% and average deposits were up 4.7% compared to the prior year. Our relationship-based business model continues to position us well with our targeted clients, which results in new and expanded relationships. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

We acquired Laurel Road in April of 2019, which originated $1.8 billion of consumer direct loans during the year, well above our original expectations. These high quality loans provide us with an opportunity to build a broader digital relationship with our clients. Our residential mortgage business is another area where we are seeing strong returns on our investments. Residential mortgage loan originations for 2019 were $4.3 billion, up over 120% from 2018, with $1.5 billion originated in the fourth quarter of 2019. These two investments highlight our commitment to acquire and expand targeted client relationships . 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

During 2019 , our net loan charge-offs to average loans ratio was impacted by a previously disclosed fraud loss. Our provision for credit losses and net loan charge-offs include $139 million related to the fraud loss. Overall, credit quality remains strong as our new loan originations in both our commercial and consumer book continue to meet our criteria for high quality loans as we continue to effectively manage risk and rewards. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Maintaining financial strength while driving long-term shareholder value was again a focus during 2019 . At December 31, 2019, our Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios stood at 9.44% and 10.86% , respectively. During 2019 , we repurchased $379 million of Common Shares under our 2018 capital plan authorization and $489 million under our 2019 capital plan authorization. Our full-year dividend for 2019 was $.71, a 26% increase from the previous year. 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

We remained committed to our strategy to engage a high-performing, talented, and diverse workforce. In 2019, we were recognized by multiple organizations for our dedication to creating an environment where employees are treated with respect and empowered to bring their authentic selves to work. Some of these awards and recognitions included the Human Rights Campaign naming us one of the Best Places to Work for LGBT Equality, G.I. Jobs and Military Spouse Magazine recognizing us as a Military Friendly &#174; and Military Friendly &#174; Spouse Employer, and receiving the Leading Disability Employer Seal from the National Organization on Disability. We were also named to DiversityInc&#8217;s 2019 Top 50 Companies for Diversity. 

##TABLE_END 

CEO Transition 

On September 19, 2019, we announced that Beth Mooney will retire as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of KeyCorp, effective May 1, 2020. Our Board has appointed Christopher Gorman as President and Chief Operating Officer. The Board has also appointed Mr. Gorman to the Board for a term expiring at our 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Mr. Gorman will succeed Ms. Mooney as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on May 1, 2020. Mr. Gorman&#8217;s appointment is in keeping with the Board&#8217;s succession management process and will ensure a seamless leadership transition. 

LIBOR Transition 

As disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report, LIBOR in its current form is not expected to be available after 2021. The most likely replacement rate is expected to be SOFR, which has been recommended by the ARRC. The Federal Reserve has encouraged financial institutions not to wait for the end of 2021 to make the transition away from LIBOR. We have established an enterprise wide program to identify and address all LIBOR transition issues. The goals of the LIBOR transition program are to: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Identify and analyze LIBOR-based exposure and develop and execute transition strategies; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Review and update near-term strategies and actions for our current LIBOR-based business currently being written; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Assess financial impact and risk while planning and executing mitigation actions; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Understand and strategically address the current market approach to LIBOR and SOFR; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Determine and execute system and process work to be operationally ready for SOFR. 

##TABLE_END 

We are also collaborating closely with regulators and industry groups on the transition. We also expect to leverage recommendations made by the ARRC and ISDA that are tailored to our specific client segments. 

Results of Operations 

Earnings Overview 

The following chart provides a reconciliation of net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2018 , to the year ended December 31, 2019 (dollars in millions): 

##TABLE_START (a) 

Includes Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest and Preferred dividends. 

##TABLE_END

Net interest income 

One of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets (such as loans and securities) and loan-related fee income, and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. There are several factors that affect net interest income, including: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

the volume, pricing, mix, and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

the volume and value of net free funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and equity capital; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

asset quality; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

fair value accounting of acquired earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 

##TABLE_END 

To make it easier to compare both the results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets (some taxable, some not), we present net interest income in this discussion on a &#8220;TE basis&#8221; (i.e., as if all income were taxable and at the same rate). For example, $100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as $126, an amount that, if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 21%, would yield $100. Prior to 2018, $100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as $154, an amount that, if taxed at the previous statutory federal income tax rate of 35%, would yield $100. 

Figure 1 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense, and their respective yields or rates over the past five years. This figure also presents a reconciliation of TE net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with GAAP for each of those years. The net interest margin, which is an indicator of the profitability of our earning assets less the cost of funding, is calculated by dividing taxable-equivalent net interest income by average earning assets. 

TE net interest income for 2019 was $3.9 billion , and the net interest margin was 3.04% , compared to TE net interest income of $3.9 billion and a net interest margin of 3.17% for the prior year. Net interest income for 2019 reflects an increase in earning asset balances, partially offset by a decline in loan fees and a lower net interest margin. Additionally, purchase accounting accretion declined $38 million. The net interest margin was impacted by a lag in deposit pricing as interest rates moved lower during the second half of 2019. In 2020 , we expect TE net interest income to be up 1% to 3% compared to 2019 and the net interest margin to be relatively stable compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. 

##TABLE_START (a) 

Average deposits for the year ended December 31, 2015, exclude deposits in foreign office. 

##TABLE_END 

Average loans totaled $91.5 billion for 2019 , compared to $88.3 billion in 2018 . Commercial loans increased $2 . 1 billion, reflecting broad-based growth in commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by declines in commercial mortgage and construction loans. Consumer loans increased $1 . 1 billion, driven by solid growth from Laurel Road, residential mortgage loans, and indirect auto lending . For 2020 , we expect average loans to be up 4% to 6% compared to 2019. 

Average deposits totaled $110.0 billion for 2019 , an increase of $5.0 billion compared to 2018 , reflecting growth from consumer and commercial relationships . For 2020 , we expect average deposits to be up 1% to 3% compared to 2019.

Provision for credit losses 

Our provision for credit losses was $445 million for 2019 , compared to $246 million for 2018 . The increase of $199 million in our provision for credit losses is primarily due to the realization of $139 million from a previously disclosed fraud loss. In 2020, given a relatively stable economic outlook, we expect the provision to slightly exceed net loan charge-offs to provide for loan growth. 

Noninterest income 

Noninterest income for 2019 was $2.5 billion , compared to $2.5 billion during 2018 . Noninterest income represented 38% of total revenue for 2019 and 39% of total revenue for 2018 . In 2020 , we expect noninterest income to be up 4% to 6% compared to 2019 . 

The following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest income and the factors that caused those elements to change. 

Figure 3. Noninterest Income 

##TABLE_START (a) 

Other noninterest income includes operating lease income and other leasing gains, corporate services income, corporate-owned life insurance income, consumer mortgage income, mortgage servicing fees, and other income. See the "Consolidated Statements of Income" in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 

##TABLE_END 

Trust and investment services income 

Trust and investment services income consists of brokerage commissions, trust and asset management commissions, and insurance income. For 2019 , trust and investment services income decrease d $24 million , or 4.8% , from the prior year primarily due to a decrease in insurance commissions as a result of the sale of KIBS in the second quarter of 2018, which contributed $22 million of income for 2018 prior to the sale. 

A significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management. At December 31, 2019 , our bank, trust, and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of $40.8 billion , compared to $36.8 billion at December 31, 2018 . The increase from 2018 to 2019 was primarily attributable to the market appreciation during the year as the market recovered from a decline that occurred during the second half of 2018.

Investment banking and debt placement fees 

Investment banking and debt placement fees consist of syndication fees, debt and equity financing fees, financial advisor fees, gains on sales of commercial mortgages, and agency origination fees. For 2019 , investment banking and debt placement fees decrease d $20 million , or 3.1% , from the prior year due to the market disruption from the government shutdown that occurred early in 2019. 

Service charges on deposit accounts 

Service charges on deposit accounts decrease d $12 million , or 3.4% , in 2019 compared to the prior year. 

Cards and payments income 

Cards and payments income, which consists of debit card, consumer and commercial credit card, and merchant services income, increase d $5 million , or 1.9% , in 2019 compared to 2018 . This increase was primarily due to higher debit card, credit card, and merchant fees. 

Other noninterest income 

Other noninterest income includes operating lease income and other leasing gains, corporate services income, corporate-owned life insurance income, consumer mortgage income, mortgage servicing fees, and other income. Other noninterest income decreased $5 million , or .7% , in 2019 compared to 2018 . Other income was down primarily due to a $78 million gain related to the sale of KIBS during the second quarter of 2018. Partially offsetting this was an increase in operating lease income and other leasing gains which was negatively impacted by a $42 million lease residual loss in the second quarter of 2018, as well as higher consumer mortgage income and mortgage servicing fees reflecting our ongoing investment in our residential mortgage business. 

Noninterest expense 

Noninterest expense for 2019 was $3.9 billion , compared to $4.0 billion for 2018 . Figure 5 gives a breakdown of our major categories of noninterest expense as a percentage of total noninterest expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 . In 2020 , we expect noninterest expense to be relatively stable compared to 2019 . 

The following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest expense and the factors that caused those elements to change.

##TABLE_START (a) 

Other noninterest expense includes equipment, operating lease expense, marketing, FDIC assessment, intangible asset amortization, OREO expense, net, and other expense. See the "Consolidated Statements of Income" in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 

##TABLE_END 

Personnel 

As shown in Figure 6 , personnel expense, the largest category of our noninterest expense, decrease d by $59 million , or 2.6% , in 2019 compared to 2018 . The decrease reflected the successful implementation of our expense initiatives, which resulted in a $83 million decrease in salary and contract labor expense.

##TABLE_END 

Net occupancy 

Net occupancy expense decrease d $15 million , or 4.9% , in 2019 compared to 2018 , primarily due to lower depreciation and rental expenses. 

Other noninterest expense 

Other noninterest expense includes equipment, operating lease expense, marketing, FDIC assessment, intangible asset amortization, OREO expenses, and other miscellaneous expense categories. In total, other noninterest expense decreased $6 million , or .6% , in 2019 compared to 2018 . This decline was primarily attributable to the elimination of the FDIC surcharge. 

Income taxes 

We recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of $314 million for 2019 , compared to $344 million for 2018 . The effective tax rate, which is the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes, was 15.6% for 2019 and 2018 . In 2020 , we expect our GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 17% to 18%. 

In 2019 , our federal tax expense and effective tax rate differ from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate; primarily from investments in tax-advantaged assets, such as corporate-owned life insurance, tax credits associated with investments in low-income housing projects and energy related projects, and periodic adjustments to our tax reserves as described in Note 14 (&#8220; Income Taxes &#8221;). 

Business Segments Results 

We previously reported our results of operations through two business segments, Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank, with the remaining operations recorded in Other. In the first quarter of 2019, we underwent a company-wide organizational change, resulting in the realignment of our businesses into two reportable business segments, Consumer Bank and Commercial Bank, with the remaining operations that do not meet the criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business recorded in Other. The new business segment structure aligns with how management reviews performance and makes decisions by client, segment, and business unit. Prior period information was restated to conform to the new business segment structure. 

This section summarizes the highlights and segment imperatives, market and business overview, and financial performance of our two major business segments (operating segments): Consumer Bank and Commercial Bank. Note 25 (&#8220; Business Segment Reporting &#8221;) describes the products and services offered by each of these business segments and provides more detailed financial information pertaining to the segments. Dollars in the charts are presented in millions.

Market and business overview 

As the banking industry moves forward, so do our clients. Anticipating our clients&#8217; needs not only today, but for tomorrow and into the future, has become one of the biggest challenges for the banking industry. We view these challenges as an opportunity to help our current client base meet their own goals, as well as attract new and diverse clients. In an increasingly digital world focused on specialized convenience, we have made meaningful steps to meet those demands through new digital portals and the acquisitions of HelloWallet in 2017 and Laurel Road in 2019. These platforms place us in a strong position to develop long lasting and meaningful relationships with our current and prospective clients. Financial wellness is a core tenet of our customer relationships and we see it in three different ways: diagnose, enhance, and sustain. Our goal is to get our clients to a place where they can comfortably sustain their current financial position so we can be there for them when they are ready to grow. Clients no longer go to a branch to conduct transactions only, they go to seek advice and gain new perspectives on issues they may be facing. Overall, we have a passion to help our clients through: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Ease - enabling simple and clear banking with no surprises 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Value - knowing our clients and valuing each relationship 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Expertise - provide our clients with industry-leading expertise and personalized service

Summary of operations 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Net income attributable to Key of $706 million in 2019, compared to $632 million in 2018, an increase of 11.7%. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Taxable equivalent net interest income increased in 2019 by $60 million, or 2.6%, from the prior year. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by strong balance sheet growth. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Average loans and leases increased in 2019 by $1.2 billion, or 3.9%, from the prior year. This was driven by the addition of Laurel Road along with strength in residential mortgage and indirect auto lending. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Average deposits increased in 2019 by $3.7 billion, or 5.4%, from the prior year. This was driven by growth in money market and certificates of deposit, reflecting Key&#8217;s relationship strategy. 

##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Provision for credit losses increased $41 million in 2019 compared to the prior year, driven by higher net loan charge-offs and balance sheet growth. Credit quality in 2019 remained stable to 2018. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Noninterest income increased in 2019 by $7 million, or .8%, from the prior year, primarily driven by growth in consumer mortgage income. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Noninterest expense decreased in 2019 by $71 million, or 3.2%, from the prior year. The decline reflects the benefit of efficiency initiatives, strong expense discipline, and the elimination of the FDIC quarterly surcharge. The decline in expense was partially offset by expenses related to the acquisition of Laurel Road.

Segment imperatives 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Solve complex client needs through a differentiated product set of banking and capital markets capabilities 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226;

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226;

##TABLE_END 

Market and business overview 

Building relationships and delivering complex solutions for middle market clients requires a distinctive operating model that understands their business and can provide a broad set of product capabilities. As competition for these clients intensifies, we have positioned the business to maintain and grow our competitive advantage by building targeted scale in businesses and client segments. Strong market share in businesses such as real estate loan servicing and equipment finance highlights our ability to successfully meet customer needs through targeted scale in distinct product capabilities. Clients expect us to understand every aspect of their business. Our seven industry verticals are aligned to drive targeted scale in segments where we have a deep breadth of industry expertise. Healthcare is the largest sector of the economy and one of our targeted verticals. Our acquisition of Cain Brothers in 2017 is one example of how we have expanded our business capabilities to further enhance our reputation as a trusted advisor to current and prospective clients. Our business model is positioned to meet our client needs because our focus is not on being a universal bank, but rather being the right bank for our clients. 

Summary of operations 

##TABLE_START &#8226;

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Taxable equivalent net interest income decreased in 2019 by $36 million, or 2.2%, from the prior year. The decrease in net interest income was primarily driven by loan spread compression due to a lower rate environment, lower purchase accounting accretion, and lower loan fees. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Average loan and lease balances increased $2.2 billion in 2019, or 3.9%, compared to the prior year driven by broad-based growth in commercial and industrial loans. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Average deposit balances increased $2.5 billion in 2019, or 7.5%, compared to the prior year, driven by growth in core deposits. 

##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#8226;

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Noninterest income increased $62 million in 2019, or 4.7%, from the prior year. Operating lease income and other leasing gains increased $75 million from the prior year driven by favorable client activity and a $42 million lease residual loss in 2018. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226;

Commercial and industrial . &#160; Commercial and industrial loans are the largest component of our loan portfolio, representing 51% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 , and 51% at December 31, 2018 . This portfolio is approximately 89% variable rate and consists of loans primarily to large corporate, middle market, and small business clients. 

Commercial and industrial loans totaled $48.3 billion at December 31, 2019 , an increase of $2.5 billion compared to December 31, 2018 , driven by increases in the finance, utilities, oil and gas, and consumer services industries, which combined accounted for approximately 38% of the total portfolio mix at December 31, 2019 . 

Commercial real estate loans . Our commercial real estate lending business includes both mortgage and construction loans, and is conducted through two primary sources: our 15-state banking franchise, and KeyBank Real Estate Capital, a national line of business that cultivates relationships with owners of commercial real estate located both within and beyond the branch system. Nonowner-occupied properties, generally properties for which at least 50% of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties, represented 80% of total commercial real estate loans outstanding at December 31, 2019 . Construction loans, which provide a stream of funding for properties not fully leased at origination to support debt service payments over the term of the contract or project, represented 10% of commercial real estate loans at year end . 

At December 31, 2019 , commercial real estate loans totaled $15.0 billion , comprised of $13.5 billion of mortgage loans and $1.6 billion of construction loans. Compared to December 31, 2018 , this portfolio decreased $902 million , driven by elevated paydowns as a result of competitive headwinds and strategic exits. 

As shown in Figure 12 , our commercial real estate loan portfolio includes various property types and geographic locations of the underlying collateral. These loans include commercial mortgage and construction loans in both Consumer Bank and Commercial Bank.

Consumer loan portfolio 

Consumer loans outstanding at December 31, 2019 , totaled $26.6 billion , an increase of $3.4 billion , or 14.5% , from one year ago , driven by growth in consumer direct lending as a result of the Laurel Road acquisition, residential mortgage loans, and indirect auto lending. 

The home equity portfolio is comprised of loans originated by our Consumer Bank within our 15-state footprint and is the largest segment of our consumer loan portfolio, representing approximately 39% of consumer loans outstanding at year end. 

As shown in Figure 8 , we held the first lien position for approximately 61% of the Consumer Bank home equity portfolio at December 31, 2019 , and 60% at December 31, 2018 . For loans with real estate collateral, we track borrower performance monthly. Regardless of the lien position, credit metrics are refreshed quarterly, including recent FICO scores as well as original and updated loan-to-value ratios. This information is used in establishing the ALLL. Our methodology is described in Note 1 (&#8220; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.&#8221;

&#160; 

In the event of default by a borrower, we are subject to recourse with respect to approximately $4.9 billion of the $358 billion of loans administered or serviced at December 31, 2019 . Additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in Note 22 (&#8220; Commitments, Contingent Liabilities, and Guarantees &#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Recourse agreement with FNMA.&#8221; 

We derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold. We earn noninterest income (recorded as &#8220;mortgage servicing fees&#8221;) from fees for servicing or administering loans. This fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets. In addition, we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing loans. Additional information about our mortgage servicing assets is included in Note 9 (&#8220; Mortgage Servicing Assets &#8221;). 

Maturities and sensitivity of certain loans to changes in interest rates 

Figure 16 shows the remaining maturities of certain commercial and real estate loans, and the sensitivity of those loans to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2019 , approximately 27% of these outstanding loans were scheduled to mature within one year.

Securities 

Our securities portfolio totaled $31.9 billion at December 31, 2019 , compared to $30.9 billion at December 31, 2018 . Available-for-sale securities were $21.8 billion at December 31, 2019 , compared to $19.4 billion at December 31, 2018 . Held-to-maturity securities were $10.1 billion at December 31, 2019 , compared to $11.5 billion at December 31, 2018 . 

As shown in Figure 17 , all of our mortgage-backed securities, which include both securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, are issued by government-sponsored enterprises or GNMA, and are traded in liquid secondary markets. These securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value for the available-for-sale portfolio and at cost for the held-to-maturity portfolio. For more information about these securities, see Note 6 (&#8220; Fair Value Measurements &#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Qualitative Disclosures of Valuation Techniques,&#8221; and Note 7 (&#8220; Securities &#8221;).

Securities available for sale 

The majority of our securities available-for-sale portfolio consists of Federal Agency CMOs and mortgage-backed securities. CMOs are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities. These mortgage securities generate interest income, serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements, and provide liquidity value under regulatory requirements. 

We periodically evaluate our securities available-for-sale portfolio in light of established A/LM objectives, changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio, the regulatory environment, and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed. These evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning. 

In addition, the size and composition of our securities available-for-sale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required (or elect) to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits. Although we generally use debt securities for this purpose, other assets, such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit, are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles. 

Our investing activities continue to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs. Our actions to not reinvest the monthly security cash flows at various times served to provide the liquidity necessary to address our funding requirements. These funding requirements included ongoing loan growth and occasional debt maturities. At other times, we may make additional investments that go beyond the replacement of maturities or mortgage security cash flows as our liquidity position and/or interest rate risk management strategies may require. Lastly, our focus on investing in high quality liquid assets, including GNMA-related securities, is related to liquidity management strategies to satisfy regulatory requirements. 

Figure 18 shows the composition, TE yields, and remaining maturities of our securities available for sale. For more information about these securities, including gross unrealized gains and losses by type of security and securities pledged, see Note 7 (&#8220; Securities &#8221;).

Deposits and other sources of funds 

Figure 20. Breakdown of Deposits at December 31, 2019 

Deposits are our primary source of funding. At December 31, 2019 , our deposits totaled $111.9 billion , an increase of $4.6 billion , compared to December 31, 2018 . The increase in deposits compared to the prior year reflects our strategy to acquire and expand client relationships. 

Wholesale funds, consisting of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, totaled $13.5 billion at December 31, 2019 , compared to $14.6 billion at December 31, 2018 . The decrease from the prior year reflects a shift in funding mix stemming from strong deposit growth.

Capital 

The objective of management of capital is to maintain capital levels consistent with our risk appetite and sufficient in size to operate within a wide range of operating environments. We have identified three primary uses of capital: 

##TABLE_START 1. 

Investing in our businesses, supporting our clients, and loan growth; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2. 

Maintaining or increasing our Common Share dividend; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3. 

Returning capital in the form of Common Share repurchases to our shareholders. 

##TABLE_END 

The following sections discuss certain ways we have deployed our capital. For further information, see the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity and Note 24 (&#8220; Shareholders' Equity &#8221;). 

##TABLE_START (a) 

Common Share repurchases were suspended during the third quarter of 2015 due to the then pending merger with First Niagara. We resumed our Common Share repurchase program during the third quarter of 2016 upon the completion of the First Niagara merger. 

##TABLE_END 

Dividends 

Consistent with our 2018 capital plan, the Board declared a quarterly dividend of $.170 per Common Share for the first and second quarters of 2019 . The Board declared a quarterly dividend of $.185 per Common Share for the third and fourth quarters of 2019 , consistent with our 2019 capital plan. These quarterly dividend payments brought our annual dividend to $.71 per Common Share for 2019 . 

Common Shares outstanding 

Our Common Shares are traded on the NYSE under the symbol KEY with 32,943 holders of record at February 21, 2020 . Our book value per Common Share was $15.54 based on 977.2 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2019 , compared to $13.90 based on 1.020 billion shares outstanding at December 31, 2018 . At December 31, 2019 , our tangible book value per Common Share was $12.56 , compared to $11.14 at December 31, 2018 . 

Figure 35 in the section entitled &#8220;Fourth Quarter Results&#8221; shows per Common Share earnings and dividends paid by quarter for each of the last two years.

During 2019 , Common Shares outstanding decreased by 42.3 million shares due to Common Share repurchases under our 2018 and 2019 capital plans. 

At December 31, 2019 , we had 279.5 million treasury shares, compared to 237.2 million treasury shares at December 31, 2018 . Going forward, we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stock-based compensation awards and for other corporate purposes. 

Capital adequacy 

Capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance. All of our capital ratios remained in excess of regulatory requirements at December 31, 2019 . Our capital and liquidity levels are intended to position us to weather an adverse operating environment while continuing to serve our clients&#8217; needs, as well as to meet the Regulatory Capital Rules described in the &#8220;Supervision and regulation&#8221; section of Item 1 of this report. Our shareholders&#8217; equity to assets ratio was 11.75% at December 31, 2019 , compared to 11.17% at December 31, 2018 . Our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.64% at December 31, 2019 , compared to 8.30% at December 31, 2018 . The new minimum capital and leverage ratios under the Regulatory Capital Rules together with the estimated ratios of KeyCorp at December 31, 2019 , calculated on a fully phased-in basis, are set forth under the heading &#8220;Basel III&#8221; in the &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; section in Item 1 of this report. 

Figure 23 represents the details of our regulatory capital positions at December 31, 2019 , and December 31, 2018 , under the Regulatory Capital Rules. Information regarding the regulatory capital ratios of KeyCorp&#8217;s banking subsidiaries is presented in Note 24 (&#8220; Shareholders' Equity &#8221;).

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations 

Off-balance sheet arrangements 

We are party to various types of off-balance sheet arrangements, which could lead to contingent liabilities or risks of loss that are not reflected on the balance sheet. 

Variable interest entities 

In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for consolidations, we consolidate a VIE if we have: (i) a variable interest in the entity; (ii) the power to direct activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity&#8217;s economic performance; and (iii) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE (i.e., we are considered to be the primary beneficiary). Additional information regarding the nature of VIEs and our involvement with them is included in Note 1 (&#8220; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation&#8221; and in Note 13 (&#8220; Variable Interest Entities &#8221;). 

Commitments to extend credit or funding 

Loan commitments provide for financing on predetermined terms as long as the client continues to meet specified criteria. These commitments generally carry variable rates of interest and have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. We typically charge a fee for our loan commitments. Since a commitment may expire without resulting in a loan or being fully utilized, the total amount of an outstanding commitment may significantly exceed any related cash outlay. Further information about our loan commitments at December 31, 2019 , is presented in Note 22 (&#8220; Commitments, Contingent Liabilities, and Guarantees &#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Commitments to Extend Credit or Funding.&#8221; Figure 24 shows the remaining contractual amount of each class of commitment to extend credit or funding. For loan commitments and commercial letters of credit, this amount represents our maximum possible accounting loss on the unused commitment if the borrower were to draw upon the full amount of the commitment and subsequently default on payment for the total amount of the then outstanding loan. 

Other off-balance sheet arrangements 

Other off-balance sheet arrangements include financial instruments that do not meet the definition of a guarantee in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, and other relationships, such as liquidity support provided to asset-backed commercial paper conduits, indemnification agreements and intercompany guarantees. Information about such arrangements is provided in Note 22 under the heading &#8220;Other Off-Balance Sheet Risk.&#8221; 

Contractual obligations 

Figure 24 summarizes our significant contractual obligations, and lending-related and other off-balance sheet commitments at December 31, 2019 , by the specific time periods in which related payments are due or commitments expire.

Guarantees 

We are a guarantor in various agreements with third parties. As guarantor, we may be contingently liable to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in a specified interest rate, foreign exchange rate or other variable (including the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event). These variables, known as underlyings, may be related to an asset or liability, or another entity&#8217;s failure to perform under a contract. Additional information regarding these types of arrangements is presented in Note 22 (&#8220; Commitments, Contingent Liabilities, and Guarantees &#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Guarantees.&#8221; 

Risk Management 

Overview 

Like all financial services companies, we engage in business activities and assume the related risks. The most significant risks we face are credit, compliance, operational, liquidity, market, reputation, strategic, and model risks. Our risk management activities are shown in the following chart, and we manage such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability. Certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section. 

Federal banking regulators continue to emphasize with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution. We believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks, and conform to regulatory expectations. The table below depicts our risk management hierarchy and associated responsibilities and activities of each group.

Market risk management 

Market risk is the risk that movements in market risk factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, credit spreads, and volatilities will reduce Key&#8217;s income and the value of its portfolios. These factors influence prospective yields, values, or prices associated with the instrument. We are exposed to market risk both in our trading and nontrading activities, which include asset and liability management activities. Information regarding our fair value policies, procedures, and methodologies is provided in Note 1 (&#8220; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Fair Value Measurements&#8221; and Note 6 (&#8220; Fair Value Measurements &#8221;) in this report. 

Trading market risk 

Key incurs market risk as a result of trading activities that are used in support of client facilitation and hedging activities, principally within our investment banking and capital markets businesses. Key has exposures to a wide range of risk factors including interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and commodity prices, as well as the associated implied volatilities and spreads. Our primary market risk exposures are a result of trading and hedging activities in the derivative and fixed income markets, including securitization exposures. At December 31, 2019 , we did not have any re-securitization positions. We maintain modest trading inventories to facilitate customer flow, make markets in securities, and hedge certain risks including but not limited to credit risk and interest rate risk. The risks associated with these activities are mitigated in accordance with the Market Risk hedging policy. &#160; The majority of our positions are traded in active markets. 

Management of trading market risks . Market risk management is an integral part of Key&#8217;s risk culture. The Risk Committee of our Board provides oversight of trading market risks. The ERM Committee and the Market Risk Committee regularly review and discuss market risk reports prepared by our MRM that contain our market risk exposures and results of monitoring activities. Market risk policies and procedures have been defined and approved by the Market Risk Committee, a Tier 2 Risk Governance Committee, and take into account our tolerance for risk and consideration for the business environment. 

The MRM, as the second line of defense, is an independent risk management function that partners with the lines of business to identify, measure, and monitor market risks throughout our company. The MRM is responsible for ensuring transparency of significant market risks, monitoring compliance with established limits, and escalating limit exceptions to appropriate senior management. The various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are well-managed and prudent. Market risk is monitored through various measures, such as VaR, and through routine stress testing, sensitivity, and scenario analyses. The MRM conducts stress tests for each position using historical worst case and standard shock scenarios. VaR, stressed VaR, and other analyses are prepared daily and distributed to appropriate management. 

Covered positions. We monitor the market risk of our covered positions as defined in the Market Risk Rule, which includes all of our trading positions as well as all foreign exchange and commodity positions, regardless of whether the position is in a trading account. Key&#8217;s covered positions may also include mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities that may be identified as securitization positions or re-securitization positions under the Market Risk Rule. The MRM as well as the LOB that trades securitization positions monitor the positions, the portfolio composition and the risks identified in this section on a daily basis consistent with the Market Risk policies and procedures. At December 31, 2019 , covered positions did not include any re-securitization positions. Instruments that are used to hedge nontrading activities, such as bank-issued debt and loan portfolios, equity positions that are not actively traded, and securities financing activities, do not meet the definition of a covered position. The MRM is responsible for identifying our portfolios as either covered or non-covered. The Covered Position Working Group develops the final list of covered positions, and a summary is provided to the Market Risk Committee. 

Our significant portfolios of covered positions are detailed below. We analyze market risk by portfolios of covered positions and do not separately measure and monitor our portfolios by risk type. The descriptions below incorporate the respective risk types associated with each of these portfolios. 

&#160; 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Fixed income includes those instruments associated with our capital markets business and the trading of securities as a dealer. These instruments may include positions in municipal bonds, bonds backed by the U.S. government, agency and corporate bonds, certain mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, money markets, and certain CMOs. The activities and instruments within the fixed income portfolio create exposures to interest rate and credit spread risks. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Interest rate derivatives include interest rate swaps, caps, and floors, which are transacted primarily to accommodate the needs of commercial loan clients. In addition, we enter into interest rate derivatives to offset or mitigate the interest rate risk related to the client positions. The activities within this portfolio create exposures to interest rate risk. 

##TABLE_END 

VaR and stressed VaR. VaR is the estimate of the maximum amount of loss on an instrument or portfolio due to adverse market conditions during a given time interval within a stated confidence level. Stressed VaR is used to assess extreme conditions on market risk within our trading portfolios. The MRM calculates VaR and stressed VaR on a daily basis, and the results are distributed to appropriate management. VaR and stressed VaR results are also provided to our regulators and utilized in regulatory capital calculations. 

We use a historical simulation VaR model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and credit spreads on the fair value of our covered positions and other non-covered positions. Historical scenarios are customized for specific positions, and numerous risk factors are incorporated in the calculation. Additional consideration is given to the risk factors to estimate the exposures that contain optionality features, such as options and cancelable provisions. VaR is calculated using daily observations over a one-year time horizon, and approximates a 95% confidence level. Statistically, this means that we would expect to incur losses greater than VaR, on average, five out of 100 trading days, or three to four times each quarter. We also calculate VaR and stressed VaR at a 99% confidence level. 

The VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of possible gains and losses on our positions. However, there are limitations inherent in the VaR model since it uses historical results over a given time interval to estimate future performance. Historical results may not be indicative of future results, and changes in the market or composition of our portfolios could have a significant impact on the accuracy of the VaR model. We regularly review and enhance the modeling techniques, inputs, and assumptions used. Our market risk policy includes the independent validation of our VaR model by Key&#8217;s internal model validation group on an annual basis. The Model Risk Committee oversees the Model Validation Program, and results of validations are discussed with the ERM Committee. 

Actual losses for the total covered positions did not exceed aggregate daily VaR on any day during the quarters ended December 31, 2019 , and December 31, 2018 . The MRM backtests our VaR model on a daily basis to evaluate its predictive power. The test compares VaR model results at the 99% confidence level to daily held profit and loss. Results of backtesting are provided to the Market Risk Committee. Backtesting exceptions occur when trading losses exceed VaR. We do not engage in correlation trading or utilize the internal model approach for measuring default and credit migration risk. Our net VaR approach incorporates diversification, but our VaR calculation does not include the impact of counterparty risk and our own credit spreads on derivatives. 

The aggregate VaR at the 99% confidence level with a one day holding period for all covered positions was $.9 million at December 31, 2019 , and $.8 million at December 31, 2018 . Figure 25 summarizes our VaR at the 99% confidence level with a one day holding period for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended December 31, 2019 , and December 31, 2018 .

Internal capital adequacy assessment. Market risk is a component of our internal capital adequacy assessment. Our risk-weighted assets include a market risk-equivalent asset amount, which consists of a VaR 

component, stressed VaR component, a de minimis exposure amount, and a specific risk add-on including the securitization positions. The aggregate market value of the securitization positions as defined by the Market Risk Rule was $44.9 million at December 31, 2019 . This amount included $16.3 million of mortgage-backed securities positions and $28.6 million of asset-backed securities positions. Specific risk is the price risk of individual financial instruments, which is not accounted for by changes in broad market risk factors and is measured through a standardized approach. Market risk weighted assets, including the specific risk calculations, are run quarterly by the MRM in accordance with the Market Risk Rule and approved by the Chief Market Risk Officer. 

Nontrading market risk 

Most of our nontrading market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations and its impacts on our traditional loan and deposit products, as well as investments, hedging relationships, long-term debt, and certain short-term borrowings. Interest rate risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the EVE. Such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. We manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the EVE in accordance with our risk appetite and in accordance with the Board approved ERM policy. 

Interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors, including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of customer preferences for loan and deposit products, economic conditions, the competitive environment within our markets, changes in market interest rates that affect client activity, and our hedging, investing, funding, and capital positions. The primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of reprice risk, basis risk, yield curve risk, and option risk. 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

&#8220;Reprice risk &#8221; is the exposure to changes in the level of interest rates and occurs when the volume of interest-bearing liabilities and the volume of interest-earning assets they fund (e.g., deposits used to fund loans) do not mature or reprice at the same time. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

&#8220;Basis risk&#8221; is the exposure to asymmetrical changes in interest rate indexes and occurs when floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities reprice at the same time, but in response to different market factors or indexes. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

&#8220;Yield curve risk&#8221; is the exposure to non-parallel changes in the slope of the yield curve (where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity) and occurs when interest-bearing liabilities and the interest-earning assets that they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

&#8220;Option risk&#8221; is the exposure to a customer or counterparty&#8217;s ability to take advantage of the interest rate environment and terminate or reprice one of our assets, liabilities, or off-balance sheet instruments prior to contractual maturity without a penalty. Option risk occurs when exposures to customer and counterparty early withdrawals or prepayments are not mitigated with an offsetting position or appropriate compensation. 

##TABLE_END 

The management of nontrading market risk is centralized within Corporate Treasury. The Risk Committee of our Board provides oversight of nontrading market risk. The ERM Committee and the ALCO review reports on the interest rate risk exposures described above. In addition, the ALCO reviews reports on stress tests and sensitivity analyses related to interest rate risk. These committees have various responsibilities related to managing nontrading market risk, including recommending, approving, and monitoring strategies that maintain risk positions within approved tolerance ranges. The A/LM policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of interest rate risk and is administered by the ALCO. The MRM, as the second line of defense, provides additional oversight. 

Net interest income simulation analysis. The primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis. For purposes of this analysis, we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on- and off-balance sheet positions, accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity. The analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments and balance sheet growth projections based on a most likely macroeconomic view. The results of this simulation analysis reflect management's desired interest rate risk positioning. The modeling incorporates investment portfolio and swap portfolio balances consistent with management's desired interest rate risk positioning. The simulation model estimates the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if rates were to gradually increase or decrease over the next 12 months (subject to a 25 basis point floor in rates). 

Figure 27 presents the results of the simulation analysis at December 31, 2019 , and December 31, 2018 . At December 31, 2019 , our simulated impact to changes in interest rates was modest. The asset sensitive position declined from 2018 as a result of hedging actions executed to guide the position closer to neutral over time. Tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual, parallel 200 basis point increase or 200 basis point decrease (subject to a 25 basis point floor in rates) in interest rates over the next 12 months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 5.5%. Current modeled exposure is within Board approved tolerances.

##TABLE_END

Simulation analysis produces a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on assumptions input into the model. We tailor certain assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled and validate those assumptions on a regular basis. However, actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition, customer behavior, product pricing, market interest rates, changes in management&#8217;s desired interest rate risk positioning, investment, funding and hedging activities, and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events. 

We also perform regular stress tests and sensitivity analyses on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments. Assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve, including steepening or flattening of the yield curve, immediate changes in market interest rates, and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates. Assessments are also performed on changes to the following assumptions: loan and deposit balances, the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities, changes in lending spreads, prepayments on loans and securities, investment, funding and hedging activities, and liquidity and capital management strategies. 

The results of additional assessments indicate that net interest income could increase or decrease from the base simulation results presented in Figure 27 . Net interest income is highly dependent on the timing, magnitude, frequency, and path of interest rate increases and the associated assumptions for deposit repricing relationships, lending spreads, and the balance behavior of transaction accounts. If fixed rate assets increase by $1 billion, or fixed rate liabilities decrease by $1 billion, then the benefit to rising rates would decrease by approximately 25 basis points. If the interest-bearing liquid deposit beta assumption increases or decreases by 5% (e.g., 40% to 45%), then the benefit to rising rates would decrease or increase by approximately 95 basis points. 

Our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume, mix, maturity, and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows. Corporate Treasury discretionary activities related to funding, investing, and hedging may also change as a result of changes in customer business flows or changes in management&#8217;s desired interest rate risk positioning. As changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy, management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile. 

We also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a three-year horizon. These simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a 12-month horizon. To capture longer-term exposures, we calculate exposures to changes of the EVE as discussed in the following section. 

Economic value of equity modeling. EVE complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond 12-, 24-, and 36-month horizons. EVE modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates, measuring the resulting change in the values of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet instruments, and comparing those amounts with the base case of the current interest rate environment. This analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with non-contractual maturities. Those assumptions are based on historical behaviors, as well as our expectations. We develop remediation plans that would maintain 

residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our EVE will decrease by more than 15% in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates. We are operating within these guidelines as of December 31, 2019 . 

Management of interest rate exposure. We use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate A/LM strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures. Specifically, we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities, issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates, and using derivatives. We predominantly use interest rate swaps and options, which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities. 

Figure 28 shows all derivative positions that we hold for A/LM purposes. The swap positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. For example, fixed-rate debt is converted to a floating rate through a &#8220;receive fixed/pay variable&#8221; interest rate swap. The volume, maturity, and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader A/LM objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged.

Liquidity risk management 

Liquidity risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by our ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund new business opportunities at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, and without adverse consequences. Liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions. 

Governance structure 

We manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis. This approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity, as well as each entity&#8217;s capacity to manage through adverse conditions. The approach also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding. 

The management of consolidated liquidity risk is centralized within Corporate Treasury. Oversight and governance is provided by the Board, the ERM Committee, the ALCO, and the Chief Risk Officer. The Asset Liability Management Policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of liquidity risk and is administered by the ALCO. The Corporate Treasury Oversight group within the MRM, as the second line of defense, provides additional oversight. Our current liquidity risk management practices are in compliance with the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s Enhanced Prudential Standards. 

These committees regularly review liquidity and funding summaries, liquidity trends, peer comparisons, variance analyses, liquidity projections, hypothetical funding erosion stress tests, and goal tracking reports. The reviews generate a discussion of positions, trends, and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of our decisions. When liquidity pressure is elevated, positions are monitored more closely and reporting is more intensive. To ensure 

that emerging issues are identified, we also communicate with individuals inside and outside of the company on a daily basis. 

Factors affecting liquidity 

Our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events. An example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency. Examples of indirect events (events unrelated to us) that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war, natural disasters, global pandemics, political events, or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund or hedge fund. Similarly, market speculation, or rumors about us or the banking industry in general, may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources. 

Our credit ratings at December 31, 2019 , are shown in Figure 29 . We believe these credit ratings, under normal conditions in the capital markets, will enable KeyCorp or KeyBank to issue fixed income securities to investors.

##TABLE_END

Managing liquidity risk 

Most of our liquidity risk is derived from our lending activities, which inherently places funds into illiquid assets. Liquidity risk is also derived from our deposit gathering activities and the ability of our customers to withdraw funds that do not have a stated maturity or to withdraw funds before their contractual maturity. The assessments of liquidity risk are measured under the assumption of normal operating conditions as well as under a stressed environment. We manage these exposures in accordance with our risk appetite, and within Board-approved policy limits. 

We regularly monitor our liquidity position and funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of hypothetical scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding. In the normal course of business, we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both KeyCorp and KeyBank. In a &#8220;heightened monitoring mode,&#8221; we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently, and use assumptions to reflect the changed market environment. Our testing incorporates estimates for loan and deposit lives based on our historical studies. Erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods. Ultimately, they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations. To compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures, we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed. 

We maintain a Contingency Funding Plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis. The plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions. It also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for managing liquidity through a problem period. As part of the plan, we maintain on-balance sheet liquid reserves referred to as our liquid asset portfolio, which consists of high quality liquid assets. During a problem period, that reserve could be used as a source of funding to provide time to develop and execute a longer-term strategy. The liquid asset portfolio at December 31, 2019 , totaled $25.2 billion , consisting of $24.0 billion of unpledged securities, $140 million of securities available for secured funding at the FHLB, and $1.1 billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our Federal Reserve account. The liquid asset portfolio can fluctuate due to excess liquidity, heightened risk, or prefunding of expected outflows, such as debt maturities. Additionally, as of December 31, 2019 , our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was $25.2 billion at the Federal 

Reserve Bank of Cleveland and $8.0 billion at the FHLB of Cincinnati. In 2019 , Key&#8217;s outstanding FHLB of Cincinnati advances decreased by $1.0 billion due to paydowns. 

Long-term liquidity strategy 

Our long-term liquidity strategy is to be predominantly funded by core deposits. However, we may use wholesale funds to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio, meet daily cash demands, and allow management flexibility to execute business initiatives. Key&#8217;s client-based relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base that, in conjunction with intermediate and long-term wholesale funds managed to a diversified maturity structure and investor base, supports our liquidity risk management strategy. We use the loan-to-deposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies. Our target loan-to-deposit ratio is 90-100% (at December 31, 2019 , our loan-to-deposit ratio was 87% ), which we calculate as the sum of total loans, loans held for sale, and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by deposits. 

Sources of liquidity 

Our primary sources of liquidity include customer deposits, wholesale funding, and liquid assets. If the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances, we rely on wholesale funding or on-balance sheet liquid reserves. Conversely, excess cash generated by operating, investing, and deposit-gathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets. 

Liquidity programs 

We have several liquidity programs, which are described in Note 20 (&#8220; Long-Term Debt &#8221;), that are designed to enable KeyCorp and KeyBank to raise funds in the public and private debt markets. The proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. These liquidity programs are reviewed from time to time by the Board and are renewed and replaced as necessary. There are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs. 

On February 1, 2019, KeyBank issued $600 million of 3.300% Senior Bank Notes due February 1, 2022, and $400 million of Floating Rate Senior Bank Notes due February 1, 2022. On March 13, 2019, KeyBank issued $350 million of 3.900% Subordinated Bank Notes due April 13, 2029. 

Liquidity for KeyCorp 

The primary source of liquidity for KeyCorp is from subsidiary dividends, primarily from KeyBank. KeyCorp has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt; support customary corporate operations and activities (including acquisitions); support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries&#8217; obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, and without adverse consequences; and fund capital distributions in the form of dividends and share buybacks. 

We use a parent cash coverage months metric as the primary measure to assess parent company liquidity. The parent cash coverage months metric measures the number of months into the future where projected obligations can be met with the current quantity of liquidity. We generally issue term debt to supplement dividends from KeyBank to manage our liquidity position at or above our targeted levels. The parent company generally maintains cash and short-term investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over at least the next 24 months. At December 31, 2019 , KeyCorp held $3.8 billion in cash, which we projected to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations, including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our risk tolerance. 

Typically, KeyCorp meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from KeyBank, supplemented with term debt. Federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval. A national bank&#8217;s dividend-paying capacity is affected by several factors, including net profits (as defined by statute) for the two previous calendar years and for the current year, up to the date of dividend declaration. During 2019 , KeyBank paid $1.2 billion in cash dividends to KeyCorp. At January 1, 2020 , KeyBank had regulatory capacity to pay $920 million in dividends to KeyCorp without prior regulatory approval. 

On April 29, 2019, KeyCorp issued $450 million of 5.625% fixed-for-life Perpetual Preferred Stock. 

On September 11, 2019, KeyCorp issued $750 million of 2.550% Senior Notes due October 1, 2029, under its Medium-Term Note Program. 

On October 21, 2019, KeyCorp redeemed for cash all of the outstanding $300 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.750% Senior Notes due March 19, 2020. 

On February 6, 2020, KeyCorp issued $800 million of 2.250% Senior Notes due April 6, 2027, under its Medium-Term Note Program. 

Our liquidity position and recent activity 

Over the past 12 months, our liquid asset portfolio, which includes overnight and short-term investments, as well as unencumbered, high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios, has increased as a result of an increase in unpledged securities, partially offset by lower balances held at the Federal Reserve. The liquid asset portfolio continues to exceed the amount that we estimate would be necessary to manage through an adverse liquidity event by providing sufficient time to develop and execute a longer-term solution. 

From time to time, KeyCorp or KeyBank may seek to retire, repurchase, or exchange outstanding debt, capital securities, preferred shares, or Common Shares through cash purchase, privately negotiated transactions or other means. Additional information on repurchases of Common Shares by KeyCorp is included in Part II, Item 5. Market for the Registrant&#8217;s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities of this report. Such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity and capital requirements, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material, individually or collectively. 

The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the years ended December 31, 2019 , and December 31, 2018 . 

Credit risk management 

Credit risk is the risk of loss to us arising from an obligor&#8217;s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms. Like other financial services institutions, we make loans, extend credit, purchase securities, add financial and payments products, and enter into financial derivative contracts, all of which have related credit risk. 

Credit policy, approval, and evaluation 

We manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program. The Credit Risk Committee approves management credit policies and recommends significant credit policies to the Enterprise Risk Management Committee, the KeyBank Board, and the Risk Committee of the Board for approval. These policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit. 

Our credit risk management team and certain individuals within our lines of business, to whom credit risk management has delegated limited credit authority, are responsible for credit approval. Individuals with assigned credit authority are authorized to grant exceptions to credit policies. It is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate, however, a corporate level tolerance has been established to keep exceptions at an acceptable level based upon portfolio and economic considerations. 

Our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans. These models, known as scorecards, forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant. The scorecards are embedded in the application processing system, which allows for real-time scoring and automated decisions for many of our products. We periodically validate the loan grading and scoring processes. 

We maintain an active concentration management program to mitigate concentration risk in our credit portfolios. For individual obligors, we employ a sliding scale of exposure, known as hold limits, which is dictated by the type of loan and strength of the borrower. 

Allowance for loan and lease losses 

We estimate the appropriate level of the ALLL on at least a quarterly basis. The methodology used is described in Note 1 (&#8220; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.&#8221; Briefly, our allowance applies incurred loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics. We exercise judgment to assess any adjustment to the incurred loss rates for the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions, lending policies including underwriting standards, and the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets. As described in Note 1, (&#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221;), on January 1, 2020, we adopted ASC 326, Financial Instruments &#8212; Credit Losses, and as such, an expected credit loss methodology, specifically current expected credit losses for the remaining life of our loans and leases, will be used to estimate the appropriate level of the ALLL. The ALLL at December 31, 2019 , represents our best estimate of the probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date. For more information about impaired loans, see Note 5 (&#8220; Asset Quality &#8221;). 

As shown in Figure 30 , our ALLL from continuing operations increased by $17 million , or 1.9% , from December 31, 2018 . Our commercial ALLL increased by $8 million , or 1.1% , from December 31, 2018 , primarily due to loan growth over the period and risk rating migration. Our consumer ALLL increased by $9 million , or 6.4% , from December 31, 2018 . The consumer ALLL increase was primarily due to loan growth and modest shifts in credit quality metrics.

Net loan charge-offs 

Figure 31 shows the trend in our net loan charge-offs by loan type, while the composition of loan charge-offs and recoveries by type of loan is presented in Figure 32 . 

Over the past 12 months, net loan charge-offs increased $190 million . This increase was primarily due to $139 million of charge-offs related to a previously disclosed fraud loss. In 2020 , we expect net loan charge-offs to average loans to remain below our long-term targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points.

##TABLE_END Nonperforming assets 

Figure 33 shows the composition of our nonperforming assets. As shown in Figure 33 , nonperforming assets increased $138 million during 2019 . The increase was primarily driven by the transfer of three criticized commercial loans as well as a number of consumer residential mortgages that were moved to nonperforming loans held for sale. See Note 1 (&#8220; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8221;) under the headings &#8220;Nonperforming Loans,&#8221; &#8220;Impaired Loans,&#8221; and &#8220;Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses&#8221; for a summary of our nonaccrual and charge-off policies.

##TABLE_END

Operational and compliance risk management 

Like all businesses, we are subject to operational risk, which is the risk of loss resulting from human error or malfeasance, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events. These events include, among other things, threats to our cybersecurity, as we are reliant upon information systems and the Internet to conduct our business activities. Operational risk also encompasses compliance risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules and regulations, prescribed practices, and ethical standards. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, large financial companies like Key are subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation. This heightened level of regulation has increased our operational risk. Resulting operational risk losses and/or additional regulatory compliance costs could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation, or foregone opportunities. 

We seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk, alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance, and a system of internal controls and reporting. We continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws, rules, and regulations. For example, an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses. This tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action. We also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes. This technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the Board. 

The Operational Risk Management Program provides the framework for the structure, governance, roles, and responsibilities, as well as the content, to manage operational risk for Key. The Compliance Risk Committee serves the same function in managing compliance risk for Key. The Operational Risk Committee supports the ERM Committee by identifying early warning events and trends, escalating emerging risks, and discussing forward-looking assessments. The Operational Risk Committee includes attendees from each of the Three Lines of Defense. Primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business. The Operational Risk Committee and Compliance Risk Committee are senior management committees that oversee our level of operational and compliance risk and direct and support our operational and compliance infrastructure and related activities. These committees and the Operational Risk Management and Compliance functions are an integral part of our ERM Program. Our Risk Review function regularly assesses the overall effectiveness of our Operational Risk Management and Compliance Programs and our system of internal controls. Risk Review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the Risk and Audit Committees and independently supports the Risk Committee&#8217;s oversight of these controls. 

Cybersecurity 

We maintain comprehensive Cyber Incident Response Plans, and we devote significant time and resources to maintaining and regularly updating our technology systems and processes to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks, and other technology assets against attempts by third parties to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems, or cause other damage. We and many other U.S. financial institutions have experienced distributed denial-of-service attacks from technologically sophisticated third parties. These attacks are intended to disrupt or disable online banking services and prevent banking transactions. We also periodically experience other attempts to breach the security of our systems and data. These cyberattacks have not, to date, resulted in any material disruption of our operations or material harm to our customers, and have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 

Cyberattack risks may also occur with our third-party technology service providers, and may result in financial loss or liability that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Cyberattacks could also interfere with third-party providers&#8217; ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us. Recent high-profile cyberattacks have targeted retailers, credit bureaus, and other businesses for the purpose of acquiring the confidential information (including personal, financial, and credit card information) of customers, some of whom are customers of ours. We may incur expenses related to the investigation of such attacks or related to the protection of our customers from identity theft as a result of such attacks. We may also incur expenses to enhance our systems or processes to protect against cyber or other security incidents. Risks and exposures related to cyberattacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking, and other technology-based products and services by us and our clients. 

As described in more detail in &#8220;Risk Management &#8212; Overview&#8221; in Item 7 of this report, the Board serves in an oversight capacity ensuring that Key&#8217;s risks are managed in a manner that is effective and balanced and adds value for the shareholders. The Board&#8217;s Risk Committee has primary oversight for enterprise-wide risk at KeyCorp, including operational risk (which includes cybersecurity). The Risk Committee reviews and provides oversight of management&#8217;s activities related to the enterprise-wide risk management framework, including cyber-related risk. The ERM Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer and comprising other senior level executives, is responsible for managing risk (including cyber-related risk) and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite. The ERM Committee reports to the Board&#8217;s Risk Committee. 

GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations 

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not 

audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, 

they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, nor as a substitute for analyses 

of results as reported under GAAP. 

The tangible common equity ratio and the return on tangible common equity ratio have been a focus for some investors, and management believes that these ratios may assist investors in analyzing Key&#8217;s capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity, we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases. ##TABLE_START Year ended December 31,

For the years ended December 31, 2019 , December 31, 2018 , December 31, 2017 , December 31, 2016 , and December 31, 2015 , average intangible assets exclude $10 million , $20 million , $34 million, $43 million, and $55 million, respectively, of average purchased credit card relationships.

The cash efficiency ratio is a ratio of two non-GAAP performance measures. Accordingly, there is no directly 

comparable GAAP performance measure. The cash efficiency ratio excludes the impact of our intangible asset 

amortization from the calculation. We believe this ratio provides greater consistency and comparability between our results and those of our peer banks. Additionally, this ratio is used by analysts and investors to evaluate how effectively management is controlling noninterest expenses in generating revenue, as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis. ##TABLE_START Year ended December 31,

Fourth Quarter Results 

Figure 35 shows our financial performance for each of the past eight quarters. Highlights of our results for the fourth quarter of 2019 are summarized below. 

Earnings 

Our fourth quarter net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders was $439 million , or $.45 per diluted Common Share, compared to $459 million , or $.45 per diluted Common Share, for the fourth quarter of 2018 . 

On an annualized basis, our return on average total assets from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 1.27% , compared to 1.37% for the fourth quarter of 2018 . The annualized return on average tangible common equity from continuing operations was 14.09% for the fourth quarter of 2019 , compared to 16.40% for the year-ago quarter. 

Net interest income 

TE net interest income was $987 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 , compared to TE net interest income of $1.0 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018 . The decrease in net interest income reflects a lower net interest margin, driven by a decline in interest rates and slightly higher deposit costs. Additionally, purchase accounting accretion declined $8 million. These declines were partially offset by higher earning asset balances. 

Noninterest income 

Our noninterest income was $651 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 , compared to $645 million for the year-ago quarter. The increase reflects higher operating lease income, as well as growth in corporate services income, driven by higher derivatives income. Investments made in Key's mortgage business continue to drive consumer mortgage income and mortgage servicing fees. 

Noninterest expense 

Our noninterest expense was $980 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 , compared to $1.0 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018 . The fourth quarter of 2019 included notable items of $22 million, which consist of a pension settlement charge of $18 million and professional fees related to a previously disclosed fraud loss of $4 million. The year-ago period included notable items of $41 million, which were efficiency-related expenses of $24 million and a pension settlement charge of $17 million. Excluding notable items, noninterest expense decreased by $13 million from the year-ago period, reflecting the successful implementation of Key's expense initiatives, which drove personnel expenses lower. These expenses were partially offset by Laurel Road acquisition expenses. 

Provision for credit losses 

Our provision for credit losses was $109 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 , compared to $59 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 . This increase was partially due to a pre-tax loss related to a previously disclosed fraud incident of $16 million. Our ALLL was $900 million , or .95% of total period-end loans, at December 31, 2019 , compared to 

.99% at December 31, 2018 . 

Net loan charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2019 totaled $99 million , or .42% of average total loans. These results compare to $60 million , or .27% , for the fourth quarter of 2018 . This increase was partially due to a previously disclosed fraud incident. 

Income taxes 

For the fourth quarter of 2019 , we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of $75 million, compared to a tax provision of $92 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 . The provision included a tax benefit of $11 million related to the reversal of a valuation allowance against federal and state capital loss carryforwards acquired from First Niagara Financial Group utilized in the quarter. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 14.0%, compared to 15.9% for the same quarter one year ago. 

Our federal tax expense and effective tax rate differ from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate; primarily from investments in tax-advantaged assets, such as corporate-owned life insurance, tax credits associated with investments in low-income housing projects and energy related projects, and periodic adjustments to our tax reserves as described in Note 14 (&#8220; Income Taxes &#8221;).

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our business is dynamic and complex. Consequently, we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies. These choices are critical; not only are they necessary to comply with GAAP, they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance. All accounting policies are important, and all policies described in Note 1 (&#8220; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8221;) should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance. 

In our opinion, some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility. These policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance, or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. Because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances, they may prove to be inaccurate, or we may find it necessary to change them. The following is a description of our current critical accounting policies. 

Allowance for loan and lease losses 

The ALLL is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio. In determining the ALLL, we apply expected loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions, underwriting standards, concentrations of credit, collateral values, and the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows. For all commercial and consumer TDRs, regardless of size, as well as all other impaired commercial loans with outstanding balances of $2.5 million or greater, we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss and assign a specific allowance to the loan. 

Our loss estimates include an assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality that may not be fully reflective of the historical loss, risk-rating, or other indicative data. The ALLL is sensitive to a variety of internal factors, such as modifications in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding, portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings. The ALLL is also sensitive to a variety of external factors, such as the general health of the economy, as evidenced by volatility in commodity prices, changes in real estate demand and values, interest rates, unemployment rates, bankruptcy filings, fluctuations in the GDP, and the effects of weather and natural disasters such as droughts, floods and hurricanes. Management considers these variables and all other available information when establishing the final level of the ALLL. These variables and others may result in actual loan losses that differ from the originally estimated amounts. 

Since our loss rates are applied to large pools of loans, even minor changes in the level of estimated losses can significantly affect management&#8217;s determination of the appropriate ALLL because those changes must be applied across a large portfolio. To illustrate, an increase in estimated losses equal to one-tenth of one percent of our consumer loan portfolio as of December 31, 2019 , would indicate the need for a $27 million increase in the ALLL. The same increase in estimated losses for the commercial loan portfolio would result in a $68 million increase in the ALLL. Such adjustments to the ALLL can materially affect financial results. Following the above examples, a $27 million increase in the consumer loan portfolio allowance would have reduced our earnings on an after-tax basis by approximately $20 million , or $.02 per Common Share; a $68 million increase in the commercial loan portfolio allowance would have reduced earnings on an after-tax basis by approximately $52 million , or $.05 per Common Share. 

Our accounting policy related to the ALLL is disclosed in Note 1 under the heading &#8220;Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.&#8221; As described in Note 1, (&#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221;), on January 1, 2020, we adopted ASC 326, Financial Instruments &#8212; Credit Losses, and as such, an expected credit loss methodology, specifically current expected credit losses for the remaining life of our loans and leases, will be used to estimate the appropriate level of the ALLL. 

Valuation methodologies 

Fair value measurements 

We measure or monitor many of our assets and liabilities on a fair value basis. Fair value is generally defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) as opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability (an entry price), in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. While management uses judgment when determining the price at which willing market participants would transact when there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for the asset or liability in relation to &#8220;normal&#8221; market activity, management&#8217;s objective is to determine the point within the range of fair value estimates that is most representative of a sale to a third-party investor under current market conditions. The value to us if the asset or liability were held to maturity is not included in the fair value estimates. 

A fair value measure should reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including the assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset and the risk of nonperformance. Fair value is measured based on a variety of inputs. Fair value may be based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets (Level 1 valuations). If market prices are not available, quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, or model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market are used (Level 2 valuations). Where observable market data is not available, the valuation is generated from model based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market, but observable based on our specific data (Level 3 valuations). Unobservable assumptions reflect our estimates for assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques typically include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques, but may also include the use of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or liability. 

The selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a fair value higher or lower than carrying value. Considerable judgment may be involved in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value. 

For assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, our policy is to maximize the use of observable inputs 

and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements for those items where there 

is an active market. In certain cases, when market observable inputs for model-based valuation techniques may not 

be readily available, we are required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use 

in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument. The models used to determine fair value adjustments are 

regularly evaluated by management for relevance under current facts and circumstances. 

Changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. When market data is not available, we use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value. 

Fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary measure of 

accounting. Fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to measure certain assets or liabilities (including held-to-maturity securities, commercial loans held for sale, and OREO) for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with current accounting guidance. 

Impairment analysis also relates to long-lived assets, goodwill, and core deposit and other intangible assets. An 

impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not likely to be recoverable and exceeds its fair 

value. In determining the fair value, management uses models and applies the techniques and assumptions 

previously discussed. 

See Note 1 under the heading &#8220;Fair Value Measurements&#8221; and Note 6 (&#8220; Fair Value Measurements &#8221;) for a detailed discussion of determining fair value, including pricing validation processes. 

Goodwill 

The valuation and testing methodologies used in our analysis of goodwill impairment are summarized in Note 1 

under the heading &#8220;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.&#8221; Although accounting guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether additional goodwill impairment testing is required, Key chose to utilize the quantitative approach in 2019. 

The quantitative approach is a two step goodwill impairment test. The first step in goodwill impairment testing is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. The amount of capital being allocated to our reporting units as a proxy for the carrying value is based on risk-based regulatory capital requirements. Fair values are estimated using an equal combination of market and income approaches. The market approach incorporates comparable public company multiples along with data related to recent merger and acquisition activity. The income approach consists of discounted cash flow modeling that utilizes internal forecasts and various other inputs and assumptions. A multi-year internal forecast is prepared for each reporting unit and a terminal growth rate is estimated for each one based on market expectations of inflation and economic conditions in the financial services industry. Earnings projections for each reporting unit are adjusted for after tax cost savings expected to be realized by a market participant. The discount rate applied to our cash flows is derived from the CAPM. The buildup to the discount rate includes a risk-free rate, 5-year adjusted beta based on peer companies, a market equity risk premium, a size premium and a company specific risk premium. The discount rates differ between our reporting units as they have varying levels of risk. A sensitivity analysis is typically performed on key assumptions, such as the discount rates and cost savings estimates. 

If the fair value determined in step 1 is greater than the carrying value, then the reporting unit's goodwill is deemed not to be impaired. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, then the second step is performed, which measures the amount of impairment by comparing the carrying amount of goodwill to its implied fair value. The second step of the goodwill impairment test was not required in 2019. Effective January 1, 2020, upon the adoption of ASU 2017-04, the second step of the goodwill impairment test was eliminated. 

We continue to monitor the impairment indicators for goodwill and other intangible assets, and to evaluate the carrying amount of these assets quarterly. Additional information is provided in Note 12 (&#8220; Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets &#8221;). 

Derivatives and hedging 

We primarily use interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk for asset and liability management purposes. These derivative instruments modify the interest rate characteristics of specified on-balance sheet assets and liabilities. Our accounting policies related to derivatives reflect the current accounting guidance, which provides that all derivatives should be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value, after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements. Accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a particular derivative depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship, and further, on the type of hedging relationship. 

The application of hedge accounting requires significant judgment to interpret the relevant accounting guidance, as well as to assess hedge effectiveness, identify similar hedged item groupings, and measure changes in the fair value of the hedged items. We believe our methods of addressing these judgments and applying the accounting guidance are consistent with both the guidance and industry practices. Additional information relating to our use of derivatives is included in Note 1 under the heading &#8220;Derivatives and Hedging,&#8221; and Note 8 (&#8220; Derivatives and Hedging Activities &#8221;). 

Contingent liabilities, guarantees and income taxes 

Note 22 (&#8220; Commitments, Contingent Liabilities, and Guarantees &#8221;) summarizes contingent liabilities arising from litigation and contingent liabilities arising from guarantees in various agreements with third parties under which we are a guarantor, and the potential effects of these items on the results of our operations. We record a liability for the fair value of the obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of a guarantee, but there is a risk that our actual future payments in the event of a default by the guaranteed party could exceed the recorded amount. See Note 22 (&#8220; Commitments, Contingent Liabilities, and Guarantees &#8221;) for a comparison of the liability recorded and the maximum potential undiscounted future payments for the various types of guarantees that we had outstanding at December 31, 2019 . 

It is not always clear how the Internal Revenue Code and various state tax laws apply to transactions that we undertake. In the normal course of business, we may record tax benefits and then have those benefits contested by the IRS or state tax authorities. We have provided tax reserves that we believe are adequate to absorb potential adjustments that such challenges may necessitate. However, if our judgment later proves to be inaccurate, the tax reserves may need to be adjusted, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and capital. 

Additionally, we conduct quarterly assessments that determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are more-likely-than-not to be realized, and therefore recorded. The available evidence used in connection with these assessments includes a history of pretax income, projected future taxable income, potential tax-planning strategies, and projected future reversals of deferred tax liabilities. These assessments are subjective and may change. Based on these criteria, and all available positive and negative evidence, we establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when we are unable to conclude it is more likely than not that they will be realized. However, if our assessments prove incorrect, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which they occur. For further information on our accounting for income taxes, see Note 1 (&#8220; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8221;) and Note 14 (&#8220; Income Taxes &#8221;). 

During 2019 , we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates.

ASU 2019-12, &#160; Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes 

January 1, 2021 

Early adoption is permitted 

This ASU simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the existing guidance, such as exceptions related to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities when a foreign subsidiary becomes an equity method investment and when a foreign equity method investment becomes a subsidiary. 

Along with general improvements, it adds simplifications related to franchise taxes, the tax basis of goodwill and the method for recognizing an enacted change in tax laws. The guidance also specifies that an entity is not required to allocate the consolidated amount of certain tax expense to a legal entity not subject to tax in its own separate financial statements. 

The guidance should be applied on either a retrospective, modified retrospective or prospective basis depending on the amendment. 

The adoption of this accounting guidance is not expected to have a 

material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 

ASU 2020-01, Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321,Investments&#8212;Equity Securities; Topic 323, Investments&#8212; Equity Method and Joint Ventures; and Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging 

January 1, 2021 

Early adoption is permitted 

This guidance clarifies that when applying the measurement alternative in Topic 321, companies should consider certain observable transactions that require the application or discontinuance of the equity method under Topic 323. 

It also clarifies that companies should not consider whether the underlying securities in certain forward contracts and purchased options would be accounted for under the equity method or fair value option when determining the method of accounting for those contracts. 

This guidance should be applied on a prospective basis. 

The adoption of this accounting guidance is not expected to have a 

material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
