EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 

Reporting Updates 

During the fourth quarter of 2023, we updated the presentation of our noninterest income categories to align product and service types more closely with how we strategically manage our business. For a description of each updated noninterest income revenue stream, refer to Note 15 - &#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

During the fourth quarter of 2023, we revised our FTP methodology for non-maturity deposits, which has been enhanced to consider the internally modeled weighted average life by non-maturity deposit type. In general, the impact of the FTP methodology revision resulted in a net higher cost of funds allocation as compared with the previous method. 

For the reporting updates discussed above, prior period results have been adjusted to conform to the current presentation.

Summary of 2024 Third Quarter Results Compared to 2023 Third Quarter 

For the third quarter of 2024, we reported net income of $517 million, or $0.33 per diluted common share, compared with $547 million, or $0.35 per diluted common share, in the year-ago quarter. 

Net interest income was $1.4 billion for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of $17 million, or 1%, from the year-ago quarter. FTE net interest income, a non-GAAP financial measure, decreased $15 million, or 1%, from the year-ago quarter. The decrease in FTE net interest income primarily reflected a 22 basis point decrease in the FTE NIM to 2.98% and a $14.4 billion, or 11%, increase in average interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by a $10.9 billion, or 6%, increase in average earning assets. 

The provision for credit losses increased $7 million, or 7%, from the year-ago quarter to $106 million in the third quarter of 2024. The ACL increased $68 million from the year-ago quarter to $2.4 billion in the third quarter of 2024, or 1.93% of total loans and leases, compared to $2.4 billion, or 1.96% of total loans and leases, for the year-ago quarter. 

Noninterest income was $523 million, an increase of $14 million, or 3%, from the year-ago quarter, primarily due increases in capital markets and advisory fees, wealth and asset management revenue, and mortgage banking income, partially offset by the $33 million favorable mark-to-market on pay-fixed swaptions recognized in the year-ago quarter. Noninterest expense was $1.1 billion, an increase of $40 million, or 4%, from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to increases in personnel costs and outside data processing and other services, partially offset by decreases in deposit and other insurance expense and net occupancy. 

Consolidated Balance Sheet and Capital Ratios as of September 30, 2024 Compared to Prior Year End 

Total assets at September 30, 2024 were $200.5 billion, an increase of $11.2 billion, or 6%, compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in total assets was primarily driven by increases in loans and leases of $4.4 billion, or 4%, total investment securities of $3.5 billion, or 8%, and interest-earning deposits with banks of $2.4 billion, or 27%. Total liabilities at September 30, 2024 were $179.9 billion, an increase of $9.9 billion, or 6%, compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in total liabilities was primarily driven by increases in total deposits of $7.1 billion, or 5%, and long-term debt of $3.3 billion, or 26%. 

The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio increased to 6.4% at September 30, 2024, compared to 6.1% at December 31, 2023, primarily due to an improvement in AOCI driven by changes in interest rates, and an increase in tangible common equity from current period earnings, net of dividends, partially offset by an increase in tangible assets. CET1 risk-based capital ratio was 10.4% at September 30, 2024, compared to 10.2% at December 31, 2023. The increase in CET1 is primarily due to current period earnings, net of dividends, partially offset by an increase in risk-weighted assets and a reduction in the CECL transitional amount. The increase in risk-weighted assets was driven by loan growth, partially offset by the impact of the second quarter 2024 CLN transaction.

2024 3Q Form 10-Q 7 

Economy 

The rate cutting cycle began with the Federal Reserve cutting the federal funds rate by 50 basis points at the September FOMC meeting. Inflation is still not to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s 2% target, however, it has been continuing to move lower. On the other side of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s dual mandate, employment data has deteriorated recently. The unemployment rate has increased from a cyclical low of 3.4% to 4.1% at September 30, 2024, including reaching 4.3% during the quarter. While the unemployment rate is still low by historical standards, the Federal Reserve has mentioned that risks have shifted to be more balanced and thus should likely warrant a less restrictive monetary policy. The Federal Reserve maintains that economic data will continue to drive their decision making process for rates. 

The recent economic data has been mixed. Core manufacturing continues to contract, but the services sector is still slowly expanding. Overall U.S. consumer spending continues to be resilient defying expectations of a slowdown, although personal savings rates have been trending down over the course of 2024, which helps explain some of the resiliency. In addition, overall U.S. credit card balances and delinquency rates are both increasing. While overall risks are increasing, most economists still expect either a soft landing or a short and shallow recession. 

Other Recent Developments 

In June 2024, the FDIC adopted a final rule to modify the required frequency and informational content of resolution plan submissions applicable to insured depository institutions with $50 billion or more in total assets, which describe the insured depository institution&#8217;s strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. As a result of the final rule, the Bank will be required to submit to the FDIC full resolution plans every three years and interim targeted information between full resolution plan submissions. In addition, the final rule introduces a new credibility standard that will be used to evaluate full resolution plan submissions, which would be subject to potential FDIC enforcement action. The final rule became effective October 1, 2024 and the deadline for the first resolution plan submission is July 1, 2025.

2024 3Q Form 10-Q 9 

Quarterly Net Interest Income 

Net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 decreased $17 million, or 1%, from the third quarter of 2023. FTE net interest income, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the third quarter of 2024 decreased $15 million, or 1%, from the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in FTE net interest income primarily reflected a 22 basis point decrease in the FTE NIM to 2.98% and a $14.4 billion, or 11%, increase in average interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by a $10.9 billion, or 6%, increase in average earning assets. The lower NIM was primarily driven by higher cost of funds given the higher interest rate environment and a $12.3 billion, or 11%, increase in interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by higher loan and lease and investment security yields. 

Quarterly Average Balance Sheet 

Average assets for the third quarter of 2024 were $198.3 billion, an increase of $11.7 billion, or 6%, from the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to increases in average total securities of $4.2 billion, or 10%, average loans and leases of $3.7 billion, or 3%, and average interest-earning deposits with banks of $3.0 billion, or 31%. The increase in average loans and leases was driven by growth in average consumer loans of $2.1 billion, or 4%, and average commercial loans and leases of $1.7 billion, or 2%. 

Average liabilities for the third quarter of 2024 increased $10.3 billion, or 6%, from the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to increases in average deposits of $8.3 billion, or 6%, and in total borrowings of $2.1 billion, or 14%. Average deposits increased due to an increase in average interest-bearing deposits of $12.3 billion, or 11%, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits of $4.0 billion, or 12%. The increase in average interest-bearing deposits was primarily due to increases in average money market deposits and certificates of deposits, partially offset by decreases in savings and other domestic deposits. The increase in total borrowings was primarily due to the addition of auto securitization trust in the first quarter of 2024 and the normal management of funding needs. 

Average shareholders&#8217; equity for the third quarter of 2024 increased $1.4 billion, or 7%, from the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to the benefit from a decrease in average accumulated other comprehensive loss and earnings, net of dividends.

2024 3Q Form 10-Q 11 

Year to Date Net Interest Income 

Net interest income for the first nine-month period of 2024 decreased $173 million, or 4%, from the year-ago period. FTE net interest income, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the first nine-month period of 2024 decreased $165 million, or 4%, from the year-ago period. The decrease in FTE net interest income reflected a 24 basis point decrease in the FTE NIM to 3.00% and a $11.3 billion, or 9%, increase in interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by a $6.3 billion, or 4%, increase in average total earning assets. The NIM compression was primarily due to the higher rate environment driving higher cost of funds, partially offset by an increase in loans and lease and investment security yields. 

Year to Date Average Balance Sheet 

Average assets for the first nine-month period of 2024 were $194.4 billion, an increase of $7.0 billion, or 4%, from the year-ago period, primarily due to increases in average loans and leases of $2.4 billion, or 2%, interest-earning deposits with banks of $2.0 billion, or 23%, and total securities of $1.7 billion, or 4%. The increase in average loans and leases included growth in average consumer loans of $1.7 billion, or 3%, and average commercial loans and leases of $764 million, or 1%. 

Average liabilities for the first nine-month period of 2024 increased $6.1 billion, or 4%, from the year-ago period, primarily due to an increase in average deposits. Total average deposits increased $7.0 billion, or 5%, due to an increase in average interest-bearing deposits of $12.5 billion, or 11%, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits of $5.5 billion, or 16%. The increase in average interest-bearing deposits was driven by increases in average money market deposits and certificates of deposits, partially offset by a decrease in savings and other domestic deposits. 

Average shareholders&#8217; equity for the first nine-month period of 2024 increased $922 million, or 5%, from the year-ago period primarily due to earnings, net of dividends, and the benefit from a decrease in average accumulated other comprehensive loss. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

(This section should be read in conjunction with the &#8220; Credit Risk &#8221; section.) 

The provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2024 was $106 million, an increase of $7 million, or 7%, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Provision for credit losses for the first nine-month period of 2024 was $313 million, an increase of $37 million, or 13%, compared to the year-ago period. The increase over the prior year-to-date period reflects increased charge-off activity in the current year partially offset by a slightly higher allowance build in the year-ago period. Overall coverage ratios remain reflective of the current macroeconomic environment including recognition of near-term recessionary risks. 

The components of the provision for credit losses were as follows:

Noninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $523 million, an increase of $14 million, or 3%, from the year-ago quarter. Capital markets and advisory fees increased $26 million, or 50%, primarily due to higher underwriting and interest rate derivative fees. Wealth and asset management revenue increased $14 million, or 18%, reflecting an increase in assets under management and higher fixed annuity commissions. Mortgage banking income increased $11 million, or 41%, primarily due to higher saleable spreads. Payments and cash management revenue increased $6 million, or 4%, primarily reflecting higher card and merchant acquiring transaction revenue. Customer deposit and loan fees increased $6 million, or 8%, primarily due to higher loan commitment fees. Partially offsetting these increases, other noninterest income decreased $43 million, or 88%. Other noninterest income in the third quarter of 2023 included a $33 million favorable mark-to-market on pay-fixed swaptions, while the third quarter of 2024 included $8 million of contra-revenue related to premium costs and mark-to-market associated with credit risk transfer transactions. Leasing revenue also decreased $13 million, or 41%, driven by lower income from terminated leases. 

Noninterest income for the first nine-month period of 2024 decreased $35 million, or 2%, from the year-ago period. Other noninterest income decreased $127 million, or 88%, primarily due to a $57 million gain on the sale of our RPS business and an $18 million favorable mark-to-market on pay-fixed swaptions recognized in the first nine-month period of 2023, and $19 million of contra-revenue related to premium costs and mark-to-market associated with credit risk transfer transactions recognized in the first nine-month period of 2024. Leasing revenue decreased $23 million, or 28%, driven by lower income on terminated leases and operating lease income. Partially offsetting these decreases, wealth and asset management revenue increased $29 million, or 12%, reflecting higher fixed annuity commissions and an increase in assets under management. Capital markets and advisory fees increased $28 million, or 16%, primarily due to higher underwriting fees. Payments and cash management revenue increased $23 million, or 5%, reflecting higher commercial treasury management and card transaction revenue. Customer deposit and loan fees increased $14 million, or 6%, primarily reflecting higher deposit fees. Mortgage banking income increased $13 million, or 15%, primarily reflecting increases in net servicing income and saleable spreads.

Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $1.1 billion, an increase of $40 million, or 4%, from the year-ago quarter. Personnel costs increased $62 million, or 10%, primarily due to higher salary, benefit, and incentive compensation expense. Outside data processing and other services increased $18 million, or 12%, reflecting higher technology and data expense. Partially offsetting these increases, other noninterest expense decreased $15 million, or 17%, largely due to a gain from the call of subordinated debt and lower franchise and other taxes, deposit and other insurance expense decreased $10 million, or 40%, primarily due to $7 million of expense reduction attributable to the FDIC DIF special assessment, and net occupancy expense decreased $10 million, or 15%, primarily due to a decrease in corporate real estate consolidation expense. 

Noninterest expense for the first nine-month period of 2024 increased $158 million, or 5%, from the year-ago period. Personnel costs increased $102 million, or 5%, primarily due to increases in salary, incentive compensation, and benefit expense, partially offset by a $31 million decrease in severance expense related to staffing efficiencies. Outside data processing increased $50 million, or 11%, primarily due to higher technology and data expense. Deposit and other insurance expense increased $26 million, or 38%, primarily due to $31 million of additional expense attributable to the FDIC DIF special assessment. Partially offsetting these increases, lease financing equipment depreciation expense decreased $10 million, or 45%. 

Provision for Income Taxes 

The provision for income taxes in the third quarter of 2024 was $116 million, compared to $136 million in the third quarter of 2023. The provision for income taxes for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was $308 million and $414 million, respectively. All periods included the benefits from general business credits, tax-exempt income, tax-exempt bank owned life insurance income, and investments in qualified affordable housing projects. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 and third quarter of 2023 was 18.2% and 19.7%, respectively. The effective tax rates for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were 17.8% and 19.4%, respectively. The variances between the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 related primarily to lower pretax income and capital losses. The variances between the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 related primarily to lower pretax income, stock-based compensation, and discrete tax benefits. 

The net federal deferred tax asset was $515 million, and the net state deferred tax asset was $80 million at September 30, 2024. 

We file income tax returns with the IRS and various state, city, and foreign jurisdictions. Federal income tax audits have been completed for tax years through 2016. Also, with few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations for tax years before 2019.

RISK MANAGEMENT AND CAPITAL 

Risk awareness, identification and assessment, reporting, and active management are key elements in overall risk management. Controls include, among others, effective segregation of duties, access management, and authorization and reconciliation procedures, as well as staff education and a disciplined assessment process. We use a multi-faceted approach to risk governance. It begins with the Board of Directors, which has defined our risk appetite as aggregate moderate-to-low, through-the-cycle. 

We classify / aggregate risk into seven risk pillars: credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance, strategic, and reputation. More information on risk can be found in Item 1A Risk Factors below, the Risk Factors section included in Item 1A of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. The MD&#38;A included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K should be read in conjunction with this MD&#38;A, as this discussion provides only material updates to the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. This MD&#38;A should also be read in conjunction with the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements , Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements , and other information contained in this report. Our definition, philosophy, and approach to risk management have not materially changed from the discussion presented in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Credit Risk 

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a counterparty is not able to meet the agreed upon terms of the financial obligation. The majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities, as the acceptance and management of credit risk is central to profitable lending. We also have credit risk associated with our investment securities portfolios (see Note 3 - &#8220; Investment Securities and Other Securities &#8221; of the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements). We engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing, asset and liability management, mortgage banking, and trading activities. A variety of derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, caps, swaptions, swaption collars, floors, forward contracts, and forward starting interest rate swaps, are used in asset and liability management activities to protect against the risk of adverse price or interest rate movements. We also use derivatives, principally loan sale commitments, in hedging our mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments and mortgage loans held for sale. While there is credit risk associated with derivative activity, we believe this exposure is minimal. 

We focus on the early identification, monitoring, and management of all aspects of our credit risk. In addition to the traditional credit risk mitigation strategies of credit policies and processes, market risk management activities, and portfolio diversification, we use quantitative measurement capabilities that utilize external data sources, enhanced modeling technology, and internal stress testing processes. Our disciplined portfolio management processes are central to our commitment to maintaining an aggregate moderate-to-low, through-the-cycle risk appetite. In our efforts to identify risk mitigation techniques, we have focused on product design features, origination policies, and solutions for delinquent or stressed borrowers. 

Loan and Lease Credit Exposure Mix 

Refer to the &#8220; Loan and Lease Credit Exposure Mix &#8221; section of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of each portfolio segment. 

2024 3Q Form 10-Q 15 

At September 30, 2024, our loans and leases totaled $126.4 billion, representing a $4.4 billion, or 4%, increase compared to $122.0 billion at December 31, 2023. 

The table below provides the composition of our total loan and lease portfolio:

Our loan and lease portfolio is a managed mix of consumer and commercial credits. We manage the overall credit exposure and portfolio composition via a credit concentration policy. The policy designates specific loan types, collateral types, and loan structures to be formally tracked and assigned maximum exposure limits as a percentage of capital. Commercial lending by NAICS categories, specific limits for CRE project types, loans secured by residential real estate, large dollar exposures, and designated high risk loan categories represent examples of specifically tracked components of our concentration management process. There are no identified concentrations that exceed the assigned exposure limit. Our concentration management policy is approved by the ROC and is used to ensure a high quality, well-diversified portfolio that is consistent with our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderate-to-low, through-the-cycle risk appetite. Changes to existing concentration limits, incorporating specific information relating to the potential impact on the overall portfolio composition and performance metrics, require the approval of the ROC prior to implementation.

Our CRE portfolio totaled $11.5 billion at September 30, 2024, a decrease of $879 million, or 7%, compared to December 31, 2023, driven by loan pay-offs and low demand for new originations. The CRE portfolio had an associated allowance coverage of 4.4% and 4.2% at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

With remote work options leading to increased vacancy rates and underutilization of office space across the country, the office sector continues to be an area of uncertainty. Our office portfolio, which is predominantly suburban and multi-tenant loans, totaled $1.6 billion, or 1% of total loans and leases, as of September 30, 2024, compared to $1.8 billion, or 1% of total loans and leases, at December 31, 2023. We have established ACL reserves of approximately 11% for our CRE office portfolio as of September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 10% at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, there was $31 million of outstanding balances in the office portfolio that were 30 or more days past due. 

Credit Quality 

(This section should be read in conjunction with Note 4 - &#8220; Loans and Leases &#8221; and Note 5 - &#8220; Allowance for Credit Losses &#8221; of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements.) 

We believe the most meaningful way to assess overall credit quality performance is through an analysis of specific performance ratios. This approach forms the basis of the discussion in the sections immediately following: NPAs, NALs, ACL, and NCOs. In addition, we utilize delinquency rates, risk distribution and migration patterns, product segmentation, and origination trends in the analysis of our credit quality performance. 

Credit quality performance in the third quarter of 2024 reflected NCOs of $93 million, or 0.30% of average total loans and leases, annualized, an increase of $20 million, compared to $73 million, or 0.24%, in the year-ago quarter. The increase reflects an $11 million increase in consumer NCOs to $39 million and a $9 million increase in commercial NCOs to $54 million in the third quarter of 2024. NPAs increased from December 31, 2023 by $73 million, or 10%, primarily driven by a $64 million increase in commercial and industrial NALs. 

NPAs and NALs 

Commercial loans and leases are placed on nonaccrual status at 90-days past due, or earlier if repayment of principal and interest is in doubt. Of the $549 million of commercial related NALs at September 30, 2024, $267 million, or 49%, represented loans and leases that were less than 30-days past due, demonstrating our continued commitment to proactive credit risk management.

ACL 

The baseline scenario used in the September 30, 2024 ACL determination assumes the labor market has softened with the unemployment rate peaking at 4.2% in the third quarter of this year. Marginal improvement is expected moving forward with unemployment returning to 4.0% by 2026. The Federal Reserve is projected to enter into a cycle of rate cuts, with regular cuts forecast throughout the remainder of 2024 through 2026 until reaching 3% by 2027. Inflation is forecasted to approach the Federal Reserve&#8217;s target level of 2% by the end of 2024 and stabilize in 2025. The GDP is forecasted to continue to slow from 1.8% in the third quarter to 1.5% by the end of 2024. GDP is then forecasted to show marginal improvement throughout 2025, ending the fourth quarter of 2025 at 1.7%. 

Management uses a probability-weighted approach that incorporates a baseline, an adverse, and a more favorable economic scenario when formulating the quantitative estimate for the allowance. The table below is intended to show how the forecasted path of unemployment and GDP in the baseline scenario has changed since the end of 2023: 

Table 12 - Forecasted Key Macroeconomic Variables 2023 2024 2025 Baseline scenario forecast Q4 Q2 Q4 Q2 Q4 Unemployment rate (1) 4Q 2023 3.8 % 3.9 % 4.0 % 4.1 % 4.0 % 3Q 2024 N/A N/A 4.1 4.1 4.1 Gross Domestic Product (1) 4Q 2023 0.8 % 1.2 % 1.5 % 1.9 % 2.2 % 3Q 2024 N/A N/A 1.5 1.7 1.7 

(1) Values reflect the baseline scenario forecast inputs for each period presented, not updated for subsequent actual amounts. 

Management continues to assess the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, including ongoing risks in the commercial real estate environment, current inflation levels, political uncertainty, and geopolitical instability, considering multiple macroeconomic forecasts that reflect a range of possible outcomes. While we have incorporated estimates of economic uncertainty into our ACL, the ultimate impact that specific challenges will have on the economy remains unknown, including those related to the commercial real estate industry, recent inflation levels, higher interest rates, and the significant conflicts on-going around the world.

Management develops additional analytics to support adjustments to our modeled results. Our Allowance for Credit Loss Development Methodology Committee reviewed model results of each economic scenario for appropriate usage, concluding that the quantitative transaction reserve will continue to utilize scenario weighting. Given the uncertainty associated with key economic scenario assumptions, the September 30, 2024 ACL included a general reserve that consists of various risk profile components, including profiles to capture uncertainty not addressed within the quantitative transaction reserve. 

Our ACL evaluation process includes the on-going assessment of credit quality metrics and a comparison of certain ACL benchmarks to current performance. 

The table below reflects the allocation of our ALLL among our various loan and lease categories as well as certain coverage metrics of the reported ALLL and ACL:

(1) Percentages represent the percentage of each loan and lease category to total loans and leases. 

The ACL was $2.4 billion, or 1.93% of total loans and leases, at September 30, 2024, compared to $2.4 billion, or 1.97% of total loans and leases, at December 31, 2023. The marginal absolute increase in the total ACL was driven by loan and lease portfolio growth during the first nine months of 2024. The reduction in the ACL coverage ratio at September 30, 2024 is reflective of the current macro-economic environment and changes in various risk profiles intended to capture uncertainty not addressed within the quantitative reserve.

2024 3Q Form 10-Q 21 

Market Risk 

Market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, including the correlation among these factors and their volatility. When the value of an instrument is tied to such external factors, the holder faces market risk. We are primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of offering a wide array of financial products to our customers and secondarily to price risk from trading securities, securities owned by our broker-dealer subsidiaries, foreign exchange positions, equity investments, and investments in securities backed by mortgage loans. 

We measure market risk exposure via financial simulation models, which provide management with insights on the potential impact to net interest income and other key metrics as a result of changes in market interest rates. Models are used to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of the balance sheet based on assumptions regarding the slope or shape of the yield curve, the direction and volatility of interest rates, and the changing composition and characteristics of the balance sheet resulting from strategic objectives and customer behavior. Our models incorporate market-based assumptions that include the impact of changing interest rates on prepayment rates of assets and runoff rates of deposits. The models also include our projections of the future volume and pricing of various business lines. 

In measuring the financial risks associated with interest rate sensitivity in our balance sheet, we compare a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using market forward rates. The market forward rates reflect the market consensus regarding the future level and slope of the yield curve across a range of tenor points. The standard set of interest rate scenarios includes two types: &#8220;shock&#8221; scenarios which are immediate parallel rate shifts, and &#8220;ramp&#8221; scenarios where the parallel shift is applied gradually over the first 12 months of the forecast on a pro rata basis. In both shock and ramp scenarios with falling rates, we presume that market rates will not go below 0%. The scenarios are inclusive of all executed interest rate risk hedging activities. Forward starting hedges are included to the extent that they have been transacted and that they start within the measurement horizon. 

A key driver of our interest rate risk profile is our interest-bearing deposit repricing sensitivity assumptions to changes in interest rates, otherwise known as deposit beta. In addition, our interest expense is impacted by the composition of both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits in relation to our total deposits. Accordingly, we consider the impacts from both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits on our total deposit beta. Our cumulative to-date total deposit beta (total cost of deposits) is 46% through the most recent rising rate cycle, which started in March 2022 and concluded in September 2024. 

We use two approaches to model interest rate risk: Net interest income at risk (NII at Risk) and economic value of equity at risk modeling sensitivity analysis (EVE at Risk). 

NII at Risk is used by management to measure the risk and impact to earnings over the next 12 months, using a variety of interest rate scenarios. The NII at Risk results included in the table below reflect the analysis used monthly by management. It models gradual &#8220;ramp&#8221; -200, -100, +100 and +200 basis point parallel shift scenarios, implied by the forward yield curve over the next 12 months.

22 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

The NII at Risk shows that the balance sheet is asset sensitive at both September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. T he primary drivers to the change in sensitivity include current and projected balance sheet composition over the simulation horizon, including longer securities portfolio reinvestment duration and executed hedging activity. 

EVE at Risk is used by management to measure the impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities, including derivative exposures. The EVE results included in the table below reflect the analysis used monthly by management. It models immediate -200, -100, +100 and +200 basis point parallel &#8220;shock&#8221; scenarios from the yield curve term points at the specific point in time that EVE sensitivity is measured. 

Table 16 - Economic Value of Equity at Risk &#160; Economic Value of Equity at Risk (%) Basis point change scenario -200 -100 +100 +200 At September 30, 2024 -2.6 % 0.7 % -3.6 % -9.2 % At December 31, 2023 0.1 1.6 -3.8 -8.8 

The change in sensitivity from December 31, 2023 was driven primarily by market rates, ongoing balance sheet modeling assumption enhancements, such as updated credit spread discounting methodology and BOLI sensitivity measurement, and changes to actual balance sheet composition. 

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk 

An integral component of our interest rate risk management strategy is the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates. A variety of derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, caps, swaptions, swaption collars, floors, forward contracts, and forward starting interest rate swaps, are used in asset and liability management activities to protect against the risk of adverse price or interest rate movements. 

Table 17 shows all swap and floor positions that are utilized for purposes of managing our exposures to the variability of interest rates. The interest rate variability may impact either the fair value of the assets and liabilities or impact the cash flows attributable to net interest margin. These positions are used to protect the fair value of asset and liabilities by converting the contractual interest rate on a specified amount of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. The positions are also used to hedge the variability in cash flows attributable to the contractually specified interest rate by converting the variable rate index into a fixed rate. The volume, maturity, and mix of derivative positions change frequently as we adjust our broader interest rate risk management objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For further information, including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives, refer to Note 13 - &#8220; Derivative Financial Instruments &#8221; of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements.

Use of Derivatives to Manage Credit Risk 

We may utilize credit derivatives as a tool to manage credit risk within the portfolio by purchasing credit protection over certain types of loan products. When we purchase credit protection, such as a CDS, we pay a fee to the seller, or CDS counterparty, in return for the right to receive a payment if a specified credit event occurs.

MSRs 

(This section should be read in conjunction with Note 6 - &#8220; Mortgage Loan Sales and Servicing Rights &#8221; of Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements .) 

At September 30, 2024, we had a total of $515 million of capitalized MSRs representing the right to service $33.6 billion in mortgage loans. 

MSR fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans, which can be reduced by prepayments and declines in credit quality. Prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise. We also employ hedging strategies to reduce the risk of MSR fair value changes or impairment. However, volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these economic hedges. We report changes in the MSR value net of hedge-related trading activity in the mortgage banking income category of noninterest income. 

MSR assets are included in servicing rights and other intangible assets in the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Price Risk 

Price risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in the prices of financial instruments that are carried at fair value and are subject to fair value accounting. We have price risk from trading securities, securities owned by our broker-dealer subsidiaries, foreign exchange positions, derivative instruments, and equity investments. We have established loss limits on the trading portfolio, on the amount of foreign exchange exposure that can be maintained, and on the amount of marketable equity securities that can be held. 

Liquidity Risk 

Liquidity risk is the possibility of us being unable to meet current and future financial obligations in a timely manner. The goal of liquidity management is to ensure adequate, stable, reliable, and cost-effective sources of funds to satisfy changes in loan and lease demand, unexpected levels of deposit withdrawals, investment opportunities, and other contractual obligations. We consider core earnings, strong capital ratios, and credit quality essential for maintaining high credit ratings, which allows us cost-effective access to market-based liquidity. We mitigate liquidity risk by maintaining liquid assets in the form of cash, cash equivalents, and securities. In addition, we maintain a large, stable core deposit base and a diversified base of readily available wholesale funding sources, including secured funding sources from the FHLB and Federal Reserve through pledged borrowing capacity, issuance through dealers in the capital markets, and access to certificates of deposit issued through brokers. 

The Board of Directors is responsible for establishing an acceptable level of liquidity risk at Huntington, including approval of the liquidity risk appetite at least annually. The liquidity risk appetite includes certain structural and contingent liquidity risk metrics and limits that are designed and monitored to ensure Huntington maintains adequate liquidity to meet current and future funding needs, including during periods of potential stress. Further, the Board receives and reviews information on at least a semi-annual basis to ensure Huntington is operating in accordance with its established risk tolerance. 

Liquidity risk is reviewed and managed continuously for the Bank and the parent company, as well as its subsidiaries. In addition, liquidity working groups meet regularly to identify and monitor liquidity positions, provide policy guidance, review funding strategies, and oversee the adherence to, and maintenance of, contingency funding plans. At September 30, 2024, management believes current sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet Huntington&#8217;s on and off-balance sheet obligations. 

2024 3Q Form 10-Q 25 

We maintain a contingency funding plan that provides for liquidity stress testing, which assesses the potential erosion of funds in the event of an institution-specific event or systemic financial market crisis. Examples of institution specific events could include a downgrade in our public credit rating by a rating agency, a large charge to earnings, declines in profitability or other financial measures, declines in liquidity sources including reductions in deposit balances or access to contingent funding sources, or a significant merger or acquisition. Examples of systemic events unrelated to us that could have an effect on our access to liquidity would be terrorism or war, natural disasters, political events, failure of a major financial institution, or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund, or hedge fund. Similarly, market speculation or rumors about us, or the banking industry in general, may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources. The contingency funding plan, which is reviewed and approved by the ROC at least annually, outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis and provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions. It also assigns specific roles and responsibilities and communication protocols for effectively managing liquidity through a problem period and outlines early warning indicators that are used to monitor emerging liquidity stress events. 

Our largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is core deposits, which provide stable and lower-cost funding. Core deposits were $151.3 billion at September 30, 2024, which comprised 96% of total deposits, compared to $145.5 billion, and 96% of total deposits, at December 31, 2023. The $5.8 billion, or 4%, increase in core deposits, compared to December 31, 2023 was primarily driven by an increase in money market deposits. Our core deposits come from a base of primary bank customer relationships, and we continue to focus on acquiring and deepening those relationships resulting in our granular and diversified deposit base. 

Non-core deposits consist primarily of brokered money market balances. Non-core deposits were $7.1 billion, or 4% of total deposits, at September 30, 2024, compared to $5.8 billion, or 4% of total deposits, at December 31, 2023. Non-core deposits were below our established liquidity risk metric limits at September 30, 2024. 

Insured deposits comprised approximately 69% and 70% of our total deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

(2) Represents consolidated Huntington uninsured deposits, determined by adjusting the amounts reported in the Bank Call Report (FFIEC 031) by inter-company deposits, which are not customer deposits and are therefore eliminated through consolidation. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank Call Report estimated uninsured deposit balance was $53.3 billion, which includes $4.6 billion of inter-company deposits. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank Call Report estimated uninsured deposit balance was $49.8 billion, which includes $4.6 billion of inter-company deposits. 

26 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

Cash and cash equivalents were $12.6 billion and $10.1 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The $2.5 billion increase in cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to an increase in interest-bearing deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank to support short-term liquidity. 

Our investment securities portfolio is evaluated under established ALCO objectives. Changing market conditions could affect the profitability of the portfolio, as well as the level of interest rate risk exposure. 

Total investment securities were $44.6 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $41.2 billion at December 31, 2023. The $3.5 billion increase in securities compared to December 31, 2023, was primarily due to increased investment in U.S. Treasury securities. At September 30, 2024, the duration of the investment securities portfolio was 4.3 years, or 3.7 years net of hedging. Securities are pledged to secure borrowing capacity with the FHLB and the Federal Reserve, discussed further in the Bank Liquidity and Sources of Funding section below. At September 30, 2024, investment securities with a market value of $7.2 billion were unpledged. 

Sources of wholesale funding include non-core deposits (other domestic deposits of $250,000 or more, negotiable CDs, brokered and other deposits), short-term borrowings, and long-term debt. Our wholesale funding totaled $23.6 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $18.8 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase from year end is primarily due to increases in FHLB borrowings and collateralized borrowings. 

Bank Liquidity and Sources of Funding 

Our primary sources of funding for the Bank are consumer and commercial core deposits. At September 30, 2024, these core deposits funded 75% of total assets (120% of total loans and leases). To the extent we are unable to obtain sufficient liquidity through core deposits and cash and cash equivalents, we may meet our liquidity needs through sources of wholesale funding and asset securitization or sale. 

The Bank maintains borrowing capacity at both the FHLB and the Federal Reserve secured by pledged loans and securities. The Bank does not consider borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve a primary source of funding; however, it could be used as a potential source of liquidity in a stressed environment or during a market disruption. At September 30, 2024, the Bank&#8217;s available contingent borrowing capacity at the FHLB and Federal Reserve totaled $82.2 billion, compared to $83.0 billion at December 31, 2023. The amount of available contingent borrowing capacity may fluctuate based on the level of borrowings outstanding and level of assets pledged. 

At September 30, 2024, we believe the Bank has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its cash flow obligations over the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. 

Parent Company Liquidity 

The parent company&#8217;s funding requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders, debt service, income taxes, operating expenses, funding of nonbank subsidiaries, repurchases of our stock, and acquisitions. The parent company obtains funding to meet obligations from dividends and interest received from the Bank, interest and dividends received from direct subsidiaries, net taxes collected from subsidiaries included in the federal consolidated tax return, fees for services provided to subsidiaries, and the issuance of debt securities. 

The parent company had cash and cash equivalents of $4.2 billion and $4.0 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

On October 16, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.155 per common share. The dividend is payable on January 2, 2025, to shareholders of record on December 18, 2024. Based on the current quarterly dividend of $0.155 per common share, cash demands required for common stock dividends are estimated to be approximately $225 million per quarter. Additionally, on October 16, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly Series B, Series F, Series G, Series H, and Series J Preferred Stock dividend payable on January 15, 2025 to shareholders of record on January 1, 2025. On September 11, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend for the Series I Preferred Stock payable on December 2, 2024 to shareholders of record on November 15, 2024. Total cash demands required for preferred stock dividends are expected to be approximately $27 million per quarter. 

2024 3Q Form 10-Q 27 

During the first nine months of 2024, the Bank paid common and preferred dividends to the parent company of $1.8 billion and $34 million, respectively. To meet any additional liquidity needs, the parent company may issue debt or equity securities. To support the parent company&#8217;s ability to issue debt or equity securities, we have filed with the SEC an automatic registration statement covering an indeterminate amount or number of securities to be offered or sold from time to time as authorized by Huntington&#8217;s Board of Directors. 

At September 30, 2024, we believe the Company has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its cash flow obligations over the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. 

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 

In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations and commitments that could impact our liquidity and capital resources. These arrangements include commitments to extend credit, interest rate swaps, floors, financial guarantees contained in standby letters-of-credit issued by the Bank, commitments by the Bank to sell mortgage loans, operating lease payments, and other purchase and marketing obligations. 

Operational Risk 

Operational risk is the risk of loss due to human error, third-party performance failures, or inadequate or failed internal systems and controls, including the use of financial or other quantitative methodologies that may not adequately predict future results; violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards; and external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, failed business contingency plans, and security risks. We continuously strive to test and strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with significant contracts, agreements, laws, rules, and regulations, and to reduce our exposure to fraud and improve the oversight of our operational risk. 

To govern operational risks, we have an Operational Risk Committee, a Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance Committee, a Funds Movement Committee, a Fraud Risk Committee, an Information and Technology Risk Committee, and a Third Party Risk Management Committee. The responsibilities of these committees, among other duties, include establishing and maintaining management information systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential concerns, risks, or trends that may have a significant impact, and ensuring that recommendations are developed to address the identified issues. In addition, we have a Model Risk Oversight Committee that is responsible for policies and procedures describing how model risk is evaluated and managed and the application of the governance process to implement these practices throughout the enterprise. These committees report any significant findings and remediation recommendations to the Risk Management Committee. Potential concerns may be escalated to our ROC and our Audit Committee, as appropriate. 

The goal of this framework is to implement effective operational risk-monitoring; minimize operational, fraud, and legal losses; minimize the impact of inadequately designed models; and enhance our overall performance. 

Cybersecurity 

Cybersecurity represents an important component of Huntington&#8217;s overall cross-functional approach to risk management. We actively manage a cybersecurity operation designed to detect, contain, and respond to cybersecurity threats and incidents in a prompt and effective manner with the goal of minimizing disruptions to our business. We actively monitor cyberattacks, such as attempts related to online deception and loss of sensitive customer data. We evaluate our technology, processes, and controls to mitigate loss from cyberattacks and, to date, have not experienced any material losses. Cybersecurity threats continue to evolve and increase across the entire digital landscape. We actively monitor our environment for malicious content and implement specific cybersecurity and fraud capabilities, including the monitoring of phishing email campaigns. In addition, we have implemented specific cybersecurity and fraud monitoring of remote connections by geography and volume of connections to detect anomalous remote logins, since a significant portion of our workforce has the option to work remotely. 

28 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

Our objective for managing cybersecurity risk is to avoid or minimize the impacts of both internal and external threat events or other efforts to penetrate our systems. We work to achieve this objective by hardening networks and systems against attack, and by diligently managing visibility and monitoring controls within our data and communications environment to recognize events and respond before an attacker has the opportunity to plan and execute on their objectives. To this end, we employ a set of defense-in-depth strategies, which include efforts to make us less attractive as a target and less vulnerable to threats, while investing in threat analytic capabilities for rapid detection and response. Potential concerns related to cybersecurity may be escalated to our Board-level ROC and / or Technology Committee, as appropriate. 

As a complement to the overall cybersecurity risk management, we use a number of internal training methods, both formally through mandatory courses and informally through written communications and other updates, to ensure awareness of the risks of cybersecurity threats at all levels across the organization. Internal policies and procedures have been implemented to encourage the reporting of potential phishing attacks or other security risks. We use third-party services to test the effectiveness of our cybersecurity risk management framework and controls. We also require third-party vendors to comply with our policies regarding information security and confidentiality. 

Compliance Risk 

Financial institutions are subject to many laws, rules, and regulations at both the federal and state levels. These broad-based laws, rules, and regulations include, but are not limited to, expectations relating to anti-money laundering, lending limits, client privacy, fair lending, prohibitions against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices, protections for military members as they enter active duty, and community reinvestment. The volume and complexity of recent regulatory changes have increased our overall compliance risk. As such, we utilize various resources to help ensure expectations are met, including a team of compliance experts dedicated to ensuring our conformance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Our colleagues receive training for several broad-based laws and regulations including, but not limited to, anti-money laundering and customer privacy. Additionally, colleagues engaged in lending activities receive training for laws and regulations related to flood disaster protection, equal credit opportunity, fair lending, and/or other courses related to the extension of credit. We hold ourselves to a high standard for adherence to compliance management and seek to continuously enhance our performance. 

Capital 

Our primary capital objective is to maintain appropriate levels of capital within our Board-approved risk appetite to support the Bank&#8217;s operations, absorb unanticipated losses and declines in asset values, and provide protection to uninsured depositors and debt holders in the event of liquidation, while also funding organic growth and providing appropriate returns to our shareholders. Both regulatory capital and shareholders&#8217; equity are managed at the Bank and on a consolidated basis. We have an active program for managing capital and maintain a comprehensive process for assessing our overall capital adequacy, including the monitoring and reporting of capital risk metrics to the Board and ROC that we believe are useful for evaluating capital adequacy and making capital decisions. In addition to as-reported regulatory capital and tangible common equity metrics, we also actively monitor other measures of capital, such as tangible common equity including the mark-to-market impact on HTM securities and CET1 inclusive of AOCI excluding cash flow hedges. We believe our current levels of both regulatory capital and shareholders&#8217; equity are adequate. 

2024 3Q Form 10-Q 29 

The following table presents certain regulatory capital data at the consolidated and Bank level: 

Table 19 - Regulatory Capital Data (1) (dollar amounts in millions) &#160; At September 30, 2024 At December 31, 2023 Total risk-weighted assets Consolidated $ 142,543 $ 138,706 Bank 141,861 138,462 CET1 risk-based capital Consolidated 14,803 14,212 Bank 14,427 14,671 Tier 1 risk-based capital Consolidated 17,207 16,616 Bank 15,636 15,879 Tier 2 risk-based capital Consolidated 2,903 3,042 Bank 2,104 2,247 Total risk-based capital Consolidated 20,110 19,657 Bank 17,741 18,126 CET1 risk-based capital ratio Consolidated 10.4 % 10.2 % Bank 10.2 10.6 Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio Consolidated 12.1 12.0 Bank 11.0 11.5 Total risk-based capital ratio Consolidated 14.1 14.2 Bank 12.5 13.1 Tier 1 leverage ratio Consolidated 8.8 9.3 Bank 8.0 8.5 

(1) Huntington elected to temporarily delay certain effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period which began January 1, 2022 pursuant to a rule that allows bank holding companies and banks to delay for two years 100% of the day-one impact of adopting CECL and 25% of the cumulative change in the reported allowance for credit losses since adopting CECL. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we have phased in 75% and 50%, respectively, of the cumulative CECL deferral with the remaining impact to be recognized through the first quarter of 2025. 

At September 30, 2024, we, at both the consolidated and Bank level, maintained Basel III capital ratios in excess of the well-capitalized standards established by the Federal Reserve. Consolidated CET1 risk-based capital ratio increased to 10.4%, compared to the prior year end of 10.2%, due primarily to current period earnings, net of dividends, partially offset by an increase in risk-weighted assets and a reduction in the CECL transitional amount. The increase in risk-weighted assets was driven by loan growth, partially offset by the impact of the CLN transaction. 

We are authorized to make capital distributions that are consistent with the requirements in the Federal Reserve&#8217;s capital rule, inclusive of the SCB requirement. Effective for the period October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024, our SCB requirement was 3.2%. On April 5, 2024, we submitted our 2024 Capital Plan to the Federal Reserve for supervisory review. By notice dated June 26, 2024, the Federal Reserve informed us that our indicative SCB requirement associated with our 2024 Capital Plan is 2.5%, effective for the period October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025. 

Shareholders&#8217; Equity 

We generate shareholders&#8217; equity primarily through the retention of earnings, net of dividends, and share repurchases. Other potential sources of shareholders&#8217; equity include issuances of common and preferred stock. Our objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with our risk appetite and risk tolerance objectives, to meet both regulatory and market expectations, and to provide the flexibility needed for future growth and business opportunities. 

Shareholders&#8217; equity totaled $20.6 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of $1.3 billion, when compared with December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by earnings, net of dividends, and an improvement in accumulated other comprehensive income driven by changes in interest rates. 

30 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

Share Repurchases 

From time to time, our Board of Directors authorizes the Company to repurchase shares of our common stock. Although we announce when our Board authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. Future stock repurchases may be private or open-market repurchases, including block transactions, accelerated or delayed block transactions, forward transactions, and similar transactions. Various factors determine the amount and timing of our share repurchases, including our capital requirements, the number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions, market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and regulatory and legal considerations. 

On January 18, 2023, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of common shares within the eight quarter period ending December 31, 2024, subject to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s capital regulations. Purchases of common stock under the authorization may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, and accelerated share repurchase programs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased no shares of common stock under the current repurchase authorization. As part of the 2024 Capital Plan and our current expectation that organic capital will be used for funding loan and lease growth and proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements, we do not expect to utilize the share repurchase program through 2024. However, we may at our discretion resume share repurchases at any time while considering factors including, but not limited to, capital requirements and market conditions. 

BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION 

Overview 

Our business segments are based on our internally-aligned segment leadership structure, which is how management monitors results and assesses performance. We have two business segments: Consumer &#38; Regional Banking and Commercial Banking. The Treasury / Other function includes technology and operations, and other unallocated assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense. 

Business segment results are determined based upon our management practices, which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments. The process is designed around our organizational and management structure and, accordingly, the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions. 

Revenue Sharing 

Revenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service. Fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to or providing service to customers. Results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocations. 

Expense Allocation 

The management process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments. Expenses are allocated to business segments using a two-phase approach. The first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs (activity-based costs) to activities related to product origination and servicing. These activity-based costs are then extended, based on volumes, with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products. The second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to the business segments from Treasury / Other. We utilize a full-allocation methodology, where all Treasury / Other expenses, except reported acquisition-related expenses, if any, and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses, are allocated to the business segments. 

2024 3Q Form 10-Q 31 

Funds Transfer Pricing (FTP) 

We use an active and centralized FTP methodology to attribute appropriate net interest income to the business segments. The intent of the FTP methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing modeled duration funding of assets and liabilities. The result is to centralize the financial impact, management, and reporting of interest rate risk in the Treasury / Other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed. The Treasury / Other function charges (credits) an internal cost of funds for assets held in (or pays for funding provided by) each business segment. The FTP rate is based on prevailing market interest rates for comparable duration assets (or liabilities). The primary components of the FTP rate include a base (market) rate, a liquidity premium, and option cost. 

Net Income by Business Segment 

Net income by business segment is presented in the following table.

Consumer &#38; Regional Banking reported net income of $1.1 billion in the nine-month period of 2024, an increase of $132 million, or 14%, compared to the year-ago period. Segment net interest income increased $268 million, or 10%, primarily due to a $3.5 billion, or 5%, increase in average loans and leases and a 16 basis point increase in NIM. Provision for credit losses increased $35 million, or 18%, primarily driven by an increase in charge-off activity compared to the year-ago period. Noninterest income increased $15 million, or 2%, primarily due to increases in wealth and asset management revenue, reflecting higher fixed income commissions and assets under management, payments and cash management revenue, reflecting higher card transaction revenue, mortgage banking income, and customer deposit and loan fees, partially offset by a $57 million gain on the sale of our RPS business recognized in the nine-month period of 2023. Noninterest expense increased $81 million, or 4%, primarily due to the allocation of higher indirect expenses.

Commercial Banking reported net income of $853 million in the first nine-month period of 2024, a decrease of $82 million, o r 9%, compared to the year-ago period. Segment net interest income decreased $58 million, or 4%, primarily due to a $1.1 billion, or 2%, decrease in average loans and leases and an 8 basis point decrease in NIM driven primarily by higher deposit rates. Noninterest income increased $11 million, or 2%, primarily due to increases in capital markets and advisory fees, commitment and other loan fees, and payment and cash management fees, partially offset by a decrease in leasing revenue. Noninterest expense increased $53 million, or 6%, primarily due to higher personnel expense reflecting an investment in teams related to expansion across new geographies and industry verticals, higher incentive compensation mainly due to increased capital markets and advisory fees, and higher allocation of indirect expenses. Outside data and other processing services expense also increased, primarily due to increased capital markets activity. 

Treasury / Other 

The Treasury / Other function includes revenue and expense related to assets, liabilities, derivatives, and equity not directly assigned or allocated to one of the business segments. Assets include investment securities and bank owned life insurance. 

Net interest income includes the impact of administering our investment securities portfolios, the net impact of derivatives used to hedge interest rate sensitivity as well as the financial impact associated with our FTP methodology, as described above. Noninterest income includes miscellaneous fee income not allocated to other business segments, such as bank owned life insurance income and securities and trading asset gains or losses. Noninterest expense includes certain corporate administrative, acquisition-related expenses, if any, and other miscellaneous expenses not allocated to other business segments. The provision for income taxes for the business segments is calculated at a statutory 21% tax rate, although our overall effective tax rate is lower. 

Treasury / Other reported a net loss of $541 million in the first nine-month period of 2024, an increase in net loss of $348 million, compared to the year-ago period, driven by a decrease net interest income, partially offset by an increase in provision benefit for income taxes. Net interest income decreased $383 million primarily due to a higher cost of funds. Provision benefit for income taxes increased $120 million primarily due to lower pre-tax income.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

This document contains GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures where management believes it to be helpful in understanding our results of operations or financial position. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found herein. 

Fully-Taxable Equivalent Basis 

Interest income, yields, and ratios on an FTE basis are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes net interest income on an FTE basis provides an insightful picture of the interest margin for comparison purposes. The FTE basis also allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The FTE basis assumes a federal statutory tax rate of 21%. We encourage readers to consider the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information contained in this Form 10-Q in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

34 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

Non-Regulatory Capital Ratios 

In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including tangible common equity to tangible assets. 

Non-regulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of non-regulatory capital ratios allows readers to compare our capitalization to other financial services companies. These ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes goodwill and other intangible assets, the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies. These ratios are not defined in GAAP or federal banking regulations. As a result, non-regulatory capital ratios disclosed by the Company are considered non-GAAP financial measures. 

Because there are no standardized definitions for non-regulatory capital ratios, the Company&#8217;s calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies. Also, there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, we encourage readers to consider the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information contained in this Form 10-Q in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates 

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 1 - &#8220;Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as supplemented by this report including this MD&#38;A, describes the significant accounting policies we used in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

An accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time, and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates. Our critical accounting policies include the allowance for credit losses and goodwill. The policies, assumptions, and judgments related to goodwill are described in the Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates section within the MD&#38;A of Huntington&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following details the policies, assumption, and judgments related to the allowance for credit losses. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

Our ACL at September 30, 2024 represents our current estimate of the lifetime credit losses expected from our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded lending commitments. Management estimates the ACL by projecting probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default conditional on economic parameters, for the remaining contractual term. Internal factors that impact the quarterly allowance estimate include the level of outstanding balances, the portfolio performance, and assigned risk ratings. We utilize statistically-based models that employ assumptions about current and future economic conditions throughout the contractual life of our loan portfolio. As part of our model risk oversight, we perform ongoing monitoring of model performance to assess modeling approaches and identify potential model enhancements, which may result in updates to our statistically-based models from time-to-time. 

One of the most significant judgments influencing the ACL estimate is the macroeconomic forecasts. Key external economic parameters that directly impact our loss modeling framework include forecasted unemployment rates and GDP. Changes in the economic forecasts could significantly affect the estimated credit losses, which could potentially lead to materially different allowance levels from one reporting period to the next. 

Given the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables within our modeling framework, it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the allowance. As a result, management uses a probability-weighted approach that incorporates a baseline, an adverse, and a more favorable economic scenario when formulating the quantitative estimate. 

2024 3Q Form 10-Q 35 

However, to illustrate a hypothetical sensitivity analysis, management calculated a quantitative allowance using a 100% weighting applied to an adverse scenario. This scenario contemplates elevated interest rates weakening credit-sensitive consumer spending and confidence much more than expected in the baseline scenario. Concerns about the banking industry uncertainty also impact consumer confidence and causes banks to tighten lending standards. Increased geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan briefly impact the supply chain for semiconductors and the threat of a wider conflict causes consumer confidence to fall. Additionally, the Russian invasion of Ukraine lasts longer than in the baseline scenario and concerns increase around the current conflict in the Middle East leading to a broader war in the region. The combination of still elevated interest rates, political tensions, and tightening lending standards cause the stock market to fall. The economy falls into a recession in the fourth quarter of 2024. In response to the recession, the Federal Reserve cuts the federal funds rate aggressively with rates significantly below the baseline forecast starting in the first quarter of 2025. Under this scenario, as an example, the unemployment rate increases from baseline levels and remains elevated for a prolonged period, the rate is estimated at 5.9% and 8.0% at the end of 2024 and 2025, respectively. This represents unemployment rates that are approximately 1.8% and 3.9% higher than baseline scenario projections of 4.1% for both of the respective time periods. 

To demonstrate the sensitivity to key economic parameters used in the calculation of our ACL at September 30, 2024, management calculated the difference between our quantitative ACL and this 100% adverse scenario. Excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments, this sensitivity analysis would result in a hypothetical increase in our ACL of approximately $0.8 billion at September 30, 2024. 

The resulting difference is not intended to represent an expected increase in allowance levels for a number of reasons including the following: 

&#8226; Management uses a weighted approach applied to multiple economic scenarios for its allowance estimation process; 

&#8226; The highly uncertain economic environment; 

&#8226; The difficulty in predicting the inter-relationships between the economic parameters used in the various economic scenarios; and 

&#8226; The sensitivity estimate does not account for any general reserve components and associated risk profile adjustments incorporated by management as part of its overall allowance framework. 

We regularly review our ACL for appropriateness by performing on-going evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio. In doing so, we consider factors such as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the financial condition of specific borrowers, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or other documented support. We also evaluate the impact of changes in key economic parameters and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our ACL at each reporting date. There is no certainty that our ACL will be appropriate over time to cover losses in our portfolio as economic and market conditions may ultimately differ from our reasonable and supportable forecast. Additionally, events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, or our markets such as geopolitical instability or risks of elevated interest rates for longer including a near-term recession, could severely impact our current expectations. If the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates or the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes materially, our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which, in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The extent to which the geopolitical instability and risks of elevated interest rates for longer will continue to negatively impact our businesses, financial condition, liquidity, and results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be forecasted with precision at this time. For more information, see Note 4 - &#8220;Loans and Leases&#8221; and Note 5 - &#8220;Allowance For Credit Losses&#8221; of the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements.

Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements 

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

The accompanying interim Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of Huntington reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the consolidated financial position, the results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented. These interim Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared according to the rules and regulations of the SEC and, therefore, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted. The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which include descriptions of significant accounting policies, as updated by the information contained in this report, should be read in conjunction with these interim financial statements. 

In conjunction with applicable accounting standards, all material subsequent events have been either recognized in the interim Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements or disclosed in the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. There were no material subsequent events to disclose for the current period.

There were no securities of a single issuer, which were not governmental or government-sponsored, that exceeded 10% of shareholders&#8217; equity at either September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, all HTM debt securities are comprised of securities issued by government sponsored entities or are explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government. In addition, there were no HTM debt securities considered past due at September 30, 2024. 

Based on an evaluation of available information including security type, counterparty credit quality, past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that are relevant to collectability of cash flows, as of September 30, 2024, Huntington has concluded that, except for one municipal bond classified as an AFS debt security for which $ 2 million of write-downs were recognized during 2024, it expects to receive all contractual cash flows from each security held in its AFS and HTM debt securities portfolio. There was no allowance related to investment securities as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

Credit Quality Indicators 

See Note 5 - &#8220;Loans and Leases&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the credit quality indicators Huntington utilizes for monitoring credit quality and for determining an appropriate ACL level. 

For all classes within the consumer loan portfolios, borrower credit bureau scores are monitored as an indicator of credit quality. A credit bureau score is a credit score developed by FICO based on data provided by the credit bureaus. The credit bureau score is widely accepted as the standard measure of consumer credit risk used by lenders, regulators, rating agencies, and consumers. The higher the credit bureau score, the higher likelihood of repayment and therefore, an indicator of higher credit quality. 

2024 3Q Form 10-Q 51 

Huntington assesses the risk in the loan portfolio by utilizing numerous risk characteristics. The classifications described above, and also presented in the table below, represent one of those characteristics that are closely monitored in the overall credit risk management processes. 

The following tables present the amortized cost basis of loans and leases by vintage and credit quality indicator.

At September 30, 2024, the ACL was $ 2.4 billion, an increase of $ 36 million driven by loan and lease portfolio growth compared to December 31, 2023. The commercial ACL was $ 1.6 billion at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The consumer ACL was $ 798 million at September 30, 2024 and $ 771 million at December 31, 2023. 

The baseline economic scenario used in the September 30, 2024 ACL determination projected the Federal Reserve to have entered into a cycle of rate cuts, with regular cuts forecast throughout the remainder of 2024 through 2026 until reaching a federal funds rate of 3% by 2027. Inflation is forecasted to approach the Federal Reserve&#8217;s target level of 2% by the end of 2024. Unemployment is projected to have peaked at 4.2% in the third quarter of 2024. Marginal improvement is expected with unemployment returning to 4.0% by 2026. 

The economic scenarios used included elevated levels of uncertainty including the impact of specific challenges in the commercial real estate Industry, recent inflation levels, the U.S. labor market, the expected path of interest rate changes by the Federal Reserve, and the impact of significant conflicts on-going around the world. Given the uncertainty associated with key economic scenario assumptions, the September 30, 2024 ACL included a general reserve that consists of various risk profile components to address uncertainty not measured within the quantitative transaction reserve.

One note class bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.153 % and the remaining four note classes bear interest at SOFR plus a spread rate that ranges from 1.40 % to 8.25 % (weighted average spread of 3.04 %). As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average contractual interest rate on the CLNs was 6.98 %. Huntington has elected the fair value option for these notes. See Note 12 - &#8220; Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities &#8221; for additional information. To the extent losses exceed certain thresholds, the principal and interest payable on the notes may be reduced by a portion of the Company's aggregate net losses on the reference pool of loans, with losses allocated to note classes in reverse order of payment priority.

10. EARNINGS PER SHARE 

Basic earnings per share is the amount of earnings (adjusted for preferred stock dividends and the impact of preferred stock repurchases and redemptions) available to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share is the amount of earnings available to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period adjusted to include the effect of potentially dilutive common shares. Potentially dilutive common shares include incremental shares issued for stock options, restricted stock units and awards, and distributions from deferred compensation plans. Potentially dilutive common shares are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in periods in which the effect would be antidilutive.

11. REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS 

Revenue is segregated based on the nature of product and services offered as part of contractual arrangements. Certain sources of revenue are recognized within interest or fee income and are outside of the scope of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (&#8220;ASC 606&#8221;). Other sources of revenue fall within the scope of ASC 606 and are generally recognized within noninterest income. These revenues are included within various sections of the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table shows Huntington&#8217;s total noninterest income segregated between revenue with contracts with customers within the scope of ASC 606 and revenue within the scope of other GAAP Topics.

The following table illustrates the disaggregation by operating segment and major revenue stream and reconciles disaggregated revenue to segment revenue presented in Note 16 - &#8220; Segment Reporting &#8221;. During the fourth quarter of 2023 we updated the presentation of our noninterest income categories to align product and service types more closely with how we strategically manage our business. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2023, we completed an organizational realignment and now report on two business segments. Prior period results for each reporting update have been adjusted to conform to the current presentation.

2024 3Q Form 10-Q 65 

Huntington generally provides services for customers in which it acts as principal. Payment terms and conditions vary amongst services and customers, and thus impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition. Some fees may be paid before any service is rendered and accordingly, such fees are deferred until the obligations pertaining to those fees are satisfied. Most Huntington contracts with customers are cancelable by either party without penalty or they are short-term in nature, with a contract duration of less than one year. Accordingly, most revenue deferred for the reporting period ended September 30, 2024 is expected to be earned within one year. Huntington does not have significant balances of contract assets or contract liabilities and any change in those balances during the reporting period ended September 30, 2024 was determined to be immaterial. 

12. FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES 

See Note 19 - &#8220;Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, with the exception of the below described long-term debt elected to be accounted for at fair value. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value rarely transfer between Level 1 and Level 2 measurements. There were no such transfers during the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

In the second quarter of 2024, Huntington elected the fair value option for CLNs structured as long-term debt. CLNs are classified as Level 2 using quoted prices for similar liabilities in active markets, quoted prices of similar liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs that are observable for the assets, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

The following tables present a rollforward of the balance sheet amounts measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 3. The classification of an item as Level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, Level 3 measurements may also include observable components of value that can be validated externally. Accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology.

Assets and Liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 

Certain assets and liabilities may be required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods subsequent to their initial recognition. These assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis; however, they are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, for example, when there is evidence of impairment. The gains (losses) represent the amounts recorded during the period regardless of whether the asset is still held at period end. 

The amounts measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were as follows:

Huntington records nonrecurring adjustments of collateral-dependent loans held for investment. Such amounts are generally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral supporting the loan. Appraisals are generally obtained to support the fair value of the collateral and incorporate measures such as recent sales prices for comparable properties and cost of construction. Periodically, in cases where the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the collateral less cost to sell, an impairment charge is recognized in the form of a charge-off.

(1) Certain disclosures related to quantitative level 3 fair value measurements do not include those deemed to be immaterial. 

The following provides a general description of the impact of a change in an unobservable input on the fair value measurement and the interrelationship between unobservable inputs, where relevant/significant. Interrelationships may also exist between observable and unobservable inputs. 

Components of credit loss estimates including probability of default, constant default, cumulative default, loss given default, cure given deferral, and loss severity, are driven by the ability of the borrowers to pay their loans and the value of the underlying collateral and are impacted by changes in macroeconomic conditions, typically increasing when economic conditions worsen and decreasing when conditions improve. An increase in the estimated prepayment rate typically results in a decrease in estimated credit losses and vice versa. Higher credit loss estimates generally result in lower fair values. Credit spreads generally increase when liquidity risks and market volatility increase and decrease when liquidity conditions and market volatility improve. 

Discount rates and spread over forward interest rate swap rates typically increase when market interest rates increase and/or credit and liquidity risks increase and decrease when market interest rates decline and/or credit and liquidity conditions improve. Higher discount rates and credit spreads generally result in lower fair market values. 

Fair values of financial instruments 

Many of the assets and liabilities subject to the disclosure requirements are not actively traded, requiring fair values to be estimated by management. These estimations necessarily involve the use of judgment about a wide variety of factors, including but not limited to, relevancy of market prices of comparable instruments, expected future cash flows, and appropriate discount rates. 

The short-term nature of certain assets and liabilities result in their carrying value approximating fair value. These include trading account securities, customers&#8217; acceptance liabilities, short-term borrowings, bank acceptances outstanding, FHLB advances, and cash and short-term assets, which include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in banks, interest-bearing deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank, and federal funds sold. Loan commitments and letters-of-credit generally have short-term, variable-rate features and contain clauses that limit Huntington&#8217;s exposure to changes in customer credit quality. Accordingly, their carrying values, which are immaterial at the respective balance sheet dates, are reasonable estimates of fair value. 

Certain assets, the most significant being operating lease assets, bank owned life insurance, and premises and equipment, do not meet the definition of a financial instrument and are excluded from this disclosure. Similarly, mortgage servicing rights and relationship intangibles are not considered financial instruments and are not included in the following tables. Accordingly, this fair value information is not intended to, and does not, represent Huntington&#8217;s underlying value.

13. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

Derivative financial instruments are recorded in the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets as either an asset or a liability (in other assets or other liabilities, respectively) and measured at fair value. 

Derivative financial instruments can be designated as accounting hedges under GAAP. Designating a derivative as an accounting hedge allows Huntington to recognize gains and losses on the hedging instruments in the income statement line item where the gains and losses on the hedged item are recognized. Gains and losses on derivatives that are not designated in an effective hedge relationship under GAAP immediately impact earnings within the period they occur. 

2024 3Q Form 10-Q 73 

The following table presents the fair values and notional values of all derivative instruments included in the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts in the table below are presented gross without the impact of any net collateral arrangements.

Derivatives used in asset and liability management activities 

Huntington engages in balance sheet hedging activity, principally for asset and liability management purposes. Balance sheet hedging activity is generally arranged to receive hedge accounting treatment that can be classified as either fair value or cash flow hedges. Fair value hedges are executed to hedge changes in fair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt and investment securities caused by fluctuations in market interest rates. Cash flow hedges are executed to modify interest rate characteristics of designated commercial loans in order to reduce the impact of changes in future cash flows due to market interest rate changes. 

74 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 

The following table presents the gross notional values of derivatives used in Huntington&#8217;s asset and liability management activities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, identified by the underlying interest rate-sensitive instruments. 

(dollar amounts in millions) Fair Value Hedges Cash Flow Hedges Economic Hedges Total At September 30, 2024 Instruments associated with: Investment securities $ 11,639 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 11,639 &#160; Loans &#8212; &#160; 20,800 &#160; 175 &#160; 20,975 &#160; Long-term debt 11,213 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 11,213 &#160; Total notional value $ 22,852 &#160; $ 20,800 &#160; $ 175 &#160; $ 43,827 &#160; At December 31, 2023 Instruments associated with: Investment securities $ 11,649 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 11,649 &#160; Loans &#8212; &#160; 16,675 &#160; 175 &#160; 16,850 &#160; Long-term debt 9,693 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 9,693 &#160; Total notional value $ 21,342 &#160; $ 16,675 &#160; $ 175 &#160; $ 38,192 &#160; 

These derivative financial instruments were entered into for the purpose of managing the interest rate risk of assets and liabilities. Net amounts receivable or payable on contracts hedging either interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities were accrued as an adjustment to either interest income or interest expense. Adjustments to interest income were also recorded for the amounts related to the amortization of premiums for collars and floors that were not included in the measurement of hedge effectiveness, as well as the amounts related to terminated hedges reclassified from AOCI. The net amounts resulted in a decrease to net interest income of $ 57 million and a decrease to net interest income of $ 62 million for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the net amounts resulted in a decrease to net interest income of $ 195 million and $ 178 million, respectively. 

Fair Value Hedges 

The changes in fair value of the fair value hedges are recorded through earnings and offset against changes in the fair value of the hedged item. 

Huntington has designated $ 11.0 billion of interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of fixed-rate investment securities using the portfolio layer method. This approach allows the Company to designate as the hedged item a stated amount of the assets that are not expected to be affected by prepayments, defaults, and other factors affecting the timing and amount of cash flows. The fair value portfolio level basis adjustment on our hedged mortgage-backed securities portfolio has not been attributed to the individual available-for-sale securities in our Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. Huntington has also designated $ 652 million of interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of fixed-rate corporate bonds. 

The following table presents the change in fair value for derivatives designated as fair value hedges as well as the offsetting change in fair value on the hedged item.

The following amounts were recorded on the balance sheet related to cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges. 

Amortized Cost Cumulative Amount of Fair Value Hedging Adjustment To Hedged Items (dollar amounts in millions) At September 30, 2024 At December 31, 2023 At September 30, 2024 At December 31, 2023 Assets Investment securities (1) $ 17,327 &#160; $ 18,241 &#160; $ ( 439 ) $ ( 698 ) Liabilities Long-term debt (2) 11,165 &#160; 9,909 &#160; 28 &#160; ( 115 ) 

(1) Amounts include the amortized cost basis of closed portfolios used to designate hedging relationships under the portfolio layer method. The hedged item is a layer of the closed portfolio which is expected to be remaining at the end of the hedging relationship. As of September 30, 2024, the amortized cost basis of the closed portfolios used in these hedging relationships was $ 16.7 billion, the cumulative basis adjustments associated with these hedging relationships was $ 377 million, and the notional amounts of the designated hedging instruments were $ 11.0 billion. 

(2) Excluded from the above table are the cumulative amount of fair value hedge adjustments remaining for long-term debt for which hedge accounting has been discontinued in the amounts of $( 60 ) million at September 30, 2024 and $( 69 ) million at December 31, 2023. 

Cash Flow Hedges 

At September 30, 2024, Huntington has $ 20.8 billion of interest rate swaps and floors. These are designated as cash flow hedges for variable rate commercial loans. The change in the fair value of a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is initially recognized in OCI and is reclassified into income when the hedged item impacts earnings. The initial premium paid for the interest rate floor contracts represents the time value of the contracts and is not included in the measurement of hedge effectiveness. The initial premium paid is amortized on a straight line basis as a reduction to interest income over the contractual life of these contracts. 

At September 30, 2024, the net losses recognized in AOCI that are expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months were $ 85 million. 

Derivatives used in mortgage banking activities 

Mortgage loan origination hedging activity 

Huntington&#8217;s mortgage origination hedging activity is related to economically hedging Huntington&#8217;s mortgage pricing commitments to customers and the secondary sale to third parties. The value of a newly originated mortgage is not firm until the interest rate is committed or locked. Forward commitments to sell economically hedge the possible loss on interest rate lock commitments due to interest rate change. The position of these derivatives at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were a net asset of $ 5 million and a net liability of $ 4 million, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Huntington had commitments to sell residential real estate loans of $ 1.0 billion and $ 674 million, respectively. These contracts mature in less than one year . 

MSR hedging activity 

Huntington&#8217;s MSR economic hedging activity uses securities and derivatives to manage the value of the MSR asset and to mitigate the various types of risk inherent in the MSR asset, including risks related to duration, basis, convexity, volatility, and yield curve. The hedging instruments include forward commitments, TBA securities, Treasury futures contracts, interest rate swaps, and options on interest rate swaps. 

MSR hedging trading assets and liabilities are included in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, in the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. Trading gains (losses) are included in mortgage banking income in the Unaudited Consolidated Statement of Income. The notional value of the derivative financial instruments, the corresponding trading assets and liabilities positions, and net trading gains (losses) related to MSR hedging activity is summarized in the following tables.

Derivatives used in customer related activities 

Various derivative financial instruments are offered to enable customers to meet their financing and investing objectives and for their risk management purposes. Derivative financial instruments used in trading activities consist of commodity, interest rate, and foreign exchange contracts. Huntington enters into offsetting third-party contracts with approved, reputable counterparties with substantially matching terms and currencies in order to economically hedge significant exposure related to derivatives used in trading activities. 

The interest rate or price risk of customer derivatives is mitigated by entering into similar derivatives having offsetting terms with other counterparties. The credit risk to these customers is evaluated and included in the calculation of fair value. Foreign currency derivatives help the customer hedge risk and reduce exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates. Transactions are primarily in liquid currencies with Canadian dollars and Euros comprising a majority of all transactions. Commodity derivatives help the customer hedge risk and reduce exposure to fluctuations in the price of various commodities. Hedging of energy-related products and base metals comprise the majority of these transactions. 

The net fair values of these derivative financial instruments, for which the gross amounts are included in other assets or other liabilities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, were $ 55 million and $ 47 million, respectively. The total notional values of derivative financial instruments used by Huntington on behalf of customers, including offsetting derivatives, were $ 45.5 billion and $ 44.5 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Huntington&#8217;s credit risk from customer derivatives was $ 141 million and $ 122 million at the same dates, respectively. 

Credit derivative instruments 

Huntington enters into credit default swaps to hedge credit risk associated with certain loans and leases. These contracts are accounted for as derivatives, and accordingly, these contracts are recorded at fair value. The total notional value of credit contracts was $ 278 million and $ 381 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The position of these derivatives was a net liability of $ 1 million and $ 2 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Financial assets and liabilities that are offset in the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets 

Huntington records derivatives at fair value as further described in Note 12 - &#8220; Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities &#8221;. 

Derivative balances are presented on a net basis taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements. Additionally, collateral exchanged with counterparties is also netted against the applicable derivative fair values. Huntington enters into derivative transactions with two primary groups: broker-dealers and banks, and Huntington&#8217;s customers. Different methods are utilized for managing counterparty credit exposure and credit risk for each of these groups. 

Huntington enters into transactions with broker-dealers and banks for various risk management purposes. These types of transactions generally are high dollar volume. Huntington enters into collateral and master netting agreements with these counterparties, and routinely exchanges cash and high quality securities collateral. Huntington enters into transactions with customers to meet their financing, investing, payment, and risk management needs. These types of transactions generally are low dollar volume. Huntington enters into master netting agreements with customer counterparties; however, collateral is generally not exchanged with customer counterparties. 

In addition to the customer derivative credit exposure, aggregate credit risk associated with broker-dealer and bank derivative transactions was net credit risk of $ 319 million and $ 238 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The net credit risk associated with derivatives is calculated after considering master netting agreements and is reduced by collateral that has been pledged by the counterparty. 

At September 30, 2024, Huntington pledged $ 172 million of investment securities and cash collateral to counterparties, while other counterparties pledged $ 446 million of investment securities and cash collateral to Huntington to satisfy collateral netting agreements. In the event of credit downgrades, Huntington would not be required to provide additional collateral.

14. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES 

Consolidated VIEs 

During the first quarter of 2024, Huntington entered into an auto securitization involving a VIE. The VIE evaluation determined that Huntington is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, and therefore, must account for the VIE as a consolidated subsidiary. In addition, Huntington engages in activities with other VIEs in the normal course of business that result in Huntington being the primary beneficiary and which are consolidated in Huntington&#8217;s financial statements. 

The following table provides a summary of the assets and liabilities of VIEs carried on Huntington&#8217;s Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As part of the securitization transaction completed in the first quarter of 2024, Huntington transferred $ 1.6 billion in aggregate automobile loans to a SPE which was deemed to be a VIE. This SPE then issued approximately $ 1.6 billion of asset-backed notes, of which approximately $ 128 million were retained by Huntington. The primary purpose of the VIE in the securitization transaction is to issue asset-backed securities with varying levels of credit subordination and payment priority. Huntington retained notes and residual interest in the VIE and, therefore, has an obligation to absorb losses and a right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In addition, Huntington retained servicing rights for the underlying loans and, therefore, holds the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE. The assets of the VIE are restricted to the settlement of the asset-backed securities and other obligations of the VIE. Third-party holders of the asset-backed notes do not have recourse to the general assets of Huntington.

The economic performance of the VIE is most significantly impacted by the performance of the underlying loans. The VIE is exposed to credit and prepayment risk, which are managed through credit enhancements in the form of reserve accounts, over-collateralization, excess interest on the loans, and the subordination of certain classes of asset-backed securities. 

Consolidated VIEs at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 also included investments in LIHTC operating entities that were syndicated and where we serve as the general partner and manager. As manager of these entities, we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance, as well as an obligation to absorb significant expected losses, of the entities.

Affordable Housing and Other Tax Credit Investments 

Huntington makes certain equity investments in various limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects utilizing the LIHTC pursuant to Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital, to facilitate the sale of additional affordable housing product offerings, and to assist in achieving goals associated with the Community Reinvestment Act. The primary activities of the limited partnerships include the identification, development, and operation of multi-family housing that is leased to qualifying residential tenants. Generally, these types of investments are funded through a combination of debt and equity. 

In the first quarter of 2024, Huntington adopted ASU 2023-02 which expanded the proportional amortization method to tax credit programs beyond LIHTC investments. In addition to LIHTC investments, Huntington elected to apply the proportional amortization method to certain tax credit investments that combine LIHTC with other types of credits and historical tax credits. Huntington does not have a material amount of investments in these additional categories. 

Huntington uses the proportional amortization method to account for a majority of its investments in these entities. These investments are included in other assets. Investments that do not meet the requirements of the proportional amortization method are accounted for using the equity method. Investment losses are included in Other noninterest income in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Income.

Trust-Preferred Securities 

Huntington has certain wholly-owned trusts whose assets, liabilities, equity, income, and expenses are not included within Huntington&#8217;s Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. These trusts have been formed for the sole purpose of issuing trust-preferred securities, from which the proceeds are then invested in Huntington junior subordinated debentures, which are reflected in Huntington&#8217;s Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheet as long-term debt. The trust securities are the obligations of the trusts, and as such, are not consolidated within Huntington&#8217;s Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Other investments 

Other investments determined to be VIEs include investments in Small Business Investment Companies, Historic Tax Credit Investments, certain equity method investments, renewable energy financings, and other miscellaneous investments. 

15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 

Commitments to extend credit 

In the ordinary course of business, Huntington makes various commitments to extend credit that are not reflected in the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. The contract amounts of these financial agreements were as follows: 

(dollar amounts in millions) At September 30, 2024 At December 31, 2023 Contract amount representing credit risk Commitments to extend credit: Commercial and industrial 

$ 35,731 &#160; $ 32,344 &#160; Consumer loan portfolio 

19,983 &#160; 19,270 &#160; Commercial real estate 1,865 &#160; 2,543 &#160; Standby letters of credit and guarantees on industrial revenue bonds 743 &#160; 814 &#160; Commercial letters of credit 24 &#160; 9 &#160; 

Commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates, are variable-rate, and contain clauses that permit Huntington to terminate or otherwise renegotiate the contracts in the event of a significant deterioration in the customer&#8217;s credit quality. These arrangements normally require the payment of a fee by the customer, the pricing of which is based on prevailing market conditions, credit quality, probability of funding, and other relevant factors. Since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements. The interest rate risk arising from these financial instruments is insignificant as a result of their predominantly short-term, variable-rate nature. Certain commitments to extend credit are secured by collateral, including residential and commercial real estate, inventory, receivables, cash and securities, and other business assets.

Standby letters-of-credit and guarantees on industrial revenue bonds are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third-party. These guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. Most of these arrangements mature within two years . Since the conditions under which Huntington is required to fund these commitments may not materialize, the cash requirements are expected to be less than the total outstanding commitments. The carrying amount of deferred revenue associated with these guarantees was $ 27 million and $ 9 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Other Guarantees 

Huntington provides guarantees to certain third-party investors in connection with the sale of syndicated affordable housing tax credits. These guarantees are generally in the form of make-whole provisions that are triggered if the underlying performance of LIHTC properties result in a shortfall to the third-party investors and remain in effect until the final associated tax credits are realized. The maximum amount guaranteed by the Company under these arrangements total approximately $ 201 million and $ 79 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and represents the guaranteed portion in these transactions where the make-whole provisions have not yet expired. 

Litigation and Regulatory Matters 

In the ordinary course of business, Huntington is routinely a defendant in or party to pending and threatened legal and regulatory actions and proceedings. 

In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties, Huntington generally cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be, what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters will be, or what the eventual loss, fines, or penalties related to each matter may be. 

Huntington establishes an accrued liability when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. Huntington thereafter continues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established. 

For certain matters, Huntington is able to estimate a range of possible loss. In cases in which Huntington possesses information to estimate a range of possible loss, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed below. There may be other matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but such an estimate of the range of possible loss may not be possible. For those matters where an estimate of the range of possible loss is possible, management currently estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible loss is $ 0 to $ 15 million at September 30, 2024 in excess of the accrued liability (if any) related to those matters. This estimated range of possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions, and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. The estimated range of possible loss does not represent Huntington&#8217;s maximum loss exposure. 

Based on current knowledge, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending matters will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of Huntington. Further, management believes that amounts accrued are adequate to address Huntington&#8217;s contingent liabilities. However, in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters, some of which are beyond Huntington&#8217;s control, and the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to Huntington&#8217;s results of operations for any particular reporting period.

16. SEGMENT REPORTING 

Huntington&#8217;s business segments are based on our internally-aligned segment leadership structure, which is how management monitors results and assesses performance. During the second quarter of 2023, we completed an organizational realignment and now report on two business segments: Consumer &#38; Regional Banking and Commercial Banking. The Treasury / Other function includes technology and operations, other unallocated assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense. For a description of our business segments, see Note 25 - &#8220;Segment Reporting&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Huntington&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Prior period results have been adjusted to conform to the current presentation.
