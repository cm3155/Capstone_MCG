 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

The extent to which COVID-19 and measures taken in response thereto impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict. COVID-19 has and is likely to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition and heighten many of our known risks. 

The outbreak of the global pandemic of COVID-19 and resultant economic effects of preventative measures taken across the United States and worldwide have been weighing on the macroeconomic environment, negatively impacting consumer confidence, unemployment and other economic indicators that contribute to consumer spending behavior and demand for credit. Such economic conditions reduce the usage of our credit cards and other financing products and the average purchase amount of transactions on our credit cards and through our other products, which, in each case, reduces our interest and fee income. For more information on the risks related to the extent to which key macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, see &#8220; Risk Factors Relating to Our Business-Macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition &#8221; in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. 

The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. While the magnitude of the impact from COVID-19 is uncertain, we could see: 

&#8226; 

a continued decline in purchase volume, which ultimately impacts the growth of our loan receivables; 

&#8226; 

a decline in the growth of our interest income, due to reductions in benchmark interest rates and an expectation that we will provide, for a temporary period of time, forbearance in terms of interest and fee waivers for our cardholders impacted by COVID-19; and 

&#8226; 

increases in our delinquencies and net charge-off rate and our allowance for credit losses, given the levels of filings for unemployment benefits in the U.S. 

For more information, see &#8220; Management's Discussion and Analysis-Results of Operations-Business Trends and Conditions. &#8221; 

In addition, the spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including restricting employee travel and transitioning nearly all of our employees to working from home), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, partners and customers. The outbreak has adversely impacted and may further adversely impact our workforce and operations and the operations of our partners, customers, suppliers and third-party vendors, throughout the time period during which the spread of COVID-19 continues and related restrictions remain in place, and even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided. In particular, we may experience financial losses due to a number of operational factors, including: 

&#8226; 

continued store closures by partners or if one or more partners becomes subject to a bankruptcy proceeding; 

&#8226; 

third-party disruptions, including potential outages at third-party operated call centers and other suppliers; 

&#8226; 

increased cyber and payment fraud risk related to COVID-19, as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruption, given increased online banking, e-commerce and other online activity; 

&#8226; 

challenges to the availability and reliability of our network due to changes to normal operations, including the possibility of one or more clusters of COVID-19 cases affecting our employees or affecting the systems or employees of our partners; and 

&#8226; 

an increased volume of unanticipated customer and regulatory requests for information and support, or additional regulatory requirements, which could require additional resources and costs to address, including, for example, government initiatives to reduce or eliminate payments costs. 

Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, our business may continue to experience materially adverse impacts as a result of the virus&#8217;s economic impact, including the availability and cost of funding and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. There are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain and subject to change. 

We do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business, our operations or the economy as a whole. However, the effects are likely to have a material impact on our results of operations and heighten many of our known risks described in the &#8220; Risk Factors Relating to Our Business &#8221; and &#8220; Risk Factors Relating to Regulation &#8221; sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.
