OUR BUSINESS

Our Company
____________________________________________________________________________________________

We are a premier consumer financial services company. We deliver a wide range of specialized financing programs, as well as innovative consumer banking
products, across key industries including digital, retail, home, auto, travel, health and pet. We provide a range of credit products through our financing programs
which we have established with a diverse group of national and regional retailers, local merchants, manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations and
healthcare service providers, which we refer to as our “partners.” Through our partners’ over 410,000 locations across the United States and Canada, and their
websites and mobile applications, we offer their customers a variety of credit products to finance the purchase of goods and services. During 2019, we financed
$149.4 billion of purchase volume, and at December 31, 2019, we had $87.2 billion of loan receivables and 75.5 million active accounts. Our active accounts
represent a geographically diverse group of both consumers and businesses, with an average FICO score of 719 for active accounts at December 31, 2019.

Our business benefits from longstanding and collaborative relationships with our partners, including some of the nation’s leading retailers and manufacturers
with well-known consumer brands, such as Lowe’s and Ashley HomeStore and also leading digital partners, such as Amazon and PayPal. We believe our
partner-centric business model has been successful because it aligns our interests with those of our partners and provides substantial value to both our
partners and our customers. Our partners promote our credit products because they generate increased sales and strengthen customer loyalty. Our customers
benefit from instant access to credit, discounts, such as cash back rewards, and promotional offers. We seek to differentiate ourselves through deep partner
integration and our extensive marketing expertise. We have omni-channel (in-store, online and mobile) technology and marketing capabilities, which allow us to
offer and deliver our credit products instantly to customers across multiple channels.

We conduct our operations through a single business segment. Profitability and expenses, including funding costs, loan losses and operating expenses, are
managed for the business as a whole. Substantially all of our operations are within the United States. We offer our credit products through three sales platforms
(Retail Card, Payment Solutions and CareCredit). Those platforms are organized by the types of products we offer and the partners we work with, and are
measured on interest and fees on loans, loan receivables, active accounts and other sales metrics. Retail Card is a leading provider of private label credit
cards, and also provides Dual Cards, general purpose co-branded credit cards, and small and medium-sized business credit products. Payment Solutions is a
leading provider of promotional financing for major consumer purchases, offering primarily private label credit cards and installment loans. CareCredit is a
leading provider of promotional financing to consumers for health, veterinary and personal care procedures, services and products, including dental, vision,
audiology and cosmetic.

We offer our credit products primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank. In addition, through the Bank, we offer, directly to retail and commercial
customers, a range of deposit products insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), including certificates of deposit, individual retirement
accounts (“IRAs”), money market accounts and savings accounts. We also take deposits at the Bank through third-party securities brokerage firms that offer
our FDIC-insured deposit products to their customers. We have significantly expanded our online direct banking operations in recent years and our deposit
base serves as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding for our credit activities. At December 31, 2019, we had $65.1 billion in deposits, which
represented 77% of our total funding sources.

Our Sales Platforms
____________________________________________________________________________________________

We offer our credit products through three sales platforms: Retail Card, Payment Solutions and CareCredit. Set forth below is a summary of certain information
relating to our Retail Card, Payment Solutions and CareCredit platforms:

Retail Card

Retail Card is a leading provider of private label credit cards, and also provides Dual Cards, general purpose co-branded credit cards and small and medium-
sized business credit products. Retail Card accounted for $13.6 billion, or 73%, of our total interest and fees on loans for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is on standard (i.e., non-promotional) terms.

Retail Card’s revenue primarily consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables. Other income primarily consists of interchange fees earned when our Dual
Card or general purpose co-brand cards are used outside of our partners’ sales channels and fees paid to us by customers who purchase our debt cancellation
products, less loyalty program payments.

Retail Card Partners

We have Retail Card programs with 25 national and regional retailers, which have approximately 10,000 retail locations and include department stores,
specialty retailers, mass merchandisers and digital (multi-channel and online retailers). The average length of our relationship with our Retail Card partners is
21 years. Our oil and gas retail credit programs are no longer reported within our Retail Card sales platform and are now reported within our Payment Solutions
sales platform.

8

Our five largest ongoing programs are with Retail Card partners. Based upon interest and fees on loans for the year ended December 31, 2019, excluding the
Walmart program, our five largest programs were: Gap, JCPenney, Lowe’s, PayPal and Sam’s Club. These programs accounted in aggregate for 47% of our
total interest and fees on loans for the year ended December 31, 2019, and 48% of loan receivables at December 31, 2019. Our programs with Lowe's and
PayPal each accounted for more than 10% of our total interest and fees on loans for the year ended December 31, 2019. In October 2019, we sold $8.2 billion
of receivables associated with our consumer program agreement with Walmart.

The length of our relationship with each of our five largest ongoing Retail Card partners is over 15 years, and in the case of Lowe's, 40 years. The current
expiration dates for these agreements range from 2022 through 2030. Within the last eighteen months, we have extended our program agreements with the
majority of these key partners, including most recently our agreement announced in October 2019 to extend our program agreement with PayPal, and also to
become the exclusive issuer of a Venmo co-branded consumer credit card.

New and Extended Partner Programs

During the year ended December 31, 2019, in addition to our agreement with PayPal discussed above, we announced our new partnerships with Norwegian
Air, and in January 2020, with Verizon, and also extended our program agreement with Dick's Sporting Goods.

A total of 20 of our 25 ongoing Retail Card program agreements, now have an expiration date in 2022 or beyond. These 20 program agreements represented in
the aggregate 98% of both our Retail Card interest and fees on loans for the year ended December 31, 2019 and of our Retail Card loan receivables at
December 31, 2019 attributable to our ongoing programs.

Retail Card Program Agreements

Our Retail Card programs are governed by program agreements that are each negotiated separately with our partners. Although the terms of the agreements
are partner-specific, and may be amended from time to time, under a typical program agreement, our partner agrees to support and promote the program to its
customers, but we control credit criteria and issue credit cards to customers who qualify under those criteria. We own the underlying accounts and all loan
receivables generated under the program from the time of origination. Other key provisions in the Retail Card program agreements include:

9

 
Term

Retail Card program agreements typically have contract terms ranging from approximately five to ten years. Many program agreements have renewal clauses
that provide for automatic renewal for one or more years until terminated by us or our partner. We typically seek to renew the program agreements well in
advance of their termination dates.

Exclusivity

The program agreements typically are exclusive for the products we offer and limit our partners’ ability to originate or promote other private label or co-branded
credit cards during the term of the agreement.

Retailer Share Arrangements

Most of our Retail Card program agreements contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our partner if the economic performance of the
program exceeds a contractually-defined threshold. Economic performance for the purposes of these arrangements is typically measured based on agreed
upon program revenues (including interest income and certain other income) less agreed upon program expenses (including interest expense, provision for
loan losses, retailer payments and operating expenses). We may also provide other economic benefits to our partners such as royalties on purchase volume or
payments for new accounts, in some cases instead of retailer share arrangements (for example, on our co-branded credit cards). All of these arrangements
align our interests and provide an additional incentive to our partners to promote our credit products.

Other Economic Terms

In addition to the retailer share arrangements, the program agreements typically provide that the parties will develop a marketing plan to support the program,
and they set the terms by which a joint marketing budget is funded, the basic terms of the rewards program linked to the use of our product (such as
opportunities to receive double rewards points for purchases made on a Retail Card product), and the allocation of costs related to the rewards program.

Termination

The program agreements set forth the circumstances in which a party may terminate the agreement prior to expiration. Our program agreements generally
permit us and our partner to terminate the agreement prior to its scheduled termination date for various reasons, including if the other party materially breaches
its obligations. Some program agreements also permit our partner to terminate the program if we fail to meet certain service levels or change certain key
cardholder terms or our credit criteria, we fail to achieve certain approval rate targets with respect to approvals of new customers, we elect not to increase the
program size when the outstanding loan receivables under the program reach certain thresholds, we are not adequately capitalized, certain force majeure
events occur or certain changes in our ownership occur. Certain program agreements are also subject to early termination by a party if the other party has a
material adverse change in its financial condition. Historically, these rights have not typically been triggered or exercised. Some of our program agreements
provide that, upon termination or expiration, our partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the accounts and loan receivables generated with
respect to its program at fair market value or a stated price, including all related customer data.

Payment Solutions

Payment Solutions is a leading provider of promotional financing for major consumer purchases, offering consumer choice for financing at the point of sale,
including primarily private label credit cards, Dual Cards and installment loans. Payment Solutions accounted for $2.8 billion, or 15%, of our total interest and
fees on loans for the year ended December 31, 2019. Credit extended in this platform, other than for our oil and gas retail partners, is primarily promotional
financing.

10

Payment Solutions’ revenue primarily consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables, including “merchant discounts,” which are fees paid to us by our
partners in almost all cases to compensate us for all or part of the foregone interest income associated with promotional financing. The types of promotional
financing we offer include deferred interest (interest accrues during a promotional period and becomes payable if the full purchase amount is not paid off during
the promotional period), no interest (no interest on a promotional purchase) and reduced interest (interest is assessed monthly at a promotional interest rate
during the promotional period). As a result, during the promotional period we do not generate interest income or generate it at a lower rate, although we
continue to generate fee income relating to late fees on required minimum payments.

Payment Solutions Partners

In Payment Solutions, we create customized credit programs for national and regional retailers, manufacturers, buying groups, and industry associations. In
addition, we create our own industry vertical programs, which are available to local, small and medium size merchants to provide financing offers to their
customers.

At December 31, 2019, our Payment Solutions partners had approximately 160,000 retail locations, including oil and gas retail locations. Payment Solutions is
diversified by program, with no one Payment Solutions program accounting for more than 1.3% of our total interest and fees on loans for the year ended
December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2019, the average length of our relationships with our ten largest ongoing Payment Solutions programs was 13 years.

_____________________

(1) Ongoing partners. Based on interest and fees on loans for the year ended December 31, 2019.

In Payment Solutions, we generally partner with sellers of “big-ticket” products or services (generally priced from $500 to $25,000) to consumers where our
financing products and industry expertise provide strong incremental value to our partners and their customers. We also promote our programs to sellers
through direct marketing activities such as industry trade publications, trade shows and sales efforts by dedicated internal and external sales teams, leveraging
our existing partner network or through endorsements from manufacturers, buying groups and industry associations. Our broad array of point of sale
technologies and quick enrollment process allow us to quickly and cost-effectively integrate new partners.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we expanded our Synchrony Car Care and Synchrony HOME program acceptance networks and announced our
new partnerships with Grand Home Furnishings, Leisure Pro, Mor furniture for less, Samsung HVAC, Travis Industries, and Zero Motorcycles. We also
extended our program agreements with BuyMax Alliance, CCA Global Partners, CFMOTO, Conn's HomePlus, Continental Tires, La-Z-Boy, P.C. Richard & Son,
Penske, Polaris, Rheem, Rooms To Go, and Suzuki. In January 2020, we completed the sale of loan receivables associated with the Yamaha portfolio.

Payment Solutions Program Agreements

National and Regional Retailers and Manufacturers

The terms of our program agreements with national and regional retailers and manufacturers are typically similar to the terms of our Retail Card program
agreements in that we are the exclusive program provider of financing for the national or regional retailer or manufacturer with respect to the financing products
that we offer. Some program agreements, however, allow the merchant to use a second source lender after an application has been submitted to us and
declined, or in the case of some of our programs, may allow the manufacturer to have several primary lenders. The terms of the program agreements generally
run from three to five years and are subject to termination prior to the scheduled termination date by us or our partner for various reasons, including if the other
party materially breaches its obligations. Some of these programs also permit our partner to terminate the program if we change certain key cardholder terms,
exceed certain pricing thresholds, certain force majeure events occur, certain changes in our ownership occur or there is a material adverse change in our
financial condition. A few of these programs also may be terminated at will by the partner on specified notice to us (e.g., several months). Many of these
program agreements have renewal clauses which allow the program agreement to be renewed for successive one or more year terms until terminated by us or
our partner. We typically negotiate with program participants to renew the program agreements well in advance of their termination dates.

We control credit criteria and issue credit cards or provide installment loans to customers who qualify under those credit criteria. We own the underlying
accounts and all loan receivables generated under the program from the time of origination. Our Payment Solutions program agreements set forth the
program’s economic terms, including the merchant discount applicable to each promotional finance offering. We typically do not pay fees to our Payment
Solutions partners pursuant to any retailer share arrangements, but in some cases we pay a sign-up fee to a partner or provide volume-based rebates on the
merchant discount paid by the partner.

Buying Groups and Industry Associations

The programs we have established with buying groups and industry associations, such as the Home Furnishings Association, Jewelers of America and
Nationwide Marketing Group, are governed by program agreements under which we make our credit products available to their respective members or dealers,
but these agreements generally do not require the members or dealers to offer our products to their customers. Under the terms of the program agreements,
buying groups and industry associations generally agree to support and promote the respective programs. These arrangements may include sign-up fees and
volume-based incentives paid by us to the groups and their members.

Synchrony-Branded Networks

Our Synchrony-branded networks are focused on specific industries, where we create either company-branded or company and partner-branded private label
credit cards that are usable across all participating locations within the industry-specific network. For example, our Synchrony Car Care network, comprised of
merchants selling automotive parts, repair services and tires, covers over 730,000 locations across the United States, and cards issued may be dual branded
with Synchrony Car Care and partners such as Midas, Michelin Tires or Pep Boys. Under the terms of these networks, we establish merchant discounts
applicable to each financing offer, and, in some cases, the fees we charge partners for their membership in the network. In addition, we also earn interchange
fees through credit card transactions outside of the program network. The Synchrony Car Care network allows for expanded use outside of the program
network at certain related merchants, such as gas stations. Similarly, the Synchrony HOME credit card is accepted at more than one million home-related retail
locations nationwide, including both partner locations and retailers outside of our program network.

12

Dealer Agreements

For the programs we have established with manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations, industry vertical programs and Synchrony-branded networks
described above, we enter into individual agreements with the merchants and dealers that offer our credit products under these programs. These agreements
generally are not exclusive and some parties who offer our financing products also offer financing from our competitors. Our agreements generally continue
until terminated by either party, with termination typically available to either party at will upon 15 days’ written notice. Our dealer agreements set forth the
economic terms associated with the program, including the fees charged to dealers to offer promotional financing, and in some cases, allow us to periodically
change the fees we charge.

CareCredit

CareCredit is a leading provider of promotional financing to consumers for health, veterinary and personal care procedures, services and products. CareCredit
accounted for $2.3 billion, or 12%, of our total interest and fees on loans for the year ended December 31, 2019. Substantially all of the credit extended in
CareCredit is promotional financing.

We offer customers a CareCredit-branded private label credit card that may be used across our network of CareCredit providers and our CareCredit Dual Card
offering. We generate revenue in CareCredit primarily from interest and fees on our loan receivables and from merchant discounts paid by providers to
compensate us for all or part of the foregone interest income associated with promotional financing.

In March 2019, we announced our acquisition of Pets Best and entry into the pet health insurance industry as a managing general agent. This acquisition
allows CareCredit to offer comprehensive financial options to consumers for veterinary care.

CareCredit Partners

The vast majority of our partners are individual and small groups of independent healthcare providers, which includes networks of healthcare practitioners that
provide elective and other procedures that generally are not fully covered by insurance. The remainder are primarily national and regional healthcare providers
and health-focused retailers, such as pharmacies. At December 31, 2019, we had a network of CareCredit providers and health-focused retailers that
collectively have over 240,000 locations.

During 2019, over 200,000 locations either processed a CareCredit application or made a sale on a CareCredit credit card. No one CareCredit partner
accounted for more than 0.2% of our total interest and fees on loans for the year ended December 31, 2019.

13

 
We enter into provider agreements with individual healthcare providers who become part of our CareCredit network. These provider agreements are similar to
the dealer agreements that govern our relationships with the merchants and dealers offering our Payment Solutions products in that the agreements are not
exclusive and typically may be terminated at will upon 15 days’ notice. Multi-year agreements are in place for larger multi-location relationships across all
markets. There are typically no retailer share arrangements with partners in CareCredit.

At December 31, 2019, we had relationships with over 120 professional and other associations (including the American Dental Association and the American
Veterinary Medical Association), manufacturers and buying groups, which endorse and promote our credit products to their members. Of these relationships,
over 70 were paid endorsements linked to member enrollment in, and volume under, the relevant program.

We screen potential partners using a variety of criteria, including whether the potential provider specializes in one of our approved specialties, carries the
appropriate licensing and certifications, and meets our underwriting criteria. We also screen potential partners for reputational issues. We work with
professional and other associations, manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations and healthcare consultants to educate their constituents about the
products and services we offer. We believe our ability to attract new partners is aided by our customer satisfaction rate, which our research in 2019 showed is
91%. We also approach individual healthcare service providers through direct mail, advertising, and at trade shows.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we expanded our network through our new partnerships with Baylor Scott & White Medical Center, Kaiser
Permanente, Lehigh Valley Physician's Group, Loyale, Simplee and St. Luke's University Health Network, renewed our agreements with Bosley and William
Demant Holdings, and launched our new program with Lighthouse. The network also expanded by over 20,000 provider locations and grew average active
cardholder accounts by 4%.

Our Customers
____________________________________________________________________________________________

Acquiring and Marketing to Retail Card & Payment Solutions Customers

In our Retail Card and Payment Solutions platforms we work directly with our partners using their distribution network, communication channels and customer
interactions to market our products to their existing and potential customers. We believe our presence at partners’ points of sale (in-store, online and mobile)
locations and our ability to make credit decisions instantly for a customer already predisposed to make a purchase enables us to acquire new customer
accounts at a lower cost than issuers of general purpose cards.

To acquire new customers, we collaborate and deeply integrate with our partners and leverage our marketing expertise to create programs that promote our
products to creditworthy customers. Frequently, our partners market the availability of credit as part of the advertising for their goods and services. Our
marketing programs include marketing offers (e.g., 10% off the customer’s first purchase) and consumer communications that are delivered through a variety of
channels, including in-store signage, online advertising, retailer website placement, associate communication, emails, text messages, direct mail campaigns,
advertising circulars, and outside marketing via television, radio, print, and digital marketing (search engine optimization, paid search and personalization). We
also employ our proprietary Quickscreen acquisition method to make targeted pre-approved credit offers at the point-of-sale. Our Quickscreen technology
allows us to process customer information obtained from our partners through our risk models such that when these customers seek to make payment for
goods and services at our partners' points-of-sale, we can offer them credit instantly, if appropriate. Based on our experience, due to the personalized and
immediate nature of the offer, Quickscreen significantly outperforms traditional direct-to-consumer pre-approved channels, such as direct mail or email, in
response rate and dollar spending.

In Payment Solutions we also market the value of cross-network benefits to our partners. For example, the Synchrony Car Care credit card offers motorists the
convenience of one card to pay for comprehensive auto care at thousands of service and parts locations, as well as fuel at gas stations nationwide. In addition,
we launched Synchrony HOME Network, which allows customers to finance items from home décor to mattresses to flooring at thousands of participating
HOME locations nationwide.

14

Acquiring and Marketing to CareCredit Customers

We market our products through our network of providers by training them on the advantages of CareCredit and by creating marketing materials for providers to
use to promote the program and educate customers. Our training helps our providers learn to discuss payment options during the pre-treatment consultation
phase, including the option to apply for a CareCredit credit card and the offer of promotional credit. According to a 2019 survey of our CareCredit customers,
50% indicated they would have postponed or reduced the scope of treatment if financing was not offered by their provider. Consumers can apply for our
CareCredit products in the provider’s office or online via the web or mobile device.

As the market continues to evolve, we are increasingly seeing more customers from mobile and internet channels. Consumers are going online to look for
information about the types of procedures or care they need, where to receive that care and how to pay for it. As such, we are promoting CareCredit directly to
potential and existing customers using digital marketing. Our provider locator, on our website, allows customers to search among the more than 240,000
locations that accept the CareCredit credit card by desired geography and provider type. According to our records, our CareCredit provider locator averaged
over 1.3 million searches per month during the year ended December 31, 2019. We believe our partners recognize the locator as an important source of new
customer acquisition and information about their practice.

We believe going direct to consumers through digital marketing will have several benefits. Customers will have a better understanding of the types of care they
can pay for, the different financing options available and where they can use CareCredit. In addition, whether they choose to apply online or in the provider’s
office, once approved, they can move forward with the care they want or need to feel better.

Enterprise Customer Engagement ("ECE") / Analytics

After a customer obtains one of our products, our marketing programs encourage ongoing card usage by communicating the benefits of our products’ value
propositions. Examples of such programs include: promotional financing offers, cardholder events, product and partner discounts, dollar-off certificates, account
holder sales, reward points and offers, new product announcements and previews, and other specific partner value offerings. These programs are executed
through our partners’ and our own (direct to consumer) distribution channels.

Our ECE and data analytics teams, help us optimize these programs through detailed test-and-learn tracking of cardholder responsiveness and subsequent
behavior. This data is leveraged by applying machine learning and other analytic techniques to create tools that allow for customized marketing messages and
promotional offers to cardholders. For example, if a cardholder consistently responds to a coupon sent by text message versus other channels, we will tailor
future marketing messages to be delivered by text message and use such insight to identify other populations that are likely to behave in similar ways. Our Dual
Card and general purpose co-branded credit card programs are further enhanced by the collection and analysis of data on customers' spend patterns at both
our partners and at other retailers. The objective of these efforts is to drive incremental volume for our programs while maximizing return on investment.

Our extensive marketing activities targeted to existing customers have yielded high levels of re-use across both our Payment Solutions and CareCredit sales
platforms. During the year ended December 31, 2019, 30% (excluding oil and gas retail partner programs) and 54% of purchase volume across our Payment
Solutions platform and CareCredit network, respectively, resulted from repeat use at one or more retailers or providers.

Digital and mobile capabilities

We remain focused on investing in our digital and mobile capabilities, bringing to market new features, channels and experiences for our customers and
enhancing our existing digital design and user experience. Our approach continues to be customer and partner-centric to reach our customers in unique ways
at home, in store, online or wherever they prefer. We believe these investments are critical to driving growth in our existing programs as well as securing
renewals and winning new programs such as our new co-branded consumer credit cards for Venmo and Verizon.

15

In 2019, we continued to focus on our digital apply platform (“dApply”) and driving a simplified experience for our customers. We have launched capabilities that
can securely pre-fill data from a variety of sources and bring the application process down to just 2 or 3 input fields while also improving the authentication of
the customer. Combined with introducing more ways to start a new application, such as our new text-to-apply capability, and modernizing the user experience
design of our terms display to be easier for our customers, the dApply platform continues to be critical in how we engage with our customers. In the fourth
quarter of 2019, digital applications represented more than 50% of our total applications received.

We have also continued to introduce new ways for our customers to interact with their accounts. We’ve expanded our voice assistant offerings including,
enabling our Store Card Skill on Amazon Alexa to now be available across all Alexa devices including those with screens. Our Amazon customers can now
access and service their account using just their voice from their living room TV. We are also developing an account servicing capability on Google Home. With
the continuing customer shift towards mobile, we’ve also introduced a mobile account lookup capability to give customers a secure, fast and easy way to
access a digital representation of their card from their personal device that can be used at the retailer point of sale.

Digital account servicing now represents over 62% of all account servicing done by our customers and we continue to invest in capabilities to improve this
experience. We’ve introduced technology to allow our customers to securely link their Synchrony account servicing credentials to an online account they may
have with a retailer, allowing for a seamless single-sign-on experience that more deeply merges the shopping and account management experiences. Finally,
we are also developing the digital capabilities for our commercial account platforms, enabling many new features for digital servicing, and rolling out new
modern digital apply platforms for in-store and online as well.

We are also investing in opening our platform to partners via application program interfaces (APIs) in the creation of our Synchrony Developer Portal. Through
exposing an increasing array of APIs for the credit life-cycle, we are creating opportunities to build new and richer experiences with our partners and in 2019 we
launched multiple new experiences with partners integrating our APIs into their digital assets focused on credit applications, rewards and account servicing.
This will continue to be a significant strategic focus for Synchrony.

In our online direct banking operations we launched a native application on iOS and Android and a new website focused on enhancing the customer
experience.

Finally, we’ve continued to expand the reach of our virtual assistant, Sydney, across our digital platforms and mobile servicing, and deepened her knowledge
and ability to respond to the questions and tasks that our customers ask.

Loyalty Programs

The credit rewards loyalty programs we manage typically provide cardholders with statement credit or cash back rewards. Other programs include rewards
points, which are redeemable for a variety of products or awards, or merchandise discounts that are earned by achieving a pre-set spending level on their
private label credit card, Dual Card or general purpose co-branded credit card. The merchandise discounts can be mailed to the cardholder, accessed digitally
or may be immediately redeemable at the partner’s store. These loyalty programs are designed to generate incremental purchase volume per customer, while
reinforcing the value of the card to the customer and strengthening customer loyalty. We continue to support and integrate into our partners’ loyalty programs to
customers that utilize non-credit payment types such as cash, debit or check. These multi-tender loyalty programs allow our partners to market to an expanded
customer base and allow us access to additional prospective cardholders.

Commercial Customers

In addition to our efforts to acquire consumer cardholders, we continue to increase our focus on small to mid-sized commercial customers. We offer these
customers private label credit cards and Dual Cards that can be used primarily at our Retail Card partners and are similar to our consumer offerings. We are
also increasing our focus on marketing our commercial pay-in-full accounts receivable product that supports a wide range of business customers.

Our credit card products are loans we extend through open-ended revolving credit card accounts. We offer the following principal types of credit cards:

Private Label Credit Cards

Private label credit cards are partner-branded credit cards (e.g., Lowe’s or Amazon) or program-branded credit cards (e.g., Synchrony Car Care or CareCredit)
that are used primarily for the purchase of goods and services from the partner or within the program network. In addition, in some cases, cardholders may be
permitted to access their credit card accounts for cash advances.

Credit under a private label credit card typically is extended either on standard terms only in our Retail Card sales platform, which means accounts are
assessed periodic interest charges using an agreed non-promotional fixed and/or variable interest rate, or pursuant to a promotional financing offer in our
Payment Solutions and CareCredit sales platforms, involving deferred interest, no interest or reduced interest during a set promotional period. Promotional
periods typically range between six and 60 months, but we may agree to longer terms with the partner. In almost all cases, we receive a merchant discount
from our partners to compensate us for all or part of the foregone interest income associated with promotional financing. The terms of these promotions vary by
partner, but generally the longer the deferred interest, reduced interest or interest-free period, the greater the partner’s merchant discount. Some offers permit
customers to pay for a purchase in equal monthly payments with no interest or at a reduced interest rate, rather than deferring or delaying interest charges. For
our deferred interest products, approximately 80% of customer transactions are typically paid off before interest is assessed. In CareCredit, standard rate
financing generally applies to charges under $200.

We typically do not charge interchange or other fees to our partners when a customer uses a private label credit card to purchase our partners’ goods and
services through our payment system.

Most of our private label credit card business is in the United States. For some of our partners who have locations in Canada, we also support the issuance and
acceptance of private label credit cards at their locations in Canada and from customers in Canada.

17

 
 
 
 
Dual Cards and General Purpose Co-Brand Cards

Our patented Dual Cards are credit cards that function as private label credit cards when used to purchase goods and services from our partners, and as
general purpose credit cards when used to make purchases from other retailers wherever cards from those card networks are accepted or for cash advance
transactions. We currently issue Dual Cards for use on the MasterCard and Visa networks and we have the potential capability to issue Dual Cards for use on
the American Express and Discover networks.

We have been granted two U.S. patents relating to the process by which our Dual Cards function as a private label credit card when used to make purchases
from our partners and function as a general purpose credit card when used on the systems of other credit card associations.

We also offer general purpose co-branded credit cards that do not function as private label credit cards, as well as, in limited circumstances, a Synchrony-
branded general purpose credit card.

Credit extended under our Dual Cards and general purpose co-branded credit cards typically is extended on standard terms only. Dual Cards and general
purpose co-branded credit cards are offered across all of our sales platforms. At December 31, 2019, we offered either Dual Cards or general purpose co-
branded credit cards through 22 ongoing partners and our CareCredit Dual Card, of which the majority are Dual Cards. We expect to continue to increase the
number of partner programs that offer Dual Cards or general purpose co-branded credit cards and seek to increase the portion of our loan receivables
attributable to these products.

Charges using a Dual Card or general purpose co-branded credit card generate interchange income for us in connection with purchases made by cardholders
other than in-store or online from that partner.

We currently do not issue Dual Cards or general purpose co-branded credit cards in Canada.

Terms and Conditions

As a general matter, the financial terms and conditions governing our credit card products vary by program and product type and change over time, although we
seek to standardize the non-financial provisions consistently across all products. The terms and conditions of our credit card products are governed by a
cardholder agreement and applicable laws and regulations.

We assign each card account a credit limit when the account is initially opened. Thereafter, we may increase or decrease individual credit limits from time to
time, at our discretion, based primarily on our evaluation of the customer’s creditworthiness and ability to pay.

For the vast majority of accounts, periodic interest charges are calculated using the daily balance method, which results in daily compounding of periodic
interest charges, subject to, at times, a grace period on new purchases. Cash advances are not subject to a grace period, and some credit card programs do
not provide a grace period for promotional purchases. In addition to periodic interest charges, we may impose other charges and fees on credit card accounts,
including, as applicable and provided in the cardholder agreement, cash advance transaction fees and late fees where a customer has not paid at least the
minimum payment due by the required due date.

Typically, each customer with an outstanding debit balance on his or her credit card account must make a minimum payment each month. A customer may pay
the total amount due at any time without penalty. We also may enter into arrangements with delinquent customers to extend or otherwise change payment
schedules and to waive interest charges and/or fees.

Commercial Credit Products

We offer private label cards and Dual Cards for commercial customers that are similar to our consumer offerings. We also offer a commercial pay-in-full
accounts receivable product to a wide range of business customers. We offer our commercial credit products primarily through our Retail Card platform to the
commercial customers of our Retail Card partners.

18

Installment Loans

In Payment Solutions, we originate installment loans to consumers (and a limited number of commercial customers) in the United States, primarily in the power
products market (motorcycles, ATVs and lawn and garden). Installment loans are closed-end credit accounts where the customer pays down the outstanding
balance in installments. The terms of our installment loans are governed by customer agreements and applicable laws and regulations.

Installment loans are assessed periodic finance charges using fixed interest rates. In addition to periodic finance charges, we may impose other charges and
fees on loan accounts, including late fees where a customer has not made the required payment by the required due date and returned payment fees.

Debt Cancellation Products

We offer a debt cancellation product to our credit card customers via online, mobile and, on a limited basis, direct mail. Customers who choose to purchase this
product are charged a monthly fee based on their ending balance on each billing statement. In return, the Bank will cancel all or a portion of a customer’s credit
card balance in the event of certain qualifying life events.

Direct-to-Consumer Banking
__________________________________________________________________________________________

Through the Bank, we offer our customers a range of FDIC-insured deposit products. The Bank also takes brokered deposits through third-party securities
brokerage firms that offer our FDIC-insured deposit products to their customers. At December 31, 2019, we had $65.1 billion in deposits, $54.2 billion of which
were direct deposits and $10.9 billion of which were brokered deposits. At December 31, 2019, deposits represented 77% of our total funding sources. During
2019, direct deposits were received from approximately 491,000 customers that had a total of approximately 1 million accounts. Retail customers accounted for
substantially all of our direct deposits at December 31, 2019. The Bank had a 85% retention rate on certificates of deposit balances up for renewal for the year
ended December 31, 2019. FDIC insurance is provided for our deposit products up to applicable limits.

We have significantly expanded our online direct banking operations in recent years and our deposit base serves as a source of stable and diversified low cost
funding for our credit activities. Our online platform is highly scalable allowing us to expand without having to rely on a traditional “brick and mortar” branch
network. During 2019 we launched a native application on iOS and Android and a new website focused on enhancing the customer experience. We expect the
continued growth in our direct banking platform to come primarily from retail deposits from consumer customers.

We continue to grow our direct banking operations and believe we are well-positioned to continue to benefit from the consumer-driven shift from branch banking
to direct banking. According to the 2019 American Bankers Association survey, approximately 77% of customers primarily use direct channels (internet, mail,
phone and mobile) to manage their bank accounts.

Our deposit products include certificates of deposit, IRAs, money market accounts and savings accounts. We market our deposit products through multiple
channels including digital and print. Customers can apply for, fund, and service their deposit accounts online or via phone. We have dedicated banking
representatives within our call centers to service deposit accounts. Fiserv, Inc. ("Fiserv") provides the core banking platform for our online retail deposits
including a customer-facing account opening and servicing platform.

To attract new deposits and retain existing ones, we intend to introduce new deposit products, enhancements to our existing products, and deliver new
capabilities. This may include the introduction of checking accounts, overdraft protection lines of credit, bill payment and person-to-person payment features,
and Synchrony-branded debit cards. Our focus on deposit-taking and related branding efforts will also enable us to offer other branded direct-banking products
more efficiently in the future.

19

We seek to differentiate our deposit product offerings from our competitors on the basis of brand, reputation, convenience, customer service and value. Our
deposit products emphasize reliability, trust, security, convenience and attractive rates. We offer rewards to customers based on their tenure or balance
amounts, including reduced fees, travel offers and concierge telephone support.

Credit Risk Management
____________________________________________________________________________________________

Credit risk management is a critical component of our management and growth strategy. Credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising from customer default when
customers are unable or unwilling to meet their financial obligations to us. Our credit risk arising from credit products is generally highly diversified across
approximately 135 million open accounts at December 31, 2019, without significant individual exposures. We manage credit risk primarily according to
customer segments and product types.

Customer Account Acquisition

We have developed programs to promote credit with each of our partners and have developed varying credit decision guidelines for the different partners. We
originate credit accounts through several different channels, including in-store, mail, internet, mobile, telephone and pre-approved solicitations. In addition, we
have, and may in the future, acquire accounts that were originated by third parties in connection with establishing programs with new partners.

Regardless of the channel, in making the initial credit approval decision to open a credit card or other account or otherwise grant credit, we follow a series of
credit risk and underwriting procedures. In most cases, when applications are made in-store or by internet or mobile, the process is fully automated and
applicants are notified of our credit decision immediately. We generally obtain certain information provided by the applicant and obtain a credit bureau report
from one of the major credit bureaus. The credit report information we obtain is electronically transmitted into industry scoring models and our proprietary
scoring models developed to calculate a credit score. The credit risk management team determines in advance the qualifying credit scores and initial credit line
assignments for each portfolio and product type. We periodically analyze performance trends of accounts originated at different score levels as compared to
projected performance and adjust the minimum score or the opening credit limit to manage credit risk.

We also apply additional application screens based on various inputs, including credit bureau information, alternative data, our previous experience with the
customer and information provided by our partner, to help identify additional factors, such as potential fraud and prior bankruptcies, before qualifying the
application for approval. We compare applicants’ names against the Specially Designated Nationals list maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of
the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“OFAC”), as well as screens that account for adherence to USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the “Patriot Act”) and Credit Card
Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the “CARD Act”) requirements, including ability to pay requirements.

We also use pre-approved account solicitations for certain programs. Potential applicants are pre-screened using information provided by our partner or
obtained from outside lists, and qualified individuals receive a pre-approved credit offer by mail or email.

Acquired Portfolio Evaluation

Our risk management team evaluates each portfolio that we acquire in connection with establishing programs with new partners to ensure the portfolio satisfies
our credit risk guidelines. As part of this review, we receive data on the third-party accounts and loans, which allows us to assess the portfolio on the basis of
certain core characteristics, such as historical performance of the assets and distributions of credit and loss information. In addition, we benchmark potential
portfolio acquisitions against our existing programs to assess relative current and projected risks. Finally, our risk management team must approve the
acquisition, taking into account the results of our risk assessment process. Once assets are migrated to our systems, our account management protocols will
apply immediately as described below under “—Customer Account Management,” “—Credit Authorizations of Individual Transactions” and “—Collections.”

20

Customer Account Management

We regularly assess the credit risk exposure of our customer accounts. This ongoing assessment includes information relating to the customer’s performance
with respect to their account with us, as well as information from credit bureaus relating to the customer’s broader credit performance. To monitor and control
the quality of our loan portfolio (including the portion of the portfolio originated by third parties), we use behavioral scoring models that we have developed to
score each active account on its monthly cycle date. Proprietary risk models, together with the credit scores obtained on each active account no less than
quarterly, are an integral part of our credit decision-making process. Depending on the duration of the customer’s account, risk profile and other performance
metrics, the account may be subject to a range of account actions, including limits on transaction authorization and increases or decreases in purchase and
cash credit limits.

Credit Authorizations of Individual Transactions

Once an account has been opened, when a credit card is used to make a purchase in-store at one of our partners’ locations or online, point-of-sale terminals or
online sites have an online connection with our credit authorization system, which allows for real-time updating of accounts. Each potential sales transaction is
passed through a transaction authorization system, which considers a variety of behavior and risk factors to determine whether the transaction should be
approved or declined, and whether a credit limit adjustment is warranted.

Fraud Investigation

We provide follow up and research with respect to different types of fraud such as fraud rings, new account fraud and transactional fraud. We have developed a
proprietary fraud model to identify new account fraud and deployed tools that help identify transaction purchase behavior outside a customer’s established
pattern. Our proprietary model is also complemented by externally sourced models and tools used across the industry to better identify fraud and protect our
customers. We also are continuously implementing new and improved technologies to detect and prevent fraud such as utilizing embedded security chips
("EMV") for our active Dual Card and general purpose co-branded credit card products with all our retail partners.

Collections

All monthly billing statements of accounts with past due amounts include a request for payment of these amounts. Collections personnel generally initiate
contact with customers within 30 days after any portion of their balance becomes past due. The nature and the timing of the initial contact, typically a personal
call, e-mail, text message or letter, are determined by a review of the customer’s prior account activity and payment habits.

We re-evaluate our collection efforts and consider the implementation of other techniques, including internal collection activities, use of external vendors and
the sale of debt to third-party buyers, as a customer becomes increasingly delinquent. We limit our exposure to delinquencies through controls within the
transaction authorization processes, the imposition of credit limits and criteria-based account suspension and revocation processes. In certain situations, we
may enter into arrangements to extend or otherwise change payment schedules, decrease interest rates and/or waive fees to aid customers experiencing
financial difficulties in their efforts to become current on their obligations to us.

Customer Service
____________________________________________________________________________________________

Customer service is an important feature of our relationship with our partners. Our customers can contact us via phone, mail, email, eService and eChat. During
the year ended December 31, 2019, we handled over 300 million inquiries.

We assign a dedicated toll-free customer service phone number to each of our Retail Card programs. Our Payment Solutions customers access customer
service through one general purpose toll-free customer service phone number (except for a few large Payment Solutions programs, which have dedicated toll-
free numbers). Our CareCredit platform has its own, dedicated toll-free customer service phone number. We also have dedicated toll-free customer service
phone numbers for our deposit business.

21

We service all programs through our nine domestic and three off-shore call centers. We blend domestic and off-shore locations as an important part of our
servicing strategy, to maintain service availability beyond normal work hours in the United States and to seek optimal costs. Customer service for cards issued
to customers in Canada is supported through agents based in the United States.

Given the nature of our business and the high volume of calls, we maintain several centers of excellence to ensure the quality of our customer service across
all of our sites. Examples of these centers of excellence include back office, quality assurance, customer experience, training, workforce and capacity planning,
surveillance and process control.

Production Services
____________________________________________________________________________________________

Our production services organization oversees a number of services, including:

•

•

•

•

payment processing (more than 700 million paper and electronic payments in 2019);

embossing and mailing credit cards (more than 50 million cards in 2019);

printing and mailing and eService delivery of credit card statements (more than 750 million paper and electronic statements in 2019); and

other letters mailed or sent electronically (more than 90 million in 2019).

In December 2019, our payment processing services were outsourced to a third party under a multi-year agreement. U.S. credit card statement printing and
mailing, card embossing and mailing and letter production and mailing for customers are provided through outsourced services with Fiserv. While these
services are outsourced, we monitor and maintain oversight of these other services. Fiserv also produces our statements and other mailings for deposit
customers.

Card production embossing, mailing, statement printing and mailing services related to cards issued to customers in Canada are outsourced to Canadian
suppliers.

Technology and Data Security
____________________________________________________________________________________________

Products and Services

We leverage information technology to deliver products and services that meet the needs of our customers and partners and enables us to operate our
business efficiently. The integration of our technology with our partners is at the core of our value proposition, enabling, among other things, customers to “apply
and buy” at the point of sale, and many of our partners to settle transactions directly with us without an interchange fee. A key part of our strategic focus is the
continued development of innovative, efficient, flexible technology and operational platforms to support marketing, risk management, account acquisition and
account management, customer service, and new product innovation and development. We believe that the continued investment in and development of these
platforms is an important part of our efforts to increase our competitive capabilities, reduce costs, improve quality and provide faster, more flexible technology
services. Therefore, we continuously review capabilities and develop or acquire systems, processes and competencies to meet our business needs.

As part of our continuous efforts to enhance our technological capabilities, we may either develop these capabilities internally or in partnership with third-party
providers. Our internal approach involves deployment of cross-functional product teams, often in collaboration with our partners, focused on driving rapid
delivery of in-house product innovation and development, and the commercialization of new products. In addition, at times we also partner with third-party
providers to help us deliver systems and operational infrastructure based on strategies and, in some cases, architecture, designed by us. We leverage Fiserv
(including their recent acquisition of First Data) for our credit card transaction processing and production and our retail banking operations.

22

Data Security

The protection and security of financial and personal information of our consumers is one of our highest priorities. We have implemented a comprehensive
information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards that we believe provide an appropriate level of protection to
maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our Company's and our customers' information. This includes protecting against any known or evolving
threats to the security or integrity of customer records and information, and against unauthorized access to or use of customer records or information.

Our information security program is continuously adapting to an evolving landscape of emerging threats and available technology. Through data gathering and
evaluation of emerging threats from internal and external incidents and technology investment, security controls are adjusted on a continuous basis. We work
directly with our partners on an ongoing basis to expand our intelligence ecosystem and facilitate awareness and communications of events outside of the
Company.

We have developed a security strategy and implemented multiple layers of controls embedded throughout our technology environment that establish multiple
control points between threats and our assets. Our security program is designed to provide oversight of third parties who store, process or have access to
sensitive data, and we require the same level of protection from such third-party service providers. We evaluate the effectiveness of the key security controls
through ongoing assessment and measurement.

In addition, we identify risks that may threaten customer information and utilize both internal and external resources to perform a variety of vulnerability and
penetration testing on the platforms, systems and applications used to provide our products and services. We employ backup and disaster recovery procedures
for all the systems that are used for storing, processing and transferring customer information, and we periodically test and validate our disaster recovery plans.
Further, we regularly utilize independent assessors to evaluate the appropriateness of our overall program. We are compliant with the Payment Card Industry
(PCI) program.

Intellectual Property
____________________________________________________________________________________________

We use a variety of methods, such as trademarks, patents, copyrights and trade secrets, to protect our intellectual property, including our brand, "Synchrony."
We also place appropriate restrictions on our proprietary information to control access and prevent unauthorized disclosures. Our brands are important assets,
and we take steps to protect the value of these assets and our reputation.

Employees
____________________________________________________________________________________________

At December 31, 2019, we had over 16,500 full time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are covered by a collective
bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any material employment-related work stoppages and consider relations with our employees to be good. We
also have relationships with third-party call center providers in the United States and other countries that provide us with additional contractors for customer
service, collections and other functions.

Regulation
____________________________________________________________________________________________

Our business, including our relationships with our customers, is subject to regulation, supervision and examination under U.S. federal, state and foreign laws
and regulations. These laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business, including lending practices, treatment of our customers, safeguarding deposits,
customer privacy and information security, capital structure, liquidity, dividends and other capital distributions, transactions with affiliates, and conduct and
qualifications of personnel.

As a savings and loan holding company and financial holding company, Synchrony is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal
Reserve Board. As a large provider of consumer financial services, we are also subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the CFPB.

23

The Bank is a federally chartered savings association. As such, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency of the U.S. Treasury (the “OCC”), which is its primary regulator, and by the CFPB. In addition, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is
supervised by the FDIC. For a discussion of the specific regulations related to our business see “Regulation—Regulation Relating to Our Business” of this Form
10-K Report.

Competition
____________________________________________________________________________________________

Our industry continues to be highly competitive. We compete for relationships with partners in connection with retaining existing or establishing new consumer
credit programs. Our primary competitors for partners include major financial institutions such as Alliance Data Systems, American Express, Capital One,
JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, TD Bank and Wells Fargo, and to a lesser extent, financial technology companies and potential partners’ own in-house financing
capabilities. We compete for partners on the basis of a number of factors, including program financial and other terms, underwriting standards, marketing
expertise, service levels, product and service offerings (including incentive and loyalty programs), technological capabilities and integration, brand and
reputation. In addition, some of our competitors for partners have a business model that allows for their partners to manage underwriting (e.g., new account
approval), customer service and collections, and other core banking responsibilities that we retain.

We also compete for customer usage of our credit products. Consumer credit provided, and credit card payments made, using our cards constitute only a small
percentage of overall consumer credit provided and credit card payments in the United States. Consumers have numerous financing and payment options
available to them. As a form of payment, our products compete with cash, checks, debit cards, Visa and MasterCard credit cards, as well as American Express,
Discover Card, other private-label card brands, and, to a certain extent, prepaid cards. In the future, we expect our products may face increased competition
from new emerging payment technologies, such as Apple Pay, Chase Pay, Samsung Pay and Square, to the extent that our products are not, or do not
continue to be, accepted in, or compatible with, such technologies. We may also face increased competition from current competitors or others who introduce
or embrace disruptive technology that significantly changes the consumer credit and payment industry. We compete for customers and their usage of our
deposit products, and to minimize transfers to competitors of our customers’ outstanding balances, based on a number of factors, including pricing (interest
rates and fees), product offerings, credit limits, incentives (including loyalty programs) and customer service. Some of our competitors provide a broader
selection of services, including home and automobile loans, debit cards and bank branch ATM access, which may position them better among customers who
prefer to use a single financial institution to meet all of their financial needs. In addition, some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are, may have
substantially greater resources than we do or may offer a broader range of products and services than we do. Moreover, some of our competitors, including
new and emerging competitors in the digital and mobile payments space, are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or legislative scrutiny to which we
are subject, which also could place us at a competitive disadvantage.

In our retail deposits business, we have acquisition and servicing capabilities similar to other direct-banking competitors. We compete for deposits with
traditional banks, and in seeking to grow our direct-banking business, we compete with other banks that have direct-banking models similar to ours, such as
Ally Financial, American Express, Capital One 360 (ING), CIT, Discover, Marcus by Goldman Sachs, PurePoint, Sallie Mae and United Services Automobile
Association (“USAA"). Competition among direct banks is intense because online banking provides customers the ability to quickly and easily deposit and
withdraw funds and open and close accounts in favor of products and services offered by competitors.

Highlights for Year Ended December 31, 2019

Below are highlights of our performance for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, as applicable, except as
otherwise noted.

•

•

•

•

Net earnings increased 34.3% to $3.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, which included the impact of reductions in reserves related to the
sale of the Walmart consumer portfolio of $857 million. The increase in net earnings was also driven primarily by higher net interest income, partially
offset by an increase in retailer share arrangements, and other expense.

Loan receivables decreased 6.4% to $87.2 billion at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018, primarily driven by the sale of loan
receivables associated with the Walmart portfolio. The decrease was partially offset by growth in our remaining loan receivables of 5.2%, driven by
higher purchase volume and average active account growth.

Net interest income increased 4.2% to $16.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher average loan receivables growth,
partially offset by the Walmart consumer portfolio sale and increases in interest expense reflecting higher benchmark interest rates and growth.

Retailer share arrangements increased 24.5% to $3.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to improved performance of the
programs in which we have retailer share arrangements and growth.

• Over-30 day loan delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loan receivables decreased 32 basis points to 4.44% at December 31, 2019 from 4.76%

at December 31, 2018, and net charge-off rate increased 2 basis points to 5.65% for the year ended December 31, 2019.

•

Provision for loan losses decreased by $1.4 billion, or 24.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by reductions in reserves for loan
losses related to the Walmart consumer portfolio sale which was completed in October 2019. The reduction totaled $1.1 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2019. Our allowance coverage ratio (allowance for loan losses as a percentage of end of period loan receivables) decreased to 6.42% at
December 31, 2019, as compared to 6.90% at December 31, 2018.

• Other expense increased by $150 million, or 3.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by the PayPal Credit acquisition in July

2018, and business growth.

•

•

At December 31, 2019, deposits represented 77% of our total funding sources. Total deposits increased 1.8% to $65.1 billion at December 31, 2019,
compared to December 31, 2018. Growth in our direct deposits of 9.7% to $54.2 billion, was partially offset by lower brokered deposits.

In November 2019, we issued depositary shares representing $750 million of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, with dividends payable
quarterly beginning in February 2020.

• On May 9, 2019, we announced that our Board approved a share repurchase program of up to $4.0 billion through June 30, 2020 and increased our
quarterly dividend to $0.22 per common share in the third quarter of 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased $3.6 billion of
our outstanding common stock, and also declared and paid cash dividends of $0.86 per common share, or $581 million.

•

In March 2019, we announced our acquisition of Pets Best and entry into the pet health insurance industry as a managing general agent.

Business Trends and Conditions

We believe our business and results of operations will be impacted in the future by various trends and conditions, including the following:

• Growth in loan receivables and interest income. We believe continuing stability in the U.S. economy and employment rates will contribute to an
increase in consumer credit spending. In addition, we expect the use of credit cards to continue to increase versus other forms of payment such as
cash and checks. We anticipate that these trends, combined with our marketing and partner engagement strategies, will contribute to growth in our loan
receivables. In the near-to-medium term, we expect our total interest income to continue to grow, driven by the expected growth in average loan
receivables. Our historical growth rates in loan receivables and interest income have benefited from new partner acquisitions, and therefore, if we do
not continue to acquire new partners, replace the programs that are not extended or otherwise grow our business, our growth rates in loan receivables
and interest income in the future will be lower than in recent periods. In October 2019, we completed the sale of the Walmart consumer portfolio. Due to
the timing of our prior reclassification of these loan receivables as loan receivables held for sale on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position in
the first quarter of 2019, the sale will not impact our loan receivable growth in 2020. However, we do expect the sale to result in reductions in both our
interest income and the yields generated from our loan receivables. For our ongoing programs, we do not expect to make any significant changes to
customer pricing or merchant discount pricing in the near term other than those associated with changes in the prime rate and London Interbank
Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), and therefore we expect yields generated from interest and fees on loan receivables will remain relatively stable.

•

•

Adoption of ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments-Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“CECL”). We have
adopted the new accounting standard for credit losses effective January 1, 2020. This new guidance replaces the existing incurred loss impairment
guidance with a new impairment model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) model, which is based on expected credit losses. While
we continue to finalize our estimate and assumptions, we estimate the adoption will result in an increase of approximately $3.0 billion, or 54%, to the
Company’s allowance for loan losses. This will also result in a corresponding significant increase to our allowance coverage ratio. As required under the
new guidance, upon adoption in the first quarter of 2020, we will record a net decrease to retained earnings in our Consolidated Statement of Financial
Position of approximately $2.3 billion. Such decrease will also result in a reduction in the Company’s Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of
approximately 60 basis points per year, during the phase-in period permitted by the federal banking agencies, which runs through 2023. Following
adoption of the new CECL guidance, upon origination of a loan, the estimate of expected credit losses, and any subsequent changes to our estimates
of total expected losses for our loan receivables, will be recorded through provision for loan losses in our Consolidated Statement of Earnings.

Asset quality. In 2019, net charge-off rates were relatively flat compared to 2018, increasing slightly by 2 basis points to 5.65% for the year ended
December 31, 2019, reflecting stable U.S. unemployment rates and consumer confidence. Delinquency metrics improved at December 31, 2019
compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by the effects of the sale of the Walmart consumer portfolio. The assessment of our
credit profile includes the evaluation of portfolio mix, account maturation, as well as broader consumer trends, such as payment behavior and overall
indebtedness. We expect our net charge-off rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 to decrease slightly from 2019, primarily due to the effects of
the Walmart consumer portfolio sale. We expect credit trends in the near term for our ongoing portfolio to be relatively stable. However, we do expect
Provision for Loan Losses in our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position to increase in 2020 due to two significant factors that do not impact the
asset quality of our ongoing programs. The increase will be driven by the comparability to the reductions in reserves experienced in 2019 related to the
Walmart portfolio and also from the effects of the new CECL guidance discussed above.

34

•

•

Retailer share arrangement payments under our program agreements. We believe that the payments we make to our partners under our retailer
share arrangements, for our on-going programs, in the aggregate, are likely to increase in absolute terms compared to the year ended December 31,
2019, primarily as a result of both the overall growth, mix and the performance of our programs. This increase is expected to be largely offset by the
impact of the sale of the Walmart consumer portfolio. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Retailer Share Arrangements for additional
information on these agreements.

Extended duration of our Retail Card program agreements. Our Retail Card program agreements typically have contract terms ranging from
approximately five to ten years, and the average length of our relationship with our Retail Card partners is 21 years. We expect to continue to benefit
from these programs on a long-term basis.

A total of 20 of our 25 ongoing Retail Card program agreements have an expiration date in 2022 or beyond. These 20 program agreements
represented in the aggregate 98% of both our Retail Card interest and fees on loans for the year ended December 31, 2019 and of our Retail Card loan
receivables at December 31, 2019 attributable to our ongoing programs.

• Growth in interchange revenues and loyalty program costs. We believe that as a result of the overall growth in Dual Card and general purpose co-
branded credit card transactions occurring outside of our Retail Card partners’ locations, interchange revenues will continue to increase in excess of the
growth of our Retail Card loan receivables. The expected growth in these transactions is driven, in part, by both existing and new loyalty programs with
our Retail Card partners. In addition, we continue to offer and add new loyalty programs for our private label credit cards, for which we typically do not
receive interchange fees. The growth in these existing and new loyalty programs will result in an increase in costs associated with these programs.
Overall, we expect our loyalty program costs to continue to be largely offset by our interchange revenues. These changes have been contemplated in
our program agreements with our Retail Card partners and are a component of the calculation of our payments due under our retailer share
arrangements.

•

Capital and liquidity levels. We continue to expect to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity resources to support our daily operations, our business
growth, and our credit ratings as well as regulatory and compliance requirements in a cost effective and prudent manner through expected and
unexpected market environments. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we declared and paid dividends of $581 million and repurchased $3.6
billion of our outstanding common stock. We plan to continue to deploy capital through both dividends and share repurchases subject to regulatory
approval, as well as to support business growth. In the fourth quarter of 2019 we also issued depositary shares representing $750 million of non-
cumulative perpetual preferred stock, with dividends payable quarterly beginning in February 2020. While we expect to see the adverse impact from
CECL discussed above, we continue to expect to maintain capital ratios well in excess of minimum regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2019, the
Company had a Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio of 14.1%. We expect that our liquidity portfolio will continue to be sufficient to support all of our
business objectives and to meet all regulatory requirements for the foreseeable future. At December 31, 2019, we held excess liquidity of approximately
$3.0 billion due to the recent proceeds from the Walmart consumer portfolio sale. We expect to deploy this excess capital during the first half of 2020,
and we believe our net interest margin will decrease as a result of this excess liquidity held for part of the year.

Seasonality

In our Retail Card and Payment Solutions platforms, we experience fluctuations in transaction volumes and the level of loan receivables as a result of higher
seasonal consumer spending and payment patterns that typically result in an increase of loan receivables from August through a peak in late December, with
reductions in loan receivables occurring over the first and second quarters of the following year as customers pay their balances down.

The seasonal impact to transaction volumes and the loan receivables balance typically results in fluctuations in our results of operations, delinquency metrics
and the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loan receivables between quarterly periods. These fluctuations are generally most evident between
the fourth quarter and the first quarter of the following year.

35

In addition to the seasonal variance in loan receivables discussed above, we also experience a seasonal increase in delinquency rates and delinquent loan
receivables balances during the third and fourth quarters of each year due to lower customer payment rates resulting in higher net charge-off rates in the first
and second quarters. Our delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances typically decrease during the subsequent first and second quarters as
customers begin to pay down their loan balances and return to current status resulting in lower net charge-off rates in the third and fourth quarters. Because
customers who were delinquent during the fourth quarter of a calendar year have a higher probability of returning to current status when compared to
customers who are delinquent at the end of each of our interim reporting periods, we expect that a higher proportion of delinquent accounts outstanding at an
interim period end will result in charge-offs, as compared to delinquent accounts outstanding at a year end. Consistent with this historical experience, we
generally experience a higher allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loan receivables at the end of an interim period, as compared to the end of a
calendar year. In addition, despite improving credit metrics such as declining past due amounts, we may experience an increase in our allowance for loan
losses at an interim period end compared to the prior year end, reflecting these same seasonal trends.

Interest Income

Interest income is comprised of interest and fees on loans, which includes merchant discounts provided by partners to compensate us in almost all cases for all
or part of the promotional financing provided to their customers, and interest on cash and equivalents and investment securities. We include in interest and fees
on loans any past due interest and fees deemed to be collectible. Direct loan origination costs on credit card loans are deferred and amortized on a straight-line
basis over a one-year period and recorded in interest and fees on loans. For non-credit card receivables, direct loan origination costs are deferred and
amortized over the life of the loan and recorded in interest and fees on loans.

We analyze interest income as a function of two principal components: average interest-earning assets and yield on average interest-earning assets. Key
drivers of average interest-earning assets include:

•

•

•

•

•

purchase volumes, which are influenced by a number of factors including macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence generally, our partners’
sales and our ability to increase our share of those sales;

payment rates, reflecting the extent to which customers maintain a credit balance;

charge-offs, reflecting the receivables that are deemed not to be collectible;

the size of our liquidity portfolio; and

portfolio acquisitions when we enter into new partner relationships.

Key drivers of yield on average interest-earning assets include:

•

•

•

•

•

pricing (contractual rates of interest, movement in prime rates, late fees and merchant discount rates);

changes to our mix of loans (e.g., the number of loans bearing promotional rates as compared to standard rates);

frequency of late fees incurred when account holders fail to make their minimum payment by the required due date;

credit performance and accrual status of our loans; and

yield earned on our liquidity portfolio.

Interest income increased by $1,102 million, or 6.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was driven primarily by growth in our average loan
receivables.

The increase in average loan receivables of 6.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 was driven by higher purchase volume and average active account
growth, which included the full year impact from the 2018 PayPal Credit acquisition, partially offset by the Walmart consumer portfolio sale in October 2019.
Purchase volume and average active accounts increased 6.2% and 2.5%, respectively, including the effects of the PayPal Credit acquisition and the Walmart
consumer portfolio sale.

Yield on average interest-earning assets

The yield on average interest-earning assets increased for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to an increase in the percentage of interest-
earning assets attributable to loan receivables. The yield on average loan receivables, including held for sale, decreased 8 basis points to 21.10% for the year
ended December 31, 2019.

Interest Expense

Interest expense is incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities, which consisted of interest-bearing deposit accounts, borrowings of consolidated securitization
entities and senior unsecured notes.

Key drivers of interest expense include:

•

•

•

the amounts outstanding of our deposits and borrowings;

the interest rate environment and its effect on interest rates paid on our funding sources; and

the changing mix in our funding sources.

Interest expense increased by $421 million, or 22.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by higher benchmark interest rates and growth in
our deposit liabilities. Our cost of funds increased to 2.66% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2.30% for the year ended December 31, 2018.

The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily driven by growth in our direct deposits.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income represents the difference between interest income and interest expense.

Net interest income increased by $681 million, or 4.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by higher average loan receivables, partially
offset by the Walmart consumer portfolio sale and increases in interest expense reflecting higher benchmark interest rates and growth in our deposit liabilities.

Retailer Share Arrangements

Most of our Retail Card program agreements and certain other program agreements contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our
partners if the economic performance of the program exceeds a contractually defined threshold. We also provide other economic benefits to our partners such
as royalties on purchase volume or payments for new accounts, in some cases instead of retailer share arrangements (for example, on our co-branded credit
cards). All of these arrangements are designed to align our interests and provide an additional incentive to our partners to promote our credit products. Although
the retailer share arrangements vary by partner, these arrangements are generally structured to measure the economic performance of the program, based
typically on agreed upon program revenues (including interest income and certain other income) less agreed upon program expenses (including interest
expense, provision for loan losses, retailer payments and operating expenses), and share portions of this amount above a negotiated threshold. The threshold
and economic performance of a program that are used to calculate payments to our partners may be based on, among other things, agreed upon measures of
program expenses rather than our actual expenses, and therefore increases in our actual expenses (such as funding costs or operating expenses) may not
necessarily result in reduced payments under our retailer share arrangements. These arrangements are typically designed to permit us to achieve an economic
return before we are required to make payments to our partners based on the agreed contractually defined threshold. Our payments to partners pursuant to
these retailer share arrangements have generally increased in recent years, primarily as a result of the growth and performance of the programs in which we
have retailer share arrangements, as well as changes to the terms of certain program agreements that have been renegotiated in the past few years.

We believe that our retailer share arrangements have been effective in helping us to grow our business by aligning our partners’ interests with ours. We also
believe that the changes to the terms of certain program agreements in recent years will help us to grow our business by providing an additional incentive to the
relevant partners to promote our credit products going forward. Payments to partners pursuant to these retailer share arrangements would generally decrease,
and mitigate the impact on our profitability, in the event of declines in the performance of the programs or the occurrence of other unfavorable developments
that impact the calculation of payments to our partners pursuant to our retailer share arrangements.

Retailer share arrangements increased by $759 million, or 24.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to growth and improved performance of
the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements.

Provision for Loan Losses

Provision for loan losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level to absorb the estimated probable losses
inherent in the loan portfolio at each period end date. Provision for loan losses in each period is a function of net charge-offs (gross charge-offs net of
recoveries) and the required level of the allowance for loan losses. Our process to determine our allowance for loan losses is based upon our estimate of the
incurred loss period for each type of loss (i.e., aged, fraud, deceased, settlement, other non-aged and bankruptcy). See “Critical Accounting Estimates -
Allowance for Loan Losses” and Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements for
additional information on our allowance for loan loss methodology.

Provision for loan losses decreased by $1,365 million, or 24.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by reductions in reserves for loan
losses related to the Walmart consumer portfolio sale which was completed in October 2019. The reductions totaled $1,133 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019. The remaining decrease was primarily driven by lower reserve build, partially offset by higher net charge-offs. Our allowance coverage
ratio decreased to 6.42% at December 31, 2019, as compared to 6.90% at December 31, 2018.

We earn interchange fees on Dual Card and other co-branded credit card transactions outside of our partners’ sales channels, based on a flat fee plus a
percent of the purchase amount. Growth in interchange revenue has been, and is expected to continue to be, driven primarily by growth in our Dual Card and
general purpose co-branded credit card products.

Interchange revenue increased by $38 million, or 5.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by increases in purchase volume outside of our retail
partners' sales channels.

Debt cancellation fees

Debt cancellation fees relate to payment protection products purchased by our credit card customers. Customers who choose to purchase these products are
charged a monthly fee based on their account balance. In return, we will cancel all or a portion of a customer’s credit card balance in the event of certain
qualifying life events. We offer our debt cancellation product to our credit card customers via online, mobile and, on a limited basis, direct mail.

Debt cancellation fees remained relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Loyalty programs

We operate a number of loyalty programs primarily in our Retail Card platform that are designed to generate incremental purchase volume per customer, while
reinforcing the value of the card and strengthening cardholder loyalty. These programs typically provide cardholders with statement credit or cash back rewards.
Other programs include rewards points, which are redeemable for a variety of products or awards, or merchandise discounts that are earned by achieving a
pre-set spending level on their private label credit card, Dual Card or general purpose co-branded credit card. Growth in loyalty program payments has been,
and is expected to continue to be, driven by growth in purchase volume related to existing loyalty programs and the rollout of new loyalty programs.

Loyalty programs cost decreased slightly by $8 million, or 1.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of the Walmart consumer portfolio
sale, partially offset by growth in purchase volume related to our remaining loyalty programs.

Other

Other includes a variety of items including ancillary fees, commission fees related to Pets Best, realized gains or losses associated with investments and sales
of assets and changes in contingent consideration obligations.

Other increased by $62 million, or 159.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to reductions in certain contingent consideration obligations
and commission fees related to Pets Best.

fourth quarter of 2019.

Professional fees

Professional fees consist primarily of outsourced provider fees (e.g., collection agencies and call centers), legal, accounting, consulting, and recruiting
expenses.

Professional fees increased by $61 million, or 7.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to interim servicing costs associated with acquired
portfolios.

Marketing and business development

Marketing and business development costs consist primarily of our contractual and discretionary marketing and business development spend, as well as
amortization expense associated with retail partner contract acquisitions and extensions.

Marketing and business development costs increased by $21 million, or 4.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to strategic investments in
our sales platforms.

Information processing

Information processing costs primarily consist of fees related to outsourced information processing providers, credit card associations and software licensing
agreements.

Information processing costs increased by $59 million, or 13.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher amortization of capitalized
software related to both business growth and strategic investments.

Other

Other primarily consists of postage, operational losses, litigation and regulatory matters expense and various other corporate overhead items such as facilities'
costs and telephone charges. Postage is driven primarily by the number of our active accounts and the percentage of customers that utilize our electronic billing
option. Fraud, or operational losses, are driven primarily by the number of our active Dual Card and general purpose co-branded credit card accounts.

The “other” component decreased by $19 million, or 2.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to lower corporate overhead costs.

Loan Receivables
____________________________________________________________________________________________

Loan receivables are our largest category of assets and represent our primary source of revenues. The following discussion provides supplemental information
regarding our loan receivables portfolio. See Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 4. Loan Receivables and
Allowance for Loan Losses to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our Loan Receivables, including impaired loans and

December 31, 2018. The 32 basis point decrease in 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year was driven by effects of the sale of the Walmart
consumer portfolio.

Net Charge-Offs

Net charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine are uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We exclude
accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and third-party fraud losses from charge-offs. Charged-off and recovered finance charges and fees are included
in interest and fees on loans while third-party fraud losses are included in other expense. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for loan
losses and subsequent recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan losses. Costs incurred to recover charged-off loans
are recorded as collection expense and included in other expense in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

capital resources to support our daily operations, our business growth, our credit ratings and our regulatory and policy requirements, in a cost effective and
prudent manner through expected and unexpected market environments.

Funding Sources

Our primary funding sources include cash from operations, deposits (direct and brokered deposits), securitized financings and senior unsecured notes.

Non-interest-bearing deposits comprise less than 10% of total deposits for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.

Deposits

We obtain deposits directly from retail and commercial customers (“direct deposits”) or through third-party brokerage firms that offer our deposits to their
customers (“brokered deposits”). At December 31, 2019, we had $54.2 billion in direct deposits and $10.9 billion in deposits originated through brokerage firms
(including network deposit sweeps procured through a program arranger that channels brokerage account deposits to us). A key part of our liquidity plan and
funding strategy is to continue to expand our direct deposits base as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding.

Our direct deposits include a range of FDIC-insured deposit products, including certificates of deposit, IRAs, money market accounts and savings accounts.

Brokered deposits are primarily from retail customers of large brokerage firms. We have relationships with 11 brokers that offer our deposits through their
networks. Our brokered deposits consist primarily of certificates of deposit that bear interest at a fixed rate and at December 31, 2019, had a weighted average
remaining life of 2.2 years. These deposits generally are not subject to early withdrawal.

Our ability to attract deposits is sensitive to, among other things, the interest rates we pay, and therefore, we bear funding risk if we fail to pay higher rates, or
interest rate risk if we are required to pay higher rates, to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits. To mitigate these risks, our funding strategy includes a
range of deposit products, and we seek to maintain access to multiple other funding sources, including securitized financings (including our undrawn committed
capacity) and unsecured debt.

Securitized Financings

We have been engaged in the securitization of our credit card receivables since 1997. We access the asset-backed securitization market using the Synchrony
Credit Card Master Note Trust (“SYNCT”) and the Synchrony Card Issuance Trust (“SYNIT”) through which we issue asset-backed securities through both
public transactions and private transactions funded by financial institutions and commercial paper conduits. In addition, we issue asset-backed securities in
private transactions through the Synchrony Sales Finance Master Trust (“SFT”).

At December 31, 2019, we had $2.9 billion of outstanding private asset-backed securities and $7.5 billion of outstanding public asset-backed securities, in each
case held by unrelated third parties.

(1) Excludes any subordinated classes of SYNCT notes and SYNIT notes that we owned at December 31, 2019.

We retain exposure to the performance of trust assets through: (i) in the case of SYNCT, SFT and SYNIT, subordinated retained interests in the loan
receivables transferred to the trust in excess of the principal amount of the notes for a given series that provide credit enhancement for a particular series, as
well as a pari passu seller’s interest in each trust and (ii) in the case of SYNCT and SYNIT, any subordinated classes of notes that we own.

All of our securitized financings include early repayment triggers, referred to as early amortization events, including events related to material breaches of
representations, warranties or covenants, inability or failure of the Bank to transfer loan receivables to the trusts as required under the securitization documents,
failure to make required payments or deposits pursuant to the securitization documents, and certain insolvency-related events with respect to the related
securitization depositor, Synchrony (solely with respect to SYNCT) or the Bank. In addition, an early amortization event will occur with respect to a series if the
excess spread as it relates to a particular series or for the trust, as applicable, falls below zero. Following an early amortization event, principal collections on
the loan receivables in the applicable trust are applied to repay principal of the trust's asset-backed securities rather than being available on a revolving basis to
fund the origination activities of our business. The occurrence of an early amortization event also would limit or terminate our ability to issue future series out of
the trust in which the early amortization event occurred. No early amortization event has occurred with respect to any of the securitized financings in SYNCT,
SFT or SYNIT.

Short-Term Borrowings

Except as described above, there were no material short-term borrowings for the periods presented.

Other

At December 31, 2019, we had more than $25.0 billion of unencumbered assets in the Bank available to be used to generate additional liquidity through
secured borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged to the Federal Reserve Board for credit at the discount window.

Covenants

The indenture pursuant to which our senior unsecured notes have been issued includes various covenants, including covenants that restrict (subject to certain
exceptions) Synchrony’s ability to dispose of, or incur liens on, any of the voting stock of the Bank or otherwise permit the Bank to be merged, consolidated,
leased or sold in a manner that results in the Bank being less than 80% controlled by us.

were in compliance with all of these covenants at December 31, 2019.

At December 31, 2019, we were not in default under any of our credit facilities.

Credit Ratings

Our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets, including securitizations and senior and subordinated debt, may be affected by the credit ratings
of the Company, the Bank and the ratings of our asset-backed securities.

In addition, certain of the asset-backed securities issued by SYNCT and SYNIT are rated by Fitch, S&P and/or Moody’s. A credit rating is not a recommendation
to buy, sell or hold securities, may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated
independently of any other rating. Downgrades in these credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the
capital markets.

Liquidity
____________________________________________________________________________________________

We seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations, fund asset growth, satisfy debt obligations and to meet regulatory
expectations under normal and stress conditions.

We maintain policies outlining the overall framework and general principles for managing liquidity risk across our business, which is the responsibility of our
Asset and Liability Management Committee, a subcommittee of the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors. We employ a variety of metrics to monitor and
manage liquidity. We perform regular liquidity stress testing and contingency planning as part of our liquidity management process. We evaluate a range of
stress scenarios including Company specific and systemic events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs.

We maintain a liquidity portfolio, which at December 31, 2019 had $17.3 billion of liquid assets, primarily consisting of cash and equivalents and short-term
obligations of the U.S. Treasury, less cash in transit which is not considered to be liquid, compared to $14.8 billion of liquid assets at December 31, 2018. The
increase in liquid assets was primarily due to excess liquidity of approximately $3.0 billion we are holding from the proceeds from the sale of the Walmart
portfolio. In October 2019, we completed our sale of $8.2 billion of loan receivables associated with our Retail Card program agreement with Walmart.

As additional sources of liquidity, at December 31, 2019, we had an aggregate of $5.6 billion of undrawn committed capacity on our securitized financings,
subject to customary borrowing conditions, from private lenders under our securitization programs and $0.5 billion of undrawn committed capacity under our
unsecured revolving credit facility with private lenders, and we had more than $25.0 billion of unencumbered assets in the Bank available to be used to
generate additional liquidity through secured borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged to the Federal Reserve Board for credit at the discount window.

48

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As a general matter, investments included in our liquidity portfolio are expected to be highly liquid, giving us the ability to readily convert them to cash. The level
and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based upon the level of expected maturities of our funding sources as well as operational requirements
and market conditions.

We rely significantly on dividends and other distributions and payments from the Bank for liquidity; however, bank regulations, contractual restrictions and other
factors limit the amount of dividends and other distributions and payments that the Bank may pay to us. For a discussion of regulatory restrictions on the Bank’s
ability to pay dividends, see “Regulation—Risk Factors Relating to Regulation—We are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and
repurchase our common stock; the Bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us, which could limit our ability to pay dividends,
repurchase our common stock or make payments on our indebtedness.” and “Regulation—Savings Association Regulation—Dividends and Stock
Repurchases.”

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
____________________________________________________________________________________________

Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a
position or portfolio. We are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates. See “Risks—Risk Factors Relating to Our Business—Changes in
market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings, funding and liquidity” and “—A reduction in our credit ratings could materially
increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets.”

Interest Rate Risk

We borrow money from a variety of depositors and institutions in order to provide loans to our customers. Changes in market interest rates cause our net
interest income to increase or decrease, as some of our assets and liabilities carry interest rates that fluctuate with market benchmarks. The interest rate
benchmark for our floating rate assets is generally the prime rate, and the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate liabilities is generally either LIBOR or the
federal funds rate. The prime rate and the LIBOR or federal funds rate could reset at different times or could diverge, leading to mismatches in the interest rates
on our floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities.

Competitive factors and future regulatory reform may limit or restrict our ability to raise interest rates on our loans. In addition, some of our program agreements
limit the rate of interest we can charge to customers. If interest rates were to rise materially over a sustained period of time, and we are unable to sufficiently
raise our interest rates in a timely manner, our net interest income and margin could be adversely impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our
net earnings.

Interest rates may also adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. Our floating rate
products bear interest rates that fluctuate with the prime rate. Higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other
lenders under mortgage, credit card and other consumer loans, which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and
therefore lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs and allowances for loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings.

Changes in interest rates and competitor responses to these changes may also impact customer decisions to maintain deposits with us, and reductions in
deposits could materially adversely affect our funding costs and liquidity.

At December 31, 2019, 54.3% of our loan receivables were priced at a fixed interest rate to the customer, with the remaining 45.7% at a floating interest rate.
We fund our assets with a combination of fixed rate and floating rate funding sources that include deposits, asset-backed securities and unsecured debt. To
manage interest rate risk, we seek to match the interest rate repricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities. Historically, we have not used interest rate
derivative contracts to manage interest rate risk; however, we may choose to do so in the future. To the extent we are unable to effectively match the interest
rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities, our net earnings could be materially adversely affected.

We assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect of various interest rate scenarios on our net interest income.

49

For purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical, adverse change in interest rates over the 12-month period from our reporting date, we
assume that all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be impacted by a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates
as of the beginning of the period. The sensitivity is based upon the hypothetical assumption that all relevant types of interest rates that affect our results would
increase or decrease instantaneously, simultaneously and to the same degree.

Our interest rate sensitive assets include our variable rate loan receivables and the assets that make up our liquidity portfolio. At December 31, 2019, 45.7% of
our receivables were priced at a floating interest rate. Assets with rates that are fixed at period end but which will mature, or otherwise contractually reset to a
market-based indexed rate or other fixed rate prior to the end of the 12-month period, are considered to be rate sensitive. The latter category includes certain
loans that may be offered at below-market rates for an introductory period, such as balance transfers and special promotional programs, after which the loans
will contractually reprice under standard terms in accordance with our normal market-based pricing structure. For purposes of measuring rate sensitivity for
such loans, only the effect of the hypothetical 100 basis point change in the underlying market-based indexed rate or other fixed rate has been considered
rather than the full change in the rate to which the loan would contractually reprice (i.e. assets are categorized as fixed or floating according to their underlying
contractual terms). For assets that have a fixed interest rate at the period end but which contractually will, or are assumed to, reset to a market-based indexed
rate or other fixed rate during the next 12 months, net interest income sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date.

Interest rate sensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next 12-month period. Thus, liabilities
that vary with changes in a market-based index, such as the federal funds rate or LIBOR, which will reset before the end of the 12-month period, or liabilities
whose rates are fixed at the period end but which will mature and are assumed to be replaced with a market-based indexed rate prior to the end of the 12-
month period, also are considered to be rate sensitive. For these fixed rate liabilities, net interest income sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing
date.

The following table presents the approximate net interest income impacts forecasted over the next twelve months from an immediate and parallel change in
interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at December 31, 2019.

Limitations of Market Risk Measures

The interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information, internally-developed assumptions and proprietary
modeling methodologies, which project borrower and deposit behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments. Other market inputs, such as interest
rates, market prices and interest rate volatility, are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures. We regularly evaluate, update and enhance these
assumptions, models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior
patterns of our existing assets and liabilities.

There are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. The sensitivity analysis provided above
contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is based on the existing balance sheet as well as assumptions around future growth, pricing and
balance sheet composition. It does not attempt to estimate the effect of a more significant interest rate increase over a sustained period of time, which as
described in “—Interest Rate Risk” above, could adversely affect our net interest income. In addition, the strategic actions that management may take to
manage our balance sheet may differ from our projections, which could cause our actual net interest income to differ from the above sensitivity analysis.

Capital
____________________________________________________________________________________________

Our primary sources of capital have been earnings generated by our business and existing equity capital. We seek to manage capital to a level and
composition sufficient to support the risks of our business, meet regulatory requirements, adhere to rating agency targets and support future business growth.
The level, composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment, strategic initiatives and legislative and regulatory
developments. Within these constraints, we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that will provide attractive returns to our stockholders.

Synchrony is not currently required to conduct stress tests. See “Regulation—Regulation Relating to Our Business—Legislative and Regulatory Developments.”
In addition, while as a savings and loan holding company, we have not been subject to the Federal Reserve Board's capital planning rule to-date, we have
submitted a capital plan to the Federal Reserve Board in 2019. While not required, our capital plan process does include certain internal stress testing. See
“Regulation—Regulation Relating to Our Business—Legislative and Regulatory Developments”, for discussion of the final rules issued by the Federal Reserve
Board on October 10, 2019, related to the Federal Reserve Boards enhanced prudential standards and their applicability to savings and loan holding
companies.

On May 9, 2019, we announced that our Board plans to increase our quarterly dividend to $0.22 per common share commencing in the third quarter of 2019.
Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we issued depositary shares representing $750 million of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, with dividends
payable quarterly, beginning in February 2020. The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common and preferred stock will be at the
discretion of the Board and will depend on many factors. For a discussion of regulatory and other restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and repurchase
stock, see “Regulation—Risk Factors Relating to Regulation—We are subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends and repurchase its common
stock; the Bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to Synchrony, which could limit Synchrony's ability to pay dividends, repurchase its

complete the share repurchase program by the end of the second quarter of 2020. We made and expect to continue to make, share repurchases subject to
market conditions and other factors, including legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals.

Regulatory Capital Requirements - Synchrony Financial

As a savings and loan holding company, we are required to maintain minimum capital ratios, under the applicable U.S. Basel III capital rules. For more
information, see “Regulation—Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation.”

For Synchrony Financial to be a well-capitalized savings and loan holding company, Synchrony Bank must be well-capitalized and Synchrony Financial must
not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Federal Reserve Board to meet and maintain
a specific capital level for any capital measure. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, Synchrony Financial met all the requirements to be deemed well-
capitalized.

The following table sets forth the composition of our capital ratios for the Company calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach rules at December 31,
2019 and 2018, respectively.

The slight increase in our Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio compared to the prior year was primarily due a decrease in loan receivables and corresponding
decline in our risk-weighted assets as a result of the Walmart portfolio sale, partially offset by dividends and share repurchases. The increase in our Tier 1
capital ratio was primarily due to our issuance of depositary shares representing $750 million of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock in the fourth quarter
of 2019, and the factors outlined above.

Regulatory Capital Requirements - Synchrony Bank

At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Bank met all applicable requirements to be deemed well-capitalized pursuant to OCC regulations and for purposes of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The following table sets forth the composition of the Bank’s capital ratios calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach

Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if
undertaken, could limit our business activities and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “Regulation
—Risk Factors Relating to Regulation—Failure by Synchrony and the Bank to meet applicable capital adequacy and liquidity requirements could have a
material adverse effect on us.”

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Unfunded Lending Commitments
____________________________________________________________________________________________

We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantees of third-party obligations. Guarantees are contracts or indemnification
agreements that contingently require us to make a guaranteed payment or perform an obligation to a third-party based on certain trigger events. At
December 31, 2019, we had not recorded any contingent liabilities in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position related to any guarantees. See Note 9 -
Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements for information on contingent consideration liabilities related to business acquisitions.

We extend credit, primarily arising from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on our credit cards, in the ordinary course of business. Each
unused credit card line is unconditionally cancellable by us. See Note 4. Loan Receivables and Allowance for Loan Losses to our consolidated financial
statements for more information on our unfunded lending commitments.

Contractual Obligations
____________________________________________________________________________________________

In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that require future cash payments. Our future cash payments associated with our

(1) Savings accounts (including money market accounts), brokered network deposits sweeps, and non-interest-bearing deposits are assumed for purposes of this table to be

due in 2020 because they may be withdrawn at any time without payment of any penalty.

(2) Deposits do not include interest payments because the amount and timing of these payments cannot be reasonably estimated as certain deposits have early withdrawal

rights and also the option to roll interest payments into the balance. The average interest rate on our interest-bearing deposits for the year ended December 31, 2019 was
2.4%. See Note 7. Deposits to our consolidated financial statements.

(3) Amounts shown exclude interest on floating rate borrowings. See Note 8. Borrowings to our consolidated financial statements for additional information, including weighted

average interest rates at December 31, 2019.

(4) Purchase obligations at December 31, 2019 reflect the minimum purchase obligation under legally binding contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and

determinable. These amounts exclude obligations for goods and services that already have been incurred and are reflected on our Consolidated Statement of Financial
Position.

(5) The table above does not include estimated payments of liabilities associated with uncertain income tax positions.  The inherent complexity and uncertainty around the
timing and amount of future outflows for uncertain tax positions do not permit a reasonably reliable estimate of payments, if any, to be made in connection with these
liabilities. At December 31, 2019, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $255 million, excluding related interest and penalties.  See Note 14. Income Taxes to the consolidated
financial statements.

(6) The table above excludes our reimbursement obligations to GE for certain retiree benefits obligations of $210 million at December 31, 2019. See Note 11. Employee Benefit

Critical Accounting Estimates
____________________________________________________________________________________________

In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we have identified certain accounting estimates and assumptions that we consider to be the most critical to
an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. The critical accounting estimates we have identified
relate to allowance for loan losses and fair value measurements. These estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates future,
economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. If these conditions change from
those expected, it is reasonably possible that these judgments and estimates could change, which may result in incremental losses on loan receivables, or
material changes to our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, among other effects. See Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements, which discusses the significant accounting policies related to these estimates.

Allowance for Loan Losses

Losses on loan receivables are recognized when they are incurred, which requires us to make our best estimate of probable losses in the portfolio. The method
for calculating the best estimate of probable losses takes into account our historical experience, adjusted for current conditions with each product and customer
type, and our judgment concerning the probable effects of relevant observable data, trends and market factors.

We evaluate each portfolio quarterly. For credit card receivables, our estimation process includes analysis of historical data, and there is a significant amount of
judgment applied in selecting inputs and analyzing the results produced by the models to determine the allowance. Our risk process includes standards and
policies for reviewing major risk exposures and concentrations, and evaluates relevant data either for individual loans or on a portfolio basis, as appropriate.
More specifically, we use a migration analysis to estimate the likelihood that a loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency. The migration
analysis considers uncollectible principal, interest and fees reflected in the loan receivables. We use other analyses to estimate losses incurred on non-
delinquent accounts. The considerations in these analyses include past performance, risk management techniques applied to various accounts, historical
behavior of different account vintages, current economic conditions, recent trends in delinquencies, bankruptcy filings, account collection management, policy
changes, account seasoning, loan volume and amounts, payment rates, forecasting uncertainties and a qualitative assessment of the adequacy of the
allowance for losses, which compares this allowance for losses to projected net charge-offs over the next 12 months, in a manner consistent with regulatory
guidance. We do not evaluate credit card loans for impairment on an individual basis, but instead estimate its allowance for credit card loan losses on a portfolio
basis. Further, experience is not available for new portfolios; therefore, while we are developing that experience, we set loss allowances based on our
experience with the most closely analogous products in our portfolio. The underlying assumptions, estimates and assessments we use to provide for losses are
updated periodically to reflect our view of current conditions and are subject to the regulatory examination process, which can result in changes to our
assumptions. Changes in such estimates can significantly affect the allowance and provision for losses. It is possible that we will experience credit losses that
are different from our current estimates.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments which is effective
for the Company on January 1, 2020. This ASU replaces the existing accounting standard for credit losses and will change the accounting model for how credit
losses will be recognized in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — New
Accounting Standards, to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the new accounting standard for credit losses and its
expected impact to the Company’s allowance for loan losses.

Fair Value Measurements

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value every reporting period include investments in debt and equity securities as well as contingent consideration
obligations. Assets that are not measured at fair value every reporting period, but that are subject to fair value measurements in certain circumstances, primarily
include acquired loans, loans that have been reduced to fair value when they are held for sale, impaired loans that have been reduced based on the fair value
of the underlying collateral, cost method and equity method investments that are written down to fair value when they are impaired.

Assets that are written down to fair value when impaired are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs. A fair value measurement
is determined as the price that we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. In the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market
observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction
that occurs at the measurement date. The determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an
appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums, identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions, weighting those
differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to our asset being valued.

RISKS

Risk Factors Relating to Our Business
____________________________________________________________________________________________

The following discussion of risk factors contains “forward-looking statements,” as discussed in “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be
read in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (MD&A), the consolidated financial
statements and related notes in “Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and “Regulation—Risk Factors Relating to Regulation” of this
Form 10-K Report.

Our business routinely encounters and address risks, some of which will cause our future results to be different - sometimes materially different - than we
anticipate. Discussion about important operational risks that our business encounters can be found in the business descriptions in “Our Business” and the
MD&A section of this Form 10-K Report. Below, we describe certain important strategic, operational, financial, and legal and compliance risks. Our reactions to
material future developments as well as our competitors’ reactions to those developments will affect our future results.

Macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Key macroeconomic conditions historically have affected our business, results of operations and financial condition and are likely to affect them in the future.
Consumer confidence, unemployment and other economic indicators are among the factors that often impact consumer spending behavior and demand for
credit. Poor economic conditions reduce the usage of our credit cards and other financing products and the average purchase amount of transactions on our
credit cards and through our other products, which, in each case, reduces our interest and fee income. We rely primarily on interest and fees on our loan
receivables to generate our net earnings. Our interest and fees on our loan receivables was $18.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Poor
economic conditions also adversely affect the ability and willingness of customers to pay amounts owed to us, increasing delinquencies, bankruptcies, charge-
offs and allowances for loan losses, and decreasing recoveries. For example, our over-30 day delinquency rate as a percentage of period-end loan receivables
was 8.25% at December 31, 2009 during the financial crisis, compared to 4.44% at December 31, 2019, and our full-year net charge-off rate was 11.26% for
the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to 5.65% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The assessment of our credit profile includes the evaluation of
portfolio mix, account maturation, as well as broader consumer trends, such as payment behavior and overall indebtedness.

Economic growth in the United States can slow due to higher unemployment rates, lower housing values, concerns about the level of U.S. government debt
and fiscal actions that may be taken to address this, as well as economic and political conditions in the U.S. and global markets. A prolonged period of slow
economic growth or a significant deterioration in economic conditions or broader consumer trends, including wage growth, savings rates and consumer
indebtedness, would likely affect consumer spending levels and the ability and willingness of customers to pay amounts owed to us, and could have a material
adverse effect on our business, key credit trends, results of operations and financial condition.

Macroeconomic conditions may also cause net earnings to fluctuate and diverge from expectations of securities analysts and investors, who may have differing
assumptions regarding the impact of these conditions on our business, and this may adversely impact our stock price.

Our results of operations and growth depend on our ability to retain existing partners and attract new partners.

Substantially all of our revenue is generated from the credit products we provide to customers of our partners pursuant to program agreements we enter into
with our partners. As a result, our results of operations and growth depend on our ability to retain existing partners and attract new partners. Historically, there
has been turnover in our partners, and we expect this will continue in the future. For example, in 2018, we announced that we would not be renewing our Retail
Card program agreement with Walmart.

56

Program agreements with our Retail Card partners and national and regional retailer and manufacturer Payment Solutions partners typically are for multi-year
terms. These program agreements generally permit our partner to terminate the agreement prior to its scheduled termination date for various reasons,
including, in some cases, if we fail to meet certain service levels or change certain key cardholder terms or our credit criteria, we fail to achieve certain targets
with respect to approvals of new customers as a result of the credit criteria we use, we elect not to increase the program size when the outstanding loan
receivables under the program reach certain thresholds or we are not adequately capitalized, or certain force majeure events or changes in our ownership
occur or a material adverse change in our financial condition occurs. A few Payment Solutions programs with national and regional retailer and manufacturer
partners also may be terminated at will by the partner on specified notice to us (e.g., several months). In addition, programs with manufacturers, buying groups
and industry associations generally are made available to Payment Solutions partners such as individual retail outlets, dealers and merchants under dealer
agreements, which typically may be terminated at will by the partner on short notice to us (e.g., 15 days).

There is significant competition for our existing partners, and our failure to retain our existing larger partner relationships upon the expiration or our earlier loss
of a relationship upon the exercise of a partner’s early termination rights, or the expiration or termination of a substantial number of smaller partner
relationships, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations (including growth rates) and financial condition to the extent we do not acquire
new partners of similar size and profitability or otherwise grow our business. In addition, existing relationships may be renewed with less favorable terms to the
Company in response to increased competition for such relationships. The competition for new partners is also significant, and our failure to attract new
partners could adversely affect our ability to grow.

A significant percentage of our interest and fees on loans comes from relationships with a small number of Retail Card partners, and the loss of any
of these Retail Card partners could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Based upon interest and fees on loans for the year ended December 31, 2019, excluding the Walmart program discussed above, our five largest programs are
Gap, JCPenney, Lowe’s, PayPal and Sam’s Club. These programs accounted in aggregate for 47% of our total interest and fees on loans for the year ended
December 31, 2019 and 48% of loan receivables at December 31, 2019. Our programs with Lowe's and PayPal each accounted for more than 10% of our total
interest and fees on loans for the year ended December 31, 2019. See "Our Business—Our Sales Platforms—Retail Card Partners."

The program agreements generally permit us or our partner to terminate the agreement prior to its scheduled termination date under various circumstances as
described in the preceding risk factor. Some of our program agreements also provide that, upon expiration or termination, our partner may purchase or
designate a third party to purchase the accounts and loans generated with respect to its program and all related customer data. The loss of any of our largest
partners or a material reduction in the interest and fees we receive from their customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial condition.

Our business is heavily concentrated in U.S. consumer credit, and therefore our results are more susceptible to fluctuations in that market than a
more diversified company.

Our business is heavily concentrated in U.S. consumer credit. As a result, we are more susceptible to fluctuations and risks particular to U.S. consumer credit
than a more diversified company. For example, our business is particularly sensitive to macroeconomic conditions that affect the U.S. economy, consumer
spending and consumer credit. We are also more susceptible to the risks of increased regulations and legal and other regulatory actions that are targeted at
consumer credit or the specific consumer credit products that we offer (including promotional financing). Due to our CareCredit platform, we are also more
susceptible to increased regulations and legal and other regulatory actions targeted at healthcare related procedures or services, in contrast to other industries.
Our business concentration could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

57

Our results depend, to a significant extent, on the active and effective promotion and support of our products by our partners.

Our partners generally accept most major credit cards and various other forms of payment, and therefore our success depends on their active and effective
promotion of our products to their customers. We depend on our partners to integrate the use of our credit products into their store culture by training their sales
associates about our products, having their sales associates encourage their customers to apply for, and use, our products and otherwise effectively marketing
our products. In addition, although our Retail Card programs and our Payment Solutions programs with national and regional retailer partners typically are
exclusive with respect to the credit products we offer at that partner, some Payment Solutions programs and most CareCredit provider relationships are not
exclusive to us, and therefore a partner may choose to promote a competitor’s financing over ours, depending upon cost, availability or attractiveness to
consumers or other factors. Typically, we do not have, or utilize, any recourse against these non-exclusive partners when they do not sufficiently promote our
products. Partners may also implement or fail to implement changes in their systems and technologies that may disrupt the integration between their systems
and technologies and ours, which could disrupt the use of our products. The failure by our partners to effectively promote and support our products as well as
changes they may make in their business models that negatively impact card usage could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of
operations. In addition, if our partners engage in improper business practices, do not adhere to the terms of our program agreements or other contractual
arrangements or standards, or otherwise diminish the value of our brand, we may suffer reputational damage and customers may be less likely to use our
products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Cyber-attacks or other security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business.

In the normal course of business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential information regarding our partners and our customers. We also have
arrangements in place with our partners and other third parties through which we share and receive information about their customers who are or may become
our customers. Although we devote significant resources and management focus to ensuring the integrity of our systems through information security and
business continuity programs, our facilities and systems, and those of our partners and third-party service providers, are vulnerable to external or internal
security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming or human errors, or other similar events. We and our partners and
third-party service providers have experienced all of these events in the past and expect to continue to experience them in the future. These events could
interrupt our business or operations, result in significant legal and financial exposure, supervisory liability, damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in
the security of our systems, products and services. Although the impact to date from these events has not had a material adverse effect on us, we cannot be
sure this will be the case in the future.

Information security risks for large financial institutions like us have increased recently in part because of new technologies, the use of the internet and
telecommunications technologies (including mobile and other connected devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased
sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others. In addition to cyber-attacks or other security breaches
involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information, hackers recently have engaged in attacks against large financial institutions that are designed to
disrupt key business services, such as consumer-facing web sites. Our business performance and marketing efforts may increase our profile and therefore our
risk of being targeted for cyber-attacks and other security breaches, including attacks targeting our key business services, websites, executives, and partners.
We are not able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used
change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. We employ detection and response mechanisms designed to contain and
mitigate security incidents, but early detection may be thwarted by sophisticated attacks and malware designed to avoid detection.

58

We also face risks related to cyber-attacks and other security breaches in connection with credit card and deposit transactions that typically involve the
transmission of sensitive information regarding our customers through various third-parties, including our partners, retailers that are not our partners where our
Dual Cards and general purpose co-branded credit cards are used, merchant acquiring banks, payment processors, card networks (e.g., Visa and MasterCard)
and our processors (e.g., First Data and Fiserv). Some of these parties have in the past been the target of security breaches and cyber-attacks, and because
the transactions involve third parties and environments such as the point of sale that we do not control or secure, future security breaches or cyber-attacks
affecting any of these third parties could impact us through no fault of our own, and in some cases, we may have exposure and suffer losses for breaches or
attacks relating to them. We also rely on numerous other third-party service providers to conduct other aspects of our business operations and face similar risks
relating to them. While we regularly conduct security assessments of significant third-party service providers, we cannot be sure that their information security
protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyber-attack or other security breach.

The access by unauthorized persons to, or the improper disclosure by us of, confidential information regarding our customers or our own proprietary
information, software, methodologies and business secrets could interrupt our business or operations, result in significant legal and financial exposure,
supervisory liability, damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems, products and services, all of which could have a material
adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there have been a number of well-publicized attacks or breaches
directed at others in our industry that have heightened concern by consumers generally about the security of using credit cards, which have caused some
consumers, including our customers, to use our credit cards less in favor of alternative methods of payment and has led to increased regulatory focus on, and
potentially new regulations relating to, these matters. Further cyber-attacks or other breaches in the future, whether affecting us or others, could intensify
consumer concern and regulatory focus and result in reduced use of our cards and increased costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our
business.

Disruptions in the operation of our computer systems and data centers could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our ability to deliver products and services to our partners and our customers, service our loans and otherwise operate our business and comply with
applicable laws depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer systems and data centers, as well as those of our partners and third-party
service providers. These computer systems and data centers may encounter service interruptions at any time due to system or software failure, natural disaster
or other reasons. In addition, the implementation of technology changes and upgrades to maintain current and integrate new systems may also cause service
interruptions, transaction processing errors and system conversion delays and may cause our failure to comply with applicable laws, all of which could have a
material adverse effect on our business.

We expect that new technologies and business processes applicable to the consumer credit industry will continue to emerge, and these new technologies and
business processes may be better than those we currently use. The pace of technology change is high and our industry is intensely competitive, and we cannot
assure you that we will be able to sustain our investment in new technology as critical systems and applications become obsolete and better ones become
available. A failure to maintain current technology and business processes could cause disruptions in our operations or cause our products and services to be
less competitive, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

59

Our results are impacted, to a significant extent, by the financial performance of our partners.

Our ability to generate new loans and the interest and fees and other income associated with them is dependent upon sales of merchandise and services by
our partners. The retail and healthcare industries in which our partners operate are intensely competitive. Our partners compete with retailers and department
stores in their own geographic areas, as well as catalog and internet sales businesses. Our partners in the healthcare industry compete with other healthcare
providers. Our partners’ sales may decrease or may not increase as we anticipate for various reasons, some of which are in the partners’ control and some of
which are not. For example, partner sales may be adversely affected by macroeconomic conditions having a national, regional or more local effect on consumer
spending, business conditions affecting the general retail environment or a particular partner or industry, or catastrophes affecting broad or more discrete
geographic areas. If our partners’ sales decline for any reason, it generally results in lower credit sales, and therefore lower loan volume and associated interest
and fees and other income for us from their customers. In addition, if a partner closes some or all of its stores or becomes subject to a voluntary or involuntary
bankruptcy proceeding (or if there is a perception that it may become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding), its customers who have used our financing products
may have less incentive to pay their outstanding balances to us, which could result in higher charge-off rates than anticipated and our costs for servicing its
customers’ accounts may increase. This risk is particularly acute with respect to our largest partners that account for a significant amount of our interest and
fees on loans. See “—A significant percentage of our interest and fees on loans comes from relationships with a small number of Retail Card partners, and the
loss of any of these Retail Card partners could adversely affect our business and results of operations.” Moreover, if the financial condition of a partner
deteriorates significantly or a partner becomes subject to a bankruptcy proceeding, we may not be able to recover for customer returns, customer payments
made in partner stores or other amounts due to us from the partner. A decrease in sales by our partners for any reason or a bankruptcy proceeding involving
any of them could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

Our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to cover losses on our loans.

We maintain an allowance for loan losses (a reserve established through a provision for losses charged to expense) that we believe is appropriate at
December 31, 2019 to provide for incurred losses in our loan portfolio. In addition, for portfolios we may acquire when we enter into new partner program
agreements, any deterioration in the performance of the purchased portfolios after acquisition results in incremental loss reserves. Growth in our loan portfolio
generally would lead to an increase in the allowance for loan losses.

The process for establishing an allowance for loan losses is critical to our results of operations and financial condition, and requires complex models and
judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions. In addition, effective January 1, 2020, the Company will adopt ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-
Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires us to adopt a new impairment model, known as the CECL model. The
new model will require, upon origination of a loan, the recognition of all expected credit losses over the life of the loan based on historical experience, current
conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding our loans and other
factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for credit losses. We may underestimate our expected losses and fail to
maintain an allowance for credit losses sufficient to account for these losses. In cases where we modify a loan, if the modified loans do not perform as
anticipated, we may be required to establish additional allowances on these loans.

We will continue to periodically review and update our new methodology, models and the underlying assumptions, estimates and assessments we use to
establish our allowance for credit losses to reflect our view of current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Moreover, our regulators, as part of
their supervisory function, periodically review our methodology, models and the underlying assumptions, estimates and assessments we use for calculating,
and the adequacy of, our allowance for credit losses. Our regulators, based on their judgment, may conclude that we should modify our current methodology,
models or the underlying assumptions, estimates and assessments, increase our allowance for credit losses and/or recognize further losses. We will implement
further enhancements or changes to our methodology, models and the underlying assumptions, estimates and assessments, as needed.

We cannot assure you that our loan loss reserves will be sufficient to cover actual losses. Future increases in the allowance for credit losses or actual losses
(as a result of any review, update, regulatory guidance or otherwise) will result in a decrease in net earnings and capital and could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

60

If assumptions or estimates we use in preparing our financial statements, including those related to the new CECL accounting guidance effective
for our Company on January 1, 2020, are incorrect or are required to change, our reported results of operations and financial condition may be
adversely affected.

We are required to make various assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements under GAAP, including for purposes of determining asset
impairment, reserves related to litigation and other legal matters, valuation of income and other taxes and regulatory exposures and the amounts recorded for
certain contractual payments to be paid to or received from partners and others under contractual arrangements. In addition, significant assumptions and
estimates are involved in determining certain disclosures required under GAAP, including those involving the fair value of our financial instruments. If the
assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect, the actual amounts realized on transactions and balances subject to those
estimates will be different, and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Following adoption of the new CECL accounting guidance on January 1, 2020, we will be required to make various assumptions and estimates in determining
allowances for credit losses under the CECL model. The CECL model permits the use of judgment in determining an approach which is most appropriate for the
Company, based on facts and circumstances. We expect that the impact of adopting this new standard at the effective date will result in a material increase to
the Company’s allowance for loan losses of approximately $3.0 billion or 54% and result in a decrease in regulatory capital amounts and ratios as a result of
adoption. Once adopted, upon origination of a loan, the estimate of expected credit losses, and any subsequent changes to such estimate, will be recorded
through provision for loan losses in our Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Given the expected material increase to our allowance for credit losses under the
new CECL guidance, any subsequent changes we make to our underlying assumptions and estimates may result in a material adverse impact to our results of
operations and the Company’s ability to return capital to our shareholders. If our assumptions or estimates underlying our allowance for credit losses are
incorrect, or are required to change, this could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

For additional information on the key areas for which assumptions and estimates are used in preparing our financial statements, see “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates” and Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements.

Adverse financial market conditions or our inability to effectively manage our funding and liquidity risk could have a material adverse effect on our
funding, liquidity and ability to meet our obligations.

We need to effectively manage our funding and liquidity in order to meet our cash requirements such as day-to-day operating expenses, extensions of credit to
our customers, payments of principal and interest on our borrowings and payments on our other obligations. Our primary sources of funding and liquidity are
collections from our customers, deposits, funds from securitized financings and proceeds from unsecured borrowings. If we do not have sufficient liquidity, we
may not be able to meet our obligations, particularly during a liquidity stress event. If we maintain or are required to maintain too much liquidity, it could be
costly and reduce our financial flexibility.

We will need additional financing in the future to refinance any existing debt and finance growth of our business. The availability of additional financing will
depend on a variety of factors such as financial market conditions generally, including the availability of credit to the financial services industry, consumers’
willingness to place money on deposit in the Bank, our performance and credit ratings and the performance of our securitized portfolios. Disruptions,
uncertainty or volatility in the capital, credit or deposit markets, such as the uncertainty and volatility experienced in the capital and credit markets during
periods of financial stress and other economic and political conditions in the global markets and concerning the level of U.S. government debt and fiscal
measures that may be taken over the longer term to address these matters, may limit our ability to obtain additional financing or refinance maturing liabilities on
desired terms (including funding costs) in a timely manner or at all. As a result, we may be forced to delay obtaining funding or be forced to issue or raise
funding on undesirable terms, which could significantly reduce our financial flexibility and cause us to contract or not grow our business, all of which could have
a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions.

61

In addition, at December 31, 2019, we had an aggregate of $6.1 billion of undrawn credit facilities, subject to customary borrowing conditions, from private
lenders under our securitization programs and an unsecured revolving credit facility. Our ability to draw on such commitments is subject to the satisfaction of
certain conditions, including the applicable securitization trust having sufficient collateral to support the draw and the absence of an early amortization event.
Moreover, there are regulatory reforms that have been proposed or adopted in the United States and internationally that are intended to address certain issues
that affected banks in the last financial crisis. These reforms, generally referred to as “Basel III,” subject banks to more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage
requirements. To the extent that the Basel III requirements result in increased costs to the banks providing undrawn committed capacity under our securitization
programs, these costs are likely to be passed on to us. In addition, in response to Basel III, some banks in the market (including certain of the private lenders in
our securitization programs) have added provisions to their credit agreements permitting them to delay disbursement of funding requests for 30 days or more. If
our bank lenders require delayed disbursements of funding and/or higher pricing for committing undrawn capacity to us, our cost of funding and access to
liquidity could be adversely affected.

While financial market conditions are generally stable, there can be no assurance that significant disruptions, uncertainties and volatility will not occur in the
future. If we are unable to continue to finance our business, access capital markets and attract deposits on favorable terms and in a timely manner, or if we
experience an increase in our borrowing costs or otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectively, our results of operations and financial condition may be
materially adversely affected.

Our inability to grow our deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our liquidity and ability to grow our business.

We obtain deposits directly from retail and commercial customers or through brokerage firms that offer our deposit products to their customers. At
December 31, 2019, we had $54.2 billion in direct deposits and $10.9 billion in deposits originated through brokerage firms (including network deposit sweeps
procured through a program arranger who channels brokerage account deposits to us). A key part of our liquidity plan and funding strategy is to continue to
fund our growth through direct deposits.

The deposit business is highly competitive, with intense competition in attracting and retaining deposits. We compete on the basis of the rates we pay on
deposits, features and benefits of our products, the quality of our customer service and the competitiveness of our digital banking capabilities. Our ability to
originate and maintain retail deposits is also highly dependent on the strength of the Bank and the perceptions of consumers and others of our business
practices and our financial health. Adverse perceptions regarding our reputation could lead to difficulties in attracting and retaining deposits accounts. Negative
public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in a number of areas, including lending practices, regulatory compliance, inadequate protection of
customer information or sales and marketing activities, and from actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct.

The demand for the deposit products we offer may also be reduced due to a variety of factors, such as demographic patterns, changes in customer
preferences, reductions in consumers’ disposable income, regulatory actions that decrease customer access to particular products or the availability of
competing products. Competition from other financial services firms and others that use deposit funding products may affect deposit renewal rates, costs or
availability. Changes we make to the rates offered on our deposit products may affect our profitability and liquidity.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDIA”) prohibits an insured bank from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits
significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank’s normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited), unless it is “well
capitalized,” or it is “adequately capitalized” and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A bank that is “adequately capitalized” and accepts brokered deposits under a
waiver from the FDIC may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates. There are no such
restrictions under the FDIA on a bank that is “well capitalized” and at December 31, 2019, the Bank met or exceeded all applicable requirements to be deemed
“well capitalized” for purposes of the FDIA. However, there can be no assurance that the Bank will continue to meet those requirements. Limitations on the
Bank’s ability to accept brokered deposits for any reason (including regulatory limitations on the amount of brokered deposits in total or as a percentage of total
assets) in the future could materially adversely impact our funding costs and liquidity. Any limitation on the interest rates the Bank can pay on deposits could
competitively disadvantage us in attracting and retaining deposits and have a material adverse effect on our business.

62

Damage to our reputation could negatively impact our business.

Maintaining a positive reputation is critical to our attracting and retaining customers, partners, investors and employees. In particular, adverse perceptions
regarding our reputation could also make it more difficult for us to execute on our strategy of increasing retail deposits at the Bank and may lead to decreases in
deposits. Harm to our reputation can arise from many sources, including employee misconduct, misconduct by our partners, outsourced service providers or
other counterparties, litigation or regulatory actions, failure by us or our partners to meet minimum standards of service and quality, inadequate protection of
customer information and compliance failures. Negative publicity regarding us (or others engaged in a similar business or activities), whether or not accurate,
may damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

A reduction in our credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets.

Synchrony's senior unsecured debt currently is rated BBB- (stable outlook) by Fitch Ratings, Inc. (“Fitch”) and BBB- (stable outlook) by Standard & Poor’s
(“S&P”). The Bank’s senior unsecured debt currently is rated BBB- (stable outlook) by Fitch and BBB (stable outlook) by S&P. Although we have not requested
that Moody’s Investor Services, Inc. (“Moody’s”) provide a rating for our senior unsecured debt, we believe that if Moody’s were to issue a rating on our
unsecured debt, its rating would be lower than the comparable ratings issued by Fitch and S&P. The ratings for our unsecured debt are based on a number of
factors, including our financial strength, as well as factors that may not be within our control, such as macroeconomic conditions and the rating agencies’
perception of the industries in which we operate and the products we offer. The ratings of our asset-backed securities are, and will continue to be, based on a
number of factors, including the quality of the underlying loan receivables and the credit enhancement structure with respect to each series of asset-backed
securities, as well as our credit rating as sponsor and servicer of our publicly registered securitization trusts. These ratings also reflect the various
methodologies and assumptions used by the rating agencies, which are subject to change and could adversely affect our ratings. The rating agencies regularly
evaluate our credit ratings as well as the credit ratings of our asset-backed securities. A downgrade in our unsecured debt or asset-backed securities credit
ratings (or investor concerns that a downgrade may occur) could materially increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets.

If the ratings on our asset-backed securities are reduced, put on negative watch or withdrawn, it may have an adverse effect on the liquidity or the market price
of our asset-backed securities and on the cost of, or our ability to continue using, securitized financings to the extent anticipated.

Our inability to securitize our loan receivables would have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, cost of funds and financial condition.

We use the securitization of loan receivables, which involves the transfer of loan receivables to a trust and the issuance by the trust of asset-backed securities
to third-party investors, as a significant source of funding. Our average level of securitized financings from third parties was $11.9 billion and $12.7 billion for the
years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For a discussion of our securitization activities, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Funding, Liquidity and Capital Resources—Funding Sources—Securitized Financings” and Note 5. Variable
Interest Entities to our consolidated financial statements.

63

There can be no assurance that the securitization market for credit cards will not experience future disruptions. The extent to which we securitize our loan
receivables in the future will depend in part upon the conditions in the securities markets in general and the credit card asset-backed securities market in
particular, the availability of loan receivables for securitization, the overall credit quality of our loan receivables and the conformity of the loan receivables and
our securitization program to rating agency requirements, the costs of securitizing our loan receivables, and the legal, regulatory, accounting and tax
requirements governing securitization transactions. In the event we are unable to refinance existing asset-backed securities with new asset-backed securities,
we would be required to rely on other sources of funding, which may not be available or may be available only at higher cost. Further, in the event we are
unable to refinance existing asset-backed securities from our nonbank subsidiary securitization trust with new securities from the same trust, there are
structural and regulatory constraints on our ability to refinance these asset-backed securities with Bank deposits or other funding at the Bank, and therefore we
would be required to rely on sources outside of the Bank, which may not be available or may be available only at higher cost. A prolonged inability to securitize
our loan receivables on favorable terms, or at all, or to refinance our asset-backed securities would have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity,
cost of funds and financial condition.

The occurrence of an early amortization of our securitization facilities would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and cost of funds.

Our liquidity would be materially adversely affected by the occurrence of events resulting in the early amortization of our existing securitized financings. During
an early amortization period, principal collections from the loan receivables in our asset-backed securitization trust in which the early amortization event
occurred would be applied to repay principal of the trust's asset-backed securities rather than being available on a revolving basis to fund purchases of newly
originated loan receivables. This would negatively impact our liquidity, including our ability to originate new loan receivables under existing accounts, and
require us to rely on alternative funding sources, which might increase our funding costs or might not be available when needed.

Our loss of the right to service or subservice our securitized loan receivables would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and cost of
funds.

Synchrony currently acts as servicer with respect to our nonbank subsidiary securitization trust, and the Bank acts as servicer with respect to our other two
securitization trusts. If Synchrony or the Bank, as applicable, defaults in its servicing obligations, an early amortization event could occur with respect to the
relevant asset-backed securities and/or Synchrony or the Bank, as applicable, could be replaced as servicer. Servicer defaults include, for example, the failure
of the servicer to make any payment, transfer or deposit in accordance with the securitization documents, a breach of representations, warranties or
agreements made by the servicer under the securitization documents, the delegation of the servicer’s duties contrary to the securitization documents and the
occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the servicer. Such an early amortization event would have the adverse consequences discussed in the
immediately preceding risk factor.

If either Synchrony or the Bank defaults in its servicing obligations with respect to any of our three securitization trusts, a third party could be appointed as
servicer of such trust. If a third-party servicer is appointed, there is no assurance that the third party will engage us as sub-servicer, in which event we would no
longer be able to control the manner in which the related trust’s assets are serviced, and the failure of a third party to appropriately service such assets could
lead to an early amortization event in the affected securitization trust, which would have the adverse consequences discussed in the immediately preceding risk
factor.

64

Lower payment rates on our securitized loan receivables could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.

Certain collections from our securitized loan receivables come back to us through our subsidiaries, and we use these collections to fund our purchase of newly
originated loan receivables to collateralize our securitized financings. If payment rates on our securitized loan receivables are lower than they have historically
been, fewer collections will be remitted to us on an ongoing basis. Further, certain series of our asset-backed securities include a requirement that we
accumulate principal collections in a restricted account for a specified number of months prior to the applicable security’s maturity date. We are required under
the program documents to lengthen this accumulation period to the extent we expect the payment rates to be low enough that the current length of the
accumulation period is inadequate to fully fund the restricted account by the applicable security’s maturity date. Lower payment rates, and in particular, payment
rates that are low enough that we are required to lengthen our accumulation periods, could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.

Changes in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings, funding and liquidity.

Changes in market interest rates cause our net interest income to increase or decrease, as certain of our assets and liabilities carry interest rates that fluctuate
with market benchmarks. At December 31, 2019, 54.3% of our loan receivables were priced at a fixed interest rate to the customer, with the remaining 45.7% at
a floating interest rate. We fund our assets with a combination of fixed rate and floating rate funding sources that include deposits, asset-backed securities and
unsecured debt. The interest rate benchmark for our floating rate assets is the prime rate, and the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate liabilities is
generally either the LIBOR or the federal funds rate. The prime rate and LIBOR or the federal funds rate could reset at different times or could diverge, leading
to mismatches in the interest rates on our floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities. Additionally, on July 27, 2017 the UK Financial Conduct Authority
announced that it would no longer encourage or compel banks to continue to contribute quotes and maintain LIBOR after 2021. There is no definitive
information regarding the future utilization of LIBOR or of any particular replacement rate. To the extent we are unable to position the balance sheet (naturally or
using derivatives) to effectively match the interest rates on our assets and liabilities, or are unable to effectively manage any transition from LIBOR to a
replacement rate or rates, our net earnings could be materially adversely affected.

Competitive and regulatory factors may limit our ability to raise interest rates on our loans. In addition, some of our program agreements limit the rate of interest
we can charge to customers. If interest rates were to rise materially over a sustained period of time, and we are unable to sufficiently raise our interest rates in a
timely manner, or at all, our net interest margin could be adversely impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings.

Interest rates may also adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay amounts owed to us. Our floating rate credit products
bear interest rates that fluctuate with the prime rate. Higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under
mortgage, credit card and other consumer loans, which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to
increased delinquencies, bankruptcies, charge-offs, allowances for loan losses, and decreasing recoveries, all of which could have a material adverse effect on
our net earnings.

Changes in interest rates and competitor responses to these changes may also impact customer decisions to maintain deposits with us, and reductions in
deposits could materially adversely affect our funding costs and liquidity.

We assess our interest rate risk by estimating the net interest income impact of various interest rate scenarios. We take risk mitigation actions based on those
assessments. Changes in interest rates could materially reduce our net interest income and our net earnings, and could also increase our funding costs and
reduce our liquidity, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different from our assumptions. For a discussion of interest rate risk sensitivities, see
“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Interest Rate Risk.”

65

Our risk management processes and procedures may not be effective in mitigating our risks.

Our risk management processes and procedures seek to appropriately balance risk and return and mitigate risks. We have established processes and
procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor and control the types of risk to which we are subject, including credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk,
operational risk (including compliance risk) and strategic risk. Credit risk is the risk of loss that arises when an obligor fails to meet the terms of an obligation.
We are exposed to both consumer credit risk, from our customer loans, and institutional credit risk, principally from our partners. Market risk refers to the risk
that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio. Liquidity
risk is the risk that financial condition or overall safety and soundness are adversely affected by an inability, or perceived inability, to meet obligations and
support business growth. Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed processes, people or systems, external events (i.e., natural
disasters) or compliance, reputational or legal matters and includes those risks as they relate directly to us as well as to third parties with whom we contract or
otherwise do business. Strategic risk is the risk from changes in the business environment, improper implementation of decisions or inadequate responsiveness
to changes in the business environment. See “Our Business—Credit Risk Management” and “Risks—Risk Management” for additional information on the types
of risks affecting our business.

We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a framework that includes our Risk Appetite Statement, Enterprise Risk Assessment (ERA) process,
risk policies, procedures and controls, reporting requirements, and corporate culture and values in conjunction with the risk management accountability
incorporated into our integrated Risk Management Framework, which includes our governance structure and three distinct Lines of Defense. Management of
our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and/or forecasting models. If the models that we use to manage these risks are ineffective at
predicting future losses or are otherwise inadequate, we may incur unexpected losses or otherwise be adversely affected. In addition, the information we use in
managing our credit and other risk may be inaccurate or incomplete as a result of error or fraud, both of which may be difficult to detect and avoid. There may
also be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated including when processes are changed or
new products and services are introduced. If our Risk Management Framework does not effectively identify and control our risks, we could suffer unexpected
losses or be adversely affected, and that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We rely extensively on models in managing many aspects of our business, and if they are not accurate or are misinterpreted, it could have a
material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

We rely extensively on models in managing many aspects of our business, including liquidity and capital planning (including stress testing), customer selection,
credit and other risk management, pricing, reserving and collections management. The models may prove in practice to be less predictive than we expect for a
variety of reasons, including as a result of errors in constructing, interpreting or using the models or the use of inaccurate assumptions (including failures to
update assumptions appropriately or in a timely manner). Our assumptions may be inaccurate for many reasons including that they often involve matters that
are inherently difficult to predict and beyond our control (e.g., macroeconomic conditions and their impact on partner and customer behaviors) and they often
involve complex interactions between a number of dependent and independent variables, factors and other assumptions. The errors or inaccuracies in our
models may be material, and could lead us to make wrong or sub-optimal decisions in managing our business, and this could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our business depends on our ability to successfully manage our credit risk, and failing to do so may result in high charge-off rates.

Our success depends on our ability to manage our credit risk while attracting new customers with profitable usage patterns. We select our customers, manage
their accounts and establish terms and credit limits using proprietary scoring models and other analytical techniques that are designed to set terms and credit
limits to appropriately compensate us for the credit risk we accept, while encouraging customers to use their available credit. The models and approaches we
use to manage our credit risk may not accurately predict future charge-offs for various reasons discussed in the preceding risk factors.

66

Our ability to manage credit risk and avoid high charge-off rates also may be adversely affected by economic conditions that may be difficult to predict, such as
the last financial crisis. The assessment of our credit profile includes the evaluation of portfolio mix, account maturation, as well as broader consumer trends,
such as payment behavior and overall indebtedness. See “Management's Discussion and Analysis—Results of Operations—Business Trends and Conditions”
for further discussion of our expectations of future credit trends, in the near term. Credit trends may deteriorate materially from our expectations if economic
conditions were to deteriorate.

In addition, we remain subject to conditions in the consumer credit environment. Our credit underwriting and risk management strategies are used to manage
our credit exposures; however, there can be no assurance that those will enable us to avoid high charge-off levels or delinquencies, or that our allowance for
loan losses will be sufficient to cover actual losses.

A customer’s ability to repay us can be negatively impacted by increases in their payment obligations to other lenders under mortgage, credit card and other
loans (including student loans). These changes can result from increases in base lending rates or structured increases in payment obligations, and could
reduce the ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations to other lenders and to us. In addition, a customer’s ability to repay us can be negatively
impacted by the restricted availability of credit to consumers generally, including reduced and closed lines of credit. Customers with insufficient cash flow to
fund daily living expenses and lack of access to other sources of credit may be more likely to increase their card usage and ultimately default on their payment
obligations to us, resulting in higher credit losses in our portfolio. Our collection operations may not compete effectively to secure more of customers’ diminished
cash flow than our competitors. We may not identify customers who are likely to default on their payment obligations to us and reduce our exposure by closing
credit lines and restricting authorizations quickly enough, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. In addition, our collection strategy depends in part on the sale of debt to third-party buyers. Regulatory or other factors may adversely affect the
pricing of our debt sales or the performance of our third-party buyers, which may result in higher credit losses in our portfolio. At December 31, 2019, 26% of
our portfolio’s loan receivables were from customers with a FICO score of 660 or less (excluding unrated accounts), who typically have higher delinquency and
credits losses than consumers with higher FICO scores.

Our ability to manage credit risk also may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory changes (such as bankruptcy laws and minimum payment regulations)
and collection regulations, competitors’ actions and consumer behavior, as well as inadequate collections staffing, techniques, models and performance of
vendors such as collection agencies.

We may not be able to offset increases in our costs with decreased payments under our retailer share arrangements, which could reduce our
profitability.

Most of our Retail Card program agreements and certain other program agreements contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our
partners if the economic performance of the relevant program exceeds a contractually defined threshold. Although the share arrangements vary by partner,
these arrangements are generally structured to measure the economic performance of the program, based typically on agreed upon program revenues
(including interest income and certain other income) less agreed upon program expenses (including interest expense, provision for loan losses, retailer
payments and operating expenses), and share portions of this amount above a negotiated threshold. These arrangements are typically designed to permit us to
achieve an economic return before we are required to make payments to our partners based on the agreed contractually defined threshold. However, because
the threshold and the economic performance of a program that are used to calculate payments to our partners may be based on, among other things, agreed
upon measures of program expenses rather than our actual expenses, we may not be able to pass on increases in our actual expenses (such as funding costs
or operating expenses) in the form of reduced payments under our retailer share arrangements, and our economic return on a program could be adversely
affected. While most of our agreements contain retailer share arrangements, in some cases, where we instead provide other economic benefits to our partners
such as royalties on purchase volume or payments for new accounts (for example, on our co-branded credit cards), our ability to offset increases in our costs is
limited.

67

Competition in the consumer finance industry is intense.

The success of our business depends on our ability to retain existing partners and attract new partners. The competition for partners is intense and highly
competitive. Our primary competitors for partners include major financial institutions, such as Alliance Data Systems, American Express, Capital One,
JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, TD Bank and Wells Fargo, and to a lesser extent, financial technology companies and potential partners’ own in-house financing
capabilities. Some of our competitors are substantially larger, have substantially greater resources and may offer a broader range of products and services. We
compete for partners on the basis of a number of factors, including program financial and other terms, underwriting standards, marketing expertise, service
levels, product and service offerings (including incentive and loyalty programs), technological capabilities and integration, brand and reputation. In addition,
some of our competitors for partners have a business model that allows for their partners to manage underwriting (e.g., new account approval), customer
service and collections, and other core banking responsibilities that we retain but some partners may prefer to handle. As a result of competition, we may be
unable to acquire new partners, lose existing relationships to competing companies or find it more costly to maintain our existing relationships.

Our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain customers and generate usage of our products by them. The consumer credit and payments
industry is highly competitive and we face an increasingly dynamic industry as emerging technologies enter the marketplace. As a form of payment, our
products compete with cash, checks, debit cards, general purpose credit cards (including Visa and MasterCard, American Express and Discover Card), other
private label card brands and, to a certain extent, prepaid cards. In the future, we expect our products may face increased competition from new emerging
payment technologies, such as Apple Pay, Android Pay, Chase Pay, Samsung Pay and Square, to the extent that our products are not, or do not continue to be,
accepted in, or compatible with, such technologies. We may also face increased competition from current competitors or others who introduce or embrace
disruptive technology that significantly changes the consumer credit and payment industry. We compete for customers and their usage of our products, and to
minimize transfers to competitors of our customers’ outstanding balances, based on a number of factors, including pricing (interest rates and fees), product
offerings, credit limits, incentives (including loyalty programs) and customer service. Although we offer a variety of consumer credit products, some of our
competitors provide a broader selection of services, including home and automobile loans, debit cards and bank branch ATM access, which may position them
better among customers who prefer to use a single financial institution to meet all of their financial needs. Some of our competitors are substantially larger than
we are, which may give those competitors advantages, including a more diversified product and customer base, the ability to reach out to more customers and
potential customers, operational efficiencies, more versatile technology platforms, broad-based local distribution capabilities and lower-cost funding. In addition,
some of our competitors, including new and emerging competitors in the digital and mobile payments space, are not subject to the same regulatory
requirements or legislative scrutiny to which we are subject, which also could place us at a competitive disadvantage. Customer attrition from any or all of our
credit products or any lowering of the pricing of our products by reducing interest rates or fees in order to retain customers could reduce our revenues and
therefore our earnings.

In our retail deposits business, we have acquisition and servicing capabilities similar to other direct banking competitors. We compete for deposits with
traditional banks and, in seeking to grow our direct banking business, we compete with other banks that have direct banking models similar to ours, such as Ally
Financial, American Express, Capital One 360 (ING), CIT, Discover, Marcus by Goldman Sachs, PurePoint, Sallie Mae and USAA. Competition among direct
banks is intense because online banking provides customers the ability to rapidly deposit and withdraw funds and open and close accounts in favor of products
and services offered by competitors.

If we are unable to compete effectively for partners, customer usage or deposits, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

68

We may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize new or enhanced products and services.

Our industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technologies, products, services and consumer preferences. A key part of our financial success
depends on our ability to develop and commercialize new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services, including with respect to
loyalty programs, mobile and point of sale technologies, and new Synchrony-branded bank deposit and credit products. Realizing the benefits of those products
and services is uncertain. We may not assign the appropriate level of resources, priority or expertise to the development and commercialization of these new
products, services or enhancements. Our ability to develop, acquire or commercialize competitive technologies, products or services on acceptable terms or at
all may be limited by intellectual property rights that third parties, including competitors and potential competitors, may assert. In addition, success is dependent
on factors such as partner and customer acceptance, adoption and usage, competition, the effectiveness of marketing programs, the availability of appropriate
technologies and business processes and regulatory approvals. Success of a new product, service or enhancement also may depend upon our ability to deliver
it on a large scale, which may require a significant investment.

We also may select, utilize and invest in technologies, products and services that ultimately do not achieve widespread adoption and therefore are not as
attractive or useful to our partners, customers and service partners as we anticipate, or partners may not recognize the value of our new products and services
or believe they justify any potential costs or disruptions associated with implementing them. In addition, because our products and services typically are
marketed through our partners, if our partners are unwilling or unable to effectively implement our new technologies, products, services or enhancements, we
may be unable to grow our business. Competitors may also develop or adopt technologies or introduce innovations that change the markets we operate in and
make our products less competitive and attractive to our partners and customers.

In any event, we may not realize the benefit of new technologies, products, services or enhancements for many years or competitors may introduce more
compelling products, services or enhancements. Our failure to successfully develop and commercialize new or enhanced products, services or enhancements
could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

We may not realize the value of acquisitions and strategic investments that we pursue and such investments could divert resources or introduce
unforeseen risks to our business.

We will acquire new partners and may execute strategic acquisitions or partnerships or make other strategic investments in businesses, products, technologies
or platforms to enhance or grow our business. These acquisitions and strategic investments may introduce new costs or liabilities which could impact our ability
to grow or maintain acceptable performance.

We may be unable to integrate systems, personnel or technologies from our acquisitions and strategic investments. These acquisitions and strategic
investments may also present unforeseen legal, regulatory or other challenges that we may not be able to manage effectively. The planning and integration of
an acquisition, including of a new partner or credit card portfolio, partnership or investment, may shift employee time and other resources which could impair
our ability to focus on our core business.

New partnerships, acquisitions and strategic investments may not perform as expected due to lack of acceptance by partners, customers or employees, higher
than forecasted costs or losses, lengthy transition periods, synergies or savings not being realized and a variety of other factors. This may result in a delay or
unrealized benefit, or in some cases, increased costs or other unforeseen risks to our business.

Reductions in interchange fees may reduce the competitive advantages our private label credit card products currently have by virtue of not
charging interchange fees and would reduce our income from those fees.

Interchange is a fee merchants pay to the interchange network in exchange for the use of the network’s infrastructure and payment facilitation, and which are
paid to credit card issuers to compensate them for the risk they bear in lending money to customers. We earn interchange fees on Dual Card and general
purpose co-branded credit card transactions but we typically do not charge or earn interchange fees from our partners or customers on our private label credit
card products.

69

Merchants, trying to decrease their operating expenses, have sought to, and have had some success at, lowering interchange rates. Several recent events and
actions indicate a continuing increase in focus on interchange by both regulators and merchants. Beyond pursuing litigation, legislation and regulation,
merchants are also pursuing alternate payment platforms as a means to lower payment processing costs. To the extent interchange fees are reduced, one of
our current competitive advantages with our partners—that we typically do not charge interchange fees when our private label credit card products are used to
purchase our partners’ goods and services—may be reduced. Moreover, to the extent interchange fees are reduced, our income from those fees will be lower.
We received $748 million of interchange fees for the year ended December 31, 2019. As a result, a reduction in interchange fees could have a material adverse
effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, for our Dual Cards and general purpose co-branded credit cards, we are subject to the operating
regulations and procedures set forth by the interchange network, and our failure to comply with these operating regulations, which may change from time to
time, could subject us to various penalties or fees, or the termination of our license to use the interchange network, all of which could have a material adverse
effect on our business and results of operations.

Fraudulent activity associated with our products and services could negatively impact our operating results, brand and reputation and cause the
use of our products and services to decrease and our fraud losses to increase.

We are subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with partners, customers and third parties handling customer information. Our fraud-related
operational losses were $273 million, $239 million and $313 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our fraud-related
losses have shifted away from counterfeit fraud losses with the implementation of the EMV chip in Dual Cards and general purpose co-branded credit cards
and towards application and transactional fraud. Our products are susceptible to application fraud, because among other things, we provide immediate access
to the credit line at the time of approval. In addition, sales on the internet and through mobile channels are becoming a larger part of our business and
fraudulent activity is higher as a percentage of sales in those channels than in stores. Dual Cards, general purpose co-branded credit cards and private label
credit cards are susceptible to different types of fraud, and, depending on our product channel mix (including as a result of the introduction, if any, of a
Synchrony-branded general purpose credit card), we may continue to experience variations in, or levels of, fraud-related expense that are different from or
higher than that experienced by some of our competitors or the industry generally.

The risk of fraud continues to increase for the financial services industry in general, and credit card fraud, identity theft and related crimes are likely to continue
to be prevalent, and perpetrators are growing more sophisticated. Our resources, technologies and fraud prevention tools may be insufficient to accurately
detect and prevent fraud. High profile fraudulent activity also could negatively impact our brand and reputation, which could negatively impact the use of our
cards and thereby have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, significant increases in fraudulent activity could lead to regulatory
intervention (such as increased customer notification requirements), which could increase our costs and also negatively impact our operating results, brand and
reputation and could lead us to take steps to reduce fraud risk, which could increase our costs.

The failure of third parties to provide various services that are important to our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and
results of operations.

Some services important to our business are outsourced to third-party vendors. For example, our credit card transaction processing, production and related
services (including the printing and mailing of customer statements) are handled by First Data, and the technology platform for our online retail deposits is
managed by Fiserv. First Data, Fiserv, and, in some cases, other third-party vendors, are the sole source or one of a limited number of sources of the services
they provide for us. In 2019, Fiserv acquired First Data. It would be difficult and disruptive for us to replace some of our third-party vendors, particularly First
Data and Fiserv, in a timely manner if they were unwilling or unable to provide us with these services in the future (as a result of their financial or business
conditions or otherwise), and our business and operations likely would be materially adversely affected. Our principal agreement with First Data expires in
November 2026, unless it is terminated earlier or is extended pursuant to the terms thereof. Our principal agreement with Fiserv expires in July 2022, unless it
is terminated earlier or is extended pursuant to the terms thereof. In addition, if a third-party provider fails to provide the services we require, fails to meet
contractual requirements, such as compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or suffers a cyber-attack or other security breach, our business could suffer
economic and reputational harm that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

70

We have international operations that subject us to various international risks as well as increased compliance and regulatory risks and costs.

We have international operations, primarily in India, the Philippines and Canada, and some of our third-party service providers provide services to us from other
countries, all of which subject us to a number of international risks, including, among other things, sovereign volatility and socio-political instability. For example,
the Philippines has in the past experienced severe political and social instability. Any future political or social instability in the countries in which we operate
could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.

U.S. regulations also govern various aspects of the international activities of domestic corporations and increase our compliance and regulatory risks and costs.
Any failure on our part or the part of our service providers to comply with applicable U.S. regulations, as well as the regulations in the countries and markets in
which we or they operate, could result in fines, penalties, injunctions or other similar restrictions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

If we are alleged to have infringed upon the intellectual property rights owned by others or are not able to protect our intellectual property, our
business and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Competitors or other third parties may allege that we, or consultants or other third parties retained or indemnified by us, infringe on their intellectual property
rights. We also may face allegations that our employees have misappropriated intellectual property of their former employers or other third parties. Given the
complex, rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environment in which we operate, and the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual
property-related litigation, an assertion of an infringement claim against us may cause us to spend significant amounts to defend the claim (even if we ultimately
prevail), pay significant money damages, lose significant revenues, be prohibited from using the relevant systems, processes, technologies or other intellectual
property, cease offering certain products or services, or incur significant license, royalty or technology development expenses. Moreover, it has become
common in recent years for individuals and groups to purchase intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting
to extract settlements from companies like ours. Even in instances where we believe that claims and allegations of intellectual property infringement against us
are without merit, defending against such claims is time consuming and expensive and could result in the diversion of time and attention of our management
and employees. In addition, although in some cases a third party may have agreed to indemnify us for such costs, such indemnifying party may refuse or be
unable to uphold its contractual obligations.

Moreover, we rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information, including copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade
secrets and controls on access and distribution. These measures may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or proprietary
information and a resulting loss of competitive advantage, and in any event, we may be required to litigate to protect our intellectual property and proprietary
information from misappropriation or infringement by others, which is expensive, could cause a diversion of resources and may not be successful. Third parties
may challenge, invalidate or circumvent our intellectual property, or our intellectual property may not be sufficient to provide us with competitive advantages.
Our competitors or other third parties may independently design around or develop similar technology, or otherwise duplicate our services or products such that
we could not assert our intellectual property rights against them. In addition, our contractual arrangements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our
intellectual property or confidential and proprietary information or provide an adequate remedy in the event of an unauthorized disclosure.

Litigation, regulatory actions and compliance issues could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments, remediation costs and/or
requirements resulting in increased expenses.

Our business is subject to increased risks of litigation and regulatory actions as a result of a number of factors and from various sources, including the highly
regulated nature of the financial services industry, the focus of state and federal prosecutors on banks and the financial services industry and the structure of
the credit card industry.

71

In the normal course of business, from time to time, we have been named as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other
litigation, arising in connection with our business activities. Certain of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages, or
claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In addition, while historically the arbitration provision in our customer agreements generally has limited our
exposure to consumer class action litigation, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future. There may
also be legislative or other efforts to directly or indirectly prohibit the use of pre-dispute arbitration clauses, or we may be compelled as a result of competitive
pressure or reputational concerns to voluntarily eliminate pre-dispute arbitration clauses. If the arbitration provision is not enforceable or eliminated (for
whatever reason), our exposure to class action litigation could increase significantly.

We are also involved, from time to time, in reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental agencies regarding our
business (collectively, “regulatory matters”), which could subject us to significant fines, penalties, obligations to change our business practices or other
requirements resulting in increased expenses, diminished earnings and damage to our reputation. The current environment of additional regulation, increased
regulatory compliance efforts and enhanced regulatory enforcement has resulted in significant operational and compliance costs and may prevent or make it
less attractive for us to continue providing certain products and services. There is no assurance that these regulatory matters or other factors will not, in the
future, affect how we conduct our business and in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We contest liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. The outcome of pending and future matters could be material to our
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows depending on, among other factors, the level of our earnings for that period, and could adversely affect
our business and reputation. For a discussion of certain legal proceedings, see “Regulation—Consumer Financial Services Regulation,” and Note 16. Legal
Proceedings and Regulatory Matters to our consolidated financial statements.

In addition to litigation and regulatory matters, from time to time, through our operational and compliance controls, we identify compliance issues that require us
to make operational changes and, depending on the nature of the issue, result in financial remediation to impacted cardholders. These self-identified issues and
voluntary remediation payments could be significant depending on the issue and the number of cardholders impacted. They also could generate litigation or
regulatory investigations that subject us to additional adverse effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate key officers and employees.

Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain, recruit and motivate key officers and employees. Our senior management team has significant
industry experience and would be difficult to replace. Competition for senior executives in the financial services and payment industry is intense. We may not be
able to attract and retain qualified personnel to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel. Guidelines issued by the
federal banking regulators prohibits our payment of "excessive" compensation, or compensation that could lead to our material financial loss, to our executives,
employees, and directors. In addition, proposed rules implementing the executive compensation provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act would limit the type and
structure of compensation arrangements that we may enter into with our senior executives and persons deemed "significant risk-takers." These restrictions
could negatively impact our ability to compete with other companies in recruiting, retaining and motivating key personnel. Failure to retain talented senior
leadership could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We operate in multiple jurisdictions and we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local governments, and of various foreign
jurisdictions. From time to time, legislative initiatives may be proposed, such as the 2017 Tax Act, which may impact our effective tax rate and could adversely
affect our deferred tax assets, tax positions and/or our tax liabilities. In addition, U.S. federal, state and local, as well as foreign, tax laws and regulations are
extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that our historical tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax
authorities or that we would be successful in defending our positions in connection with any such challenge.

72

In addition, there is still some uncertainty around the interpretation of certain provisions of the recent U.S. tax reform. While the Tax Act had a significant
positive impact on our after-tax results, technical corrections or other forthcoming guidance could change how we interpret provisions of it, which may impact
our effective tax rate and could affect our deferred tax assets, tax positions and/or our tax liabilities. 

State sales tax rules and regulations, and their application and interpretation by the respective states, could change and adversely affect our results
of operations.

State sales tax rules and regulations, and their application and interpretation by the respective states, could adversely affect our results of operations. Retailers
collect sales tax from retail customers and remit those collections to the applicable states. When customers fail to repay their loans, including the amount of
sales tax advanced by us to the merchant on their behalf, we are entitled, in some cases, to seek a refund of the amount of sales tax from the applicable state.
Sales tax laws and regulations enacted by the various states are subject to interpretation, and our compliance with such laws is routinely subject to audit and
review by the states. Audit risk is concentrated in several states, and these states are conducting ongoing audits. The outcomes of ongoing and any future
audits and changes in the states’ interpretation of the sales tax laws and regulations involving the recovery of tax on bad debts could materially adversely
impact our results of operations.

We could have a material indemnification obligation to GE under the TSSA if we cause the split-off from GE or certain preliminary transactions to fail
to qualify for tax-free treatment or in the case of certain significant transfers of our stock following the split-off from GE.

GE completed its exit from its investment in us in an exchange offer that concluded in November 2015, resulting in our split-off from GE. The split-off was
designed to qualify for tax‑free treatment to GE and its shareholders under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). GE
obtained a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) regarding certain issues relating to the tax- free treatment of the split-off and a series of
preliminary transactions that occurred prior to implementing the exchange offer. Although the IRS private letter ruling is generally binding on the IRS, the
continuing validity of such ruling is subject to the accuracy of factual representations and assumptions made in the IRS private letter ruling. The IRS private
letter ruling addresses only certain aspects of the transaction. As a result, GE obtained an opinion from tax counsel confirming the tax-free treatment of the
split-off. The opinion is based upon various factual representations and assumptions, as well as certain undertakings made by us and GE. If any of those
factual representations or assumptions in the IRS private letter ruling or tax opinion are untrue or incomplete in any material respect, any undertaking is not
complied with, or the facts upon which the IRS private letter ruling or tax opinion was based are materially different from the facts at the time of the distribution,
the split-off may not qualify for tax- free treatment. Opinions of counsel are not binding on the IRS. As a result, the conclusions expressed in the opinion of
counsel could be challenged by the IRS, and if the IRS prevails in such challenge, the tax consequences of the split-off could be materially less favorable. If the
split-off (or any of the preliminary transactions) is determined to be taxable, GE and its shareholders could incur significant tax liabilities, and under the TSSA
we entered into with GE, we may be required to indemnify GE for any liabilities incurred by GE if the liabilities are caused by any action or inaction undertaken
by us following the initial public offering of our common stock (“IPO”) in 2014 or as a result of any direct or indirect transfers of our stock following the exchange
offer.

In order to preserve the tax-free status of the split-off and the preliminary transactions to GE, the TSSA includes a provision generally prohibiting us from taking
any action or inaction that is within our control (other than actions or inactions that implemented the split-off or certain preliminary transactions or actions or
inactions that are consented to by GE or are at the direction of GE) that would cause the split-off (or the preliminary transactions) to become taxable, and
providing for an indemnity obligation from us to GE for tax liabilities incurred by GE as a result of a breach of these provisions by us or as a result of any direct
or indirect transfers of our stock following the exchange offer.

Risk Management
____________________________________________________________________________________________

Strong risk management is at the core of our business strategy and we have developed processes to manage the major categories of risk, namely credit,
market, liquidity, operational (including compliance) strategic risk and reputational risk (considered across all risk types).

As described in greater detail below under “—Risk Management Roles and Responsibilities,” we manage enterprise risk using an integrated framework that
includes board-level oversight, administration by a group of cross-functional management committees, and day-to-day implementation by a dedicated risk
management team led by the Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”). We also utilize the "Three Lines of Defense" risk management model to demonstrate and structure the
roles, responsibilities and accountabilities in the organization for taking and managing risk. The Risk Committee of the Board of Directors has responsibility for
the oversight of the risk management program, and three other board committees have other oversight roles with respect to risk management. Several
management committees and subcommittees have important roles and responsibilities in administering the risk management program, including the Enterprise
Risk Management Committee (the “ERMC”), the Management Committee (the “MC”), the Asset and Liability Management Committee (the “ALCO”) and the
Capital Management Committee (the "CMC"). This committee-focused governance structure provides a forum through which risk expertise is applied cross-
functionally to all major decisions, including development of policies, processes and controls used by the CRO and risk management team to execute the risk
management philosophy.

The enterprise risk management philosophy is to ensure that all relevant risks are appropriately identified, measured, monitored and controlled. The approach
in executing this philosophy focuses on leveraging risk expertise to drive enterprise risk management using a strong governance framework structure, a
comprehensive enterprise risk assessment program and an effective risk appetite framework.

Risk Categories

Risk management is organized around six major risk categories: credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk (including compliance), strategic risk, and
reputational risk. We evaluate the potential impact of a risk event on us (including subsidiaries) by assessing the partner and customer, financial, reputational,
and legal and regulatory impacts.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk of loss that arises when an obligor fails to meet the terms of a contract and/or the underlying collateral is insufficient to satisfy the
obligation. Credit risk includes exposure to consumer credit risk from customer loans as well as institutional credit risk, principally from our partners. Consumer
credit risk is one of our most significant risks. See “Our Business—Credit Risk Management” for a description of the customer credit risk management
procedures.

Market Risk

Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a
position or portfolio. The principal market risk exposures arise from volatility in interest rates and their impact on economic value, capitalization levels and
earnings. Market risk is managed by the ALCO, and is subject to policy and risk appetite limits on sensitivity of both earnings at risk and the economic value of
equity. Market risk metrics are reviewed by ALCO monthly, the Risk Committee on a quarterly basis and the Board of Directors as required.

74

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that an institution’s financial condition or overall safety and soundness are adversely affected by a real or perceived inability to meet
contractual obligations and support planned growth. The primary liquidity objective is to maintain a liquidity profile that will enable us, even in times of stress or
market disruption, to fund our existing assets and meet liabilities in a timely manner and at an acceptable cost. Policy and risk appetite limits require us and the
Bank (and other entities within our business, as applicable) to ensure that sufficient liquid assets are available to survive liquidity stresses over a specified time
period. Our Risk Appetite Statement requires funding diversification, monitoring early warning indicators in the capital markets, and other related limits. ALCO
reviews liquidity exposures continuously in the context of approved policy and risk appetite limits and reports results quarterly to the Risk Committee, and the
Board of Directors as required.

Operational Risk

Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed processes, people or systems, external events (i.e. natural disasters) or compliance,
reputational or legal matters, and includes any of those risks as they relate directly to us and our subsidiaries, as well as to third parties with whom we contract
or otherwise do business. Compliance risk arises from the failure to adhere to applicable laws, rules, regulations and internal policies and procedures.
Operational risk also includes model risk relating to various financial and other models used by us and our subsidiaries, including the Bank, and is subject to a
formal governance process.

Strategic Risk

Strategic risk consists of the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital arising from changes in the business environment and from adverse business
decisions, improper implementation of decisions or lack of responsiveness to changes in the business environment. The New Product Introduction ("NPI") Sub-
Committee assesses the strategic viability and consistency of each new product or service. All new initiatives require the approval of the NPI Sub-Committee
and a select number of new product requests are escalated to the MC and the Board of Directors, based on level of risk.

Reputational Risk

Reputational Risk is the risk arising from negative perception on the part of customers, counterparties, shareholders, investors, rating agencies or regulators
that can adversely affect the Company’s ability to maintain existing customers and establish new business relationships with continued access to sources of
funding.

Risk Management Roles and Responsibilities

Responsibility for risk management flows to individuals and entities throughout our Company, including the Board of Directors, various board and management
committees and senior management. The corporate culture and values, in conjunction with the risk management accountability incorporated into the integrated
Enterprise Risk Governance Framework, which includes governance structure and three distinct Lines of Defense, has facilitated, and will continue to facilitate,
the evolution of an effective risk presence across the Company.

The “First Line of Defense” is comprised of the business areas whose day-to-day activities involve decision-making and associated risk-taking for the Company.
As the business owner, the first line is responsible for identifying, assessing, managing and controlling that risk, and for mitigating our overall risk exposure. The
first line formulates strategy and operates within the risk appetite and risk governance framework. The “Second Line of Defense,” also known as the
independent risk management organization, provides oversight of first line risk taking and management. The second line assists in determining risk capacity,
risk appetite, and the strategies, policies and structure for managing risks. The second line owns the risk governance framework. The “Third Line of Defense” is
comprised of Internal Audit. The third line provides independent and objective assurance to senior management and to the Board of Directors and Audit
Committee that the first and second line risk management and internal control systems and its governance processes are well-designed and working as
intended.

75

Set forth below is a further description of the roles and responsibilities related to the key elements of the Enterprise Risk Governance Framework.

Board of Directors

The Board of Directors, among other things, has approved the enterprise-wide Risk Appetite Statement for the Company, as well as certain other risk
management policies and oversees the Company’s strategic plan and enterprise-wide risk management program. The Board of Directors may assign certain
risk management activities to applicable committees and management.

Board Committees

The Board of Directors has established four committees that assist the board in its oversight of risk management. These committees and their risk-related roles
are described below.

Audit Committee

In coordination with the Risk Committees of the Company and the Bank, the Audit Committee’s role, among other things, is to review: (i) the Company’s major
financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control these risks; (ii) the Company’s risk assessment and risk management
practices and the guidelines, policies and processes for risk assessment and risk management; (iii) the organization, performance and audit findings of our
internal audit function; (iv) our public disclosures and effectiveness of internal controls; and (v) the Company’s risk guidelines and policies relating to financial
statements, financial systems, financial reporting processes, compliance and auditing, and allowance for loan losses.

Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee’s role, among other things, is to: (i) review and approve certain transactions with related persons; (ii)
review and resolve any conflict of interest involving directors or executive officers; (iii) oversee the risks, if any, related to corporate governance structure and
practices; and (iv) identify and discuss with management the risks, if any, related to social responsibility actions and public policy initiatives.

Management Development and Compensation Committee

The Management Development and Compensation Committee’s role, among other things, is to: (i) review our incentive compensation arrangements with a
view to appropriately balancing risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose us or any of our subsidiaries to imprudent
risks, and are consistent with safety and soundness; and (ii) review (with input from our CRO and the Bank’s CRO) the relationship between risk management
policies and practices, corporate strategies and senior executive compensation.

76

Risk Committee

The Risk Committee’s role, among other things, is to: (i) assist the Board of Directors in its oversight of the Company’s Enterprise Risk Governance Framework,
including as it relates to credit, investment, market, liquidity, operational compliance strategic and reputational risks; (ii) review and, at least annually, approve
the Company’s Enterprise Risk Governance Framework and risk assessment and risk management practices, guidelines and policies (including significant
policies that management uses to manage credit and investment, market, liquidity, operational, compliance and strategic risks); (iii) review and, at least
annually, recommend to the Board of Directors for approval the Company’s enterprise-wide risk appetite (including the Company’s liquidity risk tolerance), and
review and approve the Company’s strategy relating to managing key risks and other policies on the establishment of risk limits as well as the guidelines,
policies and processes for monitoring and mitigating such risks; (iv) meet separately on a regular basis with our CRO and (in coordination with the Bank’s Risk
Committee, as appropriate) the Bank’s CRO; (v) receive periodic reports from management on metrics used to measure, monitor and manage known and
emerging risks, including management’s view on acceptable and appropriate levels of exposure; (vi) receive reports from our internal audit, risk management
and independent liquidity review functions on the results of risk management reviews and assessments; (vii) review and approve, at least annually, the
Company’s enterprise-wide capital and liquidity framework (including its contingency funding plan) and, in coordination with the Bank’s Risk Committee, review,
at least quarterly, the Bank’s, liquidity risk appetite, regulatory capital and ratios and internal capital adequacy assessment processes and, at least annually, the
Bank’s allowance for loan losses methodology, annual capital plan and resolution plan; (viii) review, at least semi-annually, information from senior management
regarding whether the Company is operating within its established risk appetite; (ix) review the status of financial services regulatory examinations; (x) review
the independence, authority and effectiveness of the Company’s risk management function and independent liquidity review function; (xi) approve the
appointment of, evaluate and, when appropriate, replace, the CRO; and (xii) review disclosure regarding risk contained in the Company’s annual and quarterly
reports.

Management Committees

There are four management committees with important roles and responsibilities in the risk management function: the MC, the ERMC, the ALCO and the CMC.
These committees and their risk-related roles are described below.

Management Committee

The MC is under the oversight of the Board of Directors and is comprised of our senior executives and chaired by our Chief Executive Officer. The MC has
responsibility for reviewing and approving lending and investment activities of the Company, such as equity investments, acquisitions, dispositions, joint
ventures, portfolio deals and investment issues regarding the Company. It is also responsible for overseeing the Company’s approach to managing its
investments, reviewing and approving the Company’s annual strategic plan and annual operating plan, and overseeing activities administered by its Credit,
Culture, Information Technology, New Product Introduction, Investment Review and Pricing subcommittees. The MC also reviews management reports provided
on a periodic basis, or as requested, in order to monitor evolving issues, effectiveness of risk mitigation activities and performance against strategic plans. The
MC may make decisions only within the authority that is granted to it by the Board of Directors and must escalate any investment or other proposals outside of
its authority to the Board of Directors for final decision.

ERMC

The ERMC is a management committee under the oversight of the Risk Committee and is comprised of senior executives and chaired by the CRO. The ERMC
has responsibility for risk oversight across the Company and for reporting on material risks to our Risk Committee. The responsibilities of the ERMC include the
day-to-day oversight of risks impacting the Company, establishing a risk appetite statement and ensuring compliance across the Company with the overall risk
appetite. The ERMC also oversees establishment of risk management policies, the performance and functioning of the relevant overall risk management
function, and the implementation of appropriate governance activities and systems that support control of risks.
