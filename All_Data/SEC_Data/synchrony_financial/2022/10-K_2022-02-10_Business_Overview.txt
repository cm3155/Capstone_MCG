OUR BUSINESS

Our Company
____________________________________________________________________________________________

We are a premier consumer financial services company delivering one of the industry's most complete, digitally-enabled product suites. Our experience, expertise
and scale encompass a broad spectrum of industries, including digital, health and wellness, retail, home, auto, powersports, jewelry, pets and more. We have an
established and diverse group of national and regional retailers, local merchants, manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations and healthcare service
providers, which we refer to as our “partners.” We connect our partners and consumers through our dynamic financial ecosystem and provide them with a diverse
set of financing solutions and innovative digital capabilities to address their specific needs and deliver seamless, omnichannel experiences. We utilize a broad set
of distribution channels, including mobile apps and websites, as well as online marketplaces and business management solutions like Point-of-Sale platforms. Our
offerings include private label, dual, co-brand and general purpose credit cards, as well as short- and long-term installment loans and consumer banking products.
During 2021, we financed $165.9 billion of purchase volume, and at December 31, 2021, we had $80.7 billion of loan receivables and 72.4 million active accounts.

Our business benefits from longstanding and collaborative relationships with our partners, including some of the nation’s leading retailers and manufacturers with
well-known consumer brands, such as Lowe’s and Sam's Club and also leading digital partners, such as Amazon and PayPal. We believe our business model has
been successful because it aligns our interests with those of our partners and provides substantial value to both our partners and our customers. Our partners
promote our credit products because they generate increased sales and strengthen customer loyalty. Our customers benefit from instant access to credit,
discounts, or other benefits such as cash back rewards, and promotional offers. We seek to differentiate ourselves through our deep industry expertise, our long
history of consumer lending, our innovative digital capabilities and our diverse product suite. We have omni-channel (in-store, online and mobile) technology and
marketing capabilities, which allow us to offer and deliver our credit products instantly to customers across multiple channels. We continue to invest in, and
develop, our digital assets to ensure our partners are well positioned for the rapidly evolving environment. We have been able to demonstrate our digital
capabilities by providing solutions that meet the needs of our partners and customers, with approximately 55% of our consumer revolving applications in 2021
processed through a digital channel.

We conduct our operations through a single business segment. Profitability and expenses, including funding costs, credit losses and operating expenses, are
managed for the business as a whole. Substantially all of our revenue activities are within the United States. In June 2021, we announced organizational changes
aimed to further align the company’s activities with its partners and evolving consumer expectations, while leveraging our innovation, data, expertise and scale to
deliver products and capabilities to market faster. As part of these changes, we established a Growth Organization that includes our marketing, data, analytics,
customer experience and product development teams in one cohesive group and we also combined our Technology and Operations teams. For our sales activities,
we now primarily manage our credit products through five sales platforms (Home & Auto, Digital, Diversified & Value, Health & Wellness and Lifestyle). Those
platforms are organized by the types of partners we work with, and are measured on interest and fees on loans, loan receivables, active accounts and other sales
metrics.

We offer our credit products primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank. In addition, through the Bank, we offer, directly to retail and commercial
customers, a range of deposit products insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), including certificates of deposit, individual retirement
accounts (“IRAs”), money market accounts and savings accounts. We also take deposits at the Bank through third-party securities brokerage firms that offer our
FDIC-insured deposit products to their customers. We have significantly expanded our online direct banking operations in recent years and our deposit base serves
as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding for our credit activities. At December 31, 2021, we had $62.3 billion in deposits, which represented 81% of our
total funding sources.

Our Partner Agreements
____________________________________________________________________________________________

Revenue

Our revenue we earn from our agreements with our partners primarily consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables, and in our program agreements that
contain promotional financing, includes “merchant discounts,” which are fees paid to us by our partners in almost all cases to compensate us for all or part of the
foregone interest income associated with promotional financing. We offer promotional financing across all five of our sales platforms.

The types of promotional financing we offer includes deferred interest (interest accrues during a promotional period and becomes payable if the full purchase
amount is not paid off during the promotional period), no interest (no interest on a promotional purchase) and reduced interest (interest is assessed monthly at a
promotional interest rate during the promotional period). As a result, during the promotional period we do not generate interest income or generate it at a lower rate,
although we continue to generate fee income relating to late fees on required minimum payments. For these promotional financing offerings, we generally partner
with sellers of “big-ticket” products or services or large basket transactions (generally priced from $500 to $25,000+) to consumers where our financing products
and industry expertise provide strong incremental value to our partners and their customers. In addition to our revolving product we also offer secured installment
loans for the big ticket items primarily in our Outdoor and Powersport industries. We also promote our programs to sellers through direct marketing activities such
as industry trade publications, trade shows and sales efforts by dedicated internal and external sales teams, leveraging our existing partner network or through
endorsements through manufacturers and industry associations. Our broad array of point-of-sale technologies and quick enrollment process allow us to quickly and
effectively integrate new partners.

Our five largest programs based upon interest and fees on loans for the year ended December 31, 2021, excluding the Gap Inc. program, were Amazon,
JCPenney, Lowe’s, PayPal and Sam’s Club. These programs accounted in aggregate for 50% of our total interest and fees on loans for the year ended
December 31, 2021, and 51% of loan receivables at December 31, 2021. Our programs with Lowe's and PayPal, which includes our Venmo program, each
accounted for more than 10% of our total interest and fees on loans for the year ended December 31, 2021. The length of our relationship with each of our five
largest partners is over 14 years, and in the case of Lowe's, 42 years. The current expiration dates for these agreements range from 2026 through 2030.

11

In August 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell loan receivables associated with our program agreement with Gap Inc. We expect to recognize a gain on sale
of the portfolio, which, subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2022.

Other income related to our program agreements primarily consists of interchange fees earned when our Dual Card or general purpose co-branded cards are used
outside of our partners’ sales channels and fees paid to us by customers who purchase our debt cancellation products, less costs incurred related to partner loyalty
program. In our Health & Wellness sales platform, Other income also includes commission fees earned by Pets Best.

Program Agreements

Our private label credit cards, Dual Cards and co-branded credit card programs for our retail and digital partners are typically governed by program agreements
that are each negotiated separately with our partners. Although the terms of the agreements are partner-specific, and may be amended from time to time, under a
typical program agreement, our partner agrees to support and promote the program to its customers, but we control credit criteria and issue products to customers
who qualify under those criteria. We own the underlying accounts and all loan receivables generated under the program from the time of origination. Other key
provisions in our program agreements include:

Term

Our program agreements typically have contract terms ranging from approximately three to ten years. Many program agreements have renewal clauses that
provide for automatic renewal for one or more years until terminated by us or our partner. We typically seek to renew the program agreements well in advance of
their termination dates. Some program agreements are subject to termination prior to the scheduled termination date by us or our partner for various reasons. See
Termination below for additional information.

Exclusivity

Our program agreements are typically exclusive for the products we offer and limit our partners’ ability to originate or promote other private label or co-branded
credit cards during the term of the agreement. The terms of our program agreements with national and regional retailers and manufacturers are typically similar to
the terms of our program agreements in that we are the exclusive provider of financing for the products we offer, or in the case of some of our programs, may allow
to have several primary lenders. Some program agreements, however, allow the merchant to use a second source lender after an application has been submitted
to us and declined.

Retailer Share Arrangements

Most of our program agreements with large retail and certain other partners contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our partner if the
economic performance of the program exceeds a contractually-defined threshold. Economic performance for the purposes of these arrangements is typically
measured based on agreed upon program revenues (including interest income and certain other income) less agreed upon program expenses (including interest
expense, provision for credit losses, retailer payments and operating expenses). We may also provide other economic benefits to our partners such as royalties on
purchase volume or payments for new accounts, in some cases instead of retailer share arrangements (for example, on our co-branded credit cards). All of these
arrangements align our interests and provide an additional incentive to our partners to promote our credit products.

Certain program agreements set forth the program’s economic terms, including the merchant discount applicable to each promotional finance offering. We typically
do not pay fees to these partners pursuant to any retailer share arrangements, but in some cases we pay a sign-up fee to a partner or provide volume-based
rebates on the merchant discount paid by the partner.

12

Other Economic Terms

In addition to the retailer share arrangements, the program agreements typically provide that the parties will develop a marketing plan to support the program, and
they set the terms by which a joint marketing budget is funded, the basic terms of the rewards program linked to the use of our product (such as opportunities to
receive double rewards points for purchases made on a product), and the allocation of costs related to the rewards program.

Termination

The program agreements set forth the circumstances in which a party may terminate the agreement prior to expiration. Our program agreements generally permit
us and our partner to terminate the agreement prior to its scheduled termination date for various reasons, including if the other party materially breaches its
obligations. Some program agreements also permit our partner to terminate the program if we fail to meet certain service levels or change certain key cardholder
terms or our credit criteria, we fail to achieve certain approval rate targets with respect to approvals of new customers, we elect not to increase the program size
when the outstanding loan receivables under the program reach certain thresholds, we are not adequately capitalized, certain force majeure events occur or certain
changes in our ownership occur. Certain program agreements are also subject to early termination by a party if the other party has a material adverse change in its
financial condition. Historically, these rights have not typically been triggered or exercised. Some of our program agreements provide that, upon termination or
expiration, our partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the accounts and loan receivables generated with respect to its program at fair market
value or a stated price, including all related customer data.

Buying Groups, Manufacturers and Industry Associations

The programs we have established with buying groups, manufacturers and industry associations, such as the Home Furnishings Association, Jewelers of America,
Kawasaki, Polaris and Nationwide Marketing Group, are governed by program agreements under which we make our credit products available to their respective
members or dealers. Under the terms of the program agreements, manufacturers and industry associations generally agree to support and promote the respective
programs. These arrangements may include sign-up fees and volume-based incentives paid by us to the groups and their members but these agreements
generally do not require the members or dealers to offer our products to their customers. Under the terms of the program agreements, buying groups,
manufacturers and industry associations generally agree to support and promote the respective programs.

Synchrony-Branded Networks

Our Synchrony-branded networks are focused on specific industries, where we create either company-branded or company and partner-branded private label
credit cards that are usable across all participating locations within the industry-specific network. For example, our Synchrony Car Care network, comprised of
merchants selling automotive parts, repair services and tires, covers over 1,000,000 locations across the United States, and cards issued may be dual branded
with Synchrony Car Care and partners such as Chevron, Citgo, Napa, P66, Pep Boys or Summit Racing. Under the terms of these networks, we establish
merchant discounts applicable to each financing offer. In addition, we also earn interchange fees through credit card transactions outside of the program network.
The Synchrony Car Care network allows for expanded use outside of the program network at certain related merchants, such as gas stations. Similarly, the
Synchrony HOME credit card is accepted at hundreds of thousands of home-related retail locations nationwide, including both partner locations and retailers
outside of our program network. See Healthcare Provider Agreements for a discussion of our CareCredit branded network.

Dealer Agreements

For the programs we have established with manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations, industry specific programs and Synchrony-branded networks
described above, we enter into individual agreements with the merchants and dealers that offer our credit products under these programs. These agreements
generally are not exclusive and some parties who offer our financing products also offer financing from our competitors. Our agreements generally continue until
terminated by either party, with termination typically available to either party at will upon 15 days’ written notice. Our dealer agreements set forth the economic
terms associated with the program, including the fees charged to dealers to offer promotional financing, and in some cases, allow us to periodically change the fees
we charge.

13

Healthcare Provider Agreements

We enter into provider agreements with individual healthcare providers who become part of our CareCredit network. These provider agreements are not exclusive
and typically may be terminated at will upon 15 days’ notice. Multi-year agreements are in place for larger multi-location relationships across all markets. There are
typically no retailer share arrangements with individual healthcare providers, national and regional healthcare providers and health-focused retailers in Health &
Wellness.

We screen potential healthcare providers using a variety of criteria, including whether the potential provider specializes in one of our approved specialties, carries
the appropriate licensing and certifications, and meets our underwriting criteria. We also screen potential partners for reputational issues. We work with
professional and other associations, manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations and healthcare consultants to educate their constituents about the
products and services we offer. We also approach individual healthcare service providers through direct mail, advertising, and at trade shows.

We believe our ability to attract new partners is aided by our CareCredit customer satisfaction rate, which our research in 2021 showed is 89%.

Our Customers
____________________________________________________________________________________________

Acquiring and Marketing to Our Customers

We work directly with our partners and providers to seamlessly integrate our product offerings through their distribution networks, communication channels and
customer interactions to market to their existing and potential customers. We believe our presence at partners’ points of sale (both physical (in-store) and digital
(online and mobile)), enables incremental purchases at our partners and providers, giving them greater conversion rates and higher overall sales. This dynamic
also enables us to acquire new customer accounts at a discount compared to the traditional methods of acquiring new credit card customers.

To acquire new customers, we collaborate and deeply integrate with our partners and providers leveraging our marketing expertise to create programs promoting
our products to creditworthy customers. Frequently, our partners and providers market the availability of credit as part of the advertising for their goods and
services. Our marketing programs include marketing offers (e.g., 10% off the customer’s first purchase) and consumer communications delivered through a variety
of channels, including in-store signage, online advertising, retailer website placement, associate communication, emails, text messages, direct mail campaigns,
advertising circulars, and outside marketing via television, radio, print, digital marketing (search engine optimization, paid search and personalization), and product
education. We also employ our proprietary Quickscreen acquisition method to make targeted pre-approved credit offers at the point-of-sale. Our Quickscreen
technology allows us to process customer information obtained from our partners through our risk models such that when these customers seek to make payment
for goods and services at our partners' points-of-sale, we can offer them credit instantly, if appropriate. Based on our experience, due to the personalized and
immediate nature of the offer, Quickscreen significantly outperforms traditional direct-to-consumer channels, such as direct mail or email, in response rate and
dollar spending.

Our marketing teams have expertise and experience in media strategy and planning and understand the best opportunities to reach and engage consumers,
driving qualified traffic to apply efficiently, and enabling reach, new customer, and sales conversions. These capabilities also help to drive acquisitions, product
usage and value proposition reinforcement.

After a customer obtains one of our products, our marketing programs encourage ongoing card usage by communicating the benefits of our products’ value
propositions or deepening the relationship with the customer. Examples of such programs include promotional financing offers, cardholder events, product and
partner discounts, product upgrades, dollar-off certificates, account holder sales, reward points and offers, new product announcements and previews, and other
specific partner value offerings. These programs are executed through our partners’ and our own (direct to consumer) distribution channels. These activities
targeted to existing customers have yielded high levels of re-use of our credit products. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2021, 58% of purchase
volume across our CareCredit network, resulted from repeat use at one or more providers.

14

Loyalty Programs

We operate loyalty programs designed to generate incremental purchase volume per customer, while reinforcing the value of the card to the customer and
strengthening customer loyalty. Many of the credit rewards loyalty programs we manage provide rewards points, which are redeemable for a variety of products or
awards, or merchandise discounts earned by achieving a pre-set spending level on their private label credit card, Dual Card or general purpose co-branded credit
card. Other programs include statement credit or cash back rewards. The rewards can be mailed to the cardholder, accessed digitally or may be immediately
redeemable at the partner’s store. We continue to support and integrate into our partners’ loyalty programs which are offered to customers who utilize non-credit
payment types such as cash, debit or check. These multi-tender loyalty programs allow our partners to market to an expanded customer base and allow us access
to additional prospective cardholders.

Commercial Customers

In addition to our efforts to acquire consumer cardholders, we continue to focus on acquiring small to mid-sized commercial customers. We offer these customers
private label credit cards and Dual Cards that are similar to our consumer offerings and our approach to acquiring these customers is consistent with our consumer
strategies. We are also continuing to focus on marketing our commercial pay-in-full accounts receivable product that supports a wide range of business customers.

Our Credit Products
____________________________________________________________________________________________

Through our sales platforms, we offer three principal types of credit products: credit cards, commercial credit products and consumer installment loans. We also
offer a debt cancellation product.

The following table sets forth each credit product by type and indicates the percentage of our total loan receivables that are under standard terms only or pursuant

Our credit card products are loans we extend through open-ended revolving credit card accounts. We offer the following principal types of credit cards:

Private Label Credit Cards

Private label credit cards are partner-branded credit cards (e.g., Lowe’s or Amazon) or program-branded credit cards (e.g., Synchrony Car Care or CareCredit) that
are used primarily for the purchase of goods and services from the partner or within the program network. In addition, in some cases, cardholders may be permitted
to access their credit card accounts for cash advances.

15

Credit under a private label credit card typically is extended either on standard terms only, which means accounts are assessed periodic interest charges using an
agreed non-promotional fixed and/or variable interest rate, or pursuant to a promotional financing offer, involving deferred interest, no interest or reduced interest
during a set promotional period. Promotional periods typically range between six and 60 months, but we may agree to longer terms with the partner. In almost all
cases, we receive a merchant discount from our partners to compensate us for all or part of the foregone interest income associated with promotional financing.
The terms of these promotions vary by partner, but generally the longer the deferred interest, reduced interest or interest-free period, the greater the partner’s
merchant discount. Some offers permit customers to pay for a purchase in equal monthly payments with no interest or at a reduced interest rate, rather than
deferring or delaying interest charges. For our deferred interest products, approximately 80% of customer transactions are typically paid off before interest is
assessed. In Health & Wellness, standard rate financing generally applies to charges under $200.

We typically do not charge interchange or other fees to our partners when a customer uses a private label credit card to purchase our partners’ goods and services
through our payment system.

Most of our private label credit card business is in the United States. For some of our partners who have locations in Canada, we also support the issuance and
acceptance of private label credit cards at their locations in Canada and from customers in Canada.

Dual Cards and General Purpose Co-Branded Cards

Our patented Dual Cards are credit cards that function as private label credit cards when used to purchase goods and services from our partners, and as general
purpose credit cards when used to make purchases from other retailers wherever cards from those card networks are accepted or for cash advance transactions.
We currently issue Dual Cards for use on the MasterCard and Visa networks and we have the potential capability to issue Dual Cards for use on the American
Express and Discover networks.

We hold two U.S. patents relating to the process by which our Dual Cards function as a private label credit card when used to make purchases from our partners
and function as a general purpose credit card when used on the systems of other credit card associations.

We also offer general purpose co-branded credit cards that do not function as private label credit cards, as well as, a Synchrony-branded general purpose credit
card.

Credit extended under our Dual Cards and general purpose co-branded credit cards typically is extended on standard terms only. Dual Cards and general purpose
co-branded credit cards are offered across all of our sales platforms. At December 31, 2021, we offered either Dual Cards or general purpose co-branded credit
cards through 21 credit partners, of which the majority are Dual Cards, as well as our CareCredit Dual Card. We intend to continue to increase the number of
partner programs that offer Dual Cards or general purpose co-branded credit cards and seek to increase the portion of our loan receivables attributable to these
products. Consumer Dual Cards and Co-branded cards totaled 25% of our total loan receivables portfolio, including held for sale at December 31, 2021.

Charges using a Dual Card or general purpose co-branded credit card generate interchange income for us in connection with purchases made by cardholders
other than in-store or online from that partner.

We currently do not issue Dual Cards or general purpose co-branded credit cards in Canada.

Terms and Conditions

As a general matter, the financial terms and conditions governing our credit card products vary by program and product type and change over time, although we
seek to standardize the non-financial provisions consistently across all products. The terms and conditions of our credit card products are governed by a cardholder
agreement and applicable laws and regulations.

We assign each card account a credit limit when the account is initially opened. Thereafter, we may increase or decrease individual credit limits from time to time,
at our discretion, based primarily on our evaluation of the customer’s creditworthiness and ability to pay.

16

For the vast majority of accounts, periodic interest charges are calculated using the daily balance method, which results in daily compounding of periodic interest
charges, subject to, at times, a grace period on new purchases. Cash advances are not subject to a grace period, and some credit card programs do not provide a
grace period for promotional purchases. In addition to periodic interest charges, we may impose other charges and fees on credit card accounts, including, as
applicable and provided in the cardholder agreement, cash advance transaction fees and late fees where a customer has not paid at least the minimum payment
due by the required due date.

Typically, each customer with an outstanding debit balance on his or her credit card account must make a minimum payment each month. A customer may pay the
total amount due at any time without penalty. We also may enter into arrangements with delinquent customers to extend or otherwise change payment schedules
and to waive interest charges and/or fees.

Commercial Credit Products

We offer private label cards and Dual Cards for commercial customers that are similar to our consumer offerings. We also offer a commercial pay-in-full accounts
receivable product to a wide range of business customers.

Installment Loans

We originate installment loans to consumers (and a limited number of commercial customers) in the United States, primarily in the power products market
(motorcycles, ATVs and lawn and garden), as well as through our various SetPay installment products (such as our SetPay Pay in 4 product for short-term loans).
Installment loans are closed-end credit accounts where the customer pays down the outstanding balance in installments. The terms of our installment loans are
governed by customer agreements and applicable laws and regulations.

Installment loans are generally assessed periodic finance charges using fixed interest rates. In addition to periodic finance charges, we may impose other charges
and fees on loan accounts, including late fees where a customer has not made the required payment by the required due date and returned payment fees.

Debt Cancellation Products

We offer a debt cancellation product to our credit card customers via online, mobile and, on a limited basis, direct mail. Customers who choose to purchase this
product are charged a monthly fee based on their ending balance on each billing statement. In return, the Bank will cancel all or a portion of a customer’s credit
card balance in the event of certain qualifying life events.

Growth Organization
____________________________________________________________________________________________

On June 1, 2021 we made organizational changes aimed to further align the company’s resources with its partners and evolving consumer expectations, while
leveraging its innovation, data, expertise, and scale to deliver products and capabilities to market faster. We believe these changes will help Synchrony drive
continued growth, execute its strategy more quickly and deliver the right capabilities to partners and consumers through one of the industry’s most complete,
digitally enabled consumer financing and payments product suite.

Our Growth organization brings together Synchrony’s marketing, data analytics, customer experience, product development, and incubation teams into one
cohesive group. The Growth organization works to bring data-driven, consumer-focused offerings to market across partner portfolios, with a focus on seamless
customer experiences. This team elevates Synchrony’s focus on digital products and capabilities, while driving commercialization strategies to proactively deliver
for the company’s partners and consumers.

Products

Our Products team is focused on the development and delivery of new products and capabilities to enhance consumers' shopping journey and to anticipate the
evolving needs of consumers and retailers. We work to ensure our products continuously meet the changing needs of our customers, partners and the competitive
marketplace, while providing scalability of products across our sales platforms and partners.

The Product organization includes:

•

•

•

An innovation team accountable for ideating and delivering scalable product and capability innovations that will produce a competitive advantage in the
marketplace and provide opportunities for growth.

Products and capability management to oversee the product lifecycle and prioritize ongoing enhancements to our suite of products and capabilities.

Implementation of a product lifecycle approach to product management to ensure the most relevant products continue to be developed and prioritized.

In 2021 we also focused on expanding our product suite with our SetPay and SetPay Pay in 4 installment products. Our SetPay product for 3-84 month installment
loans was enhanced with an entirely reimagined online servicing experience and are now building the ability for customers to access their revolving accounts and
installment loans all in one place. We have also launched our SetPay Pay in 4 product for short-term loans, introducing an entirely digital experience that leverages
all of our previous investments in our digital apply ("dApply") platform, as well as our investments in our credit underwriting platform.

Performance Marketing

The performance marketing organization brings expertise in media strategy and planning, channel innovation and execution, as well as in earned, paid and owned
media. We work with our partners to understand the best opportunities to reach and engage consumers who are more likely to apply and use our financial
products.

We are also well positioned to maximize our unique access to data and customer touchpoints to identify the strongest audiences for credit acquisition and
utilization, and to analyze behaviors driving insights that fuel creative content and contextually relevant placements with platforms and publishers.

Recognizing organic search, content development, and personalized marketing are critical to online marketing strategy, we have built a team of experts who focus
on working on our digital properties. We create a complete digital media strategy, using all channels to effectively drive qualified traffic and to bring prospects back
to the site efficiently to apply. This team also offers support for our clients and partners to help drive increase in site usability, enhance brand awareness, and
increase lead generation and sales conversions.

18

Digital and Mobile Capabilities

We remain focused on investing in our digital and mobile capabilities, bringing to market new features, channels and experiences for our customers and enhancing
our existing digital design and user experience. Our approach continues to be focused on creating an exceptional digital experience through all aspects of the
customer's journey, whether in-store or online. In 2021, our investments focused on continuing to launch new digital features to enhance the customer experience,
expanding our product suite to offer more choice to our customers, and developing new distribution channels to make it easier for our partners and customers to
leverage our capabilities. In 2021, digital applications represented approximately 55% of our consumer revolving applications received, demonstrating the
continued shift in consumer trends towards digital experiences.

In 2021 we launched our new cardholder notifications and alerts platform across many of our largest portfolios. This new platform offers customers a broad suite of
account notifications across every aspect of the credit lifecycle, from notifications that a new card has shipped to instant transaction alerts, all enhanced with
enriched merchant data. In addition to text and email alerts, we are able to deliver these notifications and alerts directly within our partner’s iOS and Android apps
by leveraging our patented SyPI platform, continuing to enhance the customer’s experience within our partner’s brands.

With the launch of the myWalgreens Credit Card program, we again displayed our focus on creating an exceptional digital experience by bringing together many of
our newest digital capabilities. From leveraging our Direct to Device APIs and our new prequalification capability to bring a seamless digital apply experience at the
point of sale, to deploying the capability to instantly load tokenized virtual cards to the customer’s Walgreen’s profile. In addition, our investments in contactless
capabilities have continued to expand with the rollout of our digital card and activation via QR code. Leveraging our SyPI platform, we are now able to allow
customers to provision their account to wallets such as Apple Pay directly from the Walgreens and other client apps. Taken together, these investments help create
a holistic and seamless digital experience for the customer.

In addition, we have continued to introduce new distribution channels to make it easy for our partners to leverage our products, such as our app integrations with
Epic App Orchard to enable health care providers to offer our CareCredit product, and our partnership with Fiserv to enable Synchrony products and capabilities via
the Clover App Market. These digital capabilities offer a range of choices to our partners both in the products available to offer to customers, and in the flexibility of
easy integration options.

Data Analytics

As our products, partnerships, and networks come together, the ultimate benefit is the ability to align the customers’ and Synchrony’s needs across our over 70
million active accounts. Through each step of the customer journey – even before acquisition – our customers expect personalized products, experiences,
messaging, and service. These are all enabled through continuous comprehensive data analytics. Synchrony gathers thousands of customer data points curated
through customer interactions with Synchrony, our partners, and third-party data providers. Through the combination of effective data management, curation of data
products for internal use, performance tracking and measurement, and development of decision signals leveraging machine learning algorithms and other data
science methods, our over 200 business analysts and data scientists support decision making throughout the business.

Our analytics teams help us expand and optimize customer relationships through the building of targeting tools and the deployment of detailed test-and-learn
tracking of omni-channel marketing campaigns. This closed loop learning process uses a set of analytics tools and machine learning algorithms to read and react to
the customer’s response to these treatments. This learning can be applied to decisions around ad placements, creatives, visuals, messaging, and offers to relevant
customer segments. This example is repeated thousands of times a month across digital and non-digital use cases to constantly maximize campaign response,
customer acquisition, customer share of wallet, and program profitability.

In addition, our understanding of our Dual Card and general purpose co-branded credit card programs are further enhanced by the collection and analysis of data
on customers' spending patterns (merchant category code, online spend, etc.) at other retailers. These additional data help drive incremental volume for our
programs while maximizing return on investment.

Consumer Banking
__________________________________________________________________________________________

Through the Bank, we offer our customers a range of FDIC-insured deposit products. The Bank also takes brokered deposits through third-party securities
brokerage firms that offer our FDIC-insured deposit products to their customers. At December 31, 2021, we had $62.3 billion in deposits, $50.1 billion of which were
direct deposits and $12.2 billion of which were brokered deposits. At December 31, 2021, deposits represented 81% of our total funding sources. During 2021,
retail deposits were received from approximately 450,000 customers that had a total of approximately 800,000 accounts. Retail customers accounted for
substantially all of our direct deposits at December 31, 2021. The Bank had a 82% retention rate on certificates of deposit balances up for renewal for the year
ended December 31, 2021. FDIC insurance is provided for our deposit products up to applicable limits.

We have expanded our online direct banking operations in recent years and our deposit base serves as a source of stable and diversified low-cost funding for our
credit activities. Our online platform is highly scalable allowing us to expand without having to rely on a traditional “brick and mortar” branch network. We continue
to focus on growing our direct banking operations and believe we are well-positioned to continue to benefit from the consumer-driven shift from branch banking to
direct banking. According to the 2021 American Bankers Association survey, approximately 80% of customers primarily use direct channels (internet, mail, phone
and mobile) to manage their bank accounts.

During 2021 we continued to make investments in our servicing and digital platforms to expand features available for self-service and improve the user experience
including allowing digital applications for the Synchrony Mastercard product. In addition, the Bank entered into an affinity deposit arrangement with PayPal in which
the Bank will be offering PayPal-branded savings accounts through PayPal’s mobile application and website.

Our deposit products include certificates of deposit, IRAs, money market accounts and savings accounts. We market our deposit products through multiple
channels including digital and print. Customers can apply for, fund, and service their deposit accounts online, mobile or via phone. We have dedicated banking
representatives within our call centers to service deposit accounts. Fiserv, Inc. (“Fiserv”) provides the core banking platform for our online retail deposits including a
customer-facing account opening and servicing platform.

To attract new deposits and retain existing ones, we intend to introduce new deposit products, enhancements to our existing products, and deliver new capabilities.
This may include the introduction of checking accounts, overdraft protection lines of credit, bill payment and person-to-person payment features, affinity
relationships, and Synchrony-branded debit cards. Our focus on deposit-taking and related branding efforts will also enable us to offer other branded direct-banking
products more efficiently in the future.

We seek to differentiate our deposit product offerings from our competitors on the basis of brand, reputation, convenience, customer service and value. Our deposit
products emphasize reliability, trust, security, convenience and attractive rates. We offer rewards to customers based on their tenure or balance amounts, including
reduced fees, travel offers and concierge telephone support.

Credit Risk Management
____________________________________________________________________________________________

Credit risk management is a critical component of our management and growth strategy. Credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising from customer default when
customers are unable or unwilling to meet their financial obligations to us. Our credit risk arising from credit products is generally highly diversified across
approximately 136 million open accounts at December 31, 2021, without significant individual exposures. We manage credit risk primarily according to customer
segments and product types.

We have developed proprietary credit tools which we call Synchrony PRISM. Through Synchrony PRISM we leverage a broad spectrum of data to yield powerful,
proprietary insights to enable a more holistic view of our applications and customers.

20

Customer Account Acquisition

We have developed programs to promote credit with each of our partners and apply a consistent underwriting approach using our Synchrony PRISM tools that
have varying results across our client portfolios based on underlying credit characteristics. We originate credit accounts through several different channels,
including in-store, mail, internet, mobile, telephone and pre-approved solicitations. In addition, we have, and may in the future, acquire accounts that were
originated by third parties in connection with establishing programs with new partners.

Regardless of the channel, in making the initial credit approval decision to open a credit card or other account or otherwise grant credit, we follow a series of credit
risk and underwriting procedures. In most cases, when applications are made in-store or digitally, the process is fully automated and applicants are notified of our
credit decision immediately. We generally obtain certain information provided by the applicant and obtain a credit bureau report from one of the major credit
bureaus. The credit report information we obtain is electronically transmitted into industry scoring models and our proprietary scoring models developed to calculate
a credit score. The credit risk management team determines in advance the qualifying credit scores and initial credit line assignments for each portfolio and product
type. We periodically analyze performance trends of accounts originated at different score levels as compared to projected performance and adjust the minimum
score or the opening credit limit to manage credit risk.

We also apply additional application screens based on various inputs, including credit bureau information, alternative data, our previous experience with the
customer and information provided by our partner, to help identify additional factors, such as potential fraud and prior bankruptcies, before qualifying the application
for approval. We compare applicants’ names against the Specially Designated Nationals list maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S.
Department of the Treasury (“OFAC”), as well as screens that account for adherence to USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the “Patriot Act”) and Credit Card Accountability
Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the “CARD Act”) requirements, including ability to pay requirements for our revolving products.

We also use pre-approved account solicitations for certain programs. Potential applicants are pre-screened using information provided by our partner or obtained
from outside lists, and qualified individuals receive a pre-approved credit offer by mail or email.

Acquired Portfolio Evaluation

Our risk management team evaluates each portfolio that we acquire in connection with establishing programs with new partners to ensure the portfolio satisfies our
credit risk guidelines. As part of this review, we receive data on the third-party accounts and loans, which allows us to assess the portfolio on the basis of certain
core characteristics, such as historical performance of the assets and distributions of credit and loss information. In addition, we benchmark potential portfolio
acquisitions against our existing programs to assess relative current and projected risks. Finally, our risk management team must approve the acquisition, taking
into account the results of our risk assessment process. Once assets are migrated to our systems, our account management protocols will apply immediately as
described below under “—Customer Account Management,” “—Credit Authorizations of Individual Transactions” and “—Collections.”

Customer Account Management

We regularly assess the credit risk exposure of our customer accounts. This ongoing assessment includes information relating to the customer’s performance with
respect to their account with us, as well as information from credit bureaus relating to the customer’s broader credit performance. To monitor and control the quality
of our loan portfolio (including the portion of the portfolio originated by third parties), we use behavioral scoring models that we have developed to score each active
account on its monthly cycle date. Proprietary risk models, together with the credit scores obtained on each active account no less than quarterly, are an integral
part of our credit decision-making process. Depending on the duration of the customer’s account, risk profile and other performance metrics, the account may be
subject to a range of account actions, including limits on transaction authorization and increases or decreases in purchase and cash credit limits.

21

Credit Authorizations of Individual Transactions

Once an account has been opened, when a credit card is used to make a purchase in-store at one of our partners’ locations or online, point-of-sale terminals or
online sites have an online connection with our credit authorization system, which allows for real-time updating of accounts. Each potential sales transaction is
passed through a transaction authorization system, which considers a variety of behavior and risk factors to determine whether the transaction should be approved
or declined, and whether a credit limit adjustment is warranted.

Fraud Investigation

We provide follow up and research with respect to different types of fraud such as fraud rings, new account fraud and transactional fraud. We have developed a
proprietary fraud model to identify new account fraud and deployed tools that help identify transaction purchase behavior outside a customer’s established pattern.
Our proprietary model is also complemented by externally sourced models and tools used across the industry to better identify fraud and protect our customers. We
also are continuously implementing new and improved technologies to detect and prevent fraud.

Collections and Recovery

All monthly billing statements of accounts with past due amounts include a request for payment of these amounts. Collections personnel generally initiate contact
with customers within 30 days after any portion of their balance becomes past due. The nature and the timing of the initial contact, typically a personal call, email,
text message or letter, are determined by a review of the customer’s prior account activity and payment habits.

We re-evaluate our collection and recovery efforts and consider the implementation of other techniques, including internal collection activities, use of external
vendors and the sale of debt to third-party buyers, as a customer becomes increasingly delinquent. We limit our exposure to delinquencies through controls within
the transaction authorization processes, the imposition of credit limits and criteria-based account suspension and revocation processes. In certain situations, we
may enter into arrangements to extend or otherwise change payment schedules, decrease interest rates and/or waive fees to aid customers experiencing financial
difficulties in their efforts to become current on their obligations to us.

Customer Service
____________________________________________________________________________________________

Customer service is an important feature of our relationship with our partners. Our customers can contact us via phone, mail, email, eService and eChat. During
the year ended December 31, 2021, we handled over 281 million inquiries. For certain programs, credit products and our deposit business, we assign dedicated
toll-free customer service phone numbers. For other programs, customers access customer service through one general purpose toll-free customer service phone
number.

We service all programs through our nine domestic geographic hubs and three off-shore call centers. We blend domestic and off-shore locations as an important
part of our servicing strategy, to maintain service availability beyond normal work hours in the United States and to seek optimal costs. Customer service for cards
issued to customers in Canada is supported through agents based in the United States.

Given the nature of our business and the high volume of calls, we maintain several centers of excellence to ensure the quality of our customer service across all of
our sites. Examples of these centers of excellence include back office, quality assurance, customer experience, training, workforce and capacity planning,
surveillance and process control.

22

Production Services
____________________________________________________________________________________________

Our production services organization oversees a number of services, including:

•

•

•

•

payment processing (more than 600 million paper and electronic payments in 2021);

embossing and mailing credit cards (more than 45 million cards in 2021);

printing and mailing and eService delivery of credit card statements (more than 700 million paper and electronic statements in 2021); and

other letters mailed or sent electronically (more than 95 million in 2021).

We utilize third-party providers for certain production services. Credit card statement printing, card embossing, letter production and mailing services for U.S.
customers are provided through outsourced services with Fiserv. Fiserv also produces our statements and other mailings for deposit customers. We also utilize a
third-party provider for our paper payment processing services. While these services are outsourced, we monitor and maintain oversight of these other activities.

Card production embossing, statement printing and mailing services related to cards issued to customers in Canada are outsourced to Canadian suppliers.

Technology and Data Security
____________________________________________________________________________________________

Products and Services

We leverage information technology to deliver products and services that meet the needs of our customers and partners and enables us to operate our business
efficiently. The integration of our technology with our partners is at the core of our value proposition, enabling, among other things, customers to “apply and buy” at
the point of sale, and many of our partners to settle transactions directly with us without an interchange fee. A key part of our strategic focus is the continued
development of innovative, efficient, flexible technology and operational platforms to support marketing, risk management, account acquisition and account
management, customer service, and new product innovation and development. We believe that the continued investment in and development of these platforms is
an important part of our efforts to increase our competitive capabilities, reduce costs, improve quality and provide faster, more flexible technology services.
Therefore, we continuously review capabilities and develop or acquire systems, processes and competencies to meet our business needs.

As part of our continuous efforts to enhance our technological capabilities, we may either develop these capabilities internally or in partnership with third-party
providers. Our internal approach involves deployment of cross-functional product teams, often in collaboration with our partners, focused on driving rapid delivery of
in-house product innovation and development, and the commercialization of new products. In addition, at times we also partner with third-party providers to help us
deliver systems and operational infrastructure based on strategies and, in some cases, architecture, designed by us. We leverage Fiserv for our credit card
transaction processing and production and our retail banking operations.

Data Security

The protection and security of financial and personal information of consumers is one of our highest priorities. We have implemented a comprehensive information
security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards that we believe provide an appropriate level of protection to maintain the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our Company's and our customers’ information. This includes protecting against any known or evolving threats to the
security or integrity of customer records and information, and against unauthorized access to or use of customer records or information.

23

Our information security program is continuously adapting to an evolving landscape of emerging threats and available technology. Through data gathering and
evaluation of emerging threats from internal and external incidents and technology investments, security controls are adjusted on a continuous basis. We work
directly with our partners on an ongoing basis by sharing cyber intelligence and facilitating awareness and communications of events outside of the Company.

We have developed a security strategy and implemented multiple layers of controls embedded throughout our technology environment that establish multiple
control points between threats and our assets. Our security program is designed to provide oversight of third parties who store, process or have access to sensitive
data, and we require the same level of protection from such third-party service providers. We evaluate the effectiveness of the key security controls through
ongoing assessment and measurement.

In addition, we identify risks that may threaten customer information and utilize both internal and external resources to perform a variety of vulnerability and
penetration testing on the platforms, systems and applications used to provide our products and services. We employ backup and disaster recovery procedures for
all the systems that are used for storing, processing and transferring customer information, and we periodically test and validate our disaster recovery plans to
validate our resilience capabilities. Further, we regularly utilize independent assessors to evaluate the appropriateness of our overall program. We are compliant
with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS) and Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).

We have a program to comply with applicable privacy, information security, and data protection requirements imposed by federal, state, and foreign laws. However,
if we experience a significant cybersecurity incident or our regulators deemed our information security controls to be inadequate, we could be subject to supervisory
criticism or penalties, and/or suffer reputational harm.

See also “Risk Factors Relating to Our Business—Cyber-attacks or other security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business.”

Intellectual Property
____________________________________________________________________________________________

We use a variety of methods, such as trademarks, patents, copyrights and trade secrets, to protect our intellectual property, including our brand, “Synchrony.” We
also place appropriate restrictions on our proprietary information to control access and prevent unauthorized disclosures. Our brands are important assets, and we
take steps to protect the value of these assets and our reputation.

Human Capital
____________________________________________________________________________________________

At Synchrony, people power our business, and our success depends, in large part, on our ability to recruit, develop, motivate and retain employees with the skills to
execute our long-term strategy. In 2021, we significantly revised our approach to human capital management in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We
transformed how we work, how we support our people and how we connect and engage, with a focus on being nimble and agile. We have also changed our overall
approach to getting work done by adopting a “hub” model that will enable employees across job roles and levels to work from home when they want (or full-time)
and visit a hub — e.g. a co-working space, Synchrony office, university space or other gathering spots — when they need to meet face-to-face. Once the pandemic
is over, physical hubs will be used as cultural and innovation centers by hosting events, collaboration days, town halls, agile sprints, networking and other important
business activities, allowing us to retain the human, personal connection of a traditional workplace while providing employees greater flexibility.

24

At Synchrony, we are so proud of the many new benefits and programs that we have created for our employees. But we believe we are never done. It is why we
will continue to listen to our employees and adapt to their needs. Through ongoing, multichannel communications such as all-employee town halls where questions
are submitted to our CEO and other senior leaders or through more targeted pulse surveys of our employee base, their feedback is included in our decision-making
process. Once a year, Synchrony partners with Great Place to Work® to conduct our annual employee engagement survey. The results help us better understand
what our employees think we’re doing right and identify areas for positive change. 89% of Synchrony employee participated in our employee engagement survey
globally and 93% of the participants responded, “Taking all things into account, I would say this is a great place to work”. 93% of participants also told us the new
way of working is providing the flexibility they need.

At December 31, 2021 we had over 18,000 full-time employees. Our global workforce increased compared to the prior year as we have begun to emerge from the
COVID-19 pandemic. At December 31, 2021, our global workforce was 59.4% female, 40.5% male and 0.1% that did not list gender. In the United States, ethnicity
of our workforce was 53.2% White, 19.6% Black, 15.6% Hispanic, 6.8% Asian, 3.4% two or more races, 0.6% Native American, 0.1% Native Hawaiian or Pacific
Islander and 0.7% that did not list ethnicity.

At Synchrony, diversity and inclusion are core to our corporate culture. We have over 10,000 employees participating in at least one of our eight Diversity Networks.
In 2021, we embraced our responsibility to further integrate diversity and inclusion into our long-term business strategy. To drive progress over the long term, we
treat diversity and inclusion as important business priorities, with (i) new board-approved governance rules, imperatives, and accountability mechanisms to
measure results and (ii) a revised annual incentive program for 2021 that incorporated diversity factors when determining payouts. We also created a senior-level
committee led by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Diversity Officer, and others, charged with developing an enterprise-wide strategy, setting
measurable goals, and providing progress reports to our board and employees across all areas of the business. We used data analytics to identify gaps in our
hiring and promotion processes. As a result, we are putting more focus on the hiring, development, and progression of underrepresented minorities, with an
emphasis on Black and Hispanic talent. Among other actions, we have tied leaders’ performance metrics to diversity factors, provided for diverse candidate slates
for senior roles, and launched a new leadership development program designed to advance diverse employees.

At Synchrony, we are focused on supporting and responding to employees' needs. In 2021, we raised the minimum wage to $20 per hour for all hourly employees
in the U.S. and Puerto Rico and conduct a regular market pay analysis. We continued providing total wellness benefits for all employees including generous time
off and leave programs, diverse well-being coaches, financial counselors and fitness reimbursements. In 2020 and through 2021, we extended our emergency
backup childcare benefits for up to 60 days (increased from 10 days). This includes enhanced childcare reimbursement where employees can use any caregiver.

Regulation
____________________________________________________________________________________________

Our business, including our relationships with our customers, is subject to regulation, supervision and examination under U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and
regulations. These laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business, including lending and collection practices, treatment of our customers, safeguarding
deposits, customer privacy and information security, capital structure, liquidity, dividends and other capital distributions, transactions with affiliates, and conduct and
qualifications of personnel. Such laws and regulations directly and indirectly affect key drivers of our profitability, including, for example, capital and liquidity, product
offerings, risk management, and costs of compliance.

As a savings and loan holding company and financial holding company, Synchrony is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve
Board. As a large provider of consumer financial services, we are also subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the CFPB.

The Bank is a federally chartered savings association. As such, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency of the U.S. Treasury (the “OCC”), which is its primary regulator, and by the CFPB. In addition, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is
supervised by the FDIC. For a discussion of the specific regulations related to our business see “Regulation—Regulation Relating to Our Business” of this Form
10-K Report.

25

Competition
____________________________________________________________________________________________

Our industry continues to be highly competitive. We compete for relationships with partners in connection with retaining existing or establishing new consumer
credit programs. Our primary competitors for partners include major financial institutions such as Alliance Data Systems, American Express, Capital One,
JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, TD Bank and Wells Fargo, and to a lesser extent, financial technology companies and potential partners’ own in-house financing
capabilities. We compete for partners on the basis of a number of factors, including program financial and other terms, underwriting capabilities, marketing
expertise, service levels, product and service offerings (including incentive and loyalty programs), technological capabilities and integration, brand and reputation.
In addition, some of our competitors for partners have a business model that allows for their partners to manage underwriting (e.g., new account approval),
customer service and collections, and other core banking responsibilities that we retain.

We also compete for customer usage of our credit products. Consumer credit provided, and credit card payments made, using our cards constitute only a small
percentage of overall consumer credit provided and credit card payments in the United States. Consumers have numerous financing and payment options
available to them. As a form of payment, our products compete with cash, checks, debit cards, general purpose credit cards (Visa and MasterCard, American
Express and Discover Card), various forms of consumer installment loans, other private-label card brands, and, to a certain extent, prepaid cards. In the future, we
expect our products may face increased competitive pressure to the extent that our products are not, or do not continue to be, accepted in, or compatible with
digital wallet technologies such as Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, Android Pay and other similar technologies. We may also face increased competition from current
competitors or others who introduce or embrace disruptive technology that significantly changes the consumer credit and payment industry. We compete for
customers and their usage of our deposit products, and to minimize transfers to competitors of our customers’ outstanding balances, based on a number of factors,
including pricing (interest rates and fees), product offerings, credit limits, incentives (including loyalty programs) and customer service. Some of our competitors
provide a broader selection of services, including home and automobile loans, debit cards and bank branch ATM access, which may position them better among
customers who prefer to use a single financial institution to meet all of their financial needs. In addition, some of our competitors are substantially larger than we
are, may have substantially greater resources than we do or may offer a broader range of products and services than we do. Moreover, some of our competitors,
including new and emerging competitors in the digital and mobile payments space, are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or legislative scrutiny to
which we are subject. Non-bank providers of pay-over-time solutions, such as Affirm, Afterpay and others, extend consumer credit-like offerings but do not face the
same restrictions, such as capital requirements and other regulatory requirements, as banks which also could place us at a competitive disadvantage.

In our retail deposits business, we have acquisition and servicing capabilities similar to other direct-banking competitors. We compete for deposits with traditional
banks, and in seeking to grow our direct-banking business, we compete with other banks that have direct-banking models similar to ours, such as Ally Financial,
American Express, Barclays, Capital One 360, CIT, Citi, Citizens Bank, Discover and Marcus by Goldman Sachs. Competition among direct banks is intense
because online banking provides customers the ability to quickly and easily deposit and withdraw funds and open and close accounts in favor of products and
services offered by competitors.

Highlights for the Year Ended December 31, 2021

Below are highlights of our performance for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, as applicable, except as
otherwise noted.

•

•

•

•

Net earnings increased 204.8% to $4.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by
higher retailer share arrangements and lower net interest income. Net earnings included the impact of reserve reductions related to held for sale portfolios
of $261 million after-tax.

Loan receivables decreased 1.4% to $80.7 billion at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020, primarily driven by the reclassification of loan
receivables to loan receivables held for sale. Loan receivables held for sale at December 31, 2021 were comprised of $3.9 billion and $0.5 billion of loan
receivables associated with our Gap Inc. and BP portfolios, respectively. Excluding the impact of the reclassifications, loan receivables increased 4%
reflecting strong purchase volume growth, largely offset by higher payment rates.

Net interest income decreased 1.1% to $14.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to a decrease in interest and fees on loans of
4.5%, reflecting the impact of elevated payment rates and lower delinquencies during the period, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense primarily
reflecting lower benchmark interest rates.

Retailer share arrangements increased 24.2% to $4.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the decrease in provision for credit
losses.

• Over-30 day loan delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loan receivables decreased 45 basis points to 2.62% at December 31, 2021 from 3.07% at

December 31, 2020. Excluding amounts related to the held for sale portfolios from both periods, the decrease compared to the prior year was
approximately 60 basis points. The net charge-off rate decreased 166 basis points to 2.92% for the year ended December 31, 2021.

•

Provision for credit losses decreased by $4.6 billion, or 86.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by lower reserves, which included
$345 million of reserve reductions related to the held for sale portfolios, and lower net charge-offs. Our allowance coverage ratio (allowance for credit
losses as a percentage of period-end loan receivables) decreased to 10.76% at December 31, 2021, as compared to 12.54% at December 31, 2020.

• Other expense decreased by $92 million, or 2.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by lower operational losses, partially offset by

higher employee costs.

•

•

•

•

At December 31, 2021, deposits represented 81% of our total funding sources. Total deposits decreased 0.8% to $62.3 billion at December 31, 2021,
compared to December 31, 2020.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, we declared and paid cash dividends on our Series A 5.625% non-cumulative preferred stock of $56.24 per
share, or $42 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased $2.9 billion of our outstanding common stock, and declared and paid cash dividends of $0.88
per common share, or $500 million. At December 31, 2021, we had $1.2 billion of remaining authorized share repurchase capacity under our existing share
repurchase program. For more information, see “Capital—Dividend and Share Repurchases.”

In February 2021 in our Health & Wellness sales platform, we completed our acquisition of Allegro Credit, a leading provider of point-of-sale consumer
financing for audiology products and dental services.

point-of-sale and business management platform.

•

In August 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell loan receivables associated with our program agreement with Gap Inc. In addition, in December
2021, we entered into an agreement to sell loan receivables associated with our program agreement with BP. We expect to complete the sale of both
portfolios, subject to customary closing conditions, in the second quarter of 2022 and expect to recognize a gain on sale of the Gap Inc. portfolio upon
disposition.

Business Trends and Conditions

We believe our business and results of operations will be impacted in the future by various trends and conditions, including the following:

• Growth in loan receivables and interest income. During 2021, accumulated savings by consumers resulting from economic stimulus, forbearance and
lower discretionary spending, has led to elevated payment rates that were approximately 260 basis points higher than our five-year historical average.
While we have experienced improvements in consumer purchase activity in 2021, the elevated payment rates contributed to a reduction in interest and
fees and slower receivable growth in 2021. We expect purchase volume to continue to increase in 2022 as compared to the prior year, and also expect to
see payment rates moderate over the course of 2022, which we expect will contribute to increases in both loan receivables and interest income for our
ongoing program agreements. The amount of the increases however will be dependent on various factors. These factors include the timing and extent of
slowing payment rates, as well as the nature of and duration for which any preventative or governmental measures are taken, including responses to
increases in COVID-19 infections nationally or additional variants that may occur. In addition to the above, we anticipate conveyance of our Gap Inc. and
BP portfolios to be completed in the second quarter of 2022, which will contribute to reductions in total interest and fees on loans when compared to 2021.

•

•

•

Asset quality. During 2021, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have driven significant improvement in customer payment behavior such that our asset
quality metrics have seen historic lows during 2021. Our over-30 day loan delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loan receivables decreased to
2.62% at December 31, 2021 from 3.07% at December 31, 2020. We anticipate that the elevated payment trend we have experienced in 2021 will begin to
moderate in 2022, such that we expect to incur increases to both delinquencies and net charge-offs as compared to current levels. We have also
experienced decreases to both our allowance for credit losses and provision for credit losses during the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily
attributable to the elevated payment rate trends, and our allowance coverage ratio at December 31, 2021 was 10.76%. As the economic environment
develops during 2022, we anticipate that our credit loss reserve builds and provision for credit losses will be higher than those experienced in 2021.

Retailer share arrangement payments under our program agreements. Retailer share arrangements increased 24.2% to $4.5 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2021, reflecting the decrease in provision for credit losses discussed above. We believe that the payments we make to our partners under
our retailer share arrangements, in the aggregate, in 2022 are likely to decrease in absolute terms compared to the year ended December 31, 2021,
primarily as a result of the expected credit trends discussed above, as well as the impact from the disposition of our held for sale portfolios. This decrease
will be partially offset by growth of the programs for which we have retailer share arrangements. The magnitude of the decrease in retailer share
arrangements will be dependent in part on the precise timing and extent of the anticipated trends in payment rates and asset quality discussed above. See
Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Retailer Share Arrangements for additional information on these agreements.

Extended duration of our credit card program agreements. Our credit card program agreements typically have contract terms ranging from
approximately five to ten years, and the length of our relationship with each of our five largest partners is over 14 years, and in the case of Lowe's, 42
years. We expect to continue to benefit from these and our other ongoing programs on a long-term basis.

The current expiration dates of our program agreements with our five largest partners range from 2026 through 2030. In addition, a total of 20 of our 25
largest ongoing program agreements have an expiration date in 2025 or beyond, which represented in the aggregate 96% of our interest and fees on loans
for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 93% of our loan receivables at December 31, 2021, attributable to our 25 largest ongoing programs.

35

• Growth in interchange revenues and loyalty program costs. We believe that as a result of the overall growth in Dual Card and general purpose co-

branded credit card transactions occurring outside of our credit card partners’ locations, interchange revenues will increase in excess of the growth of our
credit card loan receivables. The expected growth in these transactions is driven, in part, by both existing and new loyalty programs with our credit card
partners, partially offset by the impact from the disposition of our held for sale portfolios. In addition, we continue to offer and add new loyalty programs for
our private label credit cards, for which we typically do not receive interchange fees. The growth in these existing and new loyalty programs will result in an
increase in costs associated with these programs. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our loyalty program costs were largely offset by our interchange
revenues, although the increase in loyalty program costs exceeded the increase in interchange revenues. Overall, we expect these trends for our loyalty
program costs and interchange revenues to continue in 2022. These changes have been contemplated in our program agreements with our partners and
are a component of the calculation of our payments due under our retailer share arrangements.

•

Capital and liquidity levels. We continue to expect to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity resources to support our daily operations, our business
growth, and our credit ratings as well as regulatory and compliance requirements in a cost effective and prudent manner through expected and unexpected
market environments. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we declared and paid dividends of $500 million and repurchased $2.9 billion of our
outstanding common stock. We plan to continue to deploy capital through both dividends and share repurchases, subject to regulatory restrictions, as well
as to support business growth. At December 31, 2021 we had $1.2 billion remaining in share repurchase authorization. We continue to expect to maintain
capital ratios well in excess of minimum regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2021, the Company had a Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio of 15.6%,
which reflects our election to defer the impact of CECL on our regulatory capital, which will now be phased-in over a three-year transitional period through
December 31, 2024 and effects fully phased-in beginning in the first quarter of 2025. As a result of this phase-in our common equity Tier 1 ratio will be
reduced by 62 basis points in 2022.

We expect that our liquidity portfolio will continue to be sufficient to support all of our business objectives and to meet all regulatory requirements for the
foreseeable future. As a result of lower growth in loan receivables primarily due to elevated payment rates, and strength in our deposit platform, we have
generally been carrying a higher level of liquidity during 2021. We also expect to carry some excess liquidity in the second and third quarters of 2022
following the conveyance of our held for sale portfolios.

Seasonality

We experience fluctuations in transaction volumes and the level of loan receivables as a result of higher seasonal consumer spending and payment patterns that
typically result in an increase of loan receivables from August through a peak in late December, with reductions in loan receivables occurring over the first and
second quarters of the following year as customers pay their balances down.

The seasonal impact to transaction volumes and the loan receivables balance typically results in fluctuations in our results of operations, delinquency metrics and
the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables between quarterly periods. These fluctuations are generally most evident between the
fourth quarter and the first quarter of the following year.

36

In addition to the seasonal variance in loan receivables discussed above, we also typically experience a seasonal increase in delinquency rates and delinquent
loan receivables balances during the third and fourth quarters of each year due to lower customer payment rates resulting in higher net charge-off rates in the first
and second quarters. Our delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances typically decrease during the subsequent first and second quarters as
customers begin to pay down their loan balances and return to current status resulting in lower net charge-off rates in the third and fourth quarters. Because
customers who were delinquent during the fourth quarter of a calendar year have a higher probability of returning to current status when compared to customers
who are delinquent at the end of each of our interim reporting periods, we expect that a higher proportion of delinquent accounts outstanding at an interim period
end will result in charge-offs, as compared to delinquent accounts outstanding at a year end. Consistent with this historical experience, we generally experience a
higher allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables at the end of an interim period, as compared to the end of a calendar year. In addition,
despite improving credit metrics such as declining past due amounts, we may experience an increase in our allowance for credit losses at an interim period end
compared to the prior year end, reflecting these same seasonal trends.

While the effects of the seasonal trends discussed above remain evident, we also continue to experience improvements in customer payment behavior, which
include the effects of governmental stimulus actions, industry-wide forbearance measures and elevated consumer savings. Customer payments as a percentage of
beginning-of-period loan receivables for the year ended December 31, 2021 were approximately 260 basis points higher than our prior five-year historical average.
These higher payment rates have resulted in reductions in loan receivables and delinquency rates beyond our seasonal expectations.

Interest Income

Interest income is comprised of interest and fees on loans, which includes merchant discounts provided by partners to compensate us in almost all cases for all or
part of the promotional financing provided to their customers, and interest on cash and equivalents and investment securities. We include in interest and fees on
loans any past due interest and fees deemed to be collectible. Direct loan origination costs on credit card loans are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis
over a one-year period and recorded in interest and fees on loans. For non-credit card receivables, direct loan origination costs are deferred and amortized over
the life of the loan and recorded in interest and fees on loans.

We analyze interest income as a function of two principal components: average interest-earning assets and yield on average interest-earning assets. Key drivers of
average interest-earning assets include:

•

•

•

•

•

purchase volumes, which are influenced by a number of factors including macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence generally, our partners’
sales and our ability to increase our share of those sales;

payment rates, reflecting the extent to which customers maintain a credit balance;

charge-offs, reflecting the receivables that are deemed not to be collectible;

the size of our liquidity portfolio; and

portfolio acquisitions when we enter into new partner relationships.

37

Key drivers of yield on average interest-earning assets include:

•

•

•

•

•

pricing (contractual rates of interest, movement in prime rates, late fees and merchant discount rates);

changes to our mix of loans (e.g., the number of loans bearing promotional rates as compared to standard rates);

frequency of late fees incurred when account holders fail to make their minimum payment by the required due date;

credit performance and accrual status of our loans; and

yield earned on our liquidity portfolio.

Interest income decreased by $796 million, or 5.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease reflected the impact of improvements in customer
payment behavior and lower delinquencies during the period, which resulted in lower loan receivable yield and lower average loan receivables.

Average loan receivables, including held for sale, decreased 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021, as the impact from the improvements in customer
payment behavior was partially offset by purchase volume growth of 19.2%.

Yield on average interest-earning assets

The yield on average interest-earning assets decreased for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to a decrease in the yield on average loan
receivables. The decrease in loan receivables yield was 61 basis points to 19.29% for the year ended December 31, 2021, reflecting the impact of higher payment
rates and lower interest and fees.

Interest Expense

Interest expense is incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities, which consisted of interest-bearing deposit accounts, borrowings of consolidated securitization
entities and senior unsecured notes.

Key drivers of interest expense include:

•

•

•

the amounts outstanding of our deposits and borrowings;

the interest rate environment and its effect on interest rates paid on our funding sources; and

the changing mix in our funding sources.

Interest expense decreased by $633 million, or 38.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by lower benchmark interest rates. Our cost of
funds decreased to 1.37% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2.07% for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The decrease in average interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily driven by our efforts to mitigate excess liquidity in our
business which resulted in decreases in our deposits, borrowings of our consolidated securitization entities, and senior unsecured notes.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income represents the difference between interest income and interest expense.

Net interest income decreased by $163 million, or 1.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, resulting from the changes in interest income and interest
expense discussed above.

Retailer Share Arrangements

Most of our program agreements with large retail and certain other partners contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our partners if the
economic performance of the program exceeds a contractually defined threshold. We also provide other economic benefits to our partners such as royalties on
purchase volume or payments for new accounts, in some cases instead of retailer share arrangements (for example, on our co-branded credit cards). All of these
arrangements are designed to align our interests and provide an additional incentive to our partners to promote our credit products. Although the retailer share
arrangements vary by partner, these arrangements are generally structured to measure the economic performance of the program, based typically on agreed upon
program revenues (including interest income and certain other income) less agreed upon program expenses (including interest expense, provision for credit losses,
retailer payments and operating expenses), and share portions of this amount above a negotiated threshold. The threshold and economic performance of a
program that are used to calculate payments to our partners may be based on, among other things, agreed upon measures of program expenses rather than our
actual expenses, and therefore increases in our actual expenses (such as funding costs or operating expenses) may not necessarily result in reduced payments
under our retailer share arrangements. These arrangements are typically designed to permit us to achieve an economic return before we are required to make
payments to our partners based on the agreed contractually defined threshold. Our payments to partners pursuant to these retailer share arrangements have
generally increased in recent years, primarily as a result of the growth and performance of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements, as well as
changes to the terms of certain program agreements that have been renegotiated in the past few years.

We believe that our retailer share arrangements have been effective in helping us to grow our business by aligning our partners’ interests with ours. We also
believe that the changes to the terms of certain program agreements in recent years will help us to grow our business by providing an additional incentive to the
relevant partners to promote our credit products going forward. Payments to partners pursuant to these retailer share arrangements would generally decrease, and
mitigate the impact on our profitability, in the event of declines in the performance of the programs or the occurrence of other unfavorable developments that impact
the calculation of payments to our partners pursuant to our retailer share arrangements.

Retailer share arrangements increased by $883 million, or 24.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the decrease in provision for credit
losses.

39

Provision for Credit Losses

Provision for credit losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level to absorb the expected credit losses for the
life of the loan balance as of the period end date. Provision for credit losses in each period is a function of net charge-offs (gross charge-offs net of recoveries) and
the required level of the allowance for credit losses. Our process to determine our allowance for credit losses is based upon our estimate of expected credit losses
for the life of the loan balance as of the period end date. See “Critical Accounting Estimates - Allowance for Credit Losses” and Note 2. Basis of Presentation and
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our allowance for credit loss methodology.

Provision for credit losses decreased by $4.6 billion, or 86.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by lower reserves, which included $345
million of reserve reductions related to the held for sale portfolios, and lower net charge-offs.

We earn interchange fees on Dual Card and other co-branded credit card transactions outside of our partners’ sales channels, based on a flat fee plus a
percentage of the purchase amount. Interchange revenue has been, and is expected to continue to be, driven primarily by growth in our Dual Card and general
purpose co-branded credit card products.

Interchange revenue increased by $228 million, or 35.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, driven by an increase in purchase volume outside of our retail
partners' sales channels.

Debt cancellation fees

Debt cancellation fees relate to payment protection products purchased by our credit card customers. Customers who choose to purchase these products are
charged a monthly fee based on their account balance. In return, we will cancel all or a portion of a customer’s credit card balance in the event of certain qualifying
life events. We offer our debt cancellation product to our credit card customers via online, mobile and, on a limited basis, direct mail.

Debt cancellation fees increased by $6 million, or 2.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily as a result of increases in customer enrollment.

Loyalty programs

We operate a number of loyalty programs that are designed to generate incremental purchase volume per customer, while reinforcing the value of the card and
strengthening cardholder loyalty. These programs typically provide cardholders with statement credit or cash back rewards. Other programs include rewards points,
which are redeemable for a variety of products or awards, or merchandise discounts that are earned by achieving a pre-set spending level on their private label
credit card, Dual Card or general purpose co-branded credit card. Growth in loyalty program payments has been, and is expected to continue to be, driven by
growth in purchase volume related to existing loyalty programs and the rollout of new loyalty programs.

Loyalty programs cost increased by $343 million, or 52.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily as a result of growth in purchase volume associated
with existing loyalty programs.

Other

Other includes a variety of items including ancillary fees, commission fees related to Pets Best, changes in the fair value of equity investments, realized gains or

Best.

Employee costs primarily consist of employee compensation and benefit costs.

Employee costs increased by $121 million, or 8.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by higher stock-based compensation expense and
higher incentive compensation, partially offset by the prior year restructuring charge of $41 million.

Professional fees

Professional fees consist primarily of outsourced provider fees (e.g., collection agencies and call centers), legal, accounting, consulting, and recruiting expenses.

Professional fees increased by $23 million, or 3.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in third-party expenses related to strategic
technology investments.

Marketing and business development

Marketing and business development costs consist primarily of our contractual and discretionary marketing and business development spend, as well as
amortization expense associated with retail partner contract acquisitions and extensions.

Marketing and business development costs increased by $38 million, or 8.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to strategic investments in our
sales platforms.

Information processing

Information processing costs primarily consist of fees related to outsourced information processing providers, credit card associations and software licensing
agreements.

Information processing costs increased by $58 million, or 11.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to higher software licensing costs and other
technology investments, as well as an increase in association fees resulting from higher purchase volume in 2021.

41

Other

Other primarily consists of postage, operational losses, litigation and regulatory matters expense and various other corporate overhead items such as facilities'
costs and telephone charges. Postage is driven primarily by the number of our active accounts and the percentage of customers that utilize our electronic billing
option. Fraud, or operational losses, are driven primarily by the number of our active Dual Card and general purpose co-branded credit card accounts.

The “other” component decreased by $332 million, or 34.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to lower operational losses and a reduction in
corporate overhead expenses.

taxes.

Platform Analysis

As discussed above under “Our Business—Our Sales Platforms,” beginning in June 2021, we now offer our credit products through five sales platforms (Home &
Auto, Digital, Diversified & Value, Health & Wellness and Lifestyle), which management measures based on their revenue-generating activities. The following is a
discussion of certain supplemental information for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, for each of our five sales platforms and Corp, Other information.

In December 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell $0.5 billion of loan receivables associated with our program agreement with BP. In connection with this
agreement, revenue activities for the BP portfolio are no longer managed within our Home & Auto sales platform. All metrics for the BP portfolio previously reported
within our Home & Auto sales platform, are now reported within our Corp, Other information in the tables below. We have recast all prior-period metrics for our
Home & Auto sales platform and Corp, Other to conform to the current-period presentation.

Loan receivables decreased 1.4% to $80.7 billion at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020, primarily driven by the reclassification of loan
receivables associated with the Gap Inc. and BP portfolios, to loan receivables held for sale. Loan receivables held for sale totaled $4.4 billion at December 31,
2021, and we expect conveyance of both portfolios to occur, subject to customary closing conditions, in the second quarter of 2022.

Excluding the impact of the reclassification of the Gap Inc. and BP portfolios, loan receivables increased 4% reflecting strong purchase volume growth, largely
offset by higher payment rates. Customer payments as a percentage of beginning-of-period loan receivables for the year ended December 31, 2021 were
approximately 260 basis points higher than our prior five-year historical average for the year.

Over-30 day loan delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loan receivables decreased to 2.62% at December 31, 2021, as compared to 3.07% at
December 31, 2020. The 45 basis point decrease in 2021 was primarily driven by an improvement in customer payment behavior, partially offset by the effects of
the reclassification of loan receivables associated with the Gap Inc. and BP portfolios to loan receivables held for sale. When excluding amounts related to held for
sale portfolios from both periods, the decrease compared to the prior year was approximately 60 basis points.

Net Charge-Offs

Net charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine are uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We exclude
accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and third-party fraud losses from charge-offs. Charged-off and recovered finance charges and fees are included in
interest and fees on loans while third-party fraud losses are included in other expense. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for credit losses
and subsequent recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to the allowance for credit losses. Costs incurred to recover charged-off loans are
recorded as collection expense and included in other expense in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

The table below sets forth net charge-offs and the ratio of net charge-offs to average loan receivables, including held for sale, (“net charge-off rate”) for the periods
indicated.

The allowance for credit losses totaled $8.7 billion at December 31, 2021, compared to $10.3 billion at December 31, 2020, and reflects our estimate of expected
credit losses for the life of the loan receivables on our consolidated statement of financial position. Similarly, our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total
loan receivables decreased to 10.76% at December 31, 2021, from 12.54% at December 31, 2020.

The decreases in the allowance for credit losses and allowance coverage ratio are primarily driven by improvements in customer payment behavior, which resulted
in a reduction to our estimate of expected credit losses.

Funding, Liquidity and Capital Resources
____________________________________________________________________________________________

We maintain a strong focus on liquidity and capital. Our funding, liquidity and capital policies are designed to ensure that our business has the liquidity and capital
resources to support our daily operations, our business growth, our credit ratings and our regulatory and policy requirements, in a cost effective and prudent
manner through expected and unexpected market environments.

Funding Sources

Our primary funding sources include cash from operations, deposits (direct and brokered deposits), securitized financings and senior unsecured notes.

(1) Excludes $349 million, $306 million and $280 million average balance of non-interest-bearing deposits for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Non-interest-bearing deposits comprise less than 10% of total deposits for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.

Deposits

We obtain deposits directly from retail and commercial customers (“direct deposits”) or through third-party brokerage firms that offer our deposits to their customers
(“brokered deposits”). At December 31, 2021, we had $50.1 billion in direct deposits and $12.2 billion in deposits originated through brokerage firms (including
network deposit sweeps procured through a program arranger that channels brokerage account deposits to us). A key part of our liquidity plan and funding strategy
is to continue to utilize our direct deposits base as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding.

Our direct deposits include a range of FDIC-insured deposit products, including certificates of deposit, IRAs, money market accounts and savings accounts.

Brokered deposits are primarily from retail customers of large brokerage firms. We have relationships with 11 brokers that offer our deposits through their networks.
Our brokered deposits consist primarily of certificates of deposit that bear interest at a fixed rate and at December 31, 2021, had a weighted average remaining life
of 2.0 years. These deposits generally are not subject to early withdrawal.

Our ability to attract deposits is sensitive to, among other things, the interest rates we pay, and therefore, we bear funding risk if we fail to pay higher rates, or
interest rate risk if we are required to pay higher rates, to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits. To mitigate these risks, our funding strategy includes a
range of deposit products, and we seek to maintain access to multiple other funding sources, including securitized financings (including our undrawn committed
capacity) and unsecured debt.

Securitized Financings

We access the asset-backed securitization market using the Synchrony Credit Card Master Note Trust (“SYNCT”) and the Synchrony Card Issuance Trust
(“SYNIT”) through which we may issue asset-backed securities through both public transactions and private transactions funded by financial institutions and
commercial paper conduits. In addition, we issue asset-backed securities in private transactions through the Synchrony Sales Finance Master Trust (“SFT”).

At December 31, 2021, we had $4.1 billion of outstanding private asset-backed securities and $3.2 billion of outstanding public asset-backed securities, in each
case held by unrelated third parties.

(1) Excludes any subordinated classes of SYNCT notes and SYNIT notes that we owned at December 31, 2021.

We retain exposure to the performance of trust assets through: (i) in the case of SYNCT, SFT and SYNIT, subordinated retained interests in the loan receivables
transferred to the trust in excess of the principal amount of the notes for a given series that provide credit enhancement for a particular series, as well as a pari
passu seller’s interest in each trust and (ii) in the case of SYNCT and SYNIT, any subordinated classes of notes that we own.

All of our securitized financings include early repayment triggers, referred to as early amortization events, including events related to material breaches of
representations, warranties or covenants, inability or failure of the Bank to transfer loan receivables to the trusts as required under the securitization documents,
failure to make required payments or deposits pursuant to the securitization documents, and certain insolvency-related events with respect to the related
securitization depositor, Synchrony (solely with respect to SYNCT) or the Bank. In addition, an early amortization event will occur with respect to a series if the
excess spread as it relates to a particular series or for the trust, as applicable, falls below zero. Following an early amortization event, principal collections on the
loan receivables in the applicable trust are applied to repay principal of the trust's asset-backed securities rather than being available on a revolving basis to fund
the origination activities of our business. The occurrence of an early amortization event also would limit or terminate our ability to issue future series out of the trust
in which the early amortization event occurred. No early amortization event has occurred with respect to any of the securitized financings in SYNCT, SFT or SYNIT.

Short-Term Borrowings

Except as described above, there were no material short-term borrowings for the periods presented.

Other

At December 31, 2021, we had more than $25.0 billion of unencumbered assets in the Bank available to be used to generate additional liquidity through secured
borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged to the Federal Reserve Board for credit at the discount window.

Covenants

The indenture pursuant to which our senior unsecured notes have been issued includes various covenants, including covenants that restrict (subject to certain
exceptions) Synchrony’s ability to dispose of, or incur liens on, any of the voting stock of the Bank or otherwise permit the Bank to be merged, consolidated, leased
or sold in a manner that results in the Bank being less than 80% controlled by us.

If we do not satisfy any of these covenants discussed above, the maturity of amounts outstanding thereunder may be accelerated and become payable. We were in
compliance with all of these covenants at December 31, 2021.

At December 31, 2021, we were not in default under any of our credit facilities.

Credit Ratings

Our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets, including securitizations and senior and subordinated debt, may be affected by the credit ratings of
the Company, the Bank and the ratings of our asset-backed securities.

In addition, certain of the asset-backed securities issued by SYNCT and SYNIT are rated by Fitch, S&P and/or Moody’s. A credit rating is not a recommendation to
buy, sell or hold securities, may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated
independently of any other rating. Downgrades in these credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital
markets.

Liquidity
____________________________________________________________________________________________

We seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations, fund asset growth, satisfy debt obligations and to meet regulatory expectations
under normal and stress conditions.

We maintain policies outlining the overall framework and general principles for managing liquidity risk across our business, which is the responsibility of our Asset
and Liability Management Committee, a subcommittee of the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors. We employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage
liquidity. We perform regular liquidity stress testing and contingency planning as part of our liquidity management process. We evaluate a range of stress scenarios
including Company specific and systemic events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs.

We maintain a liquidity portfolio, which at December 31, 2021 had $13.0 billion of liquid assets, primarily consisting of cash and equivalents and short-term
obligations of the U.S. Treasury, less cash in transit which is not considered to be liquid, compared to $18.3 billion of liquid assets at December 31, 2020. The
decrease in liquid assets was primarily due to the increase in loan receivables, including loan receivables held for sale, share repurchase activity, and the reduction
in funding liabilities. We believe our liquidity position at December 31, 2021 remains strong as we continue to operate in a period of uncertain economic conditions
related to COVID-19 and we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity as economic conditions change.

As additional sources of liquidity, at December 31, 2021, we had an aggregate of $2.2 billion of undrawn committed capacity on our securitized financings, subject
to customary borrowing conditions, from private lenders under our securitization programs and $0.5 billion of undrawn committed capacity under our unsecured
revolving credit facility with private lenders, and we had more than $25.0 billion of unencumbered assets in the Bank available to be used to generate additional
liquidity through secured borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged to the Federal Reserve Board for credit at the discount window.

As a general matter, investments included in our liquidity portfolio are expected to be highly liquid, giving us the ability to readily convert them to cash. The level
and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based upon the level of expected maturities of our funding sources as well as operational requirements and
market conditions.

51

We rely significantly on dividends and other distributions and payments from the Bank for liquidity; however, bank regulations, contractual restrictions and other
factors limit the amount of dividends and other distributions and payments that the Bank may pay to us. For a discussion of regulatory restrictions on the Bank’s
ability to pay dividends, see “Regulation—Risk Factors Relating to Regulation—We are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase
our common stock; the Bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us, which could limit our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our
common stock or make payments on our indebtedness.” and “Regulation—Savings Association Regulation—Dividends and Stock Repurchases.”

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
____________________________________________________________________________________________

Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a
position or portfolio. We are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates. See “Risks—Risk Factors Relating to Our Business—Changes in
market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings, funding and liquidity” and “—A reduction in our credit ratings could materially
increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets.”

Interest Rate Risk

We borrow money from a variety of depositors and institutions in order to provide loans to our customers. Changes in market interest rates cause our net interest
income to increase or decrease, as some of our assets and liabilities carry interest rates that fluctuate with market benchmarks. The interest rate benchmark for our
floating rate assets is generally the prime rate, and the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate liabilities is generally either London Interbank Offered Rate
(“LIBOR”) or the federal funds rate. The prime rate and the LIBOR or federal funds rate could reset at different times or could diverge, leading to mismatches in the
interest rates on our floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities.

In 2022, we expect LIBOR to be less widely relied upon as an interest rate benchmark in pricing assets or liabilities. Synchrony is not entering into any new
agreements that reference LIBOR. Additionally, Synchrony is in the process of amending existing asset and liability contracts that reference LIBOR to reference a
new benchmark rate. The new benchmark rates include, but are not limited to, Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), federal funds and U.S. Treasury bills.
We do not expect the transition from the LIBOR benchmark to have a material impact to our company.

Competitive factors and future regulatory reform may limit or restrict our ability to raise interest rates on our loans. In addition, some of our program agreements
limit the rate of interest we can charge to customers. If interest rates were to rise materially over a sustained period of time, and we are unable to sufficiently raise
our interest rates in a timely manner, our net interest income and margin could be adversely impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our net
earnings.

Interest rates may also adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. Our floating rate
products bear interest rates that fluctuate with the prime rate. Higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders
under mortgage, credit card and other consumer loans, which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to
increased delinquencies, charge-offs and allowances for credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings.

Changes in interest rates and competitor responses to these changes may also impact customer decisions to maintain deposits with us, and reductions in deposits
could materially adversely affect our funding costs and liquidity.

At December 31, 2021, 54.6% of our loan receivables were priced at a fixed interest rate to the customer, with the remaining 45.4% at a floating interest rate. We
fund our assets with a combination of fixed rate and floating rate funding sources that include deposits, asset-backed securities and unsecured debt. To manage
interest rate risk, we seek to match the interest rate repricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities. Historically, we have not used interest rate derivative
contracts to manage interest rate risk; however, we may choose to do so in the future. To the extent we are unable to effectively match the interest rate sensitivity of
our assets and liabilities, our net earnings could be materially adversely affected.

52

We assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect of various interest rate scenarios on our net interest income.

For purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical, adverse change in interest rates over the 12-month period from our reporting date, we
assume that all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be impacted by a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates as of
the beginning of the period. The sensitivity is based upon the hypothetical assumption that all relevant types of interest rates that affect our results would increase
or decrease instantaneously, simultaneously and to the same degree.

Our interest rate sensitive assets include our variable rate loan receivables and the assets that make up our liquidity portfolio. Assets with rates that are fixed at
period end but which will mature, or otherwise contractually reset to a market-based indexed rate or other fixed rate prior to the end of the 12-month period, are
considered to be rate sensitive. The latter category includes certain loans that may be offered at below-market rates for an introductory period, such as balance
transfers and special promotional programs, after which the loans will contractually reprice under standard terms in accordance with our normal market-based
pricing structure. For purposes of measuring rate sensitivity for such loans, only the effect of the hypothetical 100 basis point change in the underlying market-
based indexed rate or other fixed rate has been considered rather than the full change in the rate to which the loan would contractually reprice (i.e. assets are
categorized as fixed or floating according to their underlying contractual terms). For assets that have a fixed interest rate at the period end but which contractually
will, or are assumed to, reset to a market-based indexed rate or other fixed rate during the next 12 months, net interest income sensitivity is measured from the
expected repricing date.

Interest rate sensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next 12-month period. Thus, liabilities that
vary with changes in a market-based index, such as the federal funds rate or LIBOR, which will reset before the end of the 12-month period, or liabilities whose
rates are fixed at the period end but which will mature and are assumed to be replaced with a market-based indexed rate prior to the end of the 12-month period,
also are considered to be rate sensitive. For these fixed rate liabilities, net interest income sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date.

The following table presents the approximate net interest income impacts forecasted over the next twelve months from an immediate and parallel change in interest
rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at December 31, 2021.

Limitations of Market Risk Measures

The interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information, internally-developed assumptions and proprietary
modeling methodologies, which project borrower and deposit behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments. Other market inputs, such as interest rates,
market prices and interest rate volatility, are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures. We regularly evaluate, update and enhance these
assumptions, models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns
of our existing assets and liabilities.

There are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. The sensitivity analysis provided above
contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is based on the existing balance sheet as well as assumptions around future growth, pricing and
balance sheet composition. It does not attempt to estimate the effect of a more significant interest rate increase over a sustained period of time, which as described
in “—Interest Rate Risk” above, could adversely affect our net interest income. In addition, the strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance
sheet may differ from our projections, which could cause our actual net interest income to differ from the above sensitivity analysis.

53

Capital
____________________________________________________________________________________________

Our primary sources of capital have been earnings generated by our business and existing equity capital. We seek to manage capital to a level and composition
sufficient to support the risks of our business, meet regulatory requirements, adhere to rating agency targets and support future business growth. The level,
composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment, strategic initiatives and legislative and regulatory developments.
Within these constraints, we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that will provide attractive returns to our stockholders.

Synchrony is not currently required to conduct stress tests. See “Regulation—Regulation Relating to Our Business—Recent Legislative and Regulatory
Developments.” In addition, while we have not been subject to the Federal Reserve Board's formal capital plan submission requirements to-date, we submitted a
capital plan to the Federal Reserve Board in 2021. While not required, our capital plan process does include certain internal stress testing.

In 2021 the Company resumed share repurchase activities under various share repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors.

54

In January 2021, we announced our Board authorized a share repurchase program of up to $1.6 billion through December 31, 2021 (the “January 2021 Share
Repurchase Program”). In May 2021 we announced that the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $2.9 billion for the period
which commenced April 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022 (the “May 2021 Share Repurchase Program”), which superseded the January 2021 Share Repurchase
Program. Finally, in December 2021, the Board of Directors authorized an increase to the May 2021 Share Repurchase Program of $1.0 billion, through the period
ending June 30, 2022. In all instances, the share repurchase programs are subject to market conditions and other factors, including legal and regulatory restrictions
and required approvals.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased $2.9 billion of common stock as part of the share repurchase programs discussed above and have
$1.2 billion of remaining authorized share repurchase capacity at December 31, 2021.

Regulatory Capital Requirements - Synchrony Financial

As a savings and loan holding company, we are required to maintain minimum capital ratios, under the applicable U.S. Basel III capital rules. For more information,
see “Regulation—Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation.”

For Synchrony Financial to be a well-capitalized savings and loan holding company, Synchrony Bank must be well-capitalized and Synchrony Financial must not be
subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Federal Reserve Board to meet and maintain a specific
capital level for any capital measure. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Synchrony Financial met all the requirements to be deemed well-capitalized.

The following table sets forth the composition of our capital ratios for the Company calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach rules at December 31,
2021 and 2020, respectively.

(1) Tier 1 leverage ratio represents Total tier 1 capital as a percentage of total average assets, after certain adjustments. All other ratios presented above represent the applicable

capital measure as a percentage of risk-weighted assets.

In March 2020 the joint federal bank regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that allows banking organizations to mitigate the effects of the CECL
accounting standard in their regulatory capital. Banking organizations that adopted CECL in 2020 could elect to mitigate the estimated cumulative regulatory capital
effects of CECL for two years. The Company elected to adopt the option provided by the interim final rule, which largely delayed the effects of CECL on our
regulatory capital through the end of 2021, after which the effects will now be phased-in over a three-year transitional period through 2024, collectively the “CECL
regulatory capital transition adjustment”. The effects of CECL on our regulatory capital will be fully phased-in beginning in the first quarter of 2025.

Capital amounts and ratios at December 31, 2021 in the above table all reflect the application of the CECL regulatory capital transition adjustment. The decrease in
our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio compared to December 31, 2020 was primarily due to an increase in risk-weighted assets in the year ended December 31,
2021 associated with an increase in loan receivables, including loan receivables held for sale, as well as share repurchase activity, partially offset by the retention
of net earnings in the current year.

Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if
undertaken, could limit our business activities and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “Regulation—
Risk Factors Relating to Regulation—Failure by Synchrony and the Bank to meet applicable capital adequacy and liquidity requirements could have a material
adverse effect on us.”

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Unfunded Lending Commitments
____________________________________________________________________________________________

We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantees of third-party obligations. Guarantees are contracts or indemnification
agreements that contingently require us to make a guaranteed payment or perform an obligation to a third-party based on certain trigger events. At December 31,
2021, we had not recorded any contingent liabilities in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position related to any guarantees. See Note 5 - Variable Interest
Entities to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on our investment commitments for unconsolidated VIE's.

We extend credit, primarily arising from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on our credit cards, in the ordinary course of business. Each unused
credit card line is unconditionally cancellable by us. See Note 4. Loan Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses to our consolidated financial statements for
more information on our unfunded lending commitments.

Critical Accounting Estimates
____________________________________________________________________________________________

In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we have identified certain accounting estimates and assumptions that we consider to be the most critical to an
understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. The critical accounting estimates we have identified relate
to allowance for credit losses and fair value measurements. These estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates future, economic and
market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. If these conditions change from those expected, it is
reasonably possible that these judgments and estimates could change, which may result in incremental losses on loan receivables, or material changes to our
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, among other effects. See Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our
consolidated financial statements, which discusses the significant accounting policies related to these estimates.

Allowance for Credit Losses

Losses on loan receivables are estimated and recognized upon origination of the loan, based on expected credit losses for the life of the loan balance as of the
period end date. This requires us to estimate expected losses in the portfolio as of each balance sheet date. The method for calculating the estimate of expected
credit loss takes into account historical experience, and current conditions and future expectations for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics, and
reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future. The model utilizes a macroeconomic forecast, with unemployment claims as the primary macroeconomic
variable. We also perform a qualitative assessment in addition to model estimates and apply qualitative adjustments as necessary. The reasonable and supportable
forecast period is determined primarily based upon an assessment of the current economic outlook, including the effects of COVID-19, and our ability to use
available data to accurately forecast losses over time. The reasonable and supportable forecast period used in our estimate of credit losses at December 31, 2021
was 12 months, consistent with the forecast period utilized since adoption of CECL. The Company reassesses the reasonable and supportable forecast period on a
quarterly basis. Beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period, we revert to historical loss information at the loan receivables segment level over a 6-
month period, gradually increasing the weight of historical losses by an equal amount each month during the reversion period, and utilize historical loss information
thereafter for the remaining life of the portfolio. The reversion period, similar to the reasonable and supportable forecast period, may change in the future depending
on multiple factors such as forecasting methods, portfolio changes, and macroeconomic environment.

We evaluate each portfolio quarterly. For credit card receivables, our estimation process includes analysis of historical data, and there is a significant amount of
judgment applied in selecting inputs and analyzing the results produced by the models to determine the allowance. Our risk process includes standards and
policies for reviewing major risk exposures and concentrations, and evaluates relevant data either for individual loans or on a portfolio basis, as appropriate. More
specifically, we use an enhanced migration analysis to estimate the likelihood that a loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency. The enhanced
migration analysis considers uncollectible principal, interest and fees reflected in the loan receivables, segmented by credit and business parameters. We use other
analyses to estimate expected losses on non-delinquent accounts, which include past performance, bankruptcy activity such as filings, policy changes, loan
volumes and amounts. Holistically, for assessing the portfolio credit loss content, we also evaluate portfolio risk management techniques applied to various
accounts, historical behavior of different account vintages, account seasoning, economic conditions, recent trends in delinquencies, account collection
management, forecasting uncertainties, expectations about the future, and a qualitative assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses.

We estimate our allowance for credit losses using pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. Further, experience is not available for new portfolios; therefore,
while we accumulate experience, we utilize our experience with the most closely analogous products and segments in our portfolio. The underlying assumptions,
estimates and assessments we use to provide for losses are updated periodically to reflect our view of current and forecasted conditions and are subject to the
regulatory examination process, which can result in changes to our assumptions. Changes in such estimates can significantly affect the allowance and provision for
credit losses. It is possible that we will experience credit losses that are different from our current estimates.

57

Fair Value Measurements

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value every reporting period primarily include investments in debt and equity securities. Assets that are not measured at fair
value every reporting period, but that are subject to fair value measurements in certain circumstances, primarily include acquired loans, loans that have been
reduced to fair value when they are held for sale, equity method investments that are written down to fair value when they are impaired, as well as certain equity
securities without readily determinable fair value that are measured based upon observable price changes.

A fair value measurement is determined as the price that we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. In the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions
based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical
transaction that occurs at the measurement date. The determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an
appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums, identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions, weighting those
differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to our asset being valued. Assets that
are written down to fair value when impaired are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs.

RISKS

Risk Factors Summary
____________________________________________________________________________________________

We are providing the following summary of the risk factors contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to enhance the readability and accessibility of our risk
factor disclosures. We encourage you to carefully review the full risk factors contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in their entirety for additional information
regarding the material factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the
following:

Macroeconomic and Operational Risks

• COVID-19 and other macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and

heighten many of our known risks.

•

As we and other companies continue to work from home, our operations are subject to new risks and the competition for key talent has increased.

• Our results of operations and growth depend on our ability to retain existing partners and attract new partners.

•

A significant percentage of our interest and fees on loans comes from relationships with a small number of partners, and the loss of any of these partners
could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

• Our business is heavily concentrated in U.S. consumer credit, and therefore our results are more susceptible to fluctuations in that market than a more

diversified company.

• Our results are impacted, to a significant extent, on the active and effective promotion and support of our products by our partners and on the financial

performance of our partners.

• Competition in the consumer finance industry is intense.

• We may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize new or enhanced products and services.

•

•

Fraudulent activity associated with our products and services could negatively impact our operating results, brand and reputation and cause the use of our
products and services to decrease and our fraud losses to increase.

The failure of third parties to provide various services that are important to our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results
of operations.

Technological Risks

• Cyber-attacks or other security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business.

• Disruptions in the operation of our and our outsourced partners' computer systems and data centers could have a material adverse effect on our business.

59

Financial Risks

• Our allowance for credit losses may prove to be insufficient to cover losses on our loans.

•

•

If assumptions or estimates we use in preparing our financial statements, including those related to the CECL accounting guidance, are incorrect or are
required to change, our reported results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.

Adverse financial market conditions or our inability to effectively manage our funding and liquidity risk could have a material adverse effect on our funding,
liquidity and ability to meet our obligations.

• Our inability to grow our deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our liquidity and ability to grow our business.

•

•

A reduction in our credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets.

Various risks related to the securitization of our loan receivables that could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, cost of funds and
financial condition.

• We rely extensively on models in managing many aspects of our business, and if they are not accurate or are misinterpreted, it could have a material

adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

• Our business depends on our ability to successfully manage our credit risk, and failing to do so may result in high charge-off rates.

• We may not be able to offset increases in our costs with decreased payments under our retailer share arrangements, which could reduce our profitability.

• Reductions in interchange fees may reduce the competitive advantages our private label credit card products currently have by virtue of not charging

interchange fees and would reduce our income from those fees.

Legal Risks

• We have international operations that subject us to various international risks as well as increased compliance and regulatory risks and costs.

•

Litigation, regulatory actions and compliance issues could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments, remediation costs and/or requirements
resulting in increased expenses.

Regulatory Risks

• We face various risks related to the government regulation, supervision, examination and enforcement our business faces.

•

•

•

•

Legislative and regulatory developments may have a significant impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Federal or state tax rules and regulations could change and adversely affect our results of operations.

Failure by us to meet applicable capital adequacy and liquidity requirements could limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock or
otherwise have a material adverse effect on us.

Regulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information
and adversely affect our business opportunities.

Risk Factors Relating to Our Business
____________________________________________________________________________________________

The following discussion of risk factors contains “forward-looking statements,” as discussed in “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” These
risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be read in
conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (MD&A), the consolidated financial statements and
related notes in “Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and “Regulation—Risk Factors Relating to Regulation” of this Form 10-K Report.

Our business routinely encounters and address risks, some of which will cause our future results to be different - sometimes materially different - than we
anticipate. Discussion about important operational risks that our business encounters can be found in the business descriptions in “Our Business” and the MD&A
section of this Form 10-K Report. The key categories of risks our business faces are macro-economic, operational, technological (including cyber-security),
financial, legal and regulatory. Our reactions to material future developments as well as our competitors’ reactions to those developments will affect our future
results.

Macroeconomic and Operational Risks

Macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Key macroeconomic conditions historically have affected our business, results of operations and financial condition and are likely to affect them in the future.
Consumer confidence, unemployment and other economic indicators are among the factors that often impact consumer spending behavior and demand for credit.
Poor economic conditions reduce the usage of our credit cards and other financing products and the average purchase amount of transactions on our credit cards
and through our other products, which, in each case, reduces our interest and fee income. We rely primarily on interest and fees on our loan receivables to
generate our net earnings. Our interest and fees on our loan receivables was $15.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. Poor economic conditions also
adversely affect the ability and willingness of customers to pay amounts owed to us, increasing delinquencies, bankruptcies, charge-offs and allowances for credit
losses, and decreasing recoveries. For example, our over-30 day delinquency rate as a percentage of period-end loan receivables was 8.25% at December 31,
2009 during the financial crisis, compared to 2.62% at December 31, 2021, and our full-year net charge-off rate was 11.26% for the year ended December 31,
2009, compared to 2.92% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The assessment of our credit profile includes the evaluation of portfolio mix, account maturation,
as well as broader consumer trends, such as payment behavior and overall indebtedness.

Economic growth in the United States can slow due to higher unemployment rates, lower housing values, concerns about the level of U.S. government debt,
inflation, interest rates and fiscal actions that may be taken to address these concerns, as well as economic and political conditions in the U.S. and global markets.
A prolonged period of slow economic growth or a significant deterioration in economic conditions or broader consumer trends, including wage growth, savings rates
and consumer indebtedness, would likely affect consumer spending levels and the ability and willingness of customers to pay amounts owed to us, and could have
a material adverse effect on our business, key credit trends, results of operations and financial condition.

Macroeconomic conditions may also cause net earnings to fluctuate and diverge from expectations of securities analysts and investors, who may have differing
assumptions regarding the impact of these conditions on our business, and this may adversely impact our stock price.

In addition, as governments, investors and other stakeholders face pressures to accelerate actions to address climate change and other environmental,
governance and social topics, governments may implement regulations or investors and other stakeholders may adopt new investment policies or otherwise
impose new expectations that cause significant shifts in disclosure, commerce and consumption behaviors that may have negative impacts on our business and/or
reputation.

61

The extent to which COVID-19 and measures taken in response thereto impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend
on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict. COVID-19 has and is likely to have a material adverse impact on our
results of operations and financial condition and heighten many of our known risks.

The outbreak of the global pandemic of COVID-19 and economic effects of preventative measures taken across the United States and worldwide have weighed on
the macroeconomic environment, negatively impacting consumer confidence, unemployment and other economic indicators that contribute to consumer spending
and payment behavior and demand for credit. Such economic conditions reduce the usage of our credit cards and other financing products and the average
purchase amount of transactions on our credit cards and through our other products, which, in each case, reduces our interest and fee income. For more
information on the risks related to the extent to which key macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
and financial condition, see “—Macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.”

The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain
and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, including the emergence of new variants, its severity, the actions to
contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.

While the magnitude of the impact from COVID-19 is uncertain, we have seen and could continue to see a decline in our interest income, net interest margin, and
loan receivables growth primarily due to increases in payment rates. To the extent that payment rates moderate due to lower consumer savings and/or the
cessation of governmental stimulus and industry-wide forbearance measures, we could see a decline and/or volatility in purchase volume, as well as increases in
our delinquencies, net charge-off rate and allowance for credit losses. The extent of the impacts from these conditions is currently uncertain and dependent on
various factors and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For more information, see “Management's
Discussion and Analysis-Results of Operations-Business Trends and Conditions.”

In addition, the spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including restricting employee travel and transitioning nearly all of our
employees to working from home), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of
our employees, partners and customers. The outbreak has adversely impacted and may further adversely impact our workforce and operations and the operations
of our partners, customers, suppliers and third-party vendors, throughout the time period during which the spread of COVID-19 continues and related restrictions
remain in place, and even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided. In particular, we may experience financial losses due to a number of operational factors,
including:

•
•
•

•

•

continued store closures by partners or if one or more partners becomes subject to a bankruptcy proceeding;
third-party disruptions, including potential outages at third-party operated call centers and other suppliers;
increased cyber and payment fraud risk related to COVID-19, as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruption, given increased online banking, e-
commerce and other online activity;
challenges to the availability and reliability of our network due to changes to normal operations, including the possibility of one or more clusters of COVID-
19 cases affecting our employees or affecting the systems or employees of our partners or the ability of our partners to maintain sufficient staffing levels;
and
an increased volume of unanticipated customer and regulatory requests for information and support, or additional regulatory requirements, which could
require additional resources and costs to address, including, for example, government initiatives to reduce or eliminate payments costs.

Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, our business may continue to experience materially adverse impacts as a result of the virus’s economic impact,
social and behavioral impact, including the availability and cost of funding and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. There are no comparable
recent events that provide guidance as to the effect COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the outbreak is highly
uncertain and subject to change.

We do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business, our operations or the economy as a whole. However, the effects have, and are likely to continue
to have, a material impact on our results of operations and heighten many of our known risks described herein.

62

As we and other companies continue to work from home, our operations are subject to new risks and the competition for key talent has increased.

In connection with COVID-19, we expanded our work from home environment and transitioned nearly all of our workforce to work remotely from home. Once the
pandemic is under control, we expect many of our employees to continue to work remotely. Employees who work from home rely on residential communication
networks and internet providers that may not be as resilient as commercial networks and providers and may be more susceptible to service interruptions and
cyberattacks than commercial systems. Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans, which have been historically developed and tested with a focus on
centralized delivery locations, may not work as effectively in a distributed work from home model, where weather impacts, network and power grid downtime may
be difficult to manage. In addition, we may not be effective in timely updating our existing operating and administrative controls nor implementing new controls
tailored to the work from home environment.

Remote work by a majority of our employee population may impact our culture, and employee engagement with our company, which could affect productivity and
our ability to retain employees who are critical to our operations and may increase our costs and impact our financial results of operations. In addition, an increase
in work from home by other companies may create more job opportunities for employees and make it more difficult for us to attract and retain key talent.

If we are unable to manage the work from home environment effectively to address these and other risks, our reputation and results of operations may be
impacted.

Our results of operations and growth depend on our ability to retain existing partners and attract new partners.

Substantially all of our revenue is generated from the credit products we provide to customers of our partners pursuant to program agreements we enter into with
our partners. As a result, our results of operations and growth depend on our ability to retain existing partners and attract new partners. Historically, there has been
turnover in our partners, and we expect this will continue in the future. For example, in 2021, we announced that we would not be renewing our program agreement
with Gap Inc.

Program agreements with our large partners and national and regional retailer and manufacturer partners typically are for multi-year terms. These program
agreements generally permit our partner to terminate the agreement prior to its scheduled termination date for various reasons, including, in some cases, if we fail
to meet certain service levels or change certain key cardholder terms or our credit criteria, we fail to achieve certain targets with respect to approvals of new
customers as a result of the credit criteria we use, we elect not to increase the program size when the outstanding loan receivables under the program reach
certain thresholds or we are not adequately capitalized, or certain force majeure events or changes in our ownership occur or a material adverse change in our
financial condition occurs. A few programs with national and regional retailer and manufacturer partners also may be terminated at will by the partner on specified
notice to us (e.g., several months). In addition, programs with manufacturers, buying groups and industry associations generally are made available to certain
partners such as individual retail outlets, dealers and merchants under dealer agreements, which typically may be terminated at will by the partner on short notice
to us (e.g., 15 days).

There is significant competition for our existing partners, and our failure to retain our existing larger partner relationships upon the expiration or our earlier loss of a
relationship upon the exercise of a partner’s early termination rights, or the expiration or termination of a substantial number of smaller partner relationships, could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations (including growth rates) and financial condition to the extent we do not acquire new partners of similar
size and profitability or otherwise grow our business. In addition, existing relationships may be renewed with less favorable terms to the Company in response to
increased competition for such relationships. The competition for new partners is also significant, and our failure to attract new partners could adversely affect our
ability to grow.

63

A significant percentage of our interest and fees on loans comes from relationships with a small number of large retail partners, and the loss of any of
these partners could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Our five largest programs, excluding the Gap Inc. program, based upon interest and fees on loans for the year ended December 31, 2021 were Amazon,
JCPenney, Lowe’s, PayPal and Sam’s Club. These programs accounted in aggregate for 50% of our total interest and fees on loans for the year ended
December 31, 2021, and 51% of loan receivables at December 31, 2021. Our programs with Lowe's and PayPal, which includes our Venmo program, each
accounted for more than 10% of our total interest and fees on loans for the year ended December 31, 2021. See “Our Business—Our Sales Platforms.”

The program agreements generally permit us or our partner to terminate the agreement prior to its scheduled termination date under various circumstances as
described in the preceding risk factor. Some of our program agreements also provide that, upon expiration or termination, our partner may purchase or designate
a third party to purchase the accounts and loans generated with respect to its program and all related customer data. The loss of any of our largest partners or a
material reduction in the interest and fees we receive from their customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
condition.

Our business is heavily concentrated in U.S. consumer credit, and therefore our results are more susceptible to fluctuations in that market than a more
diversified company.

Our business is heavily concentrated in U.S. consumer credit. As a result, we are more susceptible to fluctuations and risks particular to U.S. consumer credit than
a more diversified company. For example, our business is particularly sensitive to macroeconomic conditions that affect the U.S. economy, consumer spending and
consumer credit. We are also more susceptible to the risks of increased regulations and legal and other regulatory actions that are targeted at consumer credit or
the specific consumer credit products that we offer (including promotional financing). Our Health & Wellness platform is more susceptible to increased regulations
and legal and other regulatory actions targeted at healthcare related procedures or services, in contrast to other industries. Our business concentration could have
an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our results depend, to a significant extent, on the active and effective promotion and support of our products by our partners.

Our partners generally accept most major credit cards and various other forms of payment, and therefore our success depends on their active and effective
promotion of our products to their customers in stores and online. We depend on our partners to integrate the use of our credit products into their store culture by
training their sales associates about our products, having their sales associates encourage their customers to apply for, and use, our products and otherwise
effectively marketing our products. In addition, although our programs with national and regional partners typically are exclusive with respect to the credit products
we offer at that partner, some programs and most Health & Wellness provider relationships are not exclusive to us, and therefore a partner may choose to promote
a competitor’s financing over ours, depending upon cost, availability or attractiveness to consumers or other factors. Typically, we do not have, or utilize, any
recourse against these non-exclusive partners when they do not sufficiently promote our products. Partners may also implement or fail to implement changes in
their systems and technologies that may disrupt the integration between their systems and technologies and ours, which could disrupt the use of our products. The
failure by our partners to effectively promote and support our products as well as changes they may make in their business models that negatively impact card
usage could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, if our partners engage in improper business practices, do not
adhere to the terms of our program agreements or other contractual arrangements or standards, or otherwise diminish the value of our brand, we may suffer
reputational damage and customers may be less likely to use our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Our results are impacted, to a significant extent, by the financial performance of our partners.

Our ability to generate new loans and the interest and fees and other income associated with them is dependent upon sales of merchandise and services by our
partners. The retail and healthcare industries in which our partners operate are intensely competitive. Our partners compete with retailers and department stores in
their own geographic areas, as well as catalog and online sales businesses. Our partners in the healthcare industry compete with other healthcare providers. Our
partners’ sales may decrease or may not increase as we anticipate for various reasons, some of which are in the partners’ control and some of which are not. For
example, partner sales may be adversely affected by macroeconomic conditions having a national, regional or more local effect on consumer spending, business
conditions affecting the general retail environment, such as supply chain disruptions or the ability to maintain sufficient staffing levels, or a particular partner or
industry, or catastrophes affecting broad or more discrete geographic areas. If our partners’ sales decline for any reason, it generally results in lower credit sales,
and therefore lower loan volume and associated interest and fees and other income for us from their customers. In addition, if a partner closes some or all of its
stores or becomes subject to a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceeding (or if there is a perception that it may become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding),
its customers who have used our financing products may have less incentive to pay their outstanding balances to us, which could result in higher charge-off rates
than anticipated and our costs for servicing its customers’ accounts may increase. This risk is particularly acute with respect to our largest partners that account for
a significant amount of our interest and fees on loans. See “—A significant percentage of our interest and fees on loans comes from relationships with a small
number of partners, and the loss of any of these partners could adversely affect our business and results of operations.” Moreover, if the financial condition of a
partner deteriorates significantly or a partner becomes subject to a bankruptcy proceeding, we may not be able to recover for customer returns, customer payments
made in partner stores or other amounts due to us from the partner. A decrease in sales by our partners for any reason or a bankruptcy proceeding involving any of
them could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

Competition in the consumer finance industry is intense.

The success of our business depends on our ability to retain existing partners and attract new partners. The competition for partners is intense and highly
competitive. Our primary competitors for partners include major financial institutions, such as Alliance Data Systems, American Express, Capital One, JPMorgan
Chase, Citibank, TD Bank and Wells Fargo, and to a lesser extent, financial technology companies and potential partners’ own in-house financing capabilities.
Some of our competitors are substantially larger, have substantially greater resources and may offer a broader range of products and services. We compete for
partners on the basis of a number of factors, including program financial and other terms, underwriting capabilities, marketing expertise, service levels, product and
service offerings (including incentive and loyalty programs), technological capabilities and integration, brand and reputation. In addition, some of our competitors for
partners have a business model that allows for their partners to manage underwriting (e.g., new account approval), customer service and collections, and other
core banking responsibilities that we retain but some partners may prefer to handle. As a result of competition, we may be unable to acquire new partners, lose
existing relationships to competing companies or find it more costly to maintain our existing relationships.

Our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain customers and generate usage of our products by them. The consumer credit and payments industry
is highly competitive and we face an increasingly dynamic industry as emerging technologies enter the marketplace. As a form of payment, our products compete
with cash, checks, debit cards, general purpose credit cards (including Visa and MasterCard, American Express and Discover Card), various forms of consumer
installment loans, other private label card brands and, to a certain extent, prepaid cards. In the future, we expect our products may face increased competitive
pressure to the extent that our products are not, or do not continue to be, accepted in, or compatible with digital wallet technologies such as Apple Pay, Samsung
Pay, Android Pay and other similar technologies.

65

We may also face increased competition from current competitors or others who introduce or embrace disruptive technology that significantly changes the
consumer credit and payment industry. We compete for customers and their usage of our products, and to minimize transfers to competitors of our customers’
outstanding balances, based on a number of factors, including pricing (interest rates and fees), product offerings, credit limits, incentives (including loyalty
programs) and customer service. Although we offer a variety of consumer credit products, some of our competitors provide a broader selection of services,
including home and automobile loans, debit cards and bank branch ATM access, which may position them better among customers who prefer to use a single
financial institution to meet all of their financial needs. Some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are, which may give those competitors advantages,
including a more diversified product and customer base, the ability to reach out to more customers and potential customers, operational efficiencies, more versatile
technology platforms, broad-based local distribution capabilities and lower-cost funding. In addition, some of our competitors, including new and emerging
competitors in the digital and mobile payments space, are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or legislative scrutiny to which we are subject. Non-bank
providers of pay-over-time solutions, such as Affirm, Afterpay and others, extend consumer credit-like offerings but do not face the same restrictions, such as
capital requirements and other regulatory requirements, as banks which also could place us at a competitive disadvantage. Customer attrition from any or all of our
credit products or any lowering of the pricing of our products by reducing interest rates or fees in order to retain customers could reduce our revenues and therefore
our earnings.

In addition, companies that control access to consumer and merchant payment method choices at the point of sale or through digital wallets, commerce-related
experiences, mobile applications or other technologies could choose not to accept, suppress use of, or degrade the experience of using our products. Such
companies could also require payments from us to participate in such digital wallets, experiences or applications or negotiate incentives or pricing concessions,
impacting our profitability on transactions.

In our retail deposits business, we have acquisition and servicing capabilities similar to other direct banking competitors. We compete for deposits with traditional
banks and, in seeking to grow our direct banking business, we compete with other banks that have direct banking models similar to ours, such as Ally Financial,
American Express, Barclays, Capital One 360, CIT, Citi, Citizens Bank, Discover and Marcus by Goldman Sachs. Competition among direct banks is intense
because online banking provides customers the ability to rapidly deposit and withdraw funds and open and close accounts in favor of products and services offered
by competitors.

If we are unable to compete effectively for partners, customer usage or deposits, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

We may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize new or enhanced products and services.

Our industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technologies, products, services and consumer preferences. A key part of our financial success depends
on our ability to develop and commercialize new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services, including with respect to loyalty
programs, mobile and point-of-sale technologies, and new Synchrony-branded bank deposit and credit products. Realizing the benefits of those products and
services is uncertain. We may not assign the appropriate level of resources, priority or expertise to the development and commercialization of these new products,
services or enhancements. Our ability to develop, acquire or commercialize competitive technologies, products or services on acceptable terms or at all may be
limited by intellectual property rights that third parties, including competitors and potential competitors, may assert. In addition, success is dependent on factors
such as partner and customer acceptance, adoption and usage, competition, the effectiveness of marketing programs, the availability of appropriate technologies
and business processes and regulatory approvals. Success of a new product, service or enhancement also may depend upon our ability to deliver it on a large
scale, which may require a significant investment.

We also may select, utilize and invest in technologies, products and services that ultimately do not achieve widespread adoption and therefore are not as attractive
or useful to our partners, customers and service partners as we anticipate, or partners may not recognize the value of our new products and services or believe
they justify any potential costs or disruptions associated with implementing them. In addition, because our products and services typically are marketed through our
partners, if our partners are unwilling or unable to effectively implement our new technologies, products, services or enhancements, we may be unable to grow our
business. Competitors may also develop or adopt technologies or introduce innovations that change the markets we operate in and make our products less
competitive and attractive to our partners and customers.

66

In any event, we may not realize the benefit of new technologies, products, services or enhancements for many years or competitors may introduce more
compelling products, services or enhancements. Our failure to successfully develop and commercialize new or enhanced products, services or enhancements
could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

We may not realize the value of acquisitions, strategic investments and strategic initiatives that we pursue and such investments and initiatives could
divert resources or introduce unforeseen risks to our business.

We  will  acquire  new  partners  and  may  execute  strategic  acquisitions,  partnerships  or  initiatives  or  make  other  strategic  investments  in  businesses,  products,
technologies or platforms to enhance or grow our business. These acquisitions and strategic investments may introduce new costs or liabilities which could impact
our ability to grow or maintain acceptable performance.

We may be unable to integrate systems, personnel or technologies from our acquisitions and strategic investments. These acquisitions and strategic investments
may also present unforeseen legal, regulatory or other challenges that we may not be able to manage effectively. The planning and integration of an acquisition,
including of a new partner or credit card portfolio, partnership or investment, may shift employee time and other resources which could impair our ability to focus on
our core business.

New partnerships, acquisitions, strategic investments and strategic initiatives may not perform as expected due to lack of acceptance by partners, customers or
employees, higher than forecasted costs or losses, lengthy transition periods, synergies or savings not being realized and a variety of other factors. This may result
in a delay or unrealized benefit, or in some cases, increased costs or other unforeseen risks to our business.

Fraudulent activity associated with our products and services could negatively impact our operating results, brand and reputation and cause the use of
our products and services to decrease and our fraud losses to increase.

We are subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with partners, customers and third parties handling customer information. Our fraud-related operational
losses were $104 million, $334 million and $273 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our products are susceptible to
application fraud, because among other things, we provide immediate access to the credit line at the time of approval. In addition, sales on the internet and through
mobile channels are becoming a larger part of our business and pose a greater fraudulent threat than sales made in stores. Dual Cards, general purpose, general
purpose co-branded credit cards and private label credit cards are susceptible to different types of fraud, and, depending on our product channel mix, we may
continue to experience variations in, or levels of, fraud-related expense that are different from or higher than that experienced by some of our competitors or the
industry generally.

The risk of fraud continues to increase for the financial services industry in general, and credit card fraud, identity theft and related crimes are likely to continue to
be prevalent, and perpetrators are growing more sophisticated. Our resources, technologies and fraud prevention tools may be insufficient to accurately detect and
prevent fraud. High profile fraudulent activity also could negatively impact our brand and reputation, which could negatively impact the use of our cards and thereby
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, significant increases in fraudulent activity could lead to regulatory intervention (such as
increased customer notification requirements), which could increase our costs and also negatively impact our operating results, brand and reputation and could
lead us to take steps to reduce fraud risk, which could increase our costs.

67

The failure of third parties to provide various services that are important to our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and
results of operations.

Some services important to our business are outsourced to third-party vendors. For example, our principal technology and related services (including credit card
transaction processing) and production and related services (including the printing and mailing of customer statements) are handled via a contractual arrangement
with Fiserv Solutions LLC (formerly First Data that was acquired by Fiserv in 2019), and the platform for our online retail deposits is also managed by Fiserv. Fiserv,
and, in some cases, other third-party vendors, are the sole source or one of a limited number of sources of the services they provide for us. It would be difficult and
disruptive for us to replace certain of these third-party vendors, particularly Fiserv, in a timely or seamless manner if they were unwilling or unable to continue to
provide us with these services in the future (as a result of their financial or business conditions or otherwise), and our business and operations likely would be
materially adversely affected. Our principal agreement with Fiserv for technology and production services expires in November 2026, unless it is terminated earlier
or is extended pursuant to the terms thereof and our principal agreement with Fiserv for online retail deposits expires in July 2022, unless it is terminated earlier or
is extended pursuant to the terms thereof. In addition, if a third-party provider fails to provide the services we require, fails to meet contractual requirements, such
as compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or suffers a cyber-attack or other security breach, our business could suffer economic and reputational harm
that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Technological Risks

Cyber-attacks or other security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business.

In the normal course of business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential information regarding our partners and our customers. We also have
arrangements in place with our partners and other third parties through which we share and receive information about their customers who are or may become our
customers. Although we devote significant resources and management focus to ensuring the integrity of our systems through information security and business
continuity programs, our facilities and systems, and those of our partners and third-party service providers, are vulnerable to external or internal security breaches,
acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming or human errors, or other similar events. We and our partners and third-party service
providers have experienced all of these events in the past and expect to continue to experience them in the future. These events could interrupt our business or
operations, result in significant legal and financial exposure, supervisory liability, damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems,
products and services. Although the impact to date from these events has not had a material adverse effect on us, we cannot be sure this will be the case in the
future.

Information security risks for large financial institutions like us have increased recently in part because of new technologies, the use of the internet and
telecommunications technologies (including mobile and other connected devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions, increased remote working
dynamics, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others. In addition to cyber-attacks or
other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information, hackers recently have engaged in attacks against large financial institutions that
are designed to disrupt key business services, such as consumer-facing web sites, via increasing use of ransomeware technologies. Our business performance
and marketing efforts may increase our profile and therefore our risk of being targeted for cyber-attacks and other security breaches, including attacks targeting our
key business services, websites, executives, and partners. We are not able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches
of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. We employ detection
and response mechanisms designed to contain and mitigate security incidents, but early detection may be thwarted by sophisticated attacks and malware designed
to avoid detection.

68

We also face risks related to cyber-attacks and other security breaches in connection with credit card and deposit transactions that typically involve the
transmission of sensitive information regarding our customers through various third-parties, including our partners, retailers that are not our partners where our
Dual Cards and general purpose co-branded credit cards are used, merchant acquiring banks, payment processors, card networks (e.g., Visa and MasterCard) and
our processors (e.g., Fiserv). Some of these parties have in the past been the target of security breaches and cyber-attacks, and because the transactions involve
third parties and environments such as the point of sale that we do not control or secure, future security breaches or cyber-attacks affecting any of these third
parties could impact us through no fault of our own, and in some cases, we may have exposure and suffer losses for breaches or attacks relating to them. We also
rely on numerous other third-party service providers to conduct other aspects of our business operations and face similar risks relating to them. While we regularly
conduct security assessments of significant third-party service providers, we cannot be completely sure that their information security protocols are sufficient to
withstand a cyber-attack or other security breach.

The access by unauthorized persons to, or the improper disclosure by us of, confidential information regarding our customers or our own proprietary information,
software, methodologies and business secrets could interrupt our business or operations, result in significant legal and financial exposure, supervisory liability,
damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems, products and services, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there have been a number of well-publicized attacks or breaches directed at others in our
industry that have heightened concern by consumers generally about the security of using credit cards, which have caused some consumers, including our
customers, to use our credit cards less in favor of alternative methods of payment and has led to increased regulatory focus on, and potentially new regulations
relating to, these matters. Further cyber-attacks or other breaches in the future, whether affecting us or others, could intensify consumer concern and regulatory
focus and result in reduced use of our cards or other products and increased costs arising from, among other things new regulatory requirements relating to data
security, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Disruptions in the operation of our and our outsourced partners' computer systems and data centers could have a material adverse effect on our
business.

Our ability to deliver products and services to our partners and our customers, service our loans and otherwise operate our business and comply with applicable
laws depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer systems and data centers, as well as those of our partners and third-party service
providers. These computer systems and data centers may encounter service interruptions at any time due to system or software failure, natural disaster or other
reasons. In addition, the implementation of technology changes and upgrades to maintain current and integrate new systems may also cause service interruptions,
transaction processing errors and system conversion delays and may cause our failure to comply with applicable laws, all of which could have a material adverse
effect on our business.

We expect that new technologies and business processes applicable to the consumer credit industry will continue to emerge, and these new technologies and
business processes may be better than those we currently use. The pace of technology change is high and our industry is intensely competitive, and we cannot
assure you that we will be able to sustain our investment in new technology as critical systems and applications become obsolete and better ones become
available. A failure to maintain current technology and business processes could cause disruptions in our operations or cause our products and services to be less
competitive, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Financial Risks

Our allowance for credit losses may prove to be insufficient to cover losses on our loans.

We maintain an allowance for credit losses (a reserve established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense) that we believe is appropriate to
provide for expected credit losses for the life of our loan portfolio. In addition, for portfolios we acquire when we enter into new partner program agreements we are
required to establish an allowance for expected credit losses for the life of the acquired loan portfolio. Any subsequent deterioration in the performance of the
purchased portfolios after acquisition results in incremental credit loss reserves. Growth in our loan portfolio generally would also lead to an increase in the
allowance for credit losses.

69

The process for establishing an allowance for credit losses is critical to our results of operations and financial condition, and requires complex models and
judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions. We utilize an impairment model in accordance with ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses:
Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, known as the CECL model. The CECL model requires, upon origination of a loan, the recognition of all
expected credit losses over the life of the loan based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Changes in economic
conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding our loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the
allowance for credit losses. We may underestimate our expected losses and fail to maintain an allowance for credit losses sufficient to account for these losses. In
cases where we modify a loan, if the modified loans do not perform as anticipated, we may be required to establish additional allowances on these loans.

We will continue to periodically review and update our current methodology, models and the underlying assumptions, estimates and assessments we use to
establish our allowance for credit losses to reflect our view of current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Moreover, our regulators, as part of
their supervisory function, periodically review our methodology, models and the underlying assumptions, estimates and assessments we use for calculating, and
the adequacy of, our allowance for credit losses. Our regulators, based on their judgment, may conclude that we should modify our current methodology, models or
the underlying assumptions, estimates and assessments, increase our allowance for credit losses and/or recognize further losses. We will implement further
enhancements or changes to our methodology, models and the underlying assumptions, estimates and assessments, as needed.

We cannot assure you that our credit loss reserves will be sufficient to cover actual losses. Future increases in the allowance for credit losses or actual losses (as a
result of any review, update, regulatory guidance or otherwise) will result in a decrease in net earnings and capital and could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

If assumptions or estimates we use in preparing our financial statements, including those related to the CECL accounting guidance, are incorrect or are
required to change, our reported results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.

We are required to make various assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements under GAAP, including for purposes of determining our
allowance for credit losses, asset impairment, reserves related to litigation and other legal matters, valuation of income and other taxes and regulatory exposures
and the amounts recorded for certain contractual payments to be paid to or received from partners and others under contractual arrangements. Our most critical
estimate used in preparing our financial statements is the determination of our allowance for credit losses, which was $8.7 billion at December 31, 2021. Upon
origination of a loan, the estimate of expected credit losses, and any subsequent changes to such estimate, are recorded through provision for credit losses in our
Consolidated Statement of Earnings. As a result, any subsequent changes we make to our underlying assumptions and estimates may result in a material adverse
impact to our results of operations and the Company’s ability to return capital to our shareholders. In addition, significant assumptions and estimates are involved in
determining certain disclosures required under GAAP, including those involving the fair value of our financial instruments. If the assumptions or estimates
underlying our financial statements are incorrect or are required to change, the actual amounts realized on transactions and balances subject to those estimates
will be different, and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

For additional information on the key areas for which assumptions and estimates are used in preparing our financial statements, see “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates” and Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements.

Adverse financial market conditions or our inability to effectively manage our funding and liquidity risk could have a material adverse effect on our
funding, liquidity and ability to meet our obligations.

We need to effectively manage our funding and liquidity in order to meet our cash requirements such as day-to-day operating expenses, extensions of credit to our
customers, payments of principal and interest on our borrowings and payments on our other obligations. Our primary sources of funding and liquidity are collections
from our customers, deposits, funds from securitized financings and proceeds from unsecured borrowings. If we do not have sufficient liquidity, we may not be able
to meet our obligations, particularly during a liquidity stress event. If we maintain or are required to maintain too much liquidity, it could be costly and reduce our
financial flexibility.

70

We will need additional financing in the future to refinance any existing debt and finance growth of our business. The availability of additional financing will depend
on a variety of factors such as financial market conditions generally, including the availability of credit to the financial services industry, consumers’ willingness to
place money on deposit in the Bank, our performance and credit ratings and the performance of our securitized portfolios. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the
capital, credit or deposit markets, such as the uncertainty and volatility experienced in the capital and credit markets during periods of financial stress and other
economic and political conditions in the global markets and concerning the level of U.S. government debt and fiscal measures that may be taken over the longer
term to address these matters, may limit our ability to obtain additional financing or refinance maturing liabilities on desired terms (including funding costs) in a
timely manner or at all. As a result, we may be forced to delay obtaining funding or be forced to issue or raise funding on undesirable terms, which could
significantly reduce our financial flexibility and cause us to contract or not grow our business, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations and financial conditions.

In addition, at December 31, 2021, we had an aggregate of $2.7 billion of undrawn credit facilities, subject to customary borrowing conditions, from private lenders
under our securitization programs and an unsecured revolving credit facility. Our ability to draw on such commitments is subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions, including the applicable securitization trust having sufficient collateral to support the draw and the absence of an early amortization event. Moreover,
there are regulatory reforms that have been proposed or adopted in the United States and internationally that are intended to address certain issues that affected
banks in the last financial crisis. These reforms, generally referred to as “Basel III,” subject banks to more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements. To
the extent that the Basel III requirements result in increased costs to the banks providing undrawn committed capacity under our securitization programs, these
costs are likely to be passed on to us. In addition, in response to Basel III, some banks in the market (including certain of the private lenders in our securitization
programs) have added provisions to their credit agreements permitting them to delay disbursement of funding requests for 30 days or more. If our bank lenders
require delayed disbursements of funding and/or higher pricing for committing undrawn capacity to us, our cost of funding and access to liquidity could be
adversely affected.

While financial market conditions are generally stable, there can be no assurance that significant disruptions, uncertainties and volatility will not occur in the future.
If we are unable to continue to finance our business, access capital markets and attract deposits on favorable terms and in a timely manner, or if we experience an
increase in our borrowing costs or otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectively, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely
affected.

Our inability to grow our deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our liquidity and ability to grow our business.

We obtain deposits directly from retail and commercial customers or through brokerage firms that offer our deposit products to their customers. At December 31,
2021, we had $50.1 billion in direct deposits and $12.2 billion in deposits originated through brokerage firms (including network deposit sweeps procured through a
program arranger who channels brokerage account deposits to us). A key part of our liquidity plan and funding strategy is to continue to fund our growth through
direct deposits.

The deposit business is highly competitive, with intense competition in attracting and retaining deposits. We compete on the basis of the rates we pay on deposits,
features and benefits of our products, the quality of our customer service and the competitiveness of our digital banking capabilities. Our ability to originate and
maintain retail deposits is also highly dependent on the products we offer, the strength of the Bank and the perceptions of consumers and others of our business
practices and our financial health. Adverse perceptions regarding our reputation could lead to difficulties in attracting and retaining deposits accounts. Negative
public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in a number of areas, including lending practices, regulatory compliance, inadequate protection of
customer information or sales and marketing activities, and from actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct.

The demand for the deposit products we offer may also be reduced due to a variety of factors, such as demographic patterns, macroeconomic shocks, significant
changes in the level of interest rates, changes in customer preferences, reductions in consumers’ disposable income, regulatory actions that decrease customer
access to particular products or the availability of competing products which may offer more features or perceived benefits than the Bank's products. Competition
from other financial services firms and others that use deposit funding products may affect deposit renewal rates, costs or availability. Changes we make to the
rates offered on our deposit products may affect our profitability and liquidity.

71

On September 21, 2021, we announced a partnership with PayPal Holdings Inc. to offer demand savings accounts exclusively to PayPal customers. This, and
other future affiliate banking products, could become important sources of funding and liquidity to the Bank. To the extent such partnerships are dissolved, the Bank
may need to find suitable replacement sources of that funding and liquidity at potentially higher costs.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDIA”) prohibits an insured bank from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly
higher than the prevailing rate in the bank’s normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited), unless it is “well capitalized,” or it is
“adequately capitalized” and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A bank that is “adequately capitalized” and accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the FDIC
may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates. There are no such restrictions under the FDIA on a
bank that is “well capitalized” and at December 31, 2021, the Bank met or exceeded all applicable requirements to be deemed “well capitalized” for purposes of the
FDIA. However, there can be no assurance that the Bank will continue to meet those requirements. Limitations on the Bank’s ability to accept brokered deposits for
any reason (including regulatory limitations on the amount of brokered deposits in total or as a percentage of total assets) in the future could materially adversely
impact our funding costs and liquidity. Any limitation on the interest rates the Bank can pay on deposits could competitively disadvantage us in attracting and
retaining deposits and have a material adverse effect on our business.

A reduction in our credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets.

Synchrony's senior unsecured debt currently is rated BBB- (stable outlook) by Fitch Ratings, Inc. (“Fitch”) and BBB- (stable outlook) by Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”).
The Bank’s senior unsecured debt currently is rated BBB- (stable outlook) by Fitch and BBB (stable outlook) by S&P. Although we have not requested that Moody’s
Investor Services, Inc. (“Moody’s”) provide a rating for our senior unsecured debt, we believe that if Moody’s were to issue a rating on our unsecured debt, its rating
would be lower than the comparable ratings issued by Fitch and S&P. The ratings for our unsecured debt are based on a number of factors, including our financial
strength, as well as factors that may not be within our control, such as macroeconomic conditions and the rating agencies’ perception of the industries in which we
operate and the products we offer. The ratings of our asset-backed securities are, and will continue to be, based on a number of factors, including the quality of the
underlying loan receivables and the credit enhancement structure with respect to each series of asset-backed securities, as well as our credit rating as sponsor and
servicer of our publicly registered securitization trusts. These ratings also reflect the various methodologies and assumptions used by the rating agencies, which
are subject to change and could adversely affect our ratings. The rating agencies regularly evaluate our credit ratings as well as the credit ratings of our asset-
backed securities. A downgrade in our unsecured debt or asset-backed securities credit ratings (or investor concerns that a downgrade may occur) could materially
increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets.

If the ratings on our asset-backed securities are reduced, put on negative watch or withdrawn, it may have an adverse effect on the liquidity or the market price of
our asset-backed securities and on the cost of, or our ability to continue using, securitized financings to the extent anticipated.

Our inability to securitize our loan receivables would have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, cost of funds and financial condition.

We use the securitization of loan receivables, which involves the transfer of loan receivables to a trust and the issuance by the trust of asset-backed securities to
third-party investors, as a significant source of funding. Our average level of securitized financings from third parties was $7.2 billion and $8.7 billion for the years
ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For a discussion of our securitization activities, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations—Funding, Liquidity and Capital Resources—Funding Sources—Securitized Financings” and Note 5. Variable Interest Entities
to our consolidated financial statements.

72

There can be no assurance that the securitization market for credit cards will not experience future disruptions. The extent to which we securitize our loan
receivables in the future will depend in part upon the conditions in the securities markets in general and the credit card asset-backed securities market in particular,
the availability of loan receivables for securitization, the overall credit quality of our loan receivables and the conformity of the loan receivables and our
securitization program to rating agency requirements, the costs of securitizing our loan receivables, and the legal, regulatory, accounting and tax requirements
governing securitization transactions. In the event we are unable to refinance existing asset-backed securities with new asset-backed securities, we would be
required to rely on other sources of funding, which may not be available or may be available only at higher cost. Further, in the event we are unable to refinance
existing asset-backed securities from our nonbank subsidiary securitization trust with new securities from the same trust, there are structural and regulatory
constraints on our ability to refinance these asset-backed securities with Bank deposits or other funding at the Bank, and therefore we would be required to rely on
sources outside of the Bank, which may not be available or may be available only at higher cost. A prolonged inability to securitize our loan receivables on
favorable terms, or at all, or to refinance our asset-backed securities would have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, cost of funds and financial
condition.

The occurrence of an early amortization of our securitization facilities would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and cost of funds.

Our liquidity would be materially adversely affected by the occurrence of events resulting in the early amortization of our existing securitized financings. During an
early amortization period, principal collections from the loan receivables in our asset-backed securitization trust in which the early amortization event occurred
would be applied to repay principal of the trust's asset-backed securities rather than being available on a revolving basis to fund purchases of newly originated loan
receivables. This would negatively impact our liquidity, including our ability to originate new loan receivables under existing accounts, and require us to rely on
alternative funding sources, which might increase our funding costs or might not be available when needed.

Our loss of the right to service or subservice our securitized loan receivables would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and cost of funds.

Synchrony currently acts as servicer with respect to our nonbank subsidiary securitization trust, and the Bank acts as servicer with respect to our other two
securitization trusts. If Synchrony or the Bank, as applicable, defaults in its servicing obligations, an early amortization event could occur with respect to the
relevant asset-backed securities and/or Synchrony or the Bank, as applicable, could be replaced as servicer. Servicer defaults include, for example, the failure of
the servicer to make any payment, transfer or deposit in accordance with the securitization documents, a breach of representations, warranties or agreements
made by the servicer under the securitization documents, the delegation of the servicer’s duties contrary to the securitization documents and the occurrence of
certain insolvency events with respect to the servicer. Such an early amortization event would have the adverse consequences discussed in the immediately
preceding risk factor.

If either Synchrony or the Bank defaults in its servicing obligations with respect to any of our three securitization trusts, a third party could be appointed as servicer
of such trust. If a third-party servicer is appointed, there is no assurance that the third party will engage us as sub-servicer, in which event we would no longer be
able to control the manner in which the related trust’s assets are serviced, and the failure of a third party to appropriately service such assets could lead to an early
amortization event in the affected securitization trust, which would have the adverse consequences discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor.

Lower payment rates on our securitized loan receivables could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.

Certain collections from our securitized loan receivables come back to us through our subsidiaries, and we use these collections to fund our purchase of newly
originated loan receivables to collateralize our securitized financings. If payment rates on our securitized loan receivables are lower than they have historically
been, fewer collections will be remitted to us on an ongoing basis. Further, certain series of our asset-backed securities include a requirement that we accumulate
principal collections in a restricted account for a specified number of months prior to the applicable security’s maturity date. We are required under the program
documents to lengthen this accumulation period to the extent we expect the payment rates to be low enough that the current length of the accumulation period is
inadequate to fully fund the restricted account by the applicable security’s maturity date. Lower payment rates, and in particular, payment rates that are low enough
that we are required to lengthen our accumulation periods, could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.

Changes in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings, funding and liquidity.

Changes in market interest rates cause our net interest income to increase or decrease, as certain of our assets and liabilities carry interest rates that fluctuate with
market benchmarks. At December 31, 2021, 54.6% of our loan receivables were priced at a fixed interest rate to the customer, with the remaining 45.4% at a
floating interest rate. We fund our assets with a combination of fixed rate and floating rate funding sources that include deposits, asset-backed securities and
unsecured debt. The interest rate benchmark for our floating rate assets is the prime rate, and the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate liabilities is generally
either the LIBOR or the federal funds rate. The prime rate and LIBOR or the federal funds rate could reset at different times or could diverge, leading to mismatches
in the interest rates on our floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities. Additionally, on July 27, 2017 the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would
no longer encourage or compel banks to continue to contribute quotes and maintain LIBOR after 2021. However, on March 5, 2021, the ICE Benchmark
Administration stated that it will continue to publish overnight, 1, 3, 6 and 12 month LIBOR settings.

The Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation issued supervisory guidance, on
November 30, 2020, encouraging banks to cease entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by
December 31, 2021. Regulators have not, to date, compelled banks to use a particular replacement rate for LIBOR, but market acceptance has largely gravitated
toward the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). Synchrony is not entering into any new agreements that reference LIBOR. Additionally, Synchrony is in the
process of amending existing asset and liability contracts that reference LIBOR to reference a new benchmark rate. The new benchmark rates include, but are not
limited to, SOFR, federal funds and U.S. Treasury bills. When our existing contracts that reference LIBOR are updated or renewed with these benchmark rates,
they could reset at different times, or diverge, from the prime rate, leading to mismatches in the interest rates on our floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities.
If we are unable to effectively manage the transition from LIBOR, our net earnings could be materially adversely affected.

Competitive and regulatory factors may limit our ability to raise interest rates on our loans. In addition, some of our program agreements limit the rate of interest we
can charge to customers. If interest rates were to rise materially over a sustained period of time, and we are unable to sufficiently raise our interest rates in a timely
manner, or at all, our net interest margin could be adversely impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings.

Interest rates may also adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay amounts owed to us. Our floating rate credit products
bear interest rates that fluctuate with the prime rate. Higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under
mortgage, credit card and other consumer loans, which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to
increased delinquencies, bankruptcies, charge-offs, allowances for credit losses, and decreasing recoveries, all of which could have a material adverse effect on
our net earnings.

Changes in interest rates and competitor responses to these changes may also impact customer decisions to maintain deposits with us, and reductions in deposits
could materially adversely affect our funding costs and liquidity.

74

We assess our interest rate risk by estimating the net interest income impact of various interest rate scenarios. We take risk mitigation actions based on those
assessments. Changes in interest rates could materially reduce our net interest income and our net earnings, and could also increase our funding costs and reduce
our liquidity, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different from our assumptions. For a discussion of interest rate risk sensitivities, see
“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Interest Rate Risk.”

We rely extensively on models in managing many aspects of our business, and if they are not accurate or are misinterpreted, it could have a material
adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

We rely extensively on models in managing many aspects of our business, including liquidity and capital planning (including stress testing), customer selection,
credit and other risk management, pricing, reserving and collections management. The models may prove in practice to be less predictive than we expect for a
variety of reasons, including as a result of errors in constructing, interpreting or using the models or the use of inaccurate assumptions (including failures to update
assumptions appropriately or in a timely manner). Our assumptions may be inaccurate for many reasons including that they often involve matters that are
inherently difficult to predict and beyond our control (e.g., macroeconomic conditions and their impact on partner and customer behaviors) and they often involve
complex interactions between a number of dependent and independent variables, factors and other assumptions. The errors or inaccuracies in our models may be
material, and could lead us to make wrong or sub-optimal decisions in managing our business, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

Our business depends on our ability to successfully manage our credit risk, and failing to do so may result in high charge-off rates.

Our success depends on our ability to manage our credit risk while attracting new customers with profitable usage patterns. We select our customers, manage their
accounts and establish terms and credit limits using proprietary scoring models and other analytical techniques that are designed to set terms and credit limits to
appropriately compensate us for the credit risk we accept, while encouraging customers to use their available credit. The models and approaches we use to
manage our credit risk may not accurately predict future charge-offs for various reasons discussed in the preceding risk factors.

Our ability to manage credit risk and avoid high charge-off rates also may be adversely affected by economic conditions that may be difficult to predict, such as the
last financial crisis. The assessment of our credit profile includes the evaluation of portfolio mix, account maturation, as well as broader consumer trends, such as
payment behavior and overall indebtedness. See “Management's Discussion and Analysis—Results of Operations—Business Trends and Conditions” for further
discussion of our expectations of future credit trends, in the near term. Credit trends may deteriorate materially from our expectations if economic conditions were
to deteriorate.

In addition, we remain subject to conditions in the consumer credit environment. Our credit underwriting and risk management strategies are used to manage our
credit exposures; however, there can be no assurance that those will enable us to avoid high charge-off levels or delinquencies, or that our allowance for credit
losses will be sufficient to cover actual losses.

A customer’s ability to repay us can be negatively impacted by increases in their payment obligations to other lenders under mortgage, credit card and other loans
(including student loans). These changes can result from increases in base lending rates or structured increases in payment obligations, and could reduce the
ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations to other lenders and to us. In addition, a customer’s ability to repay us can be negatively impacted by the
restricted availability of credit to consumers generally, including reduced and closed lines of credit. Customers with insufficient cash flow to fund daily living
expenses and lack of access to other sources of credit may be more likely to increase their card usage and ultimately default on their payment obligations to us,
resulting in higher credit losses in our portfolio. Our collection operations may not compete effectively to secure more of customers’ diminished cash flow than our
competitors. We may not identify customers who are likely to default on their payment obligations to us and reduce our exposure by closing credit lines and
restricting authorizations quickly enough, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our
collection strategy depends in part on the sale of debt to third-party buyers. Regulatory or other factors may adversely affect the pricing of our debt sales or the
performance of our third-party buyers, which may result in higher credit losses in our portfolio. At December 31, 2021, 22% of our portfolio’s loan receivables were
from customers with a Vantage score of 650 or less (excluding unrated accounts), who typically have higher delinquency and credit losses than consumers with
higher credit scores.

75

Our ability to manage credit risk also may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory changes (such as bankruptcy laws and minimum payment regulations) and
collection regulations, competitors’ actions and consumer behavior, as well as inadequate collections staffing, techniques, models and performance of vendors
such as collection agencies.

We may not be able to offset increases in our costs with decreased payments under our retailer share arrangements, which could reduce our
profitability.

Most of our program agreements with larger retailers and certain other program agreements contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our
partners if the economic performance of the relevant program exceeds a contractually defined threshold. Although the share arrangements vary by partner, these
arrangements are generally structured to measure the economic performance of the program, based typically on agreed upon program revenues (including interest
income and certain other income) less agreed upon program expenses (including interest expense, provision for credit losses, retailer payments and operating
expenses), and share portions of this amount above a negotiated threshold. These arrangements are typically designed to permit us to achieve an economic return
before we are required to make payments to our partners based on the agreed contractually defined threshold. However, because the threshold and the economic
performance of a program that are used to calculate payments to our partners may be based on, among other things, agreed upon measures of program expenses
rather than our actual expenses, we may not be able to pass on increases in our actual expenses (such as funding costs or operating expenses) in the form of
reduced payments under our retailer share arrangements, and our economic return on a program could be adversely affected. While most of our agreements
contain retailer share arrangements, in some cases, where we instead provide other economic benefits to our partners such as royalties on purchase volume or
payments for new accounts (for example, on our co-branded credit cards), our ability to offset increases in our costs is limited.

Reductions in interchange fees may reduce the competitive advantages our private label credit card products currently have by virtue of not charging
interchange fees and would reduce our income from those fees.

Interchange is a fee merchants pay to the interchange network in exchange for the use of the network’s infrastructure and payment facilitation, and which are paid
to credit card issuers to compensate them for the risk they bear in lending money to customers. We earn interchange fees on Dual Card and general purpose co-
branded credit card transactions but we typically do not charge or earn interchange fees from our partners or customers on our private label credit card products.

Merchants, trying to decrease their operating expenses, have sought to, and have had some success at, lowering interchange rates. Several recent events and
actions indicate a continuing increase in focus on interchange by both regulators and merchants. Beyond pursuing litigation, legislation and regulation, merchants
are also pursuing alternate payment platforms as a means to lower payment processing costs. To the extent interchange fees are reduced, one of our current
competitive advantages with our partners—that we typically do not charge interchange fees when our private label credit card products are used to purchase our
partners’ goods and services—may be reduced. Moreover, to the extent interchange fees are reduced, our income from those fees will be lower. We received $880
million of interchange fees for the year ended December 31, 2021. As a result, a reduction in interchange fees could have a material adverse effect on our business
and results of operations. In addition, for our Dual Cards and general purpose co-branded credit cards, we are subject to the operating regulations and procedures
set forth by the interchange network, and our failure to comply with these operating regulations, which may change from time to time, could subject us to various
penalties or fees, or the termination of our license to use the interchange network, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of
operations.

76

Legal Risks

We have international operations that subject us to various international risks as well as increased compliance and regulatory risks and costs.

We have international operations, primarily in India, the Philippines and Canada, and some of our third-party service providers provide services to us from other
countries, all of which subject us to a number of international risks, including, among other things, sovereign volatility and socio-political instability. For example, the
Philippines has in the past experienced severe political and social instability. Any future political or social instability in the countries in which we operate could have
a material adverse effect on our business operations.

U.S. regulations also govern various aspects of the international activities of domestic corporations and increase our compliance and regulatory risks and costs.
Any failure on our part or the part of our service providers to comply with applicable U.S. regulations, as well as the regulations in the countries and markets in
which we or they operate, could result in fines, penalties, injunctions or other similar restrictions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

If we are alleged to have infringed upon the intellectual property rights owned by others or are not able to protect our intellectual property, our business
and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Competitors or other third parties may allege that we, or consultants or other third parties retained or indemnified by us, infringe on their intellectual property rights.
We also may face allegations that our employees have misappropriated intellectual property of their former employers or other third parties. Given the complex,
rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environment in which we operate, and the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual property-
related litigation, an assertion of an infringement claim against us may cause us to spend significant amounts to defend the claim (even if we ultimately prevail), pay
significant money damages, lose significant revenues, be prohibited from using the relevant systems, processes, technologies or other intellectual property, cease
offering certain products or services, or incur significant license, royalty or technology development expenses. Moreover, it has become common in recent years for
individuals and groups to purchase intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from
companies like ours. Even in instances where we believe that claims and allegations of intellectual property infringement against us are without merit, defending
against such claims is time consuming and expensive and could result in the diversion of time and attention of our management and employees. In addition,
although in some cases a third party may have agreed to indemnify us for such costs, such indemnifying party may refuse or be unable to uphold its contractual
obligations.

Moreover, we rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information, including copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets
and controls on access and distribution. These measures may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or proprietary information
and a resulting loss of competitive advantage, and in any event, we may be required to litigate to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information from
misappropriation or infringement by others, which is expensive, could cause a diversion of resources and may not be successful. Third parties may challenge,
invalidate or circumvent our intellectual property, or our intellectual property may not be sufficient to provide us with competitive advantages. Our competitors or
other third parties may independently design around or develop similar technology, or otherwise duplicate our services or products such that we could not assert
our intellectual property rights against them. In addition, our contractual arrangements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our intellectual property or
confidential and proprietary information or provide an adequate remedy in the event of an unauthorized disclosure.

77

Litigation, regulatory actions and compliance issues could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments, remediation costs and/or requirements
resulting in increased expenses.

Our business is subject to increased risks of litigation and regulatory actions as a result of a number of factors and from various sources, including the highly
regulated nature of the financial services industry, the focus of state and federal prosecutors on banks and the financial services industry and the structure of the
credit card industry.

In the normal course of business, from time to time, we have been named as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other
litigation, arising in connection with our business activities. Certain of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages, or
claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In addition, while historically the arbitration provision in our customer agreements generally has limited our exposure
to consumer class action litigation, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future. There may also be
legislative or other efforts to directly or indirectly prohibit the use of pre-dispute arbitration clauses, or we may be compelled as a result of competitive pressure or
reputational concerns to voluntarily eliminate pre-dispute arbitration clauses. If the arbitration provision is not enforceable or eliminated (for whatever reason), our
exposure to class action litigation could increase significantly. Even if our arbitration clause remains enforceable, we may be subject to mass arbitrations in which
large groups of consumers bring arbitrations against the Company simultaneously.

We are also involved, from time to time, in reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental agencies regarding our business
(collectively, “regulatory matters”), which could subject us to significant fines, penalties, obligations to change our business practices or other requirements resulting
in increased expenses, diminished earnings and damage to our reputation. The current environment of additional regulation, increased regulatory compliance
efforts and enhanced regulatory enforcement has resulted in significant operational and compliance costs and may prevent or make it less attractive for us to
continue providing certain products and services. There is no assurance that these regulatory matters or other factors will not, in the future, affect how we conduct
our business and in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We contest liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. The outcome of pending and future matters could be material to our
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows depending on, among other factors, the level of our earnings for that period, and could adversely affect our
business and reputation. For a discussion of certain legal proceedings, see “Regulation—Consumer Financial Services Regulation,” and Note 16. Legal
Proceedings and Regulatory Matters to our consolidated financial statements.

In addition to litigation and regulatory matters, from time to time, through our operational and compliance controls, we identify compliance issues that require us to
make operational changes and, depending on the nature of the issue, result in financial remediation to impacted cardholders. These self-identified issues and
voluntary remediation payments could be significant depending on the issue and the number of cardholders impacted. They also could generate litigation or
regulatory investigations that subject us to additional adverse effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

General Risks

Damage to our reputation could negatively impact our business.

Maintaining a positive reputation is critical to our attracting and retaining customers, partners, investors and employees. In particular, adverse perceptions
regarding our reputation could also make it more difficult for us to execute on our strategy of increasing retail deposits at the Bank and may lead to decreases in
deposits. Harm to our reputation can arise from many sources, including employee misconduct, misconduct by our partners, outsourced service providers or other
counterparties, litigation or regulatory actions, failure by us or our partners to meet minimum standards of service and quality, inadequate protection of customer
information and compliance failures. Negative publicity regarding us (or others engaged in a similar business or activities), whether or not accurate, may damage
our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

78

Our risk management processes and procedures may not be effective in mitigating our risks.

Our risk management processes and procedures seek to appropriately balance risk and return and mitigate risks. We have established processes and procedures
intended to identify, measure, monitor and control the types of risk to which we are subject, including credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk (including
compliance risk), strategic risk, and reputational risk. Credit risk is the risk of loss that arises when an obligor fails to meet the terms of an obligation. We are
exposed to both consumer credit risk, from our customer loans, and institutional credit risk, principally from our partners. Market risk refers to the risk that a change
in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio. Liquidity risk is the risk
that financial condition or overall safety and soundness are adversely affected by an inability, or perceived inability, to meet obligations and support business
growth. Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed processes, people or systems, external events (i.e., natural disasters) or compliance,
reputational or legal matters and includes those risks as they relate directly to us as well as to third parties with whom we contract or otherwise do business.
Strategic risk is the risk from changes in the business environment, improper implementation of decisions or inadequate responsiveness to changes in the business
environment. Reputational risk is the risk arising from negative perception on the part of customers, counterparties, shareholders, investors, rating agencies,
regulators and employees that can adversely affect the Company’s ability to maintain existing talent and customers and establish new business relationships with
continued access to sources of funding. See “Our Business—Credit Risk Management” and “Risks—Risk Management” for additional information on the types of
risks affecting our business.

We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a framework that includes our Risk Appetite Statement, Enterprise Risk Assessment (ERA) process, risk
policies, procedures and controls, reporting requirements, and corporate culture and values in conjunction with the risk management accountability incorporated
into our integrated Risk Management Framework, which includes our governance structure and three distinct Lines of Defense. Management of our risks in some
cases depends upon the use of analytical and/or forecasting models. If the models that we use to manage these risks are ineffective at predicting future losses or
are otherwise inadequate, we may incur unexpected losses or otherwise be adversely affected. In addition, the information we use in managing our credit and other
risk may be inaccurate or incomplete as a result of error or fraud, both of which may be difficult to detect and avoid. There may also be risks that exist, or that
develop in the future, that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated including when processes are changed or new products and services are
introduced. If our Risk Management Framework does not effectively identify and control our risks, we could suffer unexpected losses or be adversely affected, and
that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate key officers and employees.

Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain, recruit and motivate key officers and employees. Our senior management team has significant industry
experience and would be difficult to replace. Competition for senior executives and other key talent in the financial services and payment industry has been intense
and may further increase. We may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other
key personnel, particularly if we do not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest of the labor market. Guidelines issued by the federal banking
regulators prohibits our payment of "excessive" compensation, or compensation that could lead to our material financial loss, to our executives, employees, and
directors. In addition, proposed rules implementing the executive compensation provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act would limit the type and structure of
compensation arrangements that we may enter into with our senior executives and persons deemed "significant risk-takers." These restrictions could negatively
impact our ability to compete with other companies in recruiting, retaining and motivating key personnel. Failure to retain talented senior leadership could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

79

Tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We operate in multiple jurisdictions and we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local governments, and of various foreign
jurisdictions. From time to time legislative initiatives may be proposed, which may impact our effective tax rate and could adversely affect our deferred tax assets,
tax positions and/or our tax liabilities. In addition, U.S. federal, state and local, as well as foreign, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to
varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that our historical tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful
in defending our positions in connection with any such challenge.

State sales tax rules and regulations, and their application and interpretation by the respective states, could change and adversely affect our results of
operations.

State sales tax rules and regulations, and their application and interpretation by the respective states, could adversely affect our results of operations. Retailers
collect sales tax from retail customers and remit those collections to the applicable states. When customers fail to repay their loans, including the amount of sales
tax advanced by us to the merchant on their behalf, we are entitled, in some cases, to seek a refund of the amount of sales tax from the applicable state. Sales tax
laws and regulations enacted by the various states are subject to interpretation, and our compliance with such laws is routinely subject to audit and review by the
states. Audit risk is concentrated in several states, and these states are conducting ongoing audits. The outcomes of ongoing and any future audits and changes in
the states’ interpretation of the sales tax laws and regulations involving the recovery of tax on bad debts could materially adversely impact our results of operations.

See “Regulation—Risk Factors Relating to Regulation” on page 97 for additional risk factors.

Risk Management
____________________________________________________________________________________________

Strong risk management is at the core of our business strategy and we have developed processes to manage the major categories of risk, namely credit, market,
liquidity, operational (including compliance) strategic risk and reputational risk (considered across all risk types).

As described in greater detail below under “—Risk Management Roles and Responsibilities,” we manage enterprise risk using an integrated framework that
includes board-level oversight, administration by a group of cross-functional management committees, and day-to-day implementation by a dedicated risk
management team led by the Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”). We also utilize the “Three Lines of Defense” risk management model to demonstrate and structure the
roles, responsibilities and accountabilities in the organization for taking and managing risk. The Risk Committee of the Board of Directors has responsibility for the
oversight of the risk management program, and three other board committees have other oversight roles with respect to risk management. Several management
committees and subcommittees have important roles and responsibilities in administering the risk management program, including the Enterprise Risk
Management Committee (the “ERMC”), the Management Committee (the “MC”), the Asset and Liability Management Committee (the “ALCO”) and the Capital
Management Committee (the “CMC”). This committee-focused governance structure provides a forum through which risk expertise is applied cross-functionally to
all major decisions, including development of policies, processes and controls used by the CRO and risk management team to execute the risk management
philosophy.

The enterprise risk management philosophy is to ensure that all relevant risks are appropriately identified, measured, monitored and controlled. The approach in
executing this philosophy focuses on leveraging risk expertise to drive enterprise risk management using a strong governance framework structure, a
comprehensive enterprise risk assessment program and an effective risk appetite framework.

Risk Categories

Risk management is organized around six major risk categories: credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk (including compliance), strategic risk, and
reputational risk. We evaluate the potential impact of a risk event on us (including subsidiaries) by assessing the partner and customer, financial, reputational, and
legal and regulatory impacts.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk of loss that arises when an obligor fails to meet the terms of a contract and/or the underlying collateral is insufficient to satisfy the obligation.
Credit risk includes exposure to consumer credit risk from customer loans as well as institutional credit risk, principally from our partners. Consumer credit risk is
one of our most significant risks. See “Our Business—Credit Risk Management” for a description of the customer credit risk management procedures.

Market Risk

Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a
position or portfolio. The principal market risk exposures arise from volatility in interest rates and their impact on economic value, capitalization levels and earnings.
Market risk is managed by the ALCO, and is subject to policy and risk appetite limits on sensitivity of both earnings at risk and the economic value of equity. Market
risk metrics are reviewed by ALCO monthly, the Risk Committee on a quarterly basis and the Board of Directors as required.

81

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that an institution’s financial condition or overall safety and soundness are adversely affected by a real or perceived inability to meet
contractual obligations and support planned growth. The primary liquidity objective is to maintain a liquidity profile that will enable us, even in times of stress or
market disruption, to fund our existing assets and meet liabilities in a timely manner and at an acceptable cost. Policy and risk appetite limits require us and the
Bank (and other entities within our business, as applicable) to ensure that sufficient liquid assets are available to survive liquidity stresses over a specified time
period. Our Risk Appetite Statement requires funding diversification, monitoring early warning indicators in the capital markets, and other related limits. ALCO
reviews liquidity exposures continuously in the context of approved policy and risk appetite limits and reports results quarterly to the Risk Committee, and the Board
of Directors as required.

Operational Risk

Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed processes, people or systems, external events (i.e. natural disasters) or compliance,
reputational or legal matters, and includes any of those risks as they relate directly to us and our subsidiaries, as well as to third parties with whom we contract or
otherwise do business. Compliance risk arises from the failure to adhere to applicable laws, rules, regulations and internal policies and procedures. Operational risk
also includes model risk relating to various financial and other models used by us and our subsidiaries, including the Bank, and is subject to a formal governance
process.

Strategic Risk

Strategic risk consists of the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital arising from changes in the business environment and from adverse business
decisions, improper implementation of decisions or lack of responsiveness to changes in the business environment. The New Product Introduction (“NPI”) Sub-
Committee assesses the strategic viability and consistency of each new product or service. All new initiatives require the approval of the NPI Sub-Committee and a
select number of new product requests are escalated to the MC and the Board of Directors, based on level of risk.

Reputational Risk

Reputational risk is the risk arising from negative perception on the part of customers, counterparties, shareholders, investors, rating agencies, regulators and
employees that can adversely affect the Company’s ability to maintain existing talent and customers and establish new business relationships with continued
access to sources of funding.

Risk Management Roles and Responsibilities

Responsibility for risk management flows to individuals and entities throughout our Company, including the Board of Directors, various board and management
committees and senior management. The corporate culture and values, in conjunction with the risk management accountability incorporated into the integrated
Enterprise Risk Governance Framework, which includes governance structure and three distinct Lines of Defense, has facilitated, and will continue to facilitate, the
evolution of an effective risk presence across the Company.

The “First Line of Defense” is comprised of the business areas whose day-to-day activities involve decision-making and associated risk-taking for the Company. As
the business owner, the first line is responsible for identifying, assessing, managing and controlling that risk, and for mitigating our overall risk exposure. The first
line formulates strategy and operates within the risk appetite and risk governance framework. The “Second Line of Defense,” also known as the independent risk
management organization, provides oversight of first line risk taking and management. The second line assists in determining risk capacity, risk appetite, and the
strategies, policies and structure for managing risks. The second line owns the risk governance framework. The “Third Line of Defense” is comprised of Internal
Audit. The third line provides independent and objective assurance to senior management and to the Board of Directors and Audit Committee that the first and
second line risk management and internal control systems and its governance processes are well-designed and working as intended.

Set forth below is a further description of the roles and responsibilities related to the key elements of the Enterprise Risk Governance Framework.

82

Board of Directors

The Board of Directors, among other things, has approved the enterprise-wide Risk Appetite Statement for the Company, as well as certain other risk management
policies and oversees the Company’s strategic plan and enterprise-wide risk management program. The Board of Directors may assign certain risk management
activities to applicable committees and management.

Board Committees

The Board of Directors has established four committees that assist the board in its oversight of risk management. These committees and their risk-related roles are
described below.

Audit Committee

In coordination with the Risk Committees of the Company and the Bank, the Audit Committee’s role, among other things, is to review: (i) the Company’s major
financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control these risks; (ii) the Company’s risk assessment and risk management
practices and the guidelines, policies and processes for risk assessment and risk management; (iii) the organization, performance and audit findings of our internal
audit function; (iv) our public disclosures and effectiveness of internal controls; and (v) the Company’s risk guidelines and policies relating to financial statements,
financial systems, financial reporting processes, compliance and auditing, and allowance for credit losses.

Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee’s role, among other things, is to: (i) review and approve certain transactions with related persons; (ii) review
and resolve any conflict of interest involving directors or executive officers; (iii) oversee the risks, if any, related to corporate governance structure and practices;
and (iv) identify and discuss with management the risks, if any, related to social responsibility actions and public policy initiatives.

Management Development and Compensation Committee

The Management Development and Compensation Committee’s role, among other things, is to: (i) review our incentive compensation arrangements with a view to
appropriately balancing risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose us or any of our subsidiaries to imprudent risks, and
are consistent with safety and soundness; and (ii) review (with input from our CRO and the Bank’s CRO) the relationship between risk management policies and
practices, corporate strategies and senior executive compensation.

83

Risk Committee

The Risk Committee’s role, among other things, is to: (i) assist the Board of Directors in its oversight of the Company’s Enterprise Risk Governance Framework,
including as it relates to credit, investment, market, liquidity, operational compliance strategic and reputational risks; (ii) review and, at least annually, approve the
Company’s Enterprise Risk Governance Framework and risk assessment and risk management practices, guidelines and policies (including significant policies that
management uses to manage credit and investment, market, liquidity, operational, compliance and strategic risks); (iii) review and, at least annually, recommend to
the Board of Directors for approval the Company’s enterprise-wide risk appetite (including the Company’s liquidity risk tolerance), and review and approve the
Company’s strategy relating to managing key risks and other policies on the establishment of risk limits as well as the guidelines, policies and processes for
monitoring and mitigating such risks; (iv) meet separately on a regular basis with our CRO and (in coordination with the Bank’s Risk Committee, as appropriate) the
Bank’s CRO; (v) receive periodic reports from management on metrics used to measure, monitor and manage known and emerging risks, including management’s
view on acceptable and appropriate levels of exposure; (vi) receive reports from our internal audit, risk management and independent liquidity review functions on
the results of risk management reviews and assessments; (vii) review and approve, at least annually, the Company’s enterprise-wide capital and liquidity
framework (including its contingency funding plan) and, in coordination with the Bank’s Risk Committee, review, at least quarterly, the Bank’s, liquidity risk appetite,
regulatory capital and ratios and internal capital adequacy assessment processes and, at least annually, the Bank’s allowance for credit losses methodology,
annual capital plan and resolution plan; (viii) review, at least semi-annually, information from senior management regarding whether the Company is operating
within its established risk appetite; (ix) review the status of financial services regulatory examinations; (x) review the independence, authority and effectiveness of
the Company’s risk management function and independent liquidity review function; (xi) approve the appointment of, evaluate and, when appropriate, replace, the
CRO; and (xii) review disclosure regarding risk contained in the Company’s annual and quarterly reports.

Management Committees

There are four management committees with important roles and responsibilities in the risk management function: the MC, the ERMC, the ALCO and the CMC.
These committees and their risk-related roles are described below.

Management Committee

The MC is under the oversight of the Board of Directors and is comprised of our senior executives and chaired by our Chief Executive Officer. The MC has
responsibility for reviewing and approving lending and investment activities of the Company, such as equity investments, acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures,
portfolio deals and investment issues regarding the Company. It is also responsible for overseeing the Company’s approach to managing its investments, reviewing
and approving the Company’s annual strategic plan and annual operating plan, and overseeing activities administered by its Credit, Culture, Information
Technology, New Product Introduction, Investment Review and Pricing subcommittees. The MC also reviews management reports provided on a periodic basis, or
as requested, in order to monitor evolving issues, effectiveness of risk mitigation activities and performance against strategic plans. The MC may make decisions
only within the authority that is granted to it by the Board of Directors and must escalate any investment or other proposals outside of its authority to the Board of
Directors for final decision.

ERMC

The ERMC is a management committee under the oversight of the Risk Committee and is comprised of senior executives and chaired by the CRO. The ERMC has
responsibility for risk oversight across the Company and for reporting on material risks to our Risk Committee. The responsibilities of the ERMC include the day-to-
day oversight of risks impacting the Company, establishing a risk appetite statement and ensuring compliance across the Company with the overall risk appetite.
The ERMC also oversees establishment of risk management policies, the performance and functioning of the relevant overall risk management function, and the
implementation of appropriate governance activities and systems that support control of risks.

84

ALCO

The ALCO is a management committee under the oversight of the Risk Committee and is comprised of our senior executives and chaired by the Treasurer. It
identifies, measures, monitors, manages and controls market, liquidity and credit (investments and bank relationships) risks to the Company’s balance sheet. ALCO
activities include reviewing and monitoring cash management, investments, liquidity, funding and foreign exchange risk activities and overseeing the safe, sound
and efficient operation of the Company in compliance with applicable policies, laws and regulations.

CMC

The CMC is a management committee under the oversight of the Risk Committee and is comprised of our senior executives and chaired by the SVP, Capital
Management and Stress Testing. The CMC provides oversight of the Company’s capital management, stress testing, and recovery and resolution planning
activities. The CMC supports the Risk Committee in overseeing capital management activities such as the Annual Capital Plan, the Internal Capital Adequacy
Assessment Process, stress testing, the Pre-Provision Net Revenue and Credit Loss Methodologies, the Contingent Capital Plan as needed in the event of a
breach, and the Recovery and Resolution Planning Process.

Chief Executive Officer, Chief Risk Officer and Other Senior Officers

The Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) has ultimate responsibility for ensuring the management of the Company’s risk in accordance with the Company’s approved
risk appetite statement, including through their role as chairperson of the MC. The CEO also provides leadership in communicating the risk appetite to internal and
external stakeholders to help embed appropriate risk taking into the overall corporate culture of the Company.

The CRO manages our risk management team and, as chairperson of the ERMC, is responsible for establishing and implementing standards for the identification,
management, measurement, monitoring and reporting of risk on an enterprise-wide basis. In collaboration with our CEO and the Chief Financial Officer, the CRO
has responsibility for developing an appropriate risk appetite with corresponding limits that aligns with supervisory expectations, and this risk appetite statement
has been approved by the Board of Directors. The CRO regularly reports to the Board of Directors and the Risk Committee on risk management matters.

The senior executive officers who serve as leaders in the “First Line of Defense,” are responsible for ensuring that their respective functions operate within
established risk limits, in accordance with the Company’s Risk Appetite Statement. As members of the ERMC and the MC, they are also responsible for identifying
risks, considering risk when developing strategic plans, budgets and new products and implementing appropriate risk controls when pursuing business strategies
and objectives. In addition, senior executive officers are responsible for deploying sufficient financial resources and qualified personnel to manage the risks
inherent in the Company’s business activities.

Risk Management

The risk management team, including compliance, led by the CRO, provides oversight of our risk profile and is responsible for maintaining a compliance program
that includes compliance risk assessment, policy development, testing and reporting activities. This team effectively serves in a “Second Line of Defense” role by
overseeing the operating activities of the “First Line of Defense.”

Internal Audit Team

The internal audit team is responsible for performing periodic, independent reviews and testing of compliance with the Company’s and the Bank’s risk management
policies and standards, as well as with regulatory guidance and industry best practices. The internal audit team also assesses the design of the Company's and the
Bank's policies and standards and validates the effectiveness of risk management controls, and reports the results of such reviews to the Audit Committee. The
internal audit team effectively serves as the “Third Line of Defense” for the Company.

85

Enterprise Risk Assessment Process

The Enterprise Risk Assessment process (“ERA”) is a top-down process designed to identify, assess and quantify risk across the Company’s primary risk
categories and serves as a basis to determine the Company’s risk profile. The Enterprise Risk Management team, in collaboration with the Risk Pillar leaders,
performs an independent ERA using a methodology that measures likelihood, impact, vulnerability and the speed of onset to rate risks across Synchrony. The ERA
plays an important role in directing the risk management activities by helping prioritize initiatives and focus resources on the most appropriate risks. The ERA is
performed annually and refreshed periodically, and is the basis of the Material Risk Inventory which is a key input in the strategic and capital planning processes.

Stress testing activities provide a forward-looking assessment of risks and losses. Stress testing is integrated into the strategic, capital and liquidity planning
processes, and the results are used to identify portfolio vulnerabilities and develop risk mitigation strategies or contingency plans across a range of stressed
conditions.

Risk Appetite Framework

We operate in accordance with a Risk Appetite Statement setting forth objectives, plans and limits, and expressing preferences with respect to risk-taking activities
in the context of overall business goals. The risk appetite statement is approved annually by the Board of Directors, with delegated authority to the CRO for
implementation throughout the Company. The Risk Appetite Statement serves as a tool to preclude activities that are inconsistent with the business and risk
strategy. The Risk Appetite Statement is reviewed and approved at least annually as part of the business planning process and will be modified, as necessary, to
include updated risk tolerances by risk category, enabling us to meet prescribed goals while continuing to operate within established risk boundaries.

86

REGULATION

Regulation Relating to Our Business
____________________________________________________________________________________________

Our business, including our relationships with our customers, is subject to regulation, supervision and examination under U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and
regulations. These laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business, including lending and collection practices, treatment of our customers, safeguarding
deposits, customer privacy and information security, capital structure, liquidity, dividends and other capital distributions, transactions with affiliates and conduct and
qualifications of personnel. Such laws and regulations directly and indirectly affect key drivers of our profitability, including, for example, capital and liquidity, product
offerings, risk management, and costs of compliance. As a savings and loan holding company and financial holding company, Synchrony is subject to regulation,
supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. As a large provider of consumer financial services, we are also subject to regulation, supervision and
examination by the CFPB. The Bank is a federally chartered savings association. As such, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the
OCC, which is its primary regulator, and by the CFPB. In addition, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is supervised by the FDIC. The Dodd-Frank Act
and regulations promulgated thereunder have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. As
a result, the extensive laws and regulations to which we are subject and with which we must comply significantly impact our earnings, results of operations,
financial condition and competitive position. The impact of such regulations on our business is discussed further below, as well as in “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (MD&A) and “Risk Factors Relating to Regulation” of this Form 10-K Report.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Related Developments

The Dodd-Frank Act, which was enacted in 2010, significantly restructured the financial regulatory regime in the United States. Certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank
Act are subject to rules that have been taking effect over several years or have been revised since their initial adoption.

On May 24, 2018, the President signed into law the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (“EGRRCPA”), which amended the Dodd-
Frank Act and modified certain post-crisis regulatory requirements. On October 10, 2019, the Federal Reserve Board, OCC, and FDIC issued final rules, which we
refer to as the Tailoring Rules, that tailor the applicability of the Federal Reserve Board’s enhanced prudential standards relating to capital liquidity, and other risk
management matters, and apply certain of these standards to savings and loan holding companies (other than those substantially engaged in insurance
underwriting or commercial activities) that have total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more based on the average of the previous four quarters, referred to as
“covered savings and loan holding companies.” Synchrony had average total consolidated assets of $93.9 billion for the four quarters ended December 31, 2021
and less than $100 billion in total consolidated assets for each of those quarters. As a result, Synchrony is not currently subject to most of the enhanced prudential
standards under the Tailoring Rules. However, Synchrony’s average total consolidated assets have exceeded $100 billion in the past and may exceed such
threshold again in future periods. If in the future Synchrony has average total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more based on a four quarter average, it will
become subject to enhanced prudential standards following applicable transition periods.

The ongoing implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the recent and possible future changes to the regulatory framework applicable to Synchrony and the
Bank make it difficult to assess the overall financial impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulatory developments on us and across the industry. See also
“Regulation—Risk Factors Relating to Regulation—The Dodd-Frank Act and other legislative and regulatory developments have had, and may continue to have, a
significant impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.”

87

Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation

Overview

As a savings and loan holding company, we are required to register and file periodic reports with, and are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by, the
Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards on such matters as liquidity risk
management, securitizations, operational risk management, internal controls and audit systems, business continuity, and compensation and other employee
benefits. We are regularly reviewed and examined by the Federal Reserve Board, which results in supervisory comments and directions relating to many aspects of
our business that require our response and attention.

The Federal Reserve Board has broad enforcement authority over us and our subsidiaries (other than the Bank and its subsidiaries). Under the Dodd-Frank Act,
we are required to serve as a source of financial strength for any insured depository institution that we control, such as the Bank.

Capital

As a savings and loan holding company, Synchrony is subject to capital requirements.

The following are the minimum capital ratios to which Synchrony is subject:

•

•

under the Basel III standardized approach, a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 7% (the minimum of 4.5% plus a capital
conservation buffer of 2.5%), a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.5% (the minimum of 6% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%), and a
total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10.5% (a minimum of 8% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%); and

a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total consolidated assets of 4%.

For a discussion of our capital ratios at December 31, 2021, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-
Capital.”

Synchrony and the Bank elected to delay until January 1, 2022 and phase in through December 31, 2024 the impact of CECL on their regulatory capital. See “—
Legislative and Regulatory Developments” for additional information.

Under the Tailoring Rules, most covered savings and loan holding companies with average total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more, but less than $250
billion, are subject to supervisory stress tests on a biennial basis, in even calendar years. If in the future Synchrony has average total consolidated assets of $100
billion or more based on a four quarter average, it will become subject to these stress tests following a transition period of at least five quarters.

Additionally, under a final rule issued on January 19, 2021, the Federal Reserve Board has subjected covered savings and loan holding companies with average
total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more to a stress capital buffer in lieu of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer. The stress capital buffer is calculated as the
amount of loss of common equity Tier 1 capital incurred by the company in the severely adverse scenario of the most recent supervisory stress test exercise,
assuming certain continued payments on capital instruments, and is subject to a floor of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. If in the future Synchrony has average total
consolidated assets of $100 billion or more based on a four quarter average, it will become subject to the stress capital buffer, and as a result, its capital
requirements may increase and its ability to pay dividends, make other capital distributions, or redeem or repurchase its stock may be adversely impacted. See “—
Legislative and Regulatory Developments” for additional information.

88

Dividends and Stock Repurchases

We are limited in our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock by the Federal Reserve Board, including on the basis that doing so would be an unsafe or
unsound banking practice. Where we intend to declare or pay a dividend or repurchase our stock, we are expected to inform and consult with the Federal Reserve
Board in advance to ensure that such dividend or repurchase does not raise supervisory concerns. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve Board that a savings and
loan holding company like us should generally pay dividends on common stock and preferred stock out of earnings, and only if prospective earnings retention is
consistent with the company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition.

According to guidance from the Federal Reserve Board, our dividend policies will be assessed against, among other things, our ability to achieve applicable Basel
III capital ratio requirements. If we do not achieve applicable Basel III capital ratio requirements, we may not be able to pay dividends. Although we currently expect
to meet applicable Basel III capital ratio requirements, inclusive of the capital conservation buffer, we cannot be sure that we will meet those requirements or that
even if we do, if we will be able to pay dividends.

In evaluating the appropriateness of a proposed redemption or repurchase of stock, the Federal Reserve Board will consider, among other things, the potential loss
that we may suffer from the prospective need to increase reserves and write down assets as a result of continued asset deterioration, and our ability to raise
additional common equity and other capital to replace the stock that will be redeemed or repurchased. The Federal Reserve Board also will consider the potential
negative effects on our capital structure of replacing common stock with any lower-tier form of regulatory capital issued. Moreover, regulatory review of any capital
plan we are currently required to submit could result in restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make other capital distributions. See “Regulation—Risk Factors
Relating to Regulation—Failure by Synchrony and the Bank to meet applicable capital adequacy and liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on
us” and “—We are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock; the Bank is subject to restrictions that limit its
ability to pay dividends to us, which could limit our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our common stock or make payments on our indebtedness.”

Under a final rule issued on January 19, 2021, the Federal Reserve Board has subjected covered savings and loan holding companies with average total
consolidated assets of $100 billion or more to formal capital plan submission requirements. If in the future Synchrony has average total consolidated assets of $100
billion or more based on a four quarter average, it will become subject to formal capital plan submission requirements, and as a result, its capital requirements may
increase and its ability to pay dividends, make other capital distributions, or redeem or repurchase its stock may be adversely impacted. See “—Legislative and
Regulatory Developments” for additional information.

Liquidity

Under the Tailoring Rules, covered savings and loan holding companies with average total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more must comply with enhanced
prudential standards with respect to liquidity management, including maintaining diversified liquidity buffers and regularly conducting liquidity stress tests. If in the
future Synchrony has average total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more based on a four quarter average, it will become subject to these enhanced
prudential standards following a transition period of five quarters.

Activities

In general, savings and loan holding companies may only conduct, or acquire control of companies engaged in, financial activities as permitted under the relevant
provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act and the Home Owners' Loan Act (“HOLA”). Savings and loan holding companies that have elected financial holding
company status generally can engage in a broader range of financial activities than are otherwise permissible for savings and loan holding companies, including
securities underwriting, dealing and making markets in securities, and making merchant banking investments in non-financial companies. Synchrony has elected
for financial holding company status.

89

The Federal Reserve Board has the authority to limit a financial holding company’s ability to conduct otherwise permissible activities if the financial holding
company or any of its depositary institution subsidiaries ceases to meet the applicable eligibility requirements, including requirements that the financial holding
company and each of its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries maintain their status as “well-capitalized” and “well-managed.” The Federal Reserve Board may
also impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements on the financial holding company and may, for example, require divestiture of the holding company’s
depository institutions if the deficiencies persist. Federal regulations additionally provide that if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company
fails to maintain at least a “Satisfactory” rating under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), the financial holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited
from engaging in additional activities that are permissible only for financial holding companies.

In addition, we are subject to banking laws and regulations that limit in certain respects the types of acquisitions and investments that we can make. For example,
certain acquisitions of and investments in depository institutions or their holding companies that we may undertake are subject to the prior review and approval of
our banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the FDIC. Our banking regulators have broad discretion on whether to approve such
acquisitions and investments. In deciding whether to approve a proposed acquisition or investment, federal bank regulators may consider, among other factors: (i)
the effect of the acquisition or investment on competition, (ii) our financial condition and future prospects, including current and projected capital ratios and levels,
(iii) the competence, experience and integrity of our management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations, (iv) the convenience and needs of the
communities to be served, including our record of compliance under the CRA, (v) our effectiveness in combating money laundering, and (vi) any risks that the
proposed acquisition poses to the U.S. banking or financial system.

Certain acquisitions of our voting stock may be subject to regulatory approval or notice under federal law. Investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not,
directly or indirectly, acquire shares of our stock in excess of the amount that can be acquired without regulatory approval under the Change in Bank Control Act
and the HOLA, which prohibit any person or company from acquiring control of us without, in most cases, the prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board.

Savings Association Regulation

Overview

The Bank is required to file periodic reports with the OCC and is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the OCC, the FDIC, and the CFPB. The
OCC has adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards on such matters as loan underwriting and documentation, asset quality, earnings,
internal controls and audit systems, risk management, interest rate risk exposure and compensation and other employee benefits. The Bank is periodically
examined by the OCC, the FDIC, and the CFPB, which results in supervisory comments and directions relating to many aspects of the Bank’s business that require
the Bank’s response and attention. In addition, the OCC, the FDIC, and the CFPB have broad enforcement authority over the Bank.

Capital

The Bank is required by OCC regulations to maintain specified levels of regulatory capital. Institutions that are not well-capitalized are subject to certain restrictions
on brokered deposits and interest rates on deposits. The OCC is authorized and, under certain circumstances, required to take certain actions against an institution
that fails to meet the minimum ratios for an adequately capitalized institution. At December 31, 2021, the Bank met or exceeded all applicable requirements to be
deemed well-capitalized under OCC regulations.

The following are the minimum capital ratios to which the Bank is subject:

•

•

under the Basel III standardized approach, a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 7% (the minimum of 4.5% plus a capital
conservation buffer of 2.5%), a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.5% (the minimum of 6% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%), and a
total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10.5% (a minimum of 8% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%); and

a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total consolidated assets of 4%.

90

For a discussion of the Bank’s capital ratios, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital.”

As an insured depository institution, the Bank is also subject to the FDIA, which requires, among other things, the federal banking agencies to take “prompt
corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA sets forth the following five capital tiers: “well-
capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” A depository institution’s capital tier will
depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors that are established by regulation. To be well-
capitalized for purposes of the FDIA, the Bank must maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 6.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted
assets ratio of 8%, a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10%, and a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total consolidated assets of 5%, and not be subject to
any written agreement, order or capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the OCC to meet or maintain a specific capital level for any capital
measure. At December 31, 2021, the Bank met or exceeded all applicable requirements to be deemed well-capitalized for purposes of the FDIA.

Dividends and Stock Repurchases

OCC regulations limit the ability of savings associations to make distributions of capital, including payment of dividends, stock redemptions and repurchases, cash-
out mergers and other transactions charged to the capital account. The Bank must obtain the OCC’s approval or give the OCC prior notice before making a capital
distribution in certain circumstances, including if the Bank proposes to make a capital distribution when it does not meet certain capital requirements (or will not do
so as a result of the proposed capital distribution) or certain net income requirements. In addition, the Bank must file a prior written notice of a planned or declared
dividend or other distribution with the Federal Reserve Board. The OCC or the Federal Reserve Board may object to a capital distribution if: among other things, (i)
the Bank is, or as a result of such distribution would be, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized, (ii) the regulators have safety
and soundness concerns or (iii) the distribution violates a prohibition in a statute, regulation, agreement between us and the OCC or the Federal Reserve Board, or
a condition imposed on us in an application or notice approved by the OCC or the Federal Reserve Board. Additional restrictions on dividends apply if the Bank
fails the QTL test (described below under “—Activities”).

The FDIA also prohibits any insured depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to
its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be “undercapitalized.” If a depository institution is less than adequately capitalized, it must
prepare and submit a capital restoration plan to its primary federal regulator for approval. For a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, among other things, the
depository institution’s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with the capital restoration plan. If a depository institution fails to
submit an acceptable capital restoration plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” A “significantly undercapitalized” depository institution may be
subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become “adequately capitalized,” elect a new Board of
Directors, reduce total assets or cease taking deposits from correspondent banks. A “critically undercapitalized” institution may be subject to the appointment of a
conservator or receiver which could sell or liquidate the institution, be required to refrain from making payments on its subordinated debt, or be subject to additional
restrictions on its activities.

Liquidity

The Bank is required to comply with prudential regulation in connection with liquidity. In particular, under OCC guidelines establishing heightened standards for
governance and risk management (the “Heightened Standards”), the Bank is required to establish liquidity stress testing and planning processes, which the Bank
has done. For a discussion of the Heightened Standards, see “—Heightened Standards for Risk Management Governance” below.

91

Activities

Under HOLA, the OCC requires the Bank to comply with the qualified thrift lender, or “QTL” test. Under the QTL test, the Bank is required to maintain at least 65%
of its “portfolio assets” (total assets less (i) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, (ii) intangibles, including goodwill and (iii) the value of property used to
conduct business) in certain “qualified thrift investments” (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including certain mortgage-backed securities,
credit card loans, student loans and small business loans) in at least nine months of the most recent 12-month period. The Bank currently meets that test. A
savings association that fails to meet the QTL test is subject to certain operating restrictions and may be required to convert to a national bank charter.

Savings associations, including the Bank, are subject to limitations on their lending and investments. These limitations include percentage of asset limitations on
various types of loans the Bank may make. In addition, there are similar limitations on the types and amounts of investments the Bank may make.

Insured depository institutions, including the Bank, are subject to restrictions under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (as implemented by Federal
Reserve Board Regulation W), which govern transactions between an insured depository institution and an affiliate, including an entity that is the institution’s direct
or indirect holding company and a nonbank subsidiary of such a holding company. Restrictions in Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act apply to
“covered transactions” such as extensions of credit, issuances of guarantees or asset purchases. In general, these restrictions require that any extensions of credit
made by the insured depository institution to an affiliate must be fully secured with qualifying collateral and that the aggregate amount of covered transactions is
limited, as to any one affiliate of the Bank, to 10% of the Bank’s capital stock and surplus, and, as to all of the Bank’s affiliates in the aggregate, to 20% of the
Bank’s capital stock and surplus. In addition, transactions between the Bank and its affiliates must be on terms and conditions that are, or in good faith would be,
offered by the Bank to non-affiliated companies (i.e., at arm’s length).

The CRA is a federal law that generally requires an insured depository institution to identify the communities it serves and to make loans and investments, offer
products and provide services, in each case designed to meet the credit needs of these communities. The CRA also requires an institution to maintain
comprehensive records of CRA activities to demonstrate how it is meeting the credit needs of communities. These records are subject to periodic examination by
the responsible federal banking agency of the institution. Based on these examinations, the agency rates the institution’s compliance with CRA as “Outstanding,”
“Satisfactory,” “Needs to Improve” or “Substantial Noncompliance.” The CRA requires the agency to take into account the record of an institution in meeting the
credit needs of the entire communities served, including low- and moderate- income neighborhoods, in determining such rating. Failure of an institution to receive
at least a “Satisfactory” rating could inhibit the institution or its holding company from undertaking certain activities, including acquisitions. The Bank is currently
designated as a Limited Purpose bank under the CRA and therefore is generally evaluated on the basis of its community development activity in the geographies in
which its physical facilities are located. The Bank received a CRA rating of “Outstanding” as of its most recent CRA examination.

On December 15, 2021, the OCC adopted a final rule, which took effect on January 1, 2022, to rescind changes to the OCC’s CRA regulations that the agency had
adopted in June 2020 and to restore the CRA standards that previously applied to OCC-regulated institutions. The federal banking agencies have indicated their
intent to engage in an interagency rulemaking process to modernize the CRA regulatory framework.

The FDIA prohibits insured banks from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the
bank’s normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited) unless it is “well-capitalized,” or it is “adequately capitalized” and
receives a waiver from the FDIC. A bank that is “adequately capitalized” and that accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the FDIC may not pay an interest
rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates. There are no such restrictions under the FDIA on a bank that is “well-
capitalized.” Further, “undercapitalized” institutions are subject to growth limitations. At December 31, 2021, the Bank met or exceeded all applicable requirements
to be deemed well-capitalized for purposes of the FDIA. An inability to accept brokered deposits in the future could materially adversely impact our funding costs
and liquidity.

92

On December 15, 2020, the FDIC issued a final rule to revise and clarify its framework for classifying deposits as brokered deposits, including the standards for
determining whether a person is a “deposit broker” and satisfies the “primary purpose” exemption from that definition. The final rule has not had a material impact
on the Bank in 2021.

Deposit Insurance

The FDIA requires the Bank to pay deposit insurance assessments. Deposit insurance assessments are affected by the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the
federal Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”). The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the DIF to 1.35% and removed the statutory
cap on the reserve ratio. The FDIC subsequently adopted a designated ratio of 2% and may increase that ratio in the future. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19
pandemic, the amount of total estimated insured deposits has grown very rapidly while the funds in the DIF have grown at a normal rate, causing the DIF reserve
ratio to fall below the statutory minimum of 1.35%. The FDIC adopted a restoration plan on September 15, 2020, to restore the DIF reserve ratio to at least 1.35%
by September 30, 2028. Under the restoration plan, the FDIC will continue to closely monitor the factors that affect the DIF reserve ratio and maintain its current
schedule of assessment rates.

Under the FDIC’s current deposit insurance assessment methodology, the Bank is required to pay deposit insurance assessments based on its average
consolidated total assets, less average tangible equity, and various other regulatory factors included in an FDIC assessment scorecard.

The FDIA creates a depositor preference regime for the resolution of all insured depository institutions, including the Bank. If any such institution is placed into
receivership, the FDIC will pay (out of the remaining net assets of the failed institution and only to the extent of such assets) first secured creditors (to the extent of
their security), second the administrative expenses of the receivership, third all deposits liabilities (both insured and uninsured), fourth any other general or senior
liabilities, fifth any obligations subordinated to depositors or general creditors, and finally any remaining net assets to shareholders in that capacity.

Resolution Planning

Under FDIC regulations, an insured depository institution with $50 billion or more in total assets is required annually to submit to the FDIC a plan for the institution’s
resolution in the event of its failure. The plan is designed to enable the FDIC, if appointed receiver for the institution, to resolve the institution under sections 11 and
13 of the FDIA in a manner that ensures that its depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the institution's failure (two business
days if the failure occurs on a day other than Friday), maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of the institution’s assets, and minimizes
the amount of any loss realized by the creditors in the resolution. The resolution plan requirement is intended to ensure that the FDIC has access to all of the
material information it needs to resolve a large insured depository institution efficiently in the event of its failure. Under a moratorium that has been in place since
April 2019, the FDIC has suspended requiring resolution plan submissions for insured depository institutions with less than $100 billion in total assets.

Heightened Standards for Risk Management Governance

The OCC’s Heightened Standards establish guidelines for the governance and risk management practices of large OCC-regulated institutions, including the Bank.
These Heightened Standards require covered banks to establish and adhere to a written governance framework in order to manage and control their risk-taking
activities, provide standards for covered banks’ boards of directors to oversee the risk governance framework, and describe the appropriate risk management roles
and responsibilities of front line units, independent risk management, and internal audit functions. The Bank believes it complies with the Heightened Standards.

Consumer Financial Services Regulation

The relationship between us and our U.S. customers is regulated under federal and state consumer protection laws. Federal laws include the Truth in Lending Act,
the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, HOLA, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the “FCRA”), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the “GLBA”), the CARD Act and the Dodd-Frank
Act. These and other federal laws, among other things, require disclosures of the cost of credit, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit
transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, provide financial privacy protections, require safe and sound banking operations, prohibit unfair,
deceptive and abusive practices, restrict our ability to raise interest rates on certain credit card balances, and subject us to substantial regulatory oversight. State
and, in some cases, local laws also may regulate the relationship between us and our U.S. customers in these areas, as well as in the areas of collection practices,
and may provide additional consumer protections. Moreover, we are subject to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, which protects persons called to active military
service and their dependents from undue hardship resulting from their military service, and the Military Lending Act (the “MLA”), which extends specific protections
if an account holder, at the time of account opening, is a covered active duty member of the military or certain family members thereof. The Servicemembers Civil
Relief Act applies to all debts incurred prior to the commencement of active duty (including credit card and other open-end debt) and limits the amount of interest,
including service and renewal charges and any other fees or charges (other than bona fide insurance) that are related to the obligation or liability. The MLA applies
to certain consumer loans, including credit extended pursuant to a credit card account, and extends specific protections if an account holder, at the time of account
opening, is a covered active duty member of the military or certain family members thereof (collectively, the “covered borrowers”). These protections include, but
are not limited to: a limit on the military annual percentage rate that can be charged to 36%, delivery of certain required disclosures and a prohibition on mandatory
arbitration agreements. If we were to extend credit to a covered borrower without complying with certain MLA provisions, the credit card agreement could be void
from its inception.

Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages,
restitution and attorneys’ fees. Federal banking regulators, as well as state attorneys general and other state and local consumer protection agencies, also may
seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including civil money penalties and fines.

The CARD Act, which was enacted in 2009, amended the Truth in Lending Act and required us to make significant changes to many of our business practices,
including marketing, underwriting, pricing and billing. The CARD Act’s restrictions on our ability to increase interest rates on existing balances to respond to market
conditions and credit risk ultimately limits our ability to extend credit to new customers and provide additional credit to current customers. Other CARD Act
restrictions, such as limitations on late fees, have resulted and will continue to result in reduced interest income and loan fee income.

The FCRA regulates our use of credit reports and the reporting of information to credit reporting agencies, and also provides a standard for lenders to share
information with affiliates and certain third parties and to provide firm offers of credit to consumers. The FCRA also places further restrictions on the use of
information shared between affiliates for marketing purposes, requires the provision of disclosures to consumers when risk-based pricing is used in a credit
decision, and requires safeguards to help protect consumers from identity theft.

Under HOLA, the Bank is prohibited from engaging in certain tying or reciprocity arrangements with its customers. In general, the Bank may not extend credit,
lease or sell property, or furnish any services or fix or vary the consideration for these on the condition that: (i) the customer obtain or provide some additional
credit, property, or services from or to the Bank or Synchrony or their subsidiaries or (ii) the customer may not obtain some other credit, property, or services from a
competitor, except in each case to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended. Certain arrangements are
permissible. For example, the Bank may offer more favorable terms if a customer obtains two or more traditional bank products.

94

The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which regulates consumer financial products and services and certain financial services providers. The CFPB is
authorized to prevent “unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices” and ensure consistent enforcement of laws so that all consumers have access to markets for
consumer financial products and services that are fair, transparent and competitive. The CFPB has rulemaking and interpretive authority under the Dodd-Frank Act
and other federal consumer financial services laws, as well as broad supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over large providers of consumer financial
products and services, such as us. In addition, the CFPB has an online complaint system that allows consumers to log complaints with respect to various consumer
finance products, including the products we offer. The system could inform future agency decisions with respect to regulatory, enforcement or examination focus.
There continues to be uncertainty as to how the CFPB’s strategies and priorities will impact our business and our results of operations going forward. See
“Regulation—Risk Factors Relating to Regulation—There continues to be uncertainty as to how the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s actions will impact our
business; the agency’s actions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business.”

Privacy, Information Security, and Data Protection

We are subject to various privacy, information security and data protection laws, including requirements concerning security breach notification. For example, in the
United States, certain of our businesses are subject to the GLBA and implementing regulations and guidance. Among other things, the GLBA: (i) imposes certain
limitations on the ability of financial institutions to share consumers’ nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties, (ii) requires that financial
institutions provide certain disclosures to consumers about their information collection, sharing and security practices and affords customers the right to “opt out” of
the institution’s disclosure of their personal financial information to nonaffiliated third parties (with certain exceptions) and (iii) requires financial institutions to
develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution’s size
and complexity, the nature and scope of the financial institution’s activities, the sensitivity of customer information processed by the financial institution as well as
plans for responding to data security breaches.

Federal and state laws also require us to respond appropriately to data security breaches.

A final rule that the federal banking agencies issued in November 2021 requires banking organizations to notify their primary federal regulator of significant
computer security incidents within 36 hours of determining that such an incident has occurred. The compliance date of this rule is May 1, 2022.

In 2018, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). The CCPA requires covered businesses to comply with requirements that
give consumers the right to know what information is being collected from them and whether such information is sold or disclosed to third parties. The statute also
allows consumers to access, delete, and prevent the sale of personal information that has been collected by covered businesses in certain circumstances. The
CCPA does not apply to personal information collected, processed, sold, or disclosed pursuant to the GLBA or the California Financial Information Privacy Act. We
believe we are a covered business under the CCPA. The CCPA became effective on January 1, 2020. While we are continuing to evaluate the potential impact of
the CCPA on our business, the CCPA could increase our costs.

We have a program to comply with applicable privacy, information security, and data protection requirements imposed by federal, state, and foreign laws. However,
if we experience a significant cybersecurity incident or our regulators deemed our information security controls to be inadequate, we could be subject to supervisory
criticism or penalties, and/or suffer reputational harm.

See also “Regulation—Risk Factors Relating to Regulation—Regulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs,
affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and adversely affect our business opportunities.”

95

Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Program

We maintain an enterprise-wide program designed to enable us to comply with all applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws and
regulations, including, but not limited to, the Bank Secrecy Act and the Patriot Act. This program includes policies, procedures, processes and other internal
controls designed to identify, monitor, manage and mitigate the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing posed by our products, services, customers and
geographic locale. These controls include procedures and processes to detect and report suspicious transactions, perform customer due diligence, respond to
requests from law enforcement, identify and verify a legal entity customer’s beneficial owner(s) at the time a new account is opened and to understand the nature
and purpose of the customer relationship, and meet all recordkeeping and reporting requirements related to particular transactions involving currency or monetary
instruments. The program is coordinated by a compliance officer, undergoes an annual independent audit to assess its effectiveness, and requires training of
employees.

See “Regulation—Risk Factors Relating to Regulation—Failure to comply with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws could have significant
adverse consequences for us.”

Sanctions Programs

We have a program designed to comply with applicable economic and trade sanctions programs, including those administered and enforced by OFAC. These
sanctions are usually targeted against foreign countries, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers and those believed to be involved in the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction. These regulations generally require either the blocking of accounts or other property of specified entities or individuals, but they may
also require the rejection of certain transactions involving specified entities or individuals. We maintain policies, procedures and other internal controls designed to
comply with these sanctions programs.

Recent Legislative and Regulatory Developments

Under a December 2018 final rule, banking organizations may elect to phase in the regulatory capital effects of the CECL model, the new accounting standard for
credit losses, over three years. On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law, and included a provision that permits financial institutions to defer
temporarily the use of CECL. In a related action, the joint federal bank regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule effective March 31, 2020, that allows banking
organizations that implemented CECL in 2020 to elect to mitigate the effects of the CECL accounting standard on their regulatory capital for two years. This two-
year delay is in addition to the three-year transition period that the agencies had already made available in December 2018. Synchrony and the Bank have elected
to defer the regulatory capital effects of CECL in accordance with the interim final rule, and not to apply the deferral of CECL available under the CARES Act. As a
result, the effects of CECL on Synchrony’s and the Bank’s regulatory capital were delayed through the year 2021, and have begun to be phased-in over a three-
year period from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. Under the March 31, 2020 interim final rule, the amount of adjustments to regulatory capital
deferred until the phase-in period included both the initial impact of a banking organization’s adoption of CECL at January 1, 2020, and 25% of subsequent
changes in its allowance for credit losses during each quarter of the two-year period ended December 31, 2021.

The CARES Act also included a provision that permits a financial institution to elect to suspend temporarily troubled debt restructuring accounting under ASC
Subtopic 310-40 in certain circumstances (“section 4013”). To be eligible under section 4013 of the CARES Act, as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations
Act, 2021, a loan modification must be (1) related to COVID-19; (2) executed on a loan that was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019; and (3)
executed between March 1, 2020, and the earlier of (A) 60 days after the date of termination of the National Emergency or (B) January 1, 2022. In response to this
section of the CARES Act, the federal banking agencies, in consultation with the Financial Accounting Standards Board, issued a revised interagency statement on
April 7, 2020, that confirms that for loans not subject to section 4013, short-term modifications made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 are not
considered troubled debt restructurings under ASC Subtopic 310-40. Modifications covered under the interagency statement include delays in payment that are
insignificant or short-term (e.g., up to six months) modifications such as payment deferrals, fee waivers, and extensions of repayment terms to borrowers that were
current prior to any relief. Borrowers considered current are those that are less than 30 days past due on their contractual payments at the time a modification
program is implemented.

96

The CARES Act included a range of other provisions designed to support the U.S. economy and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on financial
institutions and their customers, including through the authorization of various programs and measures to be implemented by the U.S. Department of the Treasury,
the Small Business Administration, and the Federal Reserve Board. Further, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve Board implemented a
number of facilities to provide emergency liquidity to various segments of the U.S. economy and financial markets. Additionally, on March 15, 2020, in response to
the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve Board reduced reserve requirements for insured depository institutions to zero percent.

On January 19, 2021, the Federal Reserve Board issued a final rule to subject covered savings and loan holding companies with average total consolidated assets
of $100 billion or more to formal capital plan submission requirements and to the stress capital buffer in lieu of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer. The stress
capital buffer is calculated as the amount of loss of common equity Tier 1 capital incurred by the company in the severely adverse scenario of the most recent
supervisory stress test exercise, assuming certain continued payments on capital instruments, and is subject to a floor of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. If in the
future Synchrony has average total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more based on a four quarter average, it will become subject to formal capital plan
submission requirements and the stress capital buffer, and as a result, its capital requirements may increase and its ability to pay dividends, make other capital
distributions, or redeem or repurchase its stock may be impacted.

Risk Factors Relating to Regulation
____________________________________________________________________________________________

The following discussion of risk factors contains “forward-looking statements,” as discussed in “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” These
risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be read in
conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (MD&A), the consolidated financial statements and
related notes in “Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and “Risk Factors Relating to Our Business” of this Form 10-K Report.

Regulatory Risks

Our business is subject to government regulation, supervision, examination and enforcement, which could adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

Our business, including our relationships with our customers, is subject to regulation, supervision and examination under U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and
regulations. These laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business, including lending and collection practices, treatment of our customers, safeguarding
deposits, customer privacy and information security, capital structure, liquidity, dividends and other capital distributions, transactions with affiliates and conduct and
qualifications of personnel. As a savings and loan holding company and financial holding company, Synchrony is subject to regulation, supervision and examination
by the Federal Reserve Board. As a large provider of consumer financial services, we are also subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the CFPB. The
Bank is a federally chartered savings association. As such, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC, which is its primary
regulator, and by the CFPB. In addition, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is supervised by the FDIC. We, including the Bank, are regularly reviewed
and examined by our respective regulators, which results in supervisory comments and directions relating to many aspects of our business that require response
and attention. See “Regulation” for more information about the regulations applicable to us.

97

Banking laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect consumers, federally insured deposits, the DIF and the banking system as a whole, and not intended
to protect our stockholders, noteholders or creditors. If we (or our service providers, including our partners) fail to satisfy applicable laws and regulations, our
respective regulators have broad discretion to enforce those laws and regulations, including with respect to the operation of our business, required capital levels,
payment of dividends and other capital distributions, engaging in certain activities and making acquisitions and investments. Our regulators also have broad
discretion with respect to the manner in which they enforce applicable laws and regulations, including through enforcement actions that could subject us to civil
money penalties, customer remediation programs, increased compliance costs, and limits or prohibitions on our ability to offer certain products and services or to
engage in certain activities. In addition, to the extent we undertake actions requiring regulatory approval or non-objection, our regulators may make their approval
or non-objection subject to conditions or restrictions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any
other actions taken by our regulators could have a material adverse impact on our business, reputation and brand, results of operations and financial condition.
Moreover, some of our competitors are subject to different, and in some cases less restrictive, statutory and/or regulatory regimes, which may have the effect of
providing them with a competitive advantage over us.

New laws, regulations, policies, or practical changes in enforcement of existing laws, regulations or policies applicable to our business, or our own reexamination of
our current practices, could adversely impact our profitability, limit our ability to continue existing or pursue new business activities, require us to change certain of
our business practices or alter our relationships with customers, affect retention of our key personnel, affect how we interact with our partners and/or service
providers, or expose us to additional costs (including increased compliance costs and/or customer remediation). These changes may also require us to invest
significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial
condition. For example, the CFPB has broad authority over our business and there continues to be uncertainty as to how the CFPB's actions will impact our
business. See “—There continues to be uncertainty as to how the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s actions will impact our business; the agency’s actions
have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business.”

We are also subject to potential enforcement and other actions that may be brought by state attorneys general or other state enforcement authorities and other
governmental agencies. Any such actions could subject us to civil money penalties and fines, customer remediation programs and increased compliance costs, as
well as damage our reputation and brand and limit or prohibit our ability to offer certain products and services or engage in certain business practices. For a
discussion of risks related to actions or proceedings brought by regulatory agencies, see “—Risk Factors Relating to Our Business—Litigation, regulatory actions
and compliance issues could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments, remediation costs and/or requirements resulting in increased expenses.”

The Dodd-Frank Act and other legislative and regulatory developments have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

The Dodd-Frank Act and regulations promulgated thereunder have had, and may continue to have, a significant adverse impact on our business, results of
operations and financial condition. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations restrict certain business practices, impose stringent capital, liquidity
and leverage ratio requirements, as well as additional costs (including increased compliance costs and increased costs of funding raised through the issuance of
asset-backed securities), on us, and impact the value of our assets. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires us to serve as a source of financial strength for any
insured depository institution we control, such as the Bank. Such support may be required by the Federal Reserve Board at times when we might otherwise
determine not to provide it or when doing so is not otherwise in the interest of Synchrony or its stockholders, noteholders or creditors. We describe certain
provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and other legislative and regulatory developments in “Regulation—Regulation Relating to Our Business.”

The EGRRCPA and related regulatory reform initiatives, including the Tailoring Rules, have modified many of the Dodd-Frank Act’s requirements that apply to us.
While certain aspects of these legislative and regulatory changes reduce regulatory burdens for us, other aspects, including the application of enhanced prudential
standards, formal capital plan submission requirements, and the stress capital buffer to large covered savings and loan holding companies, would impose
additional requirements and constraints on us if in the future we had average total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more based on a four quarter average, and
additional rulemaking may impose new capital requirements and limitations on our ability to pay dividends or redeem or repurchase our stock.

98

Further, the ongoing implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act, the recent and possible future changes to the regulatory framework applicable to Synchrony and the
Bank, and additional rulemaking make it difficult to assess the overall financial impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulatory developments on us and across
the industry.

There is ongoing uncertainty as to how the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s actions will impact our business; the agency’s actions have had
and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business.

The CFPB has broad authority over our business. This includes authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws and to enforce those
laws against and examine large financial institutions, such as us, for compliance. The CFPB is authorized to prevent “unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices”
through its regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority. The Federal Reserve Board and the OCC and state government agencies may also invoke their
supervisory and enforcement authorities to prevent unfair and deceptive acts or practices. These federal and state agencies are authorized to remediate violations
of consumer protection laws in a number of ways, including collecting civil money penalties and fines and providing for customer restitution. The CFPB also
engages in consumer financial education, requests data and promotes the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. In addition,
the CFPB maintains an online complaint system that allows consumers to log complaints with respect to various consumer finance products, including the products
we offer. This system could inform future CFPB decisions with respect to its regulatory, enforcement or examination focus.

There is ongoing uncertainty as to how the CFPB’s strategies and priorities, including in both its examination and enforcement processes, will impact our business
and our results of operations going forward. Actions by the CFPB could result in requirements to alter or cease offering affected products and services, including
deferred interest products, making them less attractive to consumers and less profitable to us and also restricting our ability to offer them. In addition, since 2013,
the Bank has entered into two consent orders with the CFPB - one in 2013 (the “2013 CFPB Consent Order”), which required us to provide remediation to certain
customers and to make a number of changes to our CareCredit training, sales, marketing and servicing practices; and another in 2014 (together with the 2013
CFPB Consent Order, the “Consent Orders”) with respect to a debt cancellation product and sales practices and an unrelated issue that arose from the Bank’s self-
identified omission of certain Spanish-speaking customers and customers residing in Puerto Rico from two offers that were made to certain delinquent customers.
The Bank’s resolutions with the CFPB do not preclude other regulators or state attorneys general from seeking additional monetary or injunctive relief with respect
to these or other issues, and any such relief could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Although we have committed significant resources to enhancing our compliance programs, changes by the CFPB in regulatory expectations, interpretations or
practices or interpretations that are different or stricter than ours or those adopted in the past by the CFPB or other regulators could increase the risk of additional
enforcement actions, fines and penalties. Most recently, the CFPB has identified certain areas of concern for consumers, including, for example, the increasing
sophistication of underwriting, fair lending concerns (including in marketing), debt collection, and excessive and/or unexpected fees. Actions by the CFPB with
respect to these or other areas could result in requirements to alter our products and services that may make them less attractive to consumers or less profitable to
us.

Future actions by the CFPB (or other regulators) against us or our competitors that discourage the use of products we offer or suggest to consumers the desirability
of other products or services could result in reputational harm and a loss of customers. If the CFPB changes regulations which it adopted in the past or which were
adopted in the past by other regulators and transferred to the CFPB by the Dodd-Frank Act, or modifies, through supervision or enforcement, past related
regulatory guidance or interprets existing regulations in a different or stricter manner than they have been interpreted in the past by us, the industry or other
regulators, our compliance costs and litigation exposure could increase materially. If future regulatory or legislative restrictions or prohibitions are imposed that
affect our ability to offer promotional financing, including deferred interest, for certain of our products or require us to make significant changes to our business
practices, and we are unable to develop compliant alternatives with acceptable returns, these restrictions or prohibitions could have a material adverse impact on
our business, results of operations and financial condition.

99

The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes state officials to enforce regulations issued by the CFPB and to enforce the Act’s general prohibition against unfair, deceptive or
abusive acts or practices. This could make it more difficult than in the past for federal financial regulators to declare state laws that differ from federal standards to
be preempted. To the extent that states enact requirements that differ from federal standards or state officials and courts adopt interpretations of federal consumer
laws that differ from those adopted by the CFPB, we may be required to alter or cease offering products or services in some jurisdictions, which would increase
compliance costs and reduce our ability to offer the same products and services to consumers nationwide, and we may be subject to a higher risk of state
enforcement actions.

Failure by Synchrony and the Bank to meet applicable capital adequacy and liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on us.

Synchrony and the Bank must meet rules for capital adequacy as discussed in “Regulation—Regulation Relating to Our Business.” As a stand-alone savings and
loan holding company, Synchrony is subject to capital requirements similar to those that apply to the Bank.

Synchrony and the Bank may be subject to increasingly stringent capital adequacy standards in the future. For instance, if in the future Synchrony has $100 billion
or more in average total consolidated assets based on a four quarter average, Synchrony will become subject to biennial supervisory stress tests, a formal capital
plan submission requirement, and the stress capital buffer. See “Regulation—Regulation Relating to Our Business— Savings and Loan Holding Company
Regulation—Capital” and “Regulation—Regulation Relating to Our Business— Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation—Dividends and Stock
Repurchases.” While Synchrony had less than $100 billion in average total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2021 and less than $100 billion in total
consolidated assets in each of the four quarters ending as of December 31, 2021, its average total consolidated assets have exceeded $100 billion in the past and
may exceed such threshold again in future periods. If Synchrony becomes subject to supervisory stress tests, a formal capital plan submission requirement, and/or
the stress capital buffer, Synchrony could be subject to additional restrictions on its ability to return capital to shareholders.

Additionally, ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which implements an impairment model,
CECL, based on expected credit losses, requires us to recognize all expected credit losses over the life of a loan based on historical experience, current
conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. See Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — New Accounting
Standards, to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this accounting standard for credit losses and its impact to the Company’s
allowance for credit losses.

If Synchrony or the Bank fails to meet current or future minimum capital, leverage or other financial requirements, its operations, results of operations and financial
condition could be materially adversely affected. Among other things, failure by Synchrony or the Bank to maintain its status as “well capitalized” (or otherwise meet
current or future minimum capital, leverage or other financial requirements) could compromise our competitive position and result in restrictions imposed by the
Federal Reserve Board or the OCC, including, potentially, on the Bank’s ability to engage in certain activities. These could include restrictions on the Bank’s ability
to enter into transactions with affiliates, accept brokered deposits, grow its assets, engage in material transactions, extend credit in certain highly leveraged
transactions, amend or change its charter, bylaws or accounting methods, pay interest on its liabilities without regard to regulatory caps on the rates that may be
paid on deposits, and pay dividends or repurchase stock. In addition, failure to maintain the well capitalized status of the Bank could result in our having to invest
additional capital in the Bank, which could in turn require us to raise additional capital. The market and demand for, and cost of, our asset-backed securities also
could be adversely affected by failure to meet current or future capital requirements.

Synchrony must also continue to comply with regulatory requirements related to the maintenance, management, monitoring and reporting of liquidity as discussed
in “Regulation—Regulation Relating to Our Business.” Under the Tailoring Rules, enhanced prudential standards with respect to liquidity management apply to
covered savings and loan holding companies with $100 billion or more in average total consolidated assets, based on a four quarter average. See “Regulation—
Regulation Relating to Our Business—Legislative and Regulatory Developments.” If such requirements apply to us in the future, our results and operations and
financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

100

We are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock; the Bank is subject to restrictions that limit its
ability to pay dividends to us, which could limit our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our common stock or make payments on our indebtedness.

We are limited in our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock by the Federal Reserve Board, which has broad authority to review our capital
planning and risk management processes, and our current, projected and stressed capital levels, and to object to any capital action that the Federal Reserve Board
considers to be unsafe or unsound. In addition, the declaration and amount of any future dividends to holders of our common stock or stock repurchases will be at
the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital and liquidity position, including the
Bank, applicable regulatory requirements, corporate law and contractual restrictions and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. Any inability to
pay dividends or repurchase our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and market perceptions of Synchrony Financial. See
“Regulation—Regulation Relating to Our Business—Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation-Dividends and Stock Repurchases.”

We rely significantly on dividends and other distributions and payments from the Bank for liquidity, including to pay our obligations under our indebtedness and
other indebtedness as they become due, and federal law limits the amount of dividends and other distributions and payments that the Bank may pay to us. For
example, OCC regulations limit the ability of savings associations to make distributions of capital, including payment of dividends, stock redemptions and
repurchases, cash-out mergers and other transactions charged to the capital account. The Bank must obtain the OCC’s approval prior to making a capital
distribution in certain circumstances, including if the Bank proposes to make a capital distribution when it does not meet certain capital requirements (or will not do
so as a result of the proposed capital distribution) or certain net income requirements. In addition, the Bank must file a prior written notice of a planned or declared
dividend or other distribution with the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board or the OCC may object to a capital distribution if, among other things,
the Bank is, or as a result of such dividend or distribution would be, undercapitalized or the Federal Reserve Board or OCC has safety and soundness concerns.
Additional restrictions on bank dividends may apply if the Bank fails the QTL test. The application of these restrictions on the Bank’s ability to pay dividends
involves broad discretion on the part of our regulators. Limitations on the Bank’s payments of dividends and other distributions and payments that we receive from
the Bank could reduce our liquidity and limit our ability to pay dividends or our obligations under our indebtedness. See “Regulation—Regulation Relating to Our
Business—Savings Association Regulation—Dividends and Stock Repurchases” and “—Activities.”

Regulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal
information and adversely affect our business opportunities.

We are subject to various privacy, information security and data protection laws, including requirements concerning security breach notification, and we could be
negatively impacted by them. For example, in the United States, certain of our businesses are subject to the GLBA and implementing regulations and guidance.
Among other things, the GLBA: (i) imposes certain limitations on the ability of financial institutions to share consumers’ nonpublic personal information with
nonaffiliated third parties, (ii) requires that financial institutions provide certain disclosures to consumers about their information collection, sharing and security
practices and affords customers the right to “opt out” of the institution’s disclosure of their personal financial information to nonaffiliated third parties (with certain
exceptions) and (iii) requires financial institutions to develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards
that are appropriate to the financial institution’s size and complexity, the nature and scope of the financial institution’s activities, and the sensitivity of customer
information processed by the financial institution as well as plans for responding to data security breaches.

Moreover, various United States federal banking regulatory agencies, states and foreign jurisdictions have enacted data security breach notification requirements
with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory and/or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. Many of these
requirements also apply broadly to our partners that accept our cards. In many countries that have yet to impose data security breach notification requirements,
regulators have increasingly used the threat of significant sanctions and penalties by data protection authorities to encourage voluntary notification and discourage
data security breaches.

Furthermore, legislators and/or regulators in the United States and other countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, information
security and data protection laws that potentially could have a significant impact on our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-
related practices; our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer and/or employee information; and some of our current or planned business
activities. This could also increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives. In the United States,
this includes increased privacy-related enforcement activity at the federal level, by the Federal Trade Commission, as well as at the state level, such as with regard
to mobile applications, and state legislation such as the CCPA, which could increase our costs. In the European Union, this includes the General Data Protection
Regulation. See “Regulation—Regulation Relating to Our Business—Privacy.”

Compliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws (including those regarding security breach notification and consumer
privacy) affecting customer and/or employee data to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to
provide certain products and services (such as products or services that involve us sharing information with third parties or storing sensitive credit card
information), which could materially and adversely affect our profitability. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could
result in potentially significant regulatory investigations and government actions, litigation, fines or sanctions, consumer or partner actions and damage to our
reputation and our brand, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Our use of third-party vendors and our other ongoing third-party business relationships are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and
attention.

We regularly use third-party vendors and subcontractors as part of our business. We also have substantial ongoing business relationships with our partners and
other third parties. These types of third-party relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by our federal bank
regulators (the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the FDIC) and our consumer financial services regulator (the CFPB). Regulatory guidance requires us to
enhance our due diligence, ongoing monitoring and control over our third-party vendors and subcontractors and other ongoing third-party business relationships,
including with our partners. In certain cases, we may be required to renegotiate our agreements with these vendors and/or their subcontractors to meet these
enhanced requirements, which could increase our costs. These regulatory expectations may change, and potentially become more rigorous in certain ways, due to
an interagency effort to replace existing guidance on the risk management of third-party relationships with new guidance. We expect that our regulators will hold us
responsible for deficiencies in our oversight and control of our third-party relationships and in the performance of the parties with which we have these
relationships. As a result, if our regulators conclude that we have not exercised adequate oversight and control over our third-party vendors and subcontractors or
other ongoing third-party business relationships, or that such third parties have not performed appropriately, we could be subject to enforcement actions, including
the imposition of civil money penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for customer remediation.

Failure to comply with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws could have significant adverse consequences for us.

We maintain an enterprise-wide program designed to enable us to comply with all applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws and
regulations, including, but not limited to, the Bank Secrecy Act and the Patriot Act. This program includes policies, procedures, processes and other internal
controls designed to identify, monitor, manage and mitigate the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing posed by our products, services, customers and
geographic locale. These controls include procedures and processes to detect and report suspicious transactions, perform customer due diligence, respond to
requests from law enforcement, identify and verify a legal entity customer’s beneficial owner(s) at the time a new account is opened and to understand the nature
and purpose of the customer relationship, and meet all recordkeeping and reporting requirements related to particular transactions involving currency or monetary
instruments. We cannot be sure our programs and controls will be effective to ensure our compliance with all applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism
financing laws and regulations, and our failure to comply could subject us to significant sanctions, fines, penalties and reputational harm, all of which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
