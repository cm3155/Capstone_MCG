 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion is an analysis of our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, and financial condition as of September 30, 2020, compared to December 31, 2019. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes. 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

In this report, we have made various statements regarding current expectations or forecasts of future events, which speak only as of the date the statements are made. These statements are &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are also made from time-to-time in press releases and in oral statements made by the officers of Old National Bancorp (&#8220;Old National&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;). Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of the words &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;project,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; and other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements also include, but are not limited to, statements regarding estimated cost savings, plans and objectives for future operations, the Company&#8217;s business and growth strategies, including future acquisitions of banks, regulatory developments, and expectations about performance as well as economic and market conditions and trends. 

Such forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and estimates, which although believed to be reasonable, may turn out to be incorrect. Therefore, undue reliance should not be placed upon these estimates and statements. We cannot assure that any of these statements, estimates, or beliefs will be realized and actual results may differ from those contemplated in these &#8220;forward-looking statements.&#8221; We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. You are advised to consult further disclosures we may make on related subjects in our filings with the SEC. In addition to other factors discussed in this report, some of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include the following: 

&#8226; the length and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the Company&#8217;s financial conditions and business operations; 

&#8226; changes in the economy which could materially impact credit quality trends and the ability to generate loans and gather deposits, including the pace of recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic; 

&#8226; market, economic, operational, liquidity, credit, and interest rate risks associated with our business; 

&#8226; competition; 

&#8226; government legislation and policies, including changes to address the impact of COVID-19 through the CARES Act and other legislative and regulatory responses to the COVID-19 pandemic; 

&#8226; our ability to execute our business plan, including the anticipated impact from the ONB Way strategic plan that may differ from current estimates; 

&#8226; failure or circumvention of our internal controls; 

&#8226; failure or disruption of our information systems; 

&#8226; significant changes in accounting, tax, or regulatory practices or requirements, including the impact of the new CECL standard; 

&#8226; new legal obligations or liabilities or unfavorable resolutions of litigations; 

&#8226; disruptive technologies in payment systems and other services traditionally provided by banks; and 

&#8226; computer hacking and other cybersecurity threats. 

Investors should consider these risks, uncertainties, and other factors in addition to risk factors included in this filing and our other filings with the SEC.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

The non-GAAP financial measures presented below are used by our management and our Board of Directors on a regular basis in addition to our GAAP results to facilitate the assessment of our financial performance. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures enhance an investor&#8217;s understanding of our financial results by providing a meaningful basis for period-to-period comparisons, assisting in operating results analysis, and predicting future performance. This information supplements our GAAP reported results, and should not be viewed in isolation from, or as a substitute for, our GAAP results. Accordingly, this financial information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, and notes thereto for the quarter ended September 30, 2020, included elsewhere in this report, and included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items that are included in the financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. 

The following table presents GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are not necessarily comparable to similar measures that may be represented by other companies. 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

As part of our strategic plan the ONB Way, we have executed most of our expense initiatives and realized the savings we previously disclosed. Now we transition to our revenue initiatives, which were delayed due to COVID-19. This transition will include talent additions in key revenue positions in the commercial and wealth businesses as well as our technology team to support revenue enabling technology investments. 

Old National remains steadfast in executing the basic banking fundamentals of loan growth, increases in non-interest income, prudent capital deployment, and expense management. 

During the third quarter of 2020, we recorded a provision expense for loan losses of zero. This provision expense was derived from the Moody's baseline forecast, which included meaningful improvements in both gross domestic product growth and unemployment trends when compared to the forecast used in the prior quarter. 

During the third quarter of 2020, net income was $77.9 million, or $0.47 per diluted share. Net income was $69.8 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2019. 

We have continued to re-mix our earning assets towards more productive commercial and commercial real estate loans and out of indirect and other loans. 

Loans : Our loan balances, excluding loans held for sale, increased $276.8 million to $13.893 billion at September 30, 2020 compared to $13.616 billion at June 30, 2020. This was primarily driven by growth in commercial real estate loans. We reported strong total commercial loan production of $978 million in the third quarter of 2020 and the commercial loan pipeline totaled $2.9 billion at September 30, 2020. 

Net Interest Income : For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019, our net interest income decreased primarily due to decreased loan yields, partially offset by higher average loans and lower costs of interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income was unchanged in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2020. 

Noninterest Income : Noninterest income increased to $180.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to higher mortgage banking revenue, higher capital markets income, and higher debt securities gains. These increases were partially offset by lower service charges on deposit accounts. The third quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2020 showed an increase of $6.3 million reflecting higher debt securities gains, service charges on deposit accounts, and mortgage banking revenue. 

Expenses : Noninterest expenses increased $25.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to $39.0 million of charges related to the ONB Way. The third quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2020 showed a slight increase of $0.1 million. 

Pandemic Update 

As previously disclosed, the novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, which was first reported in Wuhan, China had an impact on our operations as of September 30, 2020. This impact is still being addressed by Old National as evidenced by our practice of occupying only 50% of our office buildings by rotating team members every 4 weeks. However, our branch lobbies are still open for business and we continue to lend to qualified businesses for working capital and general business purposes. While we remain committed and focused on the health and safety of our team members, clients, and communities; w e will continue to evaluate and adjust our branch hours, lobby usage, and return to work efforts as necessary depending on the path of the virus across our footprint. We believe our historically strong underwriting practices, diverse and granular portfolios, and Midwest-based footprint will help to mitigate any adverse impact to Old National. 

The impact from the virus on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations, and its customers is still unknown. The fiscal stimulus and relief programs appear to have mitigated any materially adverse financial impact to Old National during the third quarter of 2020. However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic any future changes in the behavior of customers, businesses, employees, additional stimulus and relief programs, as well as the availability and effectiveness of an immunization may have a future financial impact on Old National.

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is the most significant component of our earnings, comprising 71% of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Net interest income and margin are influenced by many factors, primarily the volume and mix of earning assets, funding sources, and interest rate fluctuations. Other factors include the level of accretion income on purchased loans, prepayment risk on mortgage and investment-related assets, and the composition and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The current uptick in cases of COVID-19 may offset the recent positive economic momentum and government stimulus programs. Accordingly, there is still much uncertainty regarding the economy. 

Interest rates remained at near historic lows during the third quarter of 2020 after declining dramatically in the first half of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s Federal Funds range is currently 0.00% to 0.25%, with the Effective Fed Funds Rate in the 0.05% to 0.10% range. If interest rates decline further, our interest rate spread could decline, which may result in a decrease in our net interest income. However, management has taken balance sheet restructuring, derivative, and deposit pricing actions to help mitigate this risk. 

Loans typically generate more interest income than investment securities with similar maturities. Funding from client deposits generally costs less than wholesale funding sources. Factors such as general economic activity, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and price volatility of competing alternative investments, can also exert significant influence on our ability to optimize the mix of assets and funding, net interest income, and margin. 

Net interest income is the excess of interest received from earning assets over interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. For analytical purposes, net interest income is also presented in the table that follows, adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis to reflect what our tax-exempt assets would need to yield in order to achieve the same after-tax yield as a taxable asset. We used the federal statutory tax rate in effect of 21% for all periods. This analysis portrays the income tax benefits related to tax-exempt assets and helps to facilitate a comparison between taxable and tax-exempt assets. Management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest margin and net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis. Therefore, management believes these measures provide useful information for both management and investors by allowing them to make peer comparisons. 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Net interest income $ 145,573 &#160; $ 153,096 $ 435,015 &#160; $ 455,374 Conversion to fully taxable equivalent 3,379 &#160; 3,171 10,069 &#160; 9,659 Net interest income - taxable equivalent basis $ 148,952 &#160; $ 156,267 $ 445,084 &#160; $ 465,033 Average earning assets $ 19,654,292 &#160; $ 17,510,487 $ 18,815,088 &#160; $ 17,320,260 Net interest margin 2.96 &#160; % 3.50 % 3.08 &#160; % 3.51 % Net interest margin - taxable equivalent basis 3.03 &#160; % 3.57 % 3.15 &#160; % 3.58 % 

The decrease in net interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily due to lower yields on average earning assets and lower accretion income. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher average earning assets and lower costs of average interest-bearing liabilities in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. Net interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 included accretion income (interest income in excess of contractual interest income) associated with acquired loans. Accretion income totaled $5.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2020 and $17.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to $13.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2019 and $34.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. We expect accretion income on loans to decrease over time, but this may be offset by future acquisitions.

(1) The variance not solely due to rate or volume is allocated equally between the rate and volume variances. 

(2) Interest on investment securities and loans includes the effect of taxable equivalent adjustments of $2.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2020; and $6.5 million and $3.5 million, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 using the federal statutory rate in effect of 21%. 

The decrease in the net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 when compared to the same periods in 2019 was primarily due to lower yields on interest earning assets and a change in the mix of average interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by higher average earning assets and lower costs of interest-bearing liabilities. The yield on interest earning assets decreased 98 basis points and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 56 basis points in the quarterly year-over-year comparison. The yield on interest earning assets is calculated by dividing annualized taxable equivalent net interest income by average interest earning assets while the cost of interest-bearing liabilities is calculated by dividing annualized interest expense by average interest-bearing liabilities. The yield on interest earning assets decreased 80 basis points and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 46 basis points in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Accretion income represented 11 basis points of the net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2020, compared to 31 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2019. Accretion income represented 12 basis points of the net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to 26 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The current uptick in cases of COVID-19 may offset the recent positive economic momentum and government stimulus programs, and could negatively impact net interest margin. Accordingly, there is still much uncertainty regarding the economy. 

Average earning assets were $19.654 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2020, compared to $17.510 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2019, an increase of $2.144 billion, or 12%. Average earning assets were $18.815 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to $17.320 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, an increase of $1.495 billion, or 9%. The increases in average earning assets were due to increases in average loans and average investment securities. The loan portfolio including loans held for sale, which generally has an average yield higher than the investment portfolio, was 70% of average interest earning assets for both the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and the nine months ended September 30, 2019. 

Average loans including loans held for sale increased $1.775 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and $1.061 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 when compared to the same periods in 2019 due to increases in average commercial loans, commercial real estate loans, and residential real estate loans, partially offset by lower average consumer loans. The increases in average commercial loans reflected strong PPP loan production, which began in April 2020. As of September 30, 2020, PPP loans totaled $1.479 billion. 

Average investments increased $293.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and $399.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 when compared to the same periods in 2019 reflecting higher fair values and excess liquidity. 

Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $1.449 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and $877.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 when compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily due to PPP funds on deposit. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $657.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and $294.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 when compared to the same periods in 2019. 

Average borrowed funds decreased $73.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and increased $187.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 when compared to the same periods in 2019. 

Provision for Loan Losses 

The provision for loan losses was zero for the three months ended September 30, 2020, compared to $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019. Net recoveries totaled $3.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2020, compared to net charge-offs of $0.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2019. The provision for loan losses was $39.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to $3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Net charge-offs totaled $4.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to net charge-offs of $2.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The provision for loan losses of zero in the three months ended September 30, 2020 reflected the improved economic forecast and net recoveries of $3.0 million during the quarter. The higher provision for loan losses in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was driven by implementation of CECL, which uses an economic forecast that now includes the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. PPP loans were factored in the provision for credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020; however, due to the SBA guaranty and our borrowers&#8217; adherence to the PPP terms, the provision impact was insignificant. Continued loan growth in future periods, a decline in our current level of recoveries, or an increase in charge-offs could result in an increase in provision expense. Additionally, with the adoption of CECL beginning on January 1, 2020, provision expense may become more volatile due to changes in CECL model assumptions of credit quality, macroeconomic factors and conditions, and loan composition, which drive the allowance for credit losses balance. 

Noninterest Income 

We generate revenues in the form of noninterest income through client fees, sales commissions, and other gains and losses from our core banking franchise and other related businesses, such as wealth management, investment consulting, and investment products. The following table details the components in noninterest income:

Noninterest income increased $10.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to higher mortgage banking revenue and higher debt securities gains. These increases were partially offset by lower service charges on deposit accounts. 

Noninterest income increased $29.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to higher mortgage banking revenue, higher capital markets income, and higher debt securities gains. These increases were partially offset by lower service charges on deposit accounts. 

Service charges and overdraft fees decreased $3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and $7.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 when compared to the same periods in 2019 reflecting lower overdraft fees due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Debit card and ATM fees decreased $1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 when compared to the same periods in 2019 reflecting lower interchange income due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Mortgage banking revenue increased $9.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and $25.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 when compared to the same periods in 2019 reflecting increased mortgage originations and sales in 2020. 

Capital markets income is comprised of customer interest rate swap fees, foreign currency exchange fees, net gains (losses) on foreign currency adjustments, and tax credit fee income. Capital markets income increased $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and $5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 when compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily due to higher customer interest rate swap fees. 

Debt securities gains (losses), net had a favorable variance of $4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to higher realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities. Debt securities gains (losses), net had a favorable variance of $9.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to higher realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities and lower realized losses on sales of available-for-sale debt securities in 2020. 

Other income decreased $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to lower branded card incentives. Other income decreased $2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to lower branded card incentives, unfavorable variance in net gains (losses) on derivatives, lower insurance income, and lower fees on commercial loans.

Noninterest expense decreased $2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019 reflecting lower marketing expenses, professional fees, and salaries and 

employee benefits. These decreases were partially offset by higher occupancy and amortization of tax credit investments. 

Noninterest expense increased $25.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019 reflecting $39.0 million of charges related to the ONB Way strategic initiative. 

Salaries and employee benefits decreased $1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to fewer employees at September 30, 2020. Salaries and employee benefits increased $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to higher commissions and personnel expenses related to the ONB Way totaling $7.6 million, partially offset by fewer employees at September 30, 2020. 

Occupancy expenses increased $2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to higher real estate taxes. 

Marketing expenses decreased $2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and $4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 when compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily due to lower public relations and advertising expenses. 

Professional fees decreased $2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and $1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 when compared to the same periods in 2019 reflecting higher consulting fees incurred in 2019 related to the ONB Way. 

Amortization of intangibles decreased $0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and $2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 when compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily due to lower amortization of core deposit intangibles. 

Amortization of tax credit investments increased $1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and $6.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 when compared to the same periods in 2019. The recognition of tax credit amortization expense is contingent upon the successful completion of the rehabilitation of a historic building or completion of a solar project within the reporting period. Many factors including weather, labor availability, building regulations, inspections, and other unexpected construction delays related to a rehabilitation project can cause a project to exceed its estimated completion date. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our tax credit investments. 

Other expense increased $25.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to lease termination charges and impairments on long-lived assets related to branch consolidations that were part of the ONB Way strategic initiative totaling $25.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. 

Provision for Income Taxes 

We record a provision for income taxes currently payable and for income taxes payable or benefits to be received in the future, which arise due to timing differences in the recognition of certain items for financial statement and income tax purposes. The major difference between the effective tax rate applied to our financial statement income and the federal statutory tax rate is caused by a tax benefit from our tax credit investments and interest on tax-exempt securities and loans. The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of pre-tax income, was 13.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2020, compared to 16.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2019. The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of pre-tax income, was 14.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to 17.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. In accordance with ASC 740-270, Accounting for Interim Reporting , the provision for income taxes was recorded at September 30, 2020 based on the current estimate of the effective annual rate. The lower effective tax rate during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 when compared to the same periods in 2019 was primarily the result of an increase in federal tax credits available. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Overview 

At September 30, 2020, our assets were $22.460 billion, a $2.048 billion increase compared to assets of $20.412 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher commercial loans driven by strong PPP loan production in the second quarter of 2020. As of September 30, 2020, PPP loans totaled $1.479 billion. 

The current uptick in cases of COVID-19 may offset the recent positive economic momentum and government stimulus programs, and could negatively impact our financial condition. Accordingly, there is still much uncertainty regarding the economy. 

Earning Assets 

Our earning assets are comprised of investment securities, portfolio loans, loans held for sale, money market investments, interest earning accounts with the Federal Reserve, and equity securities. Earning assets were $19.852 billion at September 30, 2020, a $2.090 billion increase compared to earning assets of $17.762 billion at December 31, 2019. 

Investment Securities 

We classify the majority of our investment securities as available-for-sale to give management the flexibility to sell the securities prior to maturity if needed, based on fluctuating interest rates or changes in our funding requirements. 

Equity securities are recorded at fair value and totaled $2.5 million at September 30, 2020 compared to $6.8 million at December 31, 2019. 

At September 30, 2020, the investment securities portfolio, including equity securities, was $5.774 billion compared to $5.556 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $217.5 million. Investment securities represented 29% of earning assets at September 30, 2020, compared to 31% at December 31, 2019. Stronger commercial loan demand in the future could result in management&#8217;s decision to reduce the securities portfolio. At September 30, 2020, management does not intend to sell any securities in an unrealized loss position and does not believe we will be required to sell such securities. 

The investment securities available-for-sale portfolio had net unrealized gains of $187.6 million at September 30, 2020, compared to net unrealized gains of $71.9 million at December 31, 2019. Net unrealized gains (losses) increased from December 31, 2019 to September 30, 2020 reflecting higher net unrealized gains on mortgage-backed and tax exempt municipal securities due to a decline in long-term interest rates. 

The investment portfolio had an effective duration of 3.94 at September 30, 2020, compared to 3.86 at December 31, 2019. Effective duration measures the percentage change in value of the portfolio in response to a change in interest rates. Generally, there is more uncertainty in interest rates over a longer average maturity, resulting in a higher duration percentage. The annualized average yields on investment securities, on a taxable equivalent basis, were 2.45% for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2.59% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to 2.82% for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2.94% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. 

Loans Held for Sale 

Mortgage loans held for immediate sale in the secondary market were $85.1 million at September 30, 2020, compared to $46.9 million at December 31, 2019. Certain mortgage loans are committed for sale at or prior to origination at a contracted price to an outside investor. Other mortgage loans held for immediate sale are hedged with TBA forward agreements and committed for sale when they are ready for delivery and remain on the Company&#8217;s balance sheet for a short period of time (typically 30 to 60 days). These loans are sold without recourse, beyond customary representations and warranties, and Old National has not experienced material losses arising from these sales. Mortgage originations are subject to volatility due to interest rates and home sales, among other factors. 

We have elected the fair value option prospectively for residential loans held for sale. The aggregate fair value exceeded the unpaid principal balance by $5.2 million at September 30, 2020, compared to $1.5 million at December 31, 2019. 

Commercial and Commercial Real Estate Loans 

Commercial and commercial real estate loans are the largest classification within earning assets, representing 50% of earning assets at September 30, 2020, compared to 45% at December 31, 2019. At September 30, 2020, commercial and commercial real estate loans were $9.966 billion, an increase of $1.909 billion compared to December 31, 2019 driven by strong PPP loan production in the second quarter of 2020. As of September 30, 2020, PPP loans totaled $1.479 billion. 

Residential Real Estate Loans 

At September 30, 2020, residential real estate loans held in our loan portfolio were $2.265 billion, a decrease of $69.0 million compared to December 31, 2019. Future increases in interest rates could result in a decline in the level of refinancings and new originations of residential real estate loans. 

Consumer Loans 

Consumer loans, including automobile loans and personal and home equity loans and lines of credit, decreased $65.0 million at September 30, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 primarily due to decreases in consumer direct loans and home equity loans. 

Other Assets 

Other assets increased $92.1 million, or 37%, compared to December 31, 2019 primarily due to increases in derivative assets and assets held for sale. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net deferred tax assets which reflected an increase in deferred tax liabilities related to net unrealized gains on available-for-sale investment securities. 

Funding 

Total funding, comprised of deposits and wholesale borrowings, was $19.232 billion at September 30, 2020, an increase of $1.934 billion from $17.298 billion at December 31, 2019. Included in total funding were deposits of $16.506 billion at September 30, 2020, an increase of $1.953 billion from $14.553 billion at December 31, 2019. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased $1.421 billion from December 31, 2019 to September 30, 2020 reflecting PPP funds on deposit. Interest-bearing checking and NOW deposits increased $438.8 million from December 31, 2019 to September 30, 2020, while savings deposits increased $441.9 million. Money market deposits increased $70.6 million from December 31, 2019 to September 30, 2020. Other time deposits decreased $383.3 million, while brokered certificates of deposit decreased $35.6 million. 

We use wholesale funding to augment deposit funding and to help maintain our desired interest rate risk position. At September 30, 2020, wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased and interbank borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, FHLB advances, and other borrowings, totaled $2.726 billion, a decrease of $19.0 million from December 31, 2019. Wholesale funding as a percentage of total funding was 14% at September 30, 2020 and 16% at December 31, 2019. The decrease in wholesale funding from December 31, 2019 to September 30, 2020 was due to decreases in federal funds purchased and interbank borrowings and other borrowings, substantially offset by increases in FHLB advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. 

Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities 

Accrued expenses and other liabilities increased $57.0 million, or 35%, from December 31, 2019 to September 30, 2020 primarily due to investment securities purchased but not settled before September 30, 2020. 

Capital &#160; 

Shareholders&#8217; equity totaled $2.921 billion at September 30, 2020, compared to $2.852 billion at December 31, 2019. Old National repurchased 4.9 million shares of Common Stock under a stock repurchase program that was approved by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors reducing equity by $78.7 million and 0.2 million shares of Common Stock associated with employee share-based incentive programs reducing equity by $3.6 million i n the nine months ended September 30, 2020. We have suspended the stock repurchase plan approved by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors in the near term given the uncertain economic conditions. We also paid cash dividends of $0.42 per share in the nine months ended September 30, 2020, which reduced equity by $69.8 million. The change in unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale investment securities increased equity by $90.1 million during the nine months 

ended September 30, 2020. The Company&#8217;s Common Stock is traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol &#8220;ONB&#8221; with 33,416 shareholders of record at September 30, 2020. 

Capital Adequacy 

Old National and the banking industry are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. At September 30, 2020, Old National and its bank subsidiary exceeded the regulatory minimums and Old National Bank met the regulatory definition of &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; based on the most recent regulatory definition. 

Old National&#8217;s consolidated capital position remains strong as evidenced by the following comparisons of key industry ratios. 

Regulatory Guidelines Minimum September 30, December 31, 2020 2019 2019 Risk-based capital: Tier 1 capital to total average assets (leverage ratio) 4.00 % 8.15 &#160; % 8.79 % 8.88 % Common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-adjusted total assets 7.00 11.84 &#160; 12.03 12.13 Tier 1 capital to risk-adjusted total assets 8.50 11.84 &#160; 12.03 12.13 Total capital to risk-adjusted total assets 10.50 12.81 &#160; 12.97 12.99 Shareholders' equity to assets N/A 13.01 &#160; 13.86 13.97

In December 2018, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC approved a final rule to address changes to credit loss accounting under GAAP, including banking organizations&#8217; implementation of CECL. The final rule provides banking organizations the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the new accounting standard. In March 2020, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC published an interim final rule to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from the implementation of CECL. The interim final rule maintains the three-year transition option in the previous rule and provides banks the option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period (five-year transition option). Old National is adopting the capital transition relief over the permissible five-year period. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Overview 

Old National has adopted a Risk Appetite Statement to enable the Board of Directors, Executive Leadership Group, and Senior Management to better assess, understand, and mitigate the risks of Old National. The Risk Appetite Statement addresses the following major risks: strategic, market, liquidity, credit, operational/technology/cyber, regulatory/compliance/legal, reputational, and human resources. Our Chief Risk Officer is independent of management and reports directly to the Chair of the Board&#8217;s Enterprise Risk Management Committee. The 

following discussion addresses these major risks: credit, market, liquidity, operational/technology/cyber, and regulatory/compliance/legal. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, we are committed and focused on the health and safety of our team members, clients, and communities. We will continue to evaluate and adjust our branch hours, lobby usage, and return to work efforts as necessary depending on the path of the virus across our footprint. We are occupying only 50% of our office buildings by rotating team members every 4 weeks. However, our branch lobbies are still open for business and we continue to lend to qualified businesses for working capital and general business purposes. 

Credit Risk 

Credit risk represents the risk of loss arising from an obligor&#8217;s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms. Our primary credit risks result from our investment and lending activities 

Investment Activities 

We carry a higher exposure to loss in our pooled trust preferred securities, which are collateralized debt obligations, due to illiquidity in that market and the performance of the underlying collateral. At September 30, 2020, we had pooled trust preferred securities with a fair value of $7.5 million, or less than 1% of the available-for-sale securities portfolio. These securities remained classified as available-for-sale and at September 30, 2020, the unrealized loss on our pooled trust preferred securities was $6.2 million. The fair value of these securities is expected to improve as we get closer to maturity, but not in all cases. 

All of our mortgage-backed securities are backed by U.S. government-sponsored or federal agencies. Municipal bonds, corporate bonds, and other debt securities are evaluated by reviewing the credit-worthiness of the issuer and general market conditions. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details about our investment security portfolio. 

Counterparty Exposure 

Counterparty exposure is the risk that the other party in a financial transaction will not fulfill its obligation. We define counterparty exposure as nonperformance risk in transactions involving federal funds sold and purchased, repurchase agreements, correspondent bank relationships, and derivative contracts with companies in the financial services industry. Old National manages exposure to counterparty risk in connection with its derivatives transactions by generally engaging in transactions with counterparties having ratings of at least A by Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Rating Service or A2 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. Total credit exposure is monitored by counterparty and managed within limits that management believes to be prudent. Old National&#8217;s net counterparty exposure was an asset of $67.2 million at September 30, 2020. 

Lending Activities 

Commercial 

Commercial and industrial loans are made primarily for the purpose of financing equipment acquisition, expansion, working capital, and other general business purposes. Lease financing consists of direct financing leases and are used by commercial customers to finance capital purchases ranging from computer equipment to transportation equipment. The credit decisions for these transactions are based upon an assessment of the overall financial capacity of the applicant. A determination is made as to the applicant&#8217;s ability to repay in accordance with the proposed terms as well as an overall assessment of the risks involved. In addition to an evaluation of the applicant&#8217;s financial condition, a determination is made of the probable adequacy of the primary and secondary sources of repayment, such as additional collateral or personal guarantees, to be relied upon in the transaction. Credit agency reports of the applicant&#8217;s credit history supplement the analysis of the applicant&#8217;s creditworthiness. 

Commercial mortgages and construction loans are offered to real estate investors, developers, and builders primarily domiciled in the geographic market areas we serve: Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. These loans are secured by first mortgages on real estate at LTV margins deemed appropriate for the property type, quality, location, and sponsorship. Generally, these LTV ratios do not exceed 80%. The commercial properties are predominantly non-residential properties such as retail centers, industrial properties and, to a lesser extent, more specialized properties. Substantially all of our commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located in our primary market area. 

In the underwriting of our commercial real estate loans, we obtain appraisals for the underlying properties. Decisions to lend are based on the economic viability of the property and the creditworthiness of the borrower. In evaluating a proposed commercial real estate loan, we primarily emphasize the ratio of the property&#8217;s projected net cash flows to the loan&#8217;s debt service requirement. The debt service coverage ratio normally is not less than 120% and it is computed after deduction for a vacancy factor and property expenses as appropriate. In addition, a personal guarantee of the loan or a portion thereof is often required from the principal(s) of the borrower. In most cases, we require title insurance insuring the priority of our lien, fire, and extended coverage casualty insurance, and flood insurance, if appropriate, in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property. In addition, business interruption insurance or other insurance may be required. 

Construction loans are underwritten against projected cash flows derived from rental income, business income from an owner-occupant, or the sale of the property to an end-user. We may mitigate the risks associated with these types of loans by requiring fixed-price construction contracts, performance and payment bonding, controlled disbursements, and pre-sale contracts or pre-lease agreements. 

Consumer 

We offer a variety of first mortgage and junior lien loans to consumers within our markets, with residential home mortgages comprising our largest consumer loan category. These loans are secured by a primary residence and are underwritten using traditional underwriting systems to assess the credit risks of the consumer. Decisions are primarily based on LTV ratios, DTI ratios, liquidity, and credit scores. A maximum LTV ratio of 80% is generally required, although higher levels are permitted with mortgage insurance or other mitigating factors. We offer fixed rate mortgages and variable rate mortgages with interest rates that are subject to change every year after the first, third, fifth, or seventh year, depending on the product and are based on fully-indexed rates such as LIBOR. We do not offer payment-option facilities, sub-prime loans, or any product with negative amortization. 

Home equity loans are secured primarily by second mortgages on residential property of the borrower. The underwriting terms for the home equity product generally permit borrowing availability, in the aggregate, up to 90% of the appraised value of the collateral property at the time of origination. We offer fixed and variable rate home equity loans, with variable rate loans underwritten at fully-indexed rates. Decisions are primarily based on LTV ratios, DTI ratios, and credit scores. We do not offer home equity loan products with reduced documentation. 

Automobile loans include loans and leases secured by new or used automobiles. We originate automobile loans and leases primarily on an indirect basis through selected dealerships. We require borrowers to maintain collision insurance on automobiles securing consumer loans, with us listed as loss payee. Our procedures for underwriting automobile loans include an assessment of an applicant&#8217;s overall financial capacity, including credit history and the ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although an applicant&#8217;s creditworthiness is the primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral security to the proposed loan amount. 

Asset Quality 

Community-based lending personnel, along with region-based independent underwriting and analytic support staff, extend credit under guidelines established and administered by our Enterprise Risk Committee. This committee, which meets quarterly, is made up of outside directors. The committee monitors credit quality through its review of information such as delinquencies, credit exposures, peer comparisons, problem loans, and charge-offs. In addition, the committee reviews and approves recommended loan policy changes to assure it remains appropriate for the current lending environment. 

We lend to commercial and commercial real estate clients in various industries including manufacturing, agribusiness, transportation, mining, wholesaling, and retailing. Old National manages concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship, and loan size. At September 30, 2020, our average commercial loan size (excluding PPP loans) was under $325,000 and our average commercial real estate loan size was under $775,000. In addition, while loans to lessors of both residential and non-residential real estate exceed 10% of total loans, no individual sub-segment category within those broader categories reaches the 10% threshold. At September 30, 2020, we had minimal exposure to foreign borrowers and no sovereign debt. Our policy is to concentrate our lending activity in the geographic market areas we serve, primarily Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. We have experienced an impact from COVID-19 as of September 30, 2020; however, the depth of this crisis is ongoing and its effect is anticipated to be very broad-based. We are seeing another uptick in COVID-19 cases in our geographic footprint. The relief programs we have put in place along with governmental 

stimulus programs have helped dampen any increases in delinquencies we might have seen absent these programs. It remains to be seen what impact any wind down of these programs will have on delinquency rates going forward. Management believes that trends in under-performing, criticized, and classified loans will be influenced by the degree to which the economy strengthens or weakens, as well as the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the markets in which we operate. 

Summary of under-performing, criticized, and classified assets: 

September 30, December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2020 2019 2019 Total nonaccrual loans $ 137,611 &#160; $ 138,498 $ 126,412 TDRs still accruing 22,037 &#160; 18,884 18,338 Total past due loans (90 days or more and still accruing) 90 &#160; 703 570 Other real estate owned 1,248 &#160; 2,941 2,169 Total under-performing assets $ 160,986 &#160; $ 161,026 $ 147,489 Classified loans (includes nonaccrual, TDRs still accruing, past due 90 days, and other problem loans) $ 327,225 &#160; $ 285,188 $ 296,671 Other classified assets (1) 3,860 &#160; 2,556 2,933 Criticized loans 272,859 &#160; 233,519 234,841 Total criticized and classified assets $ 603,944 &#160; $ 521,263 $ 534,445 Asset Quality Ratios: Non-performing loans/total loans (2) (3) 1.15 &#160; % 1.31 % 1.19 % Under-performing assets/total loans and other real estate owned (4) 1.16 &#160; 1.34 1.22 Under-performing assets/total assets 0.72 &#160; 0.79 0.72 Allowance/under-performing assets (5) 81.61 &#160; 35.34 37.03 Allowance/nonaccrual loans (5) 95.48 &#160; 41.09 43.21 

(1) Includes one pooled trust preferred security and two insurance policies at September 30, 2020. 

(2) Loans exclude loans held for sale. 

(3) Non-performing loans include nonaccrual loans and TDRs still accruing. 

(4) Includes acquired loans that were recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. As such, the credit risk was incorporated in the fair value recorded and no allowance for loan losses was recorded at September 30, 2019 or December 31, 2019. 

(5) Beginning January 1, 2020, the allowance is based on current expected loss methodology. Prior to January 1, 2020, the allowance was based on incurred loss methodology. 

Under-performing assets totaled $161.0 million at September 30, 2020, compared to $161.0 million at September 30, 2019 and $147.5 million at December 31, 2019. Under-performing assets as a percentage of total loans and other real estate owned at September 30, 2020 were 1.16%, an 18 basis point improvement from 1.34% at September 30, 2019 and a 6 basis point improvement from 1.22% at December 31, 2019. 

Nonaccrual loans decreased from September 30, 2019 primarily due to decreases in commercial real estate and consumer nonaccrual loans, partially offset by an increase in residential real estate nonaccrual loans. As a percentage of nonaccrual loans, the allowance was 95.48% at September 30, 2020, compared to 41.09% at September 30, 2019 and 43.21% at December 31, 2019. Beginning January 1, 2020, the allowance is based on current expected loss methodology. Prior to January 1, 2020, the allowance was based on incurred loss methodology. 

Total criticized and classified assets were $603.9 million at September 30, 2020, an increase of $82.7 million from September 30, 2019, and an increase of $69.5 million from December 31, 2019. Other classified assets include investment securities that fell below investment grade rating totaling $3.9 million at September 30, 2020, compared to $2.6 million at September 30, 2019 and $2.9 million at December 31, 2019. 

Old National may choose to restructure the contractual terms of certain loans. The decision to restructure a loan, versus aggressively enforcing the collection of the loan, may benefit Old National by increasing the ultimate probability of collection. 

Any loans that are modified are reviewed by Old National to identify if a TDR has occurred, which is when, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, Old National Bank grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. Terms may be modified to fit the ability of the borrower to repay in line with its current financial status. The modification of the terms of such loans include one or a combination of the following: a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan, an extension of the maturity date at a stated rate of interest lower than the current market rate of new debt with similar risk, or a permanent reduction of the recorded investment of the loan. 

Loans modified in a TDR are typically placed on nonaccrual status until we determine the future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured, which generally requires that the borrower demonstrate a period of performance according to the restructured terms for six months. 

If we are unable to resolve a nonperforming loan issue, the credit will be charged off when it is apparent there will be a loss. For large commercial type loans, each relationship is individually analyzed for evidence of apparent loss based on quantitative benchmarks or subjectively based upon certain events or particular circumstances. Generally, Old National charges off small commercial loans scored through our small business credit center with contractual balances under $250,000 that are 90 days or more delinquent and do not have adequate collateral support. For residential and consumer loans, a charge off is recorded at the time foreclosure is initiated or when the loan becomes 120 to 180 days past due, whichever is earlier. 

For commercial TDRs, an allocated reserve is established within the allowance for credit losses for the difference between the carrying value of the loan and its computed value. To determine the computed value of the loan, one of the following methods is selected: (1) the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan&#8217;s original effective interest rate, (2) the loan&#8217;s observable market price, or (3) the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent. The allocated reserve is established as the difference between the carrying value of the loan and the collectable value. If there are significant changes in the amount or timing of the loan&#8217;s expected future cash flows, impairment is recalculated and the valuation allowance is adjusted accordingly. 

When a residential or consumer loan is identified as a TDR, the loan is typically written down to its collateral value less selling costs. 

At September 30, 2020, TDRs consisted of $8.8 million of commercial loans, $16.7 million of commercial real estate loans, $0.1 million of BBCC loans, $2.8 million of residential real estate loans, $0.7 million of direct consumer loans, and $0.3 million of home equity loans totaling $29.4 million. TDRs included within nonaccrual loans totaled $7.7 million at September 30, 2020. At December 31, 2019, TDRs consisted of $12.4 million of commercial loans, $14.2 million of commercial real estate loans, $0.6 million of BBCC loans, $3.1 million of residential real estate loans, $1.0 million of direct consumer loans, and $0.4 million of home equity loans totaling $31.7 million. TDRs included within nonaccrual loans totaled $13.8 million at December 31, 2019. 

Old National has allocated specific reserves to customers whose loan terms have been modified as TDRs totaling $0.3 million at September 30, 2020 and $0.9 million of December 31, 2019. At September 30, 2020, Old National had committed to lend an additional $0.7 million to customers with outstanding loans that are classified as TDRs, compared to $2.3 million at December 31, 2019. 

The terms of certain other loans were modified during 2020 and 2019 that did not meet the definition of a TDR. It is our process to review all classified and criticized loans that, during the period, have been renewed, have entered into a forbearance agreement, have gone from principal and interest to interest only, or have extended the maturity date. In order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification. The evaluation is performed under our internal underwriting policy. We also evaluate whether a concession has been granted or if we were adequately compensated through a market interest rate, additional collateral, or a bona fide guarantee. We also consider whether the modification was insignificant relative to the other terms of the agreement or the delay in a payment. 

In general, once a modified loan is considered a TDR, the loan will always be considered a TDR, and therefore impaired, until it is paid in full, otherwise settled, sold, or charged off. However, guidance also permits for loans to be removed from TDR status when subsequently restructured under these circumstances: (1) at the time of the subsequent restructuring, the borrower is not experiencing financial difficulties, and this is documented by a current credit evaluation at the time of the restructuring, (2) under the terms of the subsequent restructuring agreement, the institution has granted no concession to the borrower; and (3) the subsequent restructuring agreement includes 

market terms that are no less favorable than those that would be offered for a comparable new loan. For loans subsequently restructured that have cumulative principal forgiveness, the loan should continue to be measured in accordance with ASC 310-10, Receivables &#8211; Overall . However, consistent with ASC 310-40-50-2, Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors, Creditor Disclosure of Troubled Debt Restructurings , the loan would not be required to be reported in the years following the restructuring if the subsequent restructuring meets both of these criteria: (1) has an interest rate at the time of the subsequent restructuring that is not less than a market interest rate; and (2) is performing in compliance with its modified terms after the subsequent restructuring. 

We have developed relief programs to assist borrowers in financial need due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Interagency Statement issued by our banking regulators encourages financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations due to the effects of COVID-19. Additionally, Section 4013 of the CARES Act further provides that a qualified loan modification is exempt by law from classification as a TDR as defined by GAAP, from the period beginning March 1, 2020 until the earlier of December 31, 2020 or the date that is 60 days after the date on which the national emergency concerning the COVID-19 outbreak declared by the President of the United States under the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) terminates. The Interagency Statement was subsequently revised in April 2020 to clarify the interaction of the original guidance with Section 4013 of the CARES Act, as well as setting forth the banking regulators&#8217; views on consumer protection considerations. In accordance with such guidance, we are offering short-term modifications made in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who are current and otherwise not past due. These include short-term, 180 days or less, modifications in the form of payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or other delays in payment that are insignificant. The table below presents loan deferrals by loan category: 

(dollars in thousands) June 30, 2020 Deferrals Balance September 30, 2020 Deferrals Balance (1) September 30, 2020 Number of Deferrals Commercial and commercial real estate $ 1,170,119 &#160; $ 125,603 &#160; 105 &#160; Residential real estate 78,639 &#160; 1,654 &#160; 12 &#160; Consumer 54,786 &#160; 10,315 &#160; 368 &#160; Total $ 1,303,544 &#160; $ 137,572 &#160; 485 &#160; 

(1) Includes second deferrals between 90 and 180 days totaling $8.8 million of commercial and commercial real estate loans, $0.4 million of residential real estate loans, and $1.0 million of consumer loans. 

U.S. Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program 

Section 1102 of the CARES Act created the PPP, a program administered by the SBA to provide loans to small businesses for payroll and other basic expenses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Old National has participated in the PPP as a lender. These loans are eligible to be forgiven if certain conditions are satisfied and are fully guaranteed by the SBA. Additionally, loan payments will also be deferred for the first six months of the loan term. The PPP commenced on April 3, 2020 and was available to qualified borrowers through August 8, 2020. No collateral or personal guarantees are required. Neither the government nor lenders are permitted to charge the recipients any fees. 

Old National began accepting applications from qualified borrowers on April 3, 2020 and as of September 30, 2020 has originated over 9,700 loans with balances in excess of $1.5 billion to new and existing clients through the PPP. To the extent the PPP loans are forgiven, this represents outside equity contributions to our borrowers; and, especially with respect to vulnerable industries, we believe these capital injections are going to be instrumental in assisting our borrowers in navigating through the pandemic. This capital injection, along with the level of capital each borrower had just prior to COVID-19 impacting them, are critical factors in determining the staying power of our borrowers. Upon receipt of interim financial results from our borrowers, we will use that information to update our understanding of the underlying strengths or weaknesses in each individual relationship and take actions, as appropriate. 

The SBA recently announced a streamlined forgiveness process for loans of $50,000 or less. As of October 26, 2020, 2,482 of our loans totaling $512.8 million have been submitted to the SBA for forgiveness. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Unfunded Commitments 

Loan charge-offs, net of recoveries, totaled $3.0 million of net recoveries for the three months ended September 30, 2020, compared to $0.8 million of net charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2019. Annualized, net 

charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans were (0.09)% for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to 0.03% for the three months ended September 30, 2019. Loan charge-offs, net of recoveries, totaled $4.1 million of net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to $2.0 million of net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Annualized, net charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans were 0.04% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to 0.02% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Management will continue its efforts to reduce the level of non-performing loans and may consider the possibility of sales of troubled and non-performing loans, which could result in additional charge-offs to the allowance for credit losses on loans. 

Beginning January 1, 2020, we calculated allowance for credit losses using current expected credit losses methodology. As of January 1, 2020, Old National increased the allowance for credit losses for loans by $41.3 million and increased the allowance for credit losses for unfunded loan commitments by $4.5 million, since the ASU covers credit losses over the expected life of a loan as well as considering future changes in macroeconomic conditions. The increase related to the acquired loan portfolio totaled $27.1 million. 

Credit quality within the loans held for investment portfolio is continuously monitored by management and is reflected within the allowance for credit losses for loans. The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of expected losses inherent within the Company&#8217;s loans held for investment portfolio. Credit quality is assessed and monitored by evaluating various attributes and the results of those evaluations are utilized in underwriting new loans and in our process for estimating expected credit losses. Expected credit loss inherent in non-cancelable off-balance-sheet credit exposures is accounted for as a separate liability included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The allowance for credit losses for loans held for investment is adjusted by a credit loss expense, which is reported in earnings, and reduced by the charge-off of loan amounts, net of recoveries. Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. 

The allowance for credit loss estimation process involves procedures to appropriately consider the unique characteristics of its loan portfolio segments. These segments are further disaggregated into loan classes, the level at which credit risk is monitored. When computing the level of expected credit losses, credit loss assumptions are estimated using a model that categorizes loan pools based on loss history, delinquency status, and other credit trends and risk characteristics, including current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In future periods evaluations of the overall loan portfolio, in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance and credit loss expense in those future periods. 

The allowance level is influenced by loan volumes, loan AQR migration or delinquency status, changes in historical loss experience, and other conditions influencing loss expectations, such as reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. The methodology for estimating the amount of expected credit losses reported in the allowance for credit losses has two basic components: first, an asset-specific component involving individual loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans and the measurement of expected credit losses for such individual loans; and second, a pooled component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics. 

At September 30, 2020, the allowance for credit losses for loans was $131.4 million. Continued loan growth in future periods, a decline in our current level of recoveries, or an increase in charge-offs could result in an increase in provision expense. Additionally, with the adoption of CECL beginning on January 1, 2020, provision expense may become more volatile due to changes in CECL model assumptions of credit quality, macroeconomic factors and conditions, and loan composition, which drive the allowance for credit losses balance. 

Prior to January 1, 2020, we calculated allowance for loan losses using incurred losses methodology. At December 31, 2019, the allowance for loan losses was $54.6 million. 

We maintain an allowance for credit losses on unfunded commercial lending commitments and letters of credit to provide for the risk of loss inherent in these arrangements. The allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for credit losses for loans, modified to take into account the probability of a drawdown on the commitment. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments is classified as a liability account on the balance sheet and totaled $11.0 million at September 30, 2020. 

Prior to January 1, 2020, we calculated allowance for losses on unfunded loan commitments using incurred losses methodology. At December 31, 2019, the allowance losses on unfunded commitments was $2.7 million. 

Market Risk 

Market risk is the risk that the estimated fair value of our assets, liabilities, and derivative financial instruments will decline as a result of changes in interest rates or financial market volatility, or that our net income will be significantly reduced by interest rate changes. 

The objective of our interest rate management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity. 

Potential cash flows, sales, or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities, especially those that earn or pay interest, are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. This interest rate risk arises primarily from our normal business activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors affect our exposure to changes in interest rates, such as general economic and financial conditions, customer preferences, historical pricing relationships, and re-pricing characteristics of financial instruments. Our earnings can also be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. Government and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve. 

In managing interest rate risk, we, through the Funds Management Committee, a committee of the Board of Directors, establish guidelines, for asset and liability management, including measurement of short and long-term sensitivities to changes in interest rates. Based on the results of our analysis, we may use different techniques to manage changing trends in interest rates including: 

&#8226; adjusting balance sheet mix or altering interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities; 

&#8226; changing product pricing strategies; 

&#8226; modifying characteristics of the investment securities portfolio; or 

&#8226; using derivative financial instruments, to a limited degree. 

A key element in our ongoing process is to measure and monitor interest rate risk using a model to quantify the impact of changing interest rates on Old National. The model quantifies the effects of various possible interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income. The model measures the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario. The base case scenario assumes that the balance sheet and interest rates are held at current levels. Interest rates are floored at 0.00% in the down 50 basis points scenario. The model shows our projected net interest income sensitivity based on interest rate changes only and does not consider other forecast assumptions. 

The following table illustrates our projected net interest income sensitivity over a two year cumulative horizon based on the asset/liability model at September 30, 2020 and 2019:

Our asset sensitivity increased year over year primarily due to deposit pricing actions and changes in our hedging strategies, balance sheet mix, investment duration, and prepayment speed behavior. 

A key element in the measurement and modeling of interest rate risk is the re-pricing assumptions of our transaction deposit accounts, which have no contractual maturity dates. Because the models are driven by expected behavior in various interest rate scenarios and many factors besides market interest rates affect our net interest income, we recognize that model outputs are not guarantees of actual results. For this reason, we model many different combinations of interest rates and balance sheet assumptions to understand our overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes, including shocks, ramps, yield curve flattening, yield curve steepening, as well as forecasts of likely interest rate scenarios tested. At September 30, 2020, our projected net interest income sensitivity based on the asset/liability models we utilize was within the limits of our interest rate risk policy for the scenarios tested. 

We use cash flow and fair value hedges, primarily interest rate swaps, collars, and floors, to mitigate interest rate risk. Derivatives designated as hedging instruments were in a net asset position with a fair value of $16.4 million at September 30, 2020, compared to a net asset position with a fair value of $6.1 million at December 31, 2019. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivative financial instruments. 

Liquidity Risk 

Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments, or may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources. The Funds Management Committee of the Board of Directors establishes liquidity risk guidelines and, along with the Balance Sheet Management Committee, monitors liquidity risk. The objective of liquidity management is to ensure we have the ability to fund balance sheet growth and meet deposit and debt obligations in a timely and cost-effective manner. Management monitors liquidity through a regular review of asset and liability maturities, funding sources, and loan and deposit forecasts. We maintain strategic and contingency liquidity plans to ensure sufficient available funding to satisfy requirements for balance sheet growth, properly manage capital markets&#8217; funding sources and to address unexpected liquidity requirements. On June 5, 2020, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the SEC that permits us to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities. 

Loan repayments and maturing investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds. However, deposit flows, calls of investment securities and prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities are strongly influenced by interest rates, the housing market, general and local economic conditions, and competition in the marketplace. We continually monitor marketplace trends to identify patterns that might improve the predictability of the timing of deposit flows or asset prepayments. 

A maturity schedule for Old National Bank&#8217;s brokered certificates of deposit and other time deposits is shown in the following table at September 30, 2020.

Our ability to acquire funding at competitive prices is influenced by rating agencies&#8217; views of our credit quality, liquidity, capital, and earnings. Moody&#8217;s Investor Service places us in an investment grade that indicates a low risk of default. For both Old National and Old National Bank: 

&#8226; Moody&#8217;s Investor Service affirmed the Long-Term Rating of A3 of Old National&#8217;s senior unsecured/issuer rating on February 3, 2020. 

&#8226; Moody&#8217;s Investor Service affirmed Old National Bank&#8217;s long-term deposit rating of Aa3 on February 3, 2020. The bank&#8217;s short-term deposit rating was affirmed at P-1 and the bank&#8217;s issuer rating was affirmed at A3. 

The rating outlook from Moody&#8217;s Investor Service is stable. Moody&#8217;s Investor Service concluded a rating review of Old National Bank on February 3, 2020. 

The credit ratings of Old National and Old National Bank at September 30, 2020 are shown in the following table.

Old National Bank maintains relationships in capital markets with brokers and dealers to issue certificates of deposit and short-term and medium-term bank notes as well. At September 30, 2020, Old National and its subsidiaries had the following availability of liquid funds and borrowings: 

(dollars in thousands) Parent Company Subsidiaries Available liquid funds: Cash and due from banks $ 66,668 $ 264,082 Unencumbered government-issued debt securities &#8212; 2,194,906 Unencumbered investment grade municipal securities &#8212; 780,672 Unencumbered corporate securities &#8212; 158,671 Availability of borrowings: Amount available from Federal Reserve discount window* &#8212; 457,621 Amount available from Federal Home Loan Bank Indianapolis* &#8212; 109,093 Total available funds $ 66,668 $ 3,965,045 

* Based on collateral pledged 

Old National Bancorp has routine funding requirements consisting primarily of operating expenses, dividends to shareholders, debt service, net derivative cash flows, and funds used for acquisitions. Old National Bancorp can obtain funding to meet its obligations from dividends and management fees collected from its subsidiaries, operating line of credit, and through the issuance of debt securities. Additionally, Old National Bancorp has a shelf registration in place with the SEC permitting ready access to the public debt and equity markets. At September 30, 2020, Old National Bancorp&#8217;s other borrowings outstanding were $213.2 million. 

Federal banking laws regulate the amount of dividends that may be paid by banking subsidiaries without prior approval. Prior regulatory approval is required if dividends to be declared in any year would exceed net earnings of the current year plus retained net profits for the preceding two years. Prior regulatory approval to pay dividends was not required in 2019 and is not currently required. 

Operational/Technology/Cyber Risk 

Operational/technology/cyber risk is the potential that inadequate information systems, operational problems, breaches in internal controls, information security breaches, fraud, or unforeseen catastrophes will result in unexpected losses. We maintain frameworks, programs, and internal controls to prevent or minimize financial loss from failure of systems, people, or processes. This includes specific programs and frameworks intended to prevent or limit the effects of cyber risks including cyber-attacks or other information security breaches that might allow unauthorized transactions or unauthorized access to customer, associate, or company sensitive information. Metrics and measurements are used by Executive Leaders in the management of day-to-day operations to ensure effective customer service, minimization of service disruptions, and oversight of operational and cyber risk. We continually monitor and report on operational, technology, and cyber risks related to clients, products, and business practices; external and internal fraud; business disruptions and systems failures; cyber-attacks, information security or data breaches; damage to physical assets; and execution, delivery, and process management. 

The Enterprise Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for the oversight, guidance, and monitoring of risks, including operational/technology/cyber risks, being taken by the Company. The monitoring is accomplished through ongoing review of management reports, data on risks, policy limits and discussion on enterprise risk management strategies, policies, and risk assessments. 

Regulatory/Compliance/Legal Risk 

Regulatory/compliance/legal risk is the risk that the Company violated or was not in compliance with applicable laws, regulations or practices, industry standards, or ethical standards. The legal portion assesses the risk that unenforceable contracts, lawsuits, or adverse judgments can disrupt or otherwise negatively impact the Company. The Board of Directors expects we will perform business in a manner compliant with applicable laws and/or regulations and expects issues to be identified, analyzed, and remediated in a timely and complete manner. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

Off-balance sheet arrangements include commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees. Commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees are used to meet the financial needs of our customers. Our banking affiliates have entered into various agreements to extend credit, including loan commitments of $3.511 billion and standby letters of credit of $88.5 million at September 30, 2020. At September 30, 2020, approximately $3.238 billion of the loan commitments had fixed rates and $272.1 million had floating rates, with the floating rates ranging from 0% to 13%. At December 31, 2019, loan commitments were $2.779 billion and standby letters of credit were $87.8 million. The term of these off-balance sheet arrangements is typically one year or less. 

Old National is a party in risk participation transactions of interest rate swaps, which had total notional amount of $47.6 million at September 30, 2020. 

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 

The following table presents our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations at September 30, 2020: 

&#160; Payments Due In &#160; (dollars in thousands) One Year or Less (1) One to Three Years Three to Five Years Over Five Years Total Deposits without stated maturity $ 15,243,145 $ &#8212; $ &#8212; $ &#8212; $ 15,243,145 IRAs, consumer, and brokered certificates of deposit 416,187 705,644 110,645 30,873 1,263,349 Federal funds purchased and interbank borrowings 1,259 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 1,259 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase 399,141 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 399,141 FHLB advances 150,000 50,500 125,160 1,761,988 2,087,648 Other borrowings 250 2,098 177,302 58,033 237,683 Fixed interest payments (2) 10,110 78,716 72,376 82,034 243,236 Operating leases 3,735 27,621 17,317 57,791 106,464 Other long-term liabilities (3) 17,496 15,099 131 21 32,747 

(1) For the remaining three months of fiscal 2020. 

(2) Our senior notes, subordinated notes, certain trust preferred securities, and certain FHLB advances have fixed rates ranging from 0.13% to 4.96%. All of our other long-term debt is at LIBOR based variable rates at September 30, 2020. The projected variable interest assumes no increase in LIBOR rates from September 30, 2020. 

(3) Includes unfunded commitments on qualified affordable housing projects and other tax credit investments. 

We rent certain premises and equipment under operating leases. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on long-term lease arrangements. 

We are party to various derivative contracts as a means to manage the balance sheet and our related exposure to changes in interest rates, to manage our residential real estate loan origination and sale activity, and to provide derivative contracts to our clients. Since the derivative liabilities recorded on the balance sheet change frequently and do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under these contracts, these liabilities are not included in the table of contractual obligations presented above. Further discussion of derivative instruments is included in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. 

In the normal course of business, various legal actions and proceedings are pending against us and our affiliates which are incidental to the business in which they are engaged. Further discussion of contingent liabilities is included in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. 

In addition, liabilities recorded under FASB ASC 740-10 (FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes &#8211; an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 ) are not included in the table because the amount and timing of any cash payments cannot be reasonably estimated. Further discussion of income taxes and liabilities is included in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

Our accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Certain accounting policies require management to 

use significant judgment and estimates, which can have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities. We consider these policies to be critical accounting policies. The judgment and assumptions made are based upon historical experience or other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgment and assumptions, actual results could differ from estimates, which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

The following accounting policies materially affect our reported earnings and financial condition and require significant judgments and estimates. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with our Audit Committee. 

Goodwill 

&#8226; Description. For acquisitions, we are required to record the assets acquired, including identified intangible assets, and the liabilities assumed at their fair value. These often involve estimates based on third party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques that may include estimates of attrition, inflation, asset growth rates, or other relevant factors. Goodwill recorded must be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, as well as on an interim basis if events or changes indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss must be recognized for any excess of carrying value over fair value of the goodwill. 

&#8226; Judgments and Uncertainties. The determination of fair values is based on valuations using management&#8217;s assumptions of future growth rates, future attrition, discount rates, multiples of earnings or other relevant factors. 

&#8226; Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions. Changes in these factors, as well as downturns in economic or business conditions, could have a significant adverse impact on the carrying value of goodwill and could result in impairment losses affecting our financial statements as a whole and our banking subsidiary in which the goodwill resides. 

&#8226; Pandemic. A prolonged COVID-19 outbreak, or any other epidemic that harms the global economy, U.S. economy, or the economies in which we operate could adversely affect our operations. Based on the required annual impairment test as of August 31, 2020, we have concluded that our goodwill was not impaired. On a quarterly basis, we continue to evaluate our qualitative assessment assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, including: (1) forecasted revenues, expenses, and cash flows; (2) current discount rates; (3) our market capitalization; (4) observable market transactions and multiples; (5) changes to the regulatory environment; and (6) the nature and amount of government support that has been and is expected to be provided in the future. A prolonged economic downturn or deterioration in the economic outlook may lead management to conclude that an interim quantitative impairment test of our goodwill is required prior to the annual impairment test conducted on August 31. 

Allowance for Credit Losses for Loans 

&#8226; Description. The allowance for credit losses for loans represents management&#8217;s estimate of all expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of our loan portfolio. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the then-existing loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in those future periods. 

The allowance for credit losses for loans, as reported in our consolidated statements of financial condition, is adjusted by an expense for credit losses, which is recognized in earnings, and reduced by the charge-off of loan amounts, net of recoveries. 

&#8226; Judgments and Uncertainties. We utilize a discounted cashflow approach to determine the allowance for credit losses for performing loans and nonperforming loans. Expected cashflows are created for each loan and discounted using the effective yield. The discounted sum of expected cashflows is then compared to the amortized cost and any shortfall is recorded as reserve. Expected cashflows are created using a combination of contractual payment schedules, calculated PDs, LGD and prepayment assumptions as well as qualitative factors. For the commercial and commercial real estate loans, the PD is forecast using a regression model to determine the likelihood of a loan moving into nonaccrual within the time horizon. For residential and consumer loans, the PD is forecast using a regression model to determine the likelihood of a loan being charged-off within the time horizon. The regression models use combinations of variables to assess 

systematic and unsystematic risk. Variables used for unsystematic risk are borrower specific and help to gauge the risk of default from an individual borrower. Variables for systematic risk, risk inherent to all borrowers, come from the use of forward-looking economic forecasts and include variables such as unemployment rate, gross domestic product, and house price index. The LGD is defined as credit loss incurred when an obligor of the bank defaults. Qualitative factors include items such as changes in lending policies or procedures and economic uncertainty in forward-looking forecasts. 

&#8226; Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions. The allowance represents management&#8217;s best estimate, but significant downturns in circumstances relating to loan quality and economic conditions could result in a requirement for additional allowance. Likewise, an upturn in loan quality and improved economic conditions may allow a reduction in the required allowance. In either instance, unanticipated changes could have a significant impact on results of operations. 

The expense for credit loss recorded through earnings is the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for credit losses at the amount of expected credit losses inherent within the loans held for investment portfolio. The amount of expense and the corresponding level of allowance for credit losses for loans are based on our evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and other significant qualitative and quantitative factors. 

Derivative Financial Instruments 

&#8226; Description. As part of our overall interest rate risk management, we use derivative instruments to reduce exposure to changes in interest rates and market prices for financial instruments. The application of the hedge accounting policy requires judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness, identification of similar hedged item groupings and measurement of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and hedged items. To the extent hedging relationships are found to be effective, changes in fair value of the derivatives are offset by changes in the fair value of the related hedged item or recorded to other comprehensive income. Management believes hedge effectiveness is evaluated properly in preparation of the financial statements. All of the derivative financial instruments we use have an active market and indications of fair value can be readily obtained. We are not using the &#8220;short-cut&#8221; method of accounting for any fair value derivatives. 

&#8226; Judgments and Uncertainties. The application of the hedge accounting policy requires judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness, identification of similar hedged item groupings and measurement of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and hedged items. 

&#8226; Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions. To the extent hedging relationships are found to be effective, changes in fair value of the derivatives are offset by changes in the fair value of the related hedged item or recorded to other comprehensive income. However, if in the future the derivative financial instruments used by us no longer qualify for hedge accounting treatment, all changes in fair value of the derivative would flow through the consolidated statements of income in other noninterest income, resulting in greater volatility in our earnings. 

Income Taxes 

&#8226; Description. We are subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states, and the municipalities in which we operate. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities. We review income tax expense and the carrying value of deferred tax assets quarterly; and as new information becomes available, the balances are adjusted as appropriate. FASB ASC 740-10 (FIN 48) prescribes a recognition threshold of more-likely-than-not, and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of our provision and related income tax assets and liabilities. 

&#8226; Judgments and Uncertainties. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review/adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. 

&#8226; Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions. Although management believes that the judgments and estimates used are reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would result in a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. 

Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to it in this &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221;
