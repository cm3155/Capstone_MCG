 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion is an analysis of our results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, and financial condition as of March 31, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes, as well as our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(6) Includes the allowance for credit losses on loans and unfunded loan commitments. 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

The Company&#8217;s accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and general practices within the banking industry. As a supplement to GAAP, the Company provides non-GAAP performance results, which the Company believes are useful because they assist investors in assessing the Company&#8217;s operating performance. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in the following table. 

The taxable equivalent adjustment to net interest income and net interest margin recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable and tax-exempt assets. Interest income and yields on tax-exempt securities and loans are presented using the current federal income tax rate of 21%. Management believes that it is standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest income and net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis and that it may enhance comparability for peer comparison purposes. 

In management&#8217;s view, tangible common equity measures are capital adequacy metrics that may be meaningful to the Company, as well as analysts and investors, in assessing the Company&#8217;s use of equity and in facilitating comparisons with peers. These non-GAAP measures are valuable indicators of a financial institution&#8217;s capital strength since they eliminate intangible assets from shareholders&#8217; equity and retain the effect of AOCI in shareholders&#8217; equity. 

Although intended to enhance investors&#8217; understanding of the Company&#8217;s business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from those used by other financial institutions to assess their business and performance. See the previously provided tables and the following reconciliations in the &#8220;Non-GAAP Reconciliations&#8221; section for details on the calculation of these measures to the extent presented herein. 

The following table presents GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for the previous five quarters:

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Old National is the largest financial holding company headquartered in the state of Indiana and the sixth largest Midwestern bank by asset size with consolidated assets of $48 billion at March 31, 2023. The Company&#8217;s corporate headquarters and principal executive office is located in Evansville, Indiana with commercial and consumer banking operations headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. Old National, through Old National Bank, provides a wide range of banking services throughout the Midwest region, including commercial and consumer loan and depository services, and other traditional banking services. Old National also provides services to supplement its traditional banking business including fiduciary and wealth management services, investment and brokerage services, investment consulting, and other financial services. 

Net income applicable to common shareholders for the first quarter of 2023 was $142.6 million, or $0.49 per diluted common share, compared to $196.7 million, or $0.67 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2022 and $29.6 million net loss, or $(0.13) per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2022. 

Results for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were impacted by $14.6 million of merger-related charges, compared to $20.3 million and $52.3 million for the fourth and first quarters of 2022, respectively. The first quarter of 2022 merger-related charges included $11.0 million attributable to the provision for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments. In addition, the first quarter of 2022 provision expense included $96.3 million of provision for credit losses to establish an allowance for credit losses on non-PCD loans acquired in the First Midwest merger. The first quarter of 2023 was also impacted by $1.3 million of property optimization expenses and $5.2 million in debt securities losses. Property optimization costs for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $26.8 million. 

We achieved strong results during the first quarter of 2023, including stable total deposits, ample liquidity, strong credit quality, disciplined expense management, and loan growth. 

Deposits : Period-end total deposits were stable at $34.9 billion, including normal seasonal patterns in public funds compared to December 31, 2022. 

Loans : Our loan balances, excluding loans held for sale, increased $698.7 million to $31.8 billion at March 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022. This was primarily driven by disciplined commercial loan growth. 

Net Interest Income : Net interest income decreased $9.6 million to $381.5 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 driven by loan growth and the higher rate environment, which were more than offset by higher funding costs, fewer days in the quarter, and lower accretion income on loans. 

Noninterest Income : Noninterest income decreased $94.4 million to $70.7 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 reflecting $5.2 million of net debt securities losses in the first quarter of 2023 and a $90.7 million gain on the sale of health savings accounts in the fourth quarter of 2022. The remaining change was impacted by higher capital markets income as well as wealth management and investment product fees, partially offset by lower service charges on deposit accounts and debit card and ATM fees. In addition, mortgage banking revenue continues to be impacted by the higher rate environment and lower gain on sale margins. 

Noninterest Expense : Noninterest expense decreased $32.0 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 primarily due to lower merger-related and property optimization expenses, lower salary and employee benefits and tax credit amortization, partly offset by higher FDIC assessment and technology expenses. Noninterest expense included $14.6 million of merger-related expenses and $1.3 million of property optimization expenses, compared to $20.3 million and $26.8 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2022.

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is the most significant component of our earnings, comprising 84% of revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by many factors, primarily the volume and mix of earning assets, funding sources, and interest rate fluctuations. Other factors include the level of accretion income on purchased loans, prepayment risk on mortgage and investment-related assets, and the composition and maturity of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 

Interest rates increased during the first quarter of 2023. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s Federal Funds Rate is currently in a target range of 4.75% to 5.00%, with the Effective Federal Funds Rate at 4.83% at March 31, 2023. Management actively takes balance sheet restructuring, derivative, and deposit pricing actions to help mitigate interest rate risk. See the section of this Item 7 titled &#8220;Market Risk&#8221; for additional information regarding this risk. 

Loans typically generate more interest income than investment securities with similar maturities. Funding from client deposits generally costs less than wholesale funding sources. Factors such as general economic activity, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and price volatility of competing alternative investments, can also exert significant influence on our ability to optimize our mix of assets and funding, net interest income, and net interest margin. 

Net interest income is the excess of interest received from interest-earning assets over interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. For analytical purposes, net interest income is presented in the table that follows, adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis to reflect what our tax-exempt assets would need to yield in order to achieve the same after-tax yield as a taxable asset. We used the current federal statutory tax rate in effect of 21% for all periods. This analysis portrays the income tax benefits related to tax-exempt assets and helps to facilitate a comparison between taxable and tax-exempt assets. Management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest margin and net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis and that it may enhance comparability for peer comparison purposes for both management and investors. 

The following tables present the average balance sheet for each major asset and liability category, its related interest income and yield, or its expense and rate.

(1) The variance not solely due to rate or volume is allocated equally between the rate and volume variances. 

(2) Interest on investment securities and loans includes the effect of taxable equivalent adjustments of $3.0 million and $2.7 million, respectively, during the three months ended March 31, 2023 using the federal statutory rate in effect of 21%. 

The increase in net interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 when compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily due to higher rates and loan growth. Partially offsetting these increases were higher costs of average interest-bearing liabilities and higher average interest-bearing liabilities. Accretion income associated with acquired loans and borrowings totaled $7.9 million three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $15.9 million three months ended March 31, 2022. 

The increase in the net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis for the three months ended March 31, 2023 when compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily due to higher yields on interest earning assets, partially offset by higher costs of interest-bearing liabilities. The yield on interest earning assets increased 175 basis points and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 134 basis points in the quarterly year-over-year comparison. Accretion income represented 8 basis points of the net interest margin in the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to 20 basis points in the three months ended March 31, 2022. 

Average earning assets were $41.9 billion and $31.5 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of $10.5 billion, or 33%. The increase in average earning assets was primarily due to the merger with First Midwest and strong loan growth. 

Average loans including loans held for sale increased $10.5 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 when compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to the First Midwest merger and strong organic loan growth. 

Average investments increased $764.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, when compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to the First Midwest merger. 

Average noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits increased $2.2 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 when compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to the First Midwest merger. 

Average borrowed funds increased $2.4 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 when compared to the same period in 2022. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

Old National recorded provision for credit losses on loans of $11.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $97.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The provision for credit losses on loans in the three months ended March 31, 2022 included $96.3 million to establish an allowance for credit losses on non-PCD loans acquired in the First Midwest merger. Net charge-offs on loans totaled $16.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to net charge-offs of $2.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Net charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2023 included $12.4 million in PCD charge-offs. Provision for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments totaled $2.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $11.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The provision for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments in the three months ended March 31, 2022 included $11.0 million for unfunded loan commitments acquired in the First Midwest merger. Continued loan growth in future periods, a decline in our current level of recoveries, or an increase in charge-offs could result in an increase in provision expense. Additionally, provision expense may be volatile due to changes in CECL model assumptions of credit quality, macroeconomic factors and conditions, and loan composition, which drive the allowance for credit losses balance. 

Noninterest Income 

We generate revenues in the form of noninterest income through client fees, sales commissions, and gains and losses from our core banking franchise and other related businesses, such as wealth management, investment consulting, and investment products. The following table details the components in noninterest income: 

Three Months Ended March 31, % (dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Change Wealth management fees $ 18,760 &#160; $ 14,630 28.2 % Service charges on deposit accounts 17,003 &#160; 14,026 21.2 Debit card and ATM fees 9,982 &#160; 7,599 31.4 Mortgage banking revenue 3,400 &#160; 7,245 (53.1) Investment product fees 8,160 &#160; 7,322 11.4 Capital markets income 6,939 &#160; 4,442 56.2 Company-owned life insurance 3,186 &#160; 3,524 (9.6) Debt securities gains (losses), net (5,216) 342 N/M Other income 8,467 &#160; 6,110 38.6 Total noninterest income $ 70,681 &#160; $ 65,240 8.3 % 

Noninterest income increased $5.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 when compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to the First Midwest merger in February of 2022. The increase in noninterest income was partially offset by $5.2 million of net losses on sales of debt securities in the three months ended March 31, 2023 and lower mortgage banking revenue, which continues to be impacted by the higher rate environment and lower gain on sale margins. 

Noninterest Expense 

The following table details the components in noninterest expense:

Noninterest expense increased $35.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 when compared to the same period in 2022 reflective of the additional operating costs associated with the First Midwest merger and higher FDIC assessment expense. Noninterest expense included $14.6 million of merger-related expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $41.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. 

Amortization of tax credit investments increased $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 when compared to the same period in 2022. The recognition of tax credit amortization expense is contingent upon the successful completion of the rehabilitation of a historic building or completion of a solar project within the reporting period. Many factors including weather, labor availability, building regulations, inspections, and other unexpected construction delays related to a rehabilitation project can cause a project to exceed its estimated completion date. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our tax credit investments. 

Provision for Income Taxes 

We record a provision for income taxes currently payable and for income taxes payable or benefits to be received in the future, which arise due to timing differences in the recognition of certain items for financial statement and income tax purposes. The major difference between the effective tax rate applied to our financial statement income and the federal statutory tax rate is caused by a tax benefit from our tax credit investments and interest on tax-exempt securities and loans. The effective tax rate was 22.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to 24.0% for the same period in 2022. In accordance with ASC 740-270, Accounting for Interim Reporting, the provision for income taxes was recorded at March 31, 2023 based on the current estimate of the effective annual rate. The lower effective tax rate during the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily the result of higher tax-exempt income and tax credits and a decrease in non-deductible merger-related expenses. These benefits were partially offset by increases in non-deductible officer compensation and non-deductible FDIC premiums. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Overview 

At March 31, 2023, our assets were $47.8 billion, a $1.1 billion increase compared to assets of $46.8 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase was driven by disciplined loan growth and higher cash balances funded through stable deposits and higher borrowings. 

Earning Assets 

Our earning assets are comprised of investment securities, portfolio loans, loans held for sale, money market investments, interest earning accounts with the Federal Reserve, and equity securities. Earning assets were $42.8 

billion at March 31, 2023, a $1.2 billion increase compared to earning assets of $41.6 billion at December 31, 2022 driven primarily by loan growth. 

Investment Securities 

We classify the majority of our investment securities as available-for-sale to give management the flexibility to sell the securities prior to maturity if needed, based on fluctuating interest rates or changes in our funding requirements. During 2022, we transferred $3.0 billion of securities available-for-sale to held-to-maturity due to rising interest rates and related effects on the value of our investment securities. 

Equity securities are recorded at fair value and totaled $72.2 million at March 31, 2023 compared to $52.5 million at December 31, 2022. 

The investment securities portfolio, including equity securities, was $10.2 billion at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Investment securities represented 24% of earning assets at March 31, 2023, compared to 25% at December 31, 2022. At March 31, 2023, we had no intent to sell any securities that were in an unrealized loss position nor is it expected that we would be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery. 

The investment securities available-for-sale portfolio had net unrealized losses of $814.5 million at March 31, 2023, compared to net unrealized losses of $844.4 million at December 31, 2022. The investment securities held-to-maturity portfolio had net unrealized losses of $407.8 million at March 31, 2023, compared to net unrealized losses of $445.5 million at December 31, 2022. Net unrealized losses decreased from December 31, 2022 to March 31, 2023 primarily due to a decline in market interest rates. 

The investment securities available-for-sale portfolio including securities hedges had an effective duration of 4.43 at March 31, 2023, compared to 4.57 at December 31, 2022. The total investment securities portfolio had an effective duration of 5.57 at March 31, 2023, compared to 6.45 at December 31, 2022. Effective duration represents the percentage change in the fair value of the portfolio in response to a change in interest rates and is used to evaluate the portfolio&#8217;s price volatility at a single point in time. Generally, there is more uncertainty in interest rates over a longer average maturity, resulting in a higher duration percentage. The annualized average yields on investment securities, on a taxable equivalent basis, were 2.95% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to 2.14% for the three months ended March 31, 2022. 

Commercial and Commercial Real Estate Loans 

Commercial and commercial real estate loans are the largest classifications within earning assets, representing 53% of earning assets at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. At March 31, 2023, commercial and commercial real estate loans were $22.7 billion, an increase of $694.3 million compared to December 31, 2022 driven by disciplined loan production in the three months ended March 31, 2023 that was well balanced across our market footprint and product lines. 

The following table provides detail on commercial loans by industry classification (as defined by the North American Industry Classification System) and by loan size.

Residential Real Estate Loans 

At March 31, 2023, residential real estate loans held in our loan portfolio were $6.6 billion, an increase of $108.2 million compared to December 31, 2022. Future increases in interest rates could result in a decline in the level of refinancings and new originations of residential real estate loans. 

Consumer Loans 

Consumer loans, including automobile loans, personal, and home equity loans and lines of credit, decreased $103.8 million to $2.6 billion at March 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022.

We use wholesale funding to augment deposit funding and to help maintain our desired interest rate risk position. Wholesale funding as a percentage of total funding was 16% at March 31, 2023 and 14% at December 31, 2022. 

Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities 

Accrued expenses and other liabilities at March 31, 2023 decreased $133.9 million from December 31, 2022 primarily due to incentive payments during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and lower derivative liabilities. 

Capital &#160; 

Shareholders&#8217; equity totaled $5.3 billion at March 31, 2023, compared to $5.1 billion at December 31, 2022. This increase was driven by retained earnings along with changes in unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives and available-for-sale investment securities. These increases were partially offset by dividends and the repurchase of 1.8 million shares of Common Stock in the three months ended March 31, 2023 under a stock repurchase plan that was approved by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, which reduced equity by $29.5 million. 

Capital Adequacy 

Old National and the banking industry are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. At March 31, 2023, Old National and its bank subsidiary exceeded the regulatory minimums and Old National Bank met the regulatory definition of &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; based on the most recent regulatory definition. 

Old National&#8217;s consolidated capital position remains strong as evidenced by the following comparisons of key industry ratios. 

Regulatory Guidelines Minimum Prompt Corrective Action "Well Capitalized" Guidelines March 31, December 31, 2023 2022 2022 Risk-based capital: Tier 1 capital to total average assets (leverage ratio) 4.00 % N/A % 8.53 &#160; % 10.58 % 8.52 % Common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-adjusted total assets 7.00 N/A 9.98 &#160; 10.04 10.03 Tier 1 capital to risk-adjusted total assets 8.50 6.00 10.64 &#160; 10.79 10.71 Total capital to risk-adjusted total assets 10.50 10.00 11.96 &#160; 12.19 12.02 Shareholders' equity to assets N/A N/A 11.03 &#160; 11.42 10.97 

Old National Bank, Old National&#8217;s bank subsidiary, maintained a strong capital position as evidenced by the following comparisons of key industry ratios.

During 2020, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC issued final rules to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from the implementation of CECL. The final rules provide banking organizations the option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period (five-year transition option). Old National adopted the capital transition relief over the permissible five-year period. 

Management views stress testing as an integral part of the Company&#8217;s risk management and strategic planning activities. Old National performs stress testing periodically throughout the year. The primary objective of the stress test is to ensure that Old National has a robust, forward-looking stress testing process and maintains sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress. Management also uses the stress testing framework to evaluate decisions relating to pricing, loan concentrations, capital deployment, and mergers and acquisitions to ensure that strategic decisions align with Old National&#8217;s risk appetite statement. Old National&#8217;s stress testing process incorporates key risks that include strategic, market, liquidity, credit, operational, regulatory, compliance, legal, and reputational risks. Old National&#8217;s stress testing policy outlines steps that will be taken if stress test results do not meet internal thresholds under severely adverse economic scenarios. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Overview 

Old National has adopted a Risk Appetite Statement to enable our Board of Directors, Executive Leadership Team, and Senior Management to better assess, understand, monitor, and mitigate Old National&#8217;s risks. The Risk Appetite Statement addresses the following major risks: strategic, market, liquidity, credit, operational, talent management, compliance and regulatory, legal, and reputational. Our Chief Risk Officer is independent of all other management and provides quarterly reports to the Board&#8217;s Enterprise Risk Committee. The following discussion addresses certain of these major risks including credit, market, and liquidity. Discussion of operational, compliance and regulatory, legal, strategic, talent management, and reputational risks is provided in the section entitled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Credit Risk 

Credit risk represents the risk of loss arising from an obligor&#8217;s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms. Our primary credit risks result from our investment and lending activities. 

Asset Quality 

We lend to commercial and commercial real estate clients in many diverse industries including, among others, real estate rental and leasing, manufacturing, healthcare, wholesale trade, construction, and agriculture. Old National manages concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, client relationship, and loan size. At March 31, 2023, our average commercial loan size was approximately $720,000 and our average commercial real estate loan size was approximately $1,300,000. In addition, while loans to lessors of residential and non-residential real estate exceed 10% of total loans, no individual sub-segment category within those broader categories reaches the 10% threshold. At March 31, 2023, we had minimal exposure to foreign borrowers and no sovereign debt. Our policy is to concentrate our lending activity in the geographic market areas we serve, primarily in the Midwest region.

(2) Includes investment securities that fell below investment grade rating. 

(3) Loans exclude loans held for sale. 

(4) Non-performing loans include nonaccrual loans and TDRs still accruing for periods prior to January 1, 2023. 

Under-performing assets decreased to $246.4 million at March 31, 2023, compared to $270.3 million at March 31, 2022 and $267.0 million at December 31, 2022. Under-performing assets as a percentage of total loans at March 31, 2023 were 0.77%, an 18 basis point decrease from 0.95% at March 31, 2022 and a 9 basis point decrease from 0.86% at December 31, 2022. 

Nonaccrual loans decreased from December 31, 2022 to March 31, 2023. As a percentage of nonaccrual loans, the allowance for credit losses on loans was 127.47% at March 31, 2023, compared to 123.07% at March 31, 2022 and 127.50% at December 31, 2022. 

Total criticized and classified assets were $1.4 billion at March 31, 2023, an increase of $145.3 million and $19.3 million from March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Other classified assets include investment securities that fell below investment grade rating totaling $26.4 million at March 31, 2023, compared to $24.7 million at both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2022. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Unfunded Commitments 

Net charge-offs on loans totaled $16.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to net charge-offs of $2.8 million for the same period in 2022. Annualized, net charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans were 0.21% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to 0.05% for the same period in 2022. The three months ended March 31, 2023 included net charge-offs on PCD loans totaling $12.4 million, or 0.16% on an annualized basis of average loans. Management will continue its efforts to reduce the level of non-performing loans and may consider the possibility of sales of troubled and non-performing loans, which could result in additional charge-offs to the allowance for credit losses on loans. 

Credit quality within the loans held for investment portfolio is continuously monitored by management and is reflected within the allowance for credit losses on loans. The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of expected losses inherent within the Company&#8217;s loans held for investment portfolio. Credit quality is assessed and monitored by evaluating various attributes and the results of those evaluations are utilized in underwriting new loans and in our process for estimating expected credit losses. Expected credit loss inherent in non-cancelable off-balance-sheet credit exposures is accounted for as a separate liability included in other liabilities on the balance sheet. The allowance for credit losses on loans held for investment and unfunded loan commitments is adjusted by a credit loss expense, which is reported in earnings, and reduced by the charge-off of loan amounts, net of recoveries. Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. 

The allowance for credit loss estimation process involves procedures to consider the unique characteristics of our loan portfolio segments. These segments are further disaggregated into loan classes based on the level at which credit risk of the loan is monitored. When computing the level of expected credit losses, credit loss assumptions are estimated using a model that categorizes loan pools based on loss history, delinquency status, and other credit trends and risk characteristics, including current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In future periods, evaluations of the overall loan portfolio, in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance and credit loss expense in those future periods. 

The allowance level is influenced by loan volumes, loan AQR migration or delinquency status, changes in historical loss experience, and other conditions influencing loss expectations, such as reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. The methodology for estimating the amount of expected credit losses reported in the allowance for credit losses on loans has two basic components: first, an asset-specific component involving individual loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans and the measurement of expected credit losses for such individual loans; and second, a pooled component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics. 

The allowance for credit losses on loans was $298.7 million at March 31, 2023, compared to $303.7 million at December 31, 2022. Continued loan growth in future periods, a decline in our current level of recoveries, or an increase in charge-offs could result in an increase in provision expense. Additionally, provision expense may be volatile due to changes in CECL model assumptions of credit quality, macroeconomic factors and conditions, and loan composition, which drive the allowance for credit losses balance. 

We maintain an allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments to provide for the risk of loss inherent in these arrangements. The allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for credit losses on loans, modified to take into account the probability of a drawdown on the commitment. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments is classified as a liability account on the balance sheet within accrued expenses and other liabilities, while the corresponding provision for unfunded loan commitments is included in the provision for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments totaled $34.2 million at March 31, 2023, compared to $32.2 million at December 31, 2022. 

See the section entitled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our credit risk. 

Market Risk 

Market risk is the risk that the estimated fair value of our assets, liabilities, and derivative financial instruments will decline as a result of changes in interest rates or financial market volatility, or that our net income will be significantly reduced by interest rate changes. 

The objective of our interest rate management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity. 

Potential cash flows, sales, or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities, especially those that earn or pay interest, are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. This interest rate risk arises primarily from our normal business activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors affect our exposure to changes in interest rates, such as general economic and financial conditions, client preferences, historical pricing relationships, and re-pricing characteristics of financial instruments. Our earnings can also be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. Government and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve. 

In managing interest rate risk, we establish guidelines for asset and liability management, including measurement of short and long-term sensitivities to changes in interest rates, which are reviewed with the Enterprise Risk Committee of our Board of Directors. Based on the results of our analysis, we may use different techniques to manage changing trends in interest rates including: 

&#8226; adjusting balance sheet mix or altering interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities; 

&#8226; changing product pricing strategies; 

&#8226; modifying characteristics of the investment securities portfolio; or 

&#8226; using derivative financial instruments, to a limited degree. 

A key element in our ongoing process is to measure and monitor interest rate risk using a model to quantify the likely impact of changing interest rates on Old National&#8217;s results of operations. The model quantifies the effects of various possible interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income. The model measures the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario. The base case scenario assumes that the balance sheet and interest rates are held at current levels. The model shows our projected net interest income sensitivity based on interest rate changes only and does not consider other forecast assumptions. 

The following table illustrates our projected net interest income sensitivity over a two-year cumulative horizon based on the asset/liability model at March 31, 2023 and 2022:

Our projected net interest income increased year over year due to loan growth and rising interest rates. 

A key element in the measurement and modeling of interest rate risk is the re-pricing assumptions of our transaction deposit accounts, which have no contractual maturity dates. Because the models are driven by expected behavior in various interest rate scenarios and many factors besides market interest rates affect our net interest income, we recognize that model outputs are not guarantees of actual results. For this reason, we model many different combinations of interest rates and balance sheet assumptions to understand our overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes, including shocks, ramps, yield curve flattening, yield curve steepening, as well as forecasts of likely interest rate scenarios tested. 

We use cash flow and fair value hedges, primarily interest rate swaps, collars, and floors, to mitigate interest rate risk. Derivatives designated as hedging instruments were in a net liability position with a fair value loss of $25.8 million at March 31, 2023, compared to a net liability position with a fair value loss of $36.1 million at December 31, 2022. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivative financial instruments. 

Liquidity Risk 

Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments or may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources. We establish liquidity risk guidelines that we review with the Enterprise Risk Committee of our Board of Directors and monitor through our Balance Sheet Management Committee. The objective of liquidity management is to ensure we have the ability to fund balance sheet growth and meet deposit and debt obligations in a timely and cost-effective manner. Management monitors liquidity through a regular review of asset and liability maturities, funding sources, and loan and deposit forecasts. We maintain strategic and contingency liquidity plans to ensure sufficient available funding to satisfy requirements for balance sheet growth, properly manage capital markets&#8217; funding sources and to address unexpected liquidity requirements. On June 5, 2020, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the SEC that permits us to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities. We intend to renew this shelf registration statement with the SEC prior to its expiration in June 2023. 

Loan repayments and maturing investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds. However, deposit flows, calls of investment securities, and prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities are not as predictable as they are strongly influenced by interest rates, the housing market, general and local economic conditions, and competition in the marketplace. We continually monitor marketplace trends to identify patterns that might improve the predictability of the timing of deposit flows or asset prepayments. 

A maturity schedule for Old National Bank&#8217;s time deposits is shown in the following table at March 31, 2023. 

(dollars in thousands) Maturity Bucket Amount Rate 2023 $ 2,354,454 2.60 % 2024 1,533,221 3.64 2025 122,619 1.12 2026 63,404 0.67 2027 38,289 0.62 2027 and beyond 9,708 1.10 Total $ 4,121,695 2.89 % 

Our ability to acquire funding at competitive prices is influenced by rating agencies&#8217; views of our credit quality, liquidity, capital, and earnings. Moody&#8217;s Investors Service places us in an investment grade that indicates a low risk of default. On April 21, 2023, Moody&#8217;s Investors Service affirmed the long-term debt, deposit ratings, and assessments of Old National Bancorp (Old National, long-term senior unsecured debt &#8220;A3&#8221;) and its subsidiaries, including the Baseline Credit Assessment (&#8220;BCA&#8221;) of its banking subsidiary, Old National Bank (long-term deposits &#8220;Aa3 negative,&#8221; BCA &#8220;a2&#8221;). The outlooks on the senior unsecured debt rating and long-term issuer ratings of Old National and on the long-term deposit rating and issuer ratings of Old National Bank were changed to &#8220;negative&#8221; from &#8220;stable.&#8221; 

The credit ratings of Old National and Old National Bank at March 31, 2023 are shown in the following table.

Old National Bank maintains relationships in capital markets with brokers and dealers to issue certificates of deposit and short-term and medium-term bank notes as well. At March 31, 2023, Old National and its subsidiaries had the following availability of liquid funds and borrowings: 

(dollars in thousands) Parent Company Subsidiaries Available liquid funds: Cash and due from banks $ 823,897 $ 290,038 Unencumbered government-issued debt securities &#8212; 525,898 Unencumbered investment grade municipal securities &#8212; 39,227 Unencumbered corporate securities &#8212; 29,706 Availability of borrowings: Amount available from Federal Reserve discount window* &#8212; 952,201 Amount available from Federal Reserve Bank Term Funding Program &#8212; 2,300,000 Amount available from Federal Home Loan Bank* &#8212; 5,310,000 Total available funds $ 823,897 $ 9,447,070 

* Based on collateral pledged 

Old National Bancorp has routine funding requirements consisting primarily of operating expenses, dividends to shareholders, debt service, net derivative cash flows, and funds used for acquisitions. Old National Bancorp can obtain funding to meet its obligations from dividends and management fees collected from its subsidiaries, operating line of credit, and through the issuance of debt securities. Additionally, Old National Bancorp has a shelf registration in place with the SEC permitting ready access to the public debt and equity markets. At March 31, 2023, Old National Bancorp&#8217;s other borrowings outstanding were $483.5 million. Management believes the Company has the ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its requirements in the short-term and the long-term. 

Federal banking laws regulate the amount of dividends that may be paid by Old National Bank to Old National Bancorp on an unconsolidated basis without obtaining prior regulatory approval. Prior regulatory approval is required if dividends to be declared in any year would exceed net earnings of the current year plus retained net profits for the preceding two years. Prior regulatory approval to pay dividends was not required in 2022 and is not currently required. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

Our most significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Certain of these accounting policies require management to use significant judgment and estimates, which can have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities. We consider these policies to be our critical accounting estimates.
