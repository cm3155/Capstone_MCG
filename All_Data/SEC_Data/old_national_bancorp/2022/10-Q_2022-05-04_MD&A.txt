NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

The Company&#8217;s accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and general practices within the banking industry. As a supplement to GAAP, the Company provides non-GAAP performance results, which the Company believes are useful because they assist investors in assessing the Company&#8217;s operating performance. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in the following table. 

The tax-equivalent adjustment to net interest income and net interest margin recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable and tax-exempt assets. Interest income and yields on tax-exempt securities and loans are presented using the current federal income tax rate of 21%. Management believes that it is standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest income and net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis and that it may enhance comparability for peer comparison purposes. 

In management&#8217;s view, tangible common equity measures are capital adequacy metrics that may be meaningful to the Company, as well as analysts and investors, in assessing the Company&#8217;s use of equity and in facilitating comparisons with peers. These non-GAAP measures are valuable indicators of a financial institution&#8217;s capital strength since they eliminate intangible assets from shareholders&#8217; equity and retain the effect of accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders&#8217; equity. 

Although intended to enhance investors' understanding of the Company&#8217;s business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from those used by other financial institutions to assess their business and performance. See the previously provided tables and the following reconciliations in the &#8220;Non-GAAP Reconciliations&#8221; section for details on the calculation of these measures to the extent presented herein. 

The following table presents GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Old National completed its merger of equals with First Midwest on February 15, 2022 to create the sixth largest commercial bank headquartered in the Midwest. With approximately $46 billion of assets and $31 billion of assets under management, Old National ranks among the top 35 banking companies based in the U.S. and has been recognized as a World&#8217;s Most Ethical Company by the Ethisphere Institute for eleven consecutive years. Since its founding in 1834, Old National Bank has focused on community banking by building long-term, highly valued partnerships with clients and in the communities it serves. In addition to providing extensive services in retail and commercial banking, Old National offers comprehensive wealth management, investment, and capital market services. 

During the first quarter of 2022, net loss applicable to common shareholders was $(29.6) million, or $(0.13) per diluted common share. Net income applicable to common shareholders was $86.8 million, or $0.52 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2021. 

During the first quarter of 2022, we recorded provision for credit losses of $97.6 million, which included $96.3 million of initial provision for credit losses related to the allowance for credit losses established on acquired non-PCD loans associated with the merger with First Midwest. In addition, we recorded $52.3 million of merger-related expenses, including $11.0 million attributable to the provision for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments. 

We achieved strong fundamental results during the first quarter of 2022. 

Loans : Our loan balances, excluding loans held for sale, increased $14.734 billion to $28.336 billion at March 31, 2022 compared to $13.602 billion at December 31, 2021. This was primarily driven by our merger with First Midwest in February of 2022 and strong commercial production. We reported total commercial loan production of $1.5 billion in the first quarter of 2022 and the commercial loan pipeline totaled $5.4 billion at March 31, 2022. 

Net Interest Income : Net interest income increased $74.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021, and $76.0 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 primarily due to higher average earning assets from the merger and loan growth, higher accretion income, and lower costs of average interest-bearing liabilities. Partially offsetting these increases were lower interest and fees related to PPP loans, as well as higher average interest-bearing liabilities. 

Noninterest Income : Noninterest income increased $8.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021, and $13.8 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. The increases were primarily due to noninterest income attributable to the First Midwest merger, partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenues. 

Expenses : Noninterest expenses increased $109.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021, and $94.8 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. The increases were primarily due to operating expenses attributable to the First Midwest merger and also included $52.3 million of merger-related charges, including $11.0 million attributable to the provision for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments. Merger-related charges totaled $6.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. 

Pandemic Update 

As previously disclosed, the COVID-19 pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that continue to adversely affect our operations during the three months ended March 31, 2022. Our historically careful underwriting practices, diverse and granular portfolios, and Midwest-based footprint have helped minimize any adverse impact to Old National. The pandemic appears to be slowly receding, and thus becoming less disruptive on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations, and its clients as of March 31, 2022. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following table sets forth certain income statement information of Old National:

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is the most significant component of our earnings, comprising 77% of revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by many factors, primarily the volume and mix of earning assets, funding sources, and interest rate fluctuations. Other factors include the level of accretion income on purchased loans, prepayment risk on mortgage and investment-related assets, and the composition and maturity of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 

Interest rates increased significantly during the first quarter of 2022 with the rate on the 2-Year U.S. Treasury increasing 160 basis points from 0.73% to 2.34%. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s Federal Funds Rate increased 25 basis points to a target range of 0.25% to 0.50%, with the Effective Federal Funds Rate at 0.33% at March 31, 2022. The Federal Reserve is expected to continue to increase the Federal Funds Rate throughout 2022 and into 2023. If interest rates increase, our interest rate spread may improve, which may result in an increase in our net interest income. If interest rates decline, our interest rate spread could decline, which may result in a decrease in our net interest income. However, management has taken balance sheet restructuring, derivative, and deposit pricing actions to help mitigate this risk. 

Loans typically generate more interest income than investment securities with similar maturities. Funding from client deposits generally costs less than wholesale funding sources. Factors such as general economic activity, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and price volatility of competing alternative investments, can also exert significant influence on our ability to optimize our mix of assets and funding, net interest income, and net interest margin. 

Net interest income is the excess of interest received from interest-earning assets over interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. For analytical purposes, net interest income is presented in the table that follows, adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis to reflect what our tax-exempt assets would need to yield in order to achieve the same after-tax yield as a taxable asset. We used the federal statutory tax rate in effect of 21% for all periods. This analysis portrays the income tax benefits related to tax-exempt assets and helps to facilitate a comparison between taxable and tax-exempt assets. Management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest margin and net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis. Therefore, management believes these measures provide useful information for both management and investors by allowing them to make better peer comparisons. 

The following tables present the average balance sheet for each major asset and liability category, its related interest income and yield, or its expense and rate.

(1) The variance not solely due to rate or volume is allocated equally between the rate and volume variances. 

(2) Interest on investment securities and loans includes the effect of taxable equivalent adjustments of $2.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively, during the three months ended March 31, 2022 using the federal statutory rate in effect of 21%. 

The increase in net interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2022 when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 was primarily due to higher average earning assets from the merger and loan growth, higher accretion income, and lower costs of average interest-bearing liabilities. Partially offsetting these increases were lower interest and fees related to PPP loans, higher average interest-bearing liabilities, and lower yields on average earning assets. Accretion income associated with acquired loans and borrowings totaled $15.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2022, compared to $4.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021. Net interest income included interest and net fees on PPP loans totaling $3.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, compared to $12.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Unamortized fees on remaining PPP loans totaled $3.0 million at March 31, 2022. 

The 6 basis point decrease in the net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis for the three months ended March 31, 2022 when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 was primarily due to lower yields on interest earning assets, partially offset by lower costs of interest-bearing liabilities. The yield on interest earning assets decreased 12 basis points and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 8 basis points in the quarterly year-over-year comparison. The yield on interest earning assets is calculated by dividing annualized taxable equivalent net interest income by average interest earning assets while the cost of interest-bearing liabilities is calculated by dividing annualized interest expense by average interest-bearing liabilities. Accretion income represented 20 basis points of the net interest margin in the three months ended March 31, 2022, compared to 9 basis points for the three months ended March 31, 2021. 

Average earning assets were $31.484 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022, compared to $20.602 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021, an increase of $10.882 billion, or 53%. The increase in average earning assets was primarily due to the merger with First Midwest in February 2022. In addition, loan growth contributed to the increase in average earning assets. 

Average loans including loans held for sale increased $6.906 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022 when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 primarily due to the First Midwest merger in February 2022. In addition, organic loan growth, primarily within commercial loans, contributed to growth in average loans including loans held for sale. 

Average investments increased $3.009 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022 when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 reflecting the First Midwest merger in February 2022 and excess liquidity. 

Average noninterest-bearing and interest bearing deposits increased $3.539 billion and $6.025 billion, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021. This growth was primarily driven by the First Midwest merger in February 2022. 

Average borrowed funds increased $885.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021, driven by the First Midwest merger in February 2022. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

Old National recorded provision for credit losses of $97.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, compared to $17.4 million provision for credit losses recapture for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Net charge-offs on loans totaled $2.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2022, compared to net recoveries of $5 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The provision for credit losses expense in the three months ended March 31, 2022 included $96.3 million of initial provision for credit losses on acquired non-PCD loans associated with the First Midwest merger. Continued loan growth in future periods, a decline in our current level of recoveries, or an increase in charge-offs could result in an increase in provision expense. Additionally, provision expense may be volatile due to changes in CECL model assumptions of credit quality, macroeconomic factors and conditions, and loan composition, which drive the allowance for credit losses balance. 

Noninterest Income 

We generate revenues in the form of noninterest income through client fees, sales commissions, and gains and losses from our core banking franchise and other related businesses, such as wealth management, investment consulting, and investment products. The following table details the components in noninterest income: 

Three Months Ended March 31, % (dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 Change Wealth management fees $ 14,630 &#160; $ 9,708 50.7 % Service charges on deposit accounts 14,726 &#160; 8,124 81.3 Debit card and ATM fees 6,899 &#160; 5,143 34.1 Mortgage banking revenue 7,245 &#160; 16,525 (56.2) Investment product fees 7,322 &#160; 5,864 24.9 Capital markets income 4,442 &#160; 3,715 19.6 Company-owned life insurance 3,524 &#160; 2,714 29.8 Debt securities gains (losses), net 342 &#160; 1,993 (82.8) Other income 6,110 &#160; 2,926 108.8 Total noninterest income $ 65,240 &#160; $ 56,712 15.0 % 

Noninterest income increased $8.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 primarily due to the First Midwest merger in February 2022. The increase in noninterest income was partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue which was impacted by the rate environment, normalizing gain on sale margins, and a higher mix of portfolio production. 

Noninterest Expense 

The following table details the components in noninterest expense: 

Three Months Ended March 31, % (dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 Change Salaries and employee benefits $ 124,147 &#160; $ 68,117 82.3 % Occupancy 21,019 &#160; 14,872 41.3 Equipment 5,168 &#160; 3,969 30.2 Marketing 4,276 &#160; 2,062 107.4 Data processing 18,762 &#160; 12,353 51.9 Communication 3,417 &#160; 2,878 18.7 Professional fees 19,791 &#160; 2,724 626.5 FDIC assessment 2,575 &#160; 1,607 60.2 Amortization of intangibles 4,811 &#160; 3,075 56.5 Amortization of tax credit investments 1,516 &#160; 1,202 26.1 Other expense 21,274 &#160; 4,881 335.9 Total noninterest expense $ 226,756 &#160; $ 117,740 92.6 % 

Noninterest expense increased $109.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 reflecting the additional operating costs associated with the First Midwest merger, as well as $52.3 million of merger-related expenses, including $11.0 million of other expenses attributable to the provision for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments. 

Amortization of tax credit investments increased $0.3 million and for the three months ended March 31, 2022 when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021. The recognition of tax credit amortization expense is contingent upon the successful completion of the rehabilitation of a historic building or completion of a solar project within the reporting period. Many factors including weather, labor availability, building regulations, inspections, and other unexpected construction delays related to a rehabilitation project can cause a project to exceed its estimated completion date. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our tax credit investments. 

Provision for Income Taxes 

We record a provision for income taxes currently payable and for income taxes payable or benefits to be received in the future, which arise due to timing differences in the recognition of certain items for financial statement and income tax purposes. The major difference between the effective tax rate applied to our financial statement income and the federal statutory tax rate is caused by a tax benefit from our tax credit investments and interest on tax-exempt securities and loans. The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of pre-tax income (loss), was 24.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2022, compared to 16.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2021. In accordance with ASC 740-270, Accounting for Interim Reporting , the provision for income taxes was recorded at March 31, 2022 based on the current estimate of the effective annual rate. Based on the current estimate, the higher effective tax rate during the three months ended March 31, 2022 when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 reflected higher post-merger estimated state effective tax rates. An additional benefit of $1.2 million related to share-based payments and a one-time benefit of $0.9 million due to the remeasurement of the Company&#8217;s deferred taxes post-merger both increased the effective tax rate for the quarter since the Company reflected a pretax loss, but are expected to reduce the overall full-year tax rate once the Company is in a pretax income position. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Overview 

At March 31, 2022, our assets were $45.835 billion, a $21.381 billion increase compared to assets of $24.454 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase was driven by the merger with First Midwest in February of 2022. 

We have observed signs of an economic recovery in the United States, with jobs, consumer spending, manufacturing, and other indicators rebounding from their weakest levels. Our historically careful underwriting practices, diverse and granular portfolios, and Midwest-based footprint have helped minimize any adverse impact to 

Old National. The pandemic appears to be slowly receding, and thus becoming less disruptive on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations, and its clients as of March 31, 2022. 

Earning Assets 

Our earning assets are comprised of investment securities, portfolio loans, loans held for sale, money market investments, interest earning accounts with the Federal Reserve, and equity securities. Earning assets were $41.124 billion at March 31, 2022, a $19.273 billion increase compared to earning assets of $21.851 billion at December 31, 2021 driven by the merger with First Midwest in February of 2022. 

Investment Securities 

We classify the majority of our investment securities as available-for-sale to give management the flexibility to sell the securities prior to maturity if needed, based on fluctuating interest rates or changes in our funding requirements. During the first quarter of 2022, we transferred $2.039 billion of securities available-for-sale to held-to-maturity in light of the rate environment. 

Equity securities are recorded at fair value and totaled $67.6 million at March 31, 2022 compared to $13.2 million at December 31, 2021. The increase in equity securities was driven by the merger with First Midwest in February of 2022. 

At March 31, 2022, the investment securities portfolio, including equity securities, was $11.191 billion compared to $7.565 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of $3.626 billion. Investment securities represented 27% of earning assets at March 31, 2022, compared to 35% at December 31, 2021. Stronger commercial loan demand in the future could result in management&#8217;s decision to reduce the securities portfolio. At March 31, 2022, we had no intent to sell any securities that were in an unrealized loss position nor is it expected that we would be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery. 

The investment securities available-for-sale portfolio had net unrealized losses of $413.6 million at March 31, 2022, compared to net unrealized losses of $6.0 million at December 31, 2021. Net unrealized losses increased from December 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022 primarily due to an increase in rates impacting market values for mortgage-backed, U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies, and tax exempt municipal securities. 

The investment portfolio had an effective duration of 4.41 at March 31, 2022, compared to 4.26 at December 31, 2021. Effective duration measures the percentage change in value of the portfolio in response to a change in interest rates. Generally, there is more uncertainty in interest rates over a longer average maturity, resulting in a higher duration percentage. The annualized average yields on investment securities, on a taxable equivalent basis, were 2.14% for the three months ended March 31, 2022, compared to 2.23% for the three months ended March 31, 2021. 

Loans Held for Sale 

Mortgage loans held for immediate sale in the secondary market were $39.4 million at March 31, 2022, compared to $35.5 million at December 31, 2021. Certain mortgage loans are committed for sale at or prior to origination at a contracted price to an outside investor. Other mortgage loans held for immediate sale are hedged with TBA forward agreements and committed for sale when they are ready for delivery and remain on the Company&#8217;s balance sheet for a short period of time (typically 30 to 60 days). These loans are sold without recourse, beyond customary representations and warranties, and Old National has not experienced material losses arising from these sales. Mortgage originations are subject to volatility due to interest rates and home sales, among other factors. 

We have elected the fair value option prospectively for residential loans held for sale. The aggregate fair value of residential loans held for sale was approximately equal to the unpaid principal balance at March 31, 2022. The aggregate fair value of residential loans held for sale exceeded the unpaid principal balance by $1.3 million at December 31, 2021. 

Commercial and Commercial Real Estate Loans 

Commercial and commercial real estate loans are the largest classifications within earning assets, representing 49% of earning assets at March 31, 2022, compared to 45% at December 31, 2021. At March 31, 2022, commercial and commercial real estate loans were $19.962 billion, an increase of $10.190 billion compared to December 31, 2021 driven by the merger with First Midwest in February of 2022. 

The following table provides detail on commercial loans by industry classification (as defined by the North American Industry Classification System) and by loan size.

Residential Real Estate Loans 

At March 31, 2022, residential real estate loans held in our loan portfolio were $5.706 billion, an increase of $3.451 billion compared to December 31, 2021 driven by the merger with First Midwest in February of 2022. Future increases in interest rates could result in a decline in the level of refinancings and new originations of residential real estate loans. 

Consumer Loans 

Consumer loans, including automobile loans and personal and home equity loans and lines of credit, increased $1.094 billion to $2.668 billion at March 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021 driven by the merger with First Midwest in February of 2022. 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Goodwill and other intangible assets at March 31, 2022 totaled $2.145 billion, an increase of $1.073 billion from December 31, 2021. In February 2022, we recorded $1.078 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the merger of First Midwest. 

Other Assets 

Other assets at March 31, 2022 increased $366.3 million from December 31, 2021 primarily due to higher net deferred tax assets related to net unrealized losses on investment securities and allowance for credit losses on loans and higher miscellaneous investments associated with the First Midwest merger. 

Funding 

Total funding, comprised of deposits and wholesale borrowings, was $39.955 billion at March 31, 2022, an increase of $18.811 billion from $21.144 billion at December 31, 2021 driven by the merger with First Midwest in February of 2022. Included in total funding were deposits of $35.607 billion at March 31, 2022, an increase of $17.038 billion from $18.569 billion at December 31, 2021. Compared to December 31, 2021, noninterest-bearing deposits increased $6.160 billion, interest-bearing checking and NOW deposits increased $2.958 billion, savings deposits increased $3.073 billion, money market deposits increased $3.263 billion, and time deposits increased $1.584 billion. 

We use wholesale funding to augment deposit funding and to help maintain our desired interest rate risk position. At March 31, 2022, wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased and interbank borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, FHLB advances, and other borrowings, totaled $4.348 billion, an increase of $1.772 billion from December 31, 2021. Wholesale funding as a percentage of total funding was 11% at March 31, 2022 and 12% at December 31, 2021. The increase in wholesale funding from December 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022 was driven by the merger with First Midwest in February of 2022. 

Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities 

Accrued expenses and other liabilities at March 31, 2022 increased $192.7 million from December 31, 2021 primarily due to higher derivative liabilities and accrued expenses and other liabilities associated with the First Midwest merger. 

Capital &#160; 

Shareholders&#8217; equity totaled $5.232 billion at March 31, 2022, compared to $3.012 billion at December 31, 2021. In relation to the merger of equals transaction, Old National issued 108,000 shares of Old National Series A Preferred Stock and 122,500 shares of Old National Series C Preferred Stock. Old National entered into two deposit agreements, each dated as of February 15, 2022, by and among Old National, Continental Stock Transfer &#38; Trust Company, as depository, and the holders from time to time of the depositary receipts in connection with the issuance of the Old National Preferred Stock. Pursuant to the deposit agreements, Old National issued 4,320,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of Old National Series A Preferred Stock, and 4,900,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of Old National Series C Preferred Stock . 

Shareholders&#8217; equity at March 31, 2022 included $2.446 billion from the 129.4 million shares of Common Stock that were issued in conjunction with the merger with First Midwest. The change in unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale investment securities decreased equity by $311.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2022. Old National repurchased 3.5 million shares of Common Stock in the three months ended March 31, 2022 under a stock repurchase plan that was approved by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, which reduced equity by $63.8 million. Old National also paid cash dividends of $0.14 per common share in the three months ended March 31, 2022, which reduced equity by $40.8 million. 

Capital Adequacy 

Old National and the banking industry are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. At March 31, 2022, Old National and its bank subsidiary exceeded the regulatory minimums and Old National Bank met the regulatory definition of &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; based on the most recent regulatory definition. 

Old National&#8217;s consolidated capital position remains strong as evidenced by the following comparisons of key industry ratios.

In December 2018, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC approved a final rule to address changes to credit loss accounting under GAAP, including banking organizations&#8217; implementation of CECL. The final rule provides banking organizations the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the new accounting standard. In March 2020, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC published an interim final rule to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from the implementation of CECL. The interim final rule maintains the three-year transition option in the previous rule and provides banks the option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period (five-year transition option). Old National is adopting the capital transition relief over the permissible five-year period. 

Management views stress testing as an integral part of the Company&#8217;s risk management and strategic planning activities. Old National performs stress testing periodically throughout the year. The primary objective of the stress test is to ensure that Old National has a robust, forward-looking stress testing process and maintains sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress. Management also uses the stress testing framework to evaluate decisions relating to pricing, loan concentrations, capital deployment, and mergers and acquisitions to ensure that strategic decisions align with Old National&#8217;s risk appetite statement. Old National&#8217;s stress testing process incorporates key risks that include strategic, market, liquidity, credit, operational, regulatory, compliance, legal, and reputational risks. Old National&#8217;s stress testing policy outlines steps that will be taken if stress test results do not meet internal thresholds under severely adverse economic scenarios. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Overview 

Old National has adopted a Risk Appetite Statement to enable the Board of Directors, Executive Leadership Team, and Senior Management to better assess, understand, monitor, and mitigate the risks of Old National. The Risk Appetite Statement addresses the following major risks: strategic, market, liquidity, credit, operational/technology/cybersecurity, talent management, regulatory/compliance/legal, and reputational. Our Chief Risk Officer is independent of management and reports directly to the Chair of the Board&#8217;s Enterprise Risk Management Committee. The following discussion addresses these major risks: credit, market, liquidity, operational/technology/cybersecurity, and regulatory/compliance/legal. 

Credit Risk 

Credit risk represents the risk of loss arising from an obligor&#8217;s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms. Our primary credit risks result from our investment and lending activities. 

Investment Activities 

We carry a higher exposure to loss in our pooled trust preferred securities, which are collateralized debt obligations, due to illiquidity in that market and the performance of the underlying collateral. At March 31, 2022, we had pooled trust preferred securities with a fair value of $9.7 million, or less than 1% of the available-for-sale securities portfolio. These securities remained classified as available-for-sale and the unrealized loss on our pooled trust 

preferred securities was $4.1 million at March 31, 2022. The fair value of these securities is expected to improve as we get closer to maturity, but may be adversely impacted by credit deterioration. 

All of our mortgage-backed securities are backed by U.S. government-sponsored or federal agencies. Municipal bonds, corporate bonds, and other debt securities are evaluated by reviewing the credit-worthiness of the issuer and general market conditions. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details about our investment security portfolio. 

Counterparty Exposure 

Counterparty exposure is the risk that the other party in a financial transaction will not fulfill its obligation. We define counterparty exposure as nonperformance risk in transactions involving federal funds sold and purchased, repurchase agreements, correspondent bank relationships, and derivative contracts with companies in the financial services industry. Old National manages exposure to counterparty risk in connection with its derivatives transactions by generally engaging in transactions with counterparties having ratings of at least &#8220;A&#8221; by Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Rating Service or &#8220;A2&#8221; by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. Total credit exposure is monitored by counterparty and managed within limits that management believes to be prudent. Old National&#8217;s net counterparty exposure was an asset of $1.452 billion at March 31, 2022. 

Lending Activities 

Commercial 

Commercial and industrial loans are made primarily for the purpose of financing equipment acquisition, expansion, working capital, and other general business purposes. Lease financing consists of direct financing leases and is used by commercial clients to finance capital purchases ranging from computer equipment to transportation equipment. The credit decisions for these transactions are based upon an assessment of the overall financial capacity of the applicant. A determination is made as to the applicant&#8217;s ability to repay in accordance with the proposed terms as well as an overall assessment of the risks involved. In addition to an evaluation of the applicant&#8217;s financial condition, a determination is made of the probable adequacy of the primary and secondary sources of repayment, such as additional collateral or personal guarantees, to be relied upon in the transaction. Credit agency reports of the applicant&#8217;s credit history supplement the analysis of the applicant&#8217;s creditworthiness. 

Commercial mortgages and construction loans are offered to real estate investors, developers, and builders primarily domiciled in the geographic market areas we serve: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. These loans are secured by first mortgages on real estate at LTV margins deemed appropriate for the property type, quality, location, and sponsorship. Generally, these LTV ratios do not exceed 80%. The commercial properties are predominantly non-residential properties such as retail centers, industrial properties and, to a lesser extent, more specialized properties. Substantially all of our commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located in our primary market area. 

In the underwriting of our commercial real estate loans, we obtain appraisals for the underlying properties. Decisions to lend are based on the economic viability of the property and the creditworthiness of the borrower. In evaluating a proposed commercial real estate loan, we primarily emphasize the ratio of the property&#8217;s projected net cash flows to the loan&#8217;s debt service requirement. The debt service coverage ratio normally is not less than 120% and it is computed after deduction for a vacancy factor and property expenses as appropriate. In addition, a personal guarantee of the loan or a portion thereof is often required from the principal(s) of the borrower. In most cases, we require title insurance insuring the priority of our lien, fire and extended coverage casualty insurance, and flood insurance, if appropriate, in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property. In addition, business interruption insurance or other insurance may be required. 

Construction loans are underwritten against projected cash flows derived from rental income, business income from an owner-occupant, or the sale of the property to an end-user. We may mitigate the risks associated with these types of loans by requiring fixed-price construction contracts, performance and payment bonding, controlled disbursements, and pre-sale contracts or pre-lease agreements. 

Consumer 

We offer a variety of first mortgage and junior lien loans to consumers within our markets, with residential home mortgages comprising our largest consumer loan category. These loans are secured by a primary residence and are 

underwritten using traditional underwriting systems to assess the credit risks of the consumer. Decisions are primarily based on LTV ratios, DTI ratios, liquidity, and credit scores. A maximum LTV ratio of 80% is generally required, although higher levels are permitted with mortgage insurance or other mitigating factors. We offer fixed rate mortgages and variable rate mortgages with interest rates that are subject to change every year after the first, third, fifth, or seventh year, depending on the product and are based on indexed rates such as prime. We do not offer payment-option facilities, sub-prime loans, or any product with negative amortization. 

Home equity loans are secured primarily by second mortgages on residential property of the borrower. The underwriting terms for the home equity product generally permit borrowing availability, in the aggregate, up to 90% of the appraised value of the collateral property at the time of origination. We offer fixed and variable rate home equity loans, with variable rate loans underwritten at fully-indexed rates. Decisions are primarily based on LTV ratios, DTI ratios, and credit scores. We do not offer home equity loan products with reduced documentation. 

Automobile loans include loans and leases secured by new or used automobiles. We originate automobile loans and leases primarily on an indirect basis through selected dealerships. We require borrowers to maintain collision insurance on automobiles securing consumer loans, with us listed as loss payee. Our procedures for underwriting automobile loans include an assessment of an applicant&#8217;s overall financial capacity, including credit history and the ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although an applicant&#8217;s creditworthiness is the primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral security to the proposed loan amount. 

Asset Quality 

Community-based lending personnel, along with region-based independent underwriting and analytic support staff, extend credit under guidelines established and administered by management and overseen by our Enterprise Risk Committee. This committee, which meets quarterly, is made up of independent outside directors. The committee monitors credit quality through its review of information such as delinquencies, credit exposures, peer comparisons, problem loans, and charge-offs. In addition, the committee provides oversight of loan policy changes as recommended by management to assure our policy remains appropriate for the current lending environment. 

We lend to commercial and commercial real estate clients in many diverse industries including, among others, manufacturing, agribusiness, transportation, mining, wholesaling, and retailing. Old National manages concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, client relationship, and loan size. At March 31, 2022, our average commercial loan size was approximately $540,000 and our average commercial real estate loan size was approximately $1,100,000. In addition, while loans to lessors of residential and non-residential real estate exceed 10% of total loans, no individual sub-segment category within those broader categories reaches the 10% threshold. At March 31, 2022, we had minimal exposure to foreign borrowers and no sovereign debt. Our policy is to concentrate our lending activity in the geographic market areas we serve, primarily Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. 

On February 15, 2022, Old National closed on its merger with First Midwest. As of the closing date of the transaction, First Midwest loans totaled $14.308 billion. Old National reviewed the acquired loans and determined that as of March 31, 2022, $254.5 million met the definition of criticized and $456.9 million were considered classified (of which $124.1 million are reported with nonaccrual loans). These loans are included in our summary of under-performing, criticized, and classified assets table below. 

The following table presents a summary of under-performing, criticized, and classified assets: 

March 31, December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 2021 Total nonaccrual loans $ 227,925 &#160; $ 142,138 $ 106,691 TDRs still accruing 20,999 &#160; 15,226 18,378 Total past due loans (90 days or more and still accruing) 1,646 &#160; 49 7 Foreclosed assets 19,713 &#160; 751 2,030 Total under-performing assets $ 270,283 &#160; $ 158,164 $ 127,106 Classified loans (includes nonaccrual, TDRs still accruing, past due 90 days, and other problem loans) $ 747,912 &#160; $ 302,501 $ 269,270 Other classified assets (1) 24,676 &#160; 3,791 4,338 Criticized loans 507,689 &#160; 246,365 235,910 Total criticized and classified assets $ 1,280,277 &#160; $ 552,657 $ 509,518 Asset Quality Ratios: Nonaccrual loans/total loans (2) 0.80 &#160; % 1.02 % 0.78 % Non-performing loans/total loans (2) (3) 0.88 &#160; 1.13 0.92 Under-performing assets/total loans and other real estate owned 0.95 &#160; 1.14 0.93 Under-performing assets/total assets 0.59 &#160; 0.67 0.52 Allowance/under-performing assets 103.78 &#160; 72.10 84.45 Allowance/nonaccrual loans 123.07 &#160; 80.23 100.61 

(1) Includes investment securities that fell below investment grade rating. 

(2) Loans exclude loans held for sale. 

(3) Non-performing loans include nonaccrual loans and TDRs still accruing. 

Under-performing assets increased to $270.3 million at March 31, 2022, compared to $158.2 million at March 31, 2021 and $127.1 million at December 31, 2021 due to the First Midwest Merger. Under-performing assets as a percentage of total loans and other real estate owned at March 31, 2022 were 0.95%, a 19 basis point decrease from 1.14% at March 31, 2021 and a 2 basis point increase from 0.93% at December 31, 2021. 

Nonaccrual loans increased from December 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022 primarily due to nonaccrual loans related to the First Midwest merger totaling $124.1 million. As a percentage of nonaccrual loans, the allowance was 123.07% at March 31, 2022, compared to 80.23% at March 31, 2021 and 100.61% at December 31, 2021. 

Total criticized and classified assets were $1.280 billion at March 31, 2022, an increase of $727.6 million from March 31, 2021, and an increase of $770.8 million from December 31, 2021. Criticized and classified assets related to the First Midwest merger totaled $711.4 million at March 31, 2022. Other classified assets include investment securities that fell below investment grade rating totaling $24.7 million at March 31, 2022, compared to $3.8 million at March 31, 2021 and $4.3 million at December 31, 2021. 

Old National may choose to restructure the contractual terms of certain loans. The decision to restructure a loan, versus aggressively enforcing the collection of the loan, may benefit Old National by increasing the ultimate probability of collection. 

Any loans that are modified are reviewed by Old National to identify if a TDR has occurred, which is when, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, Old National Bank grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. Terms may be modified to fit the ability of the borrower to repay in line with its current financial status. The modification of the terms of such loans includes one or a combination of the following: a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan, an extension of the maturity date at a stated rate of interest lower than the current market rate of new debt with similar risk, or a permanent reduction of the recorded investment of the loan. 

Loans modified in a TDR are typically placed on nonaccrual status until we determine that the future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured, which generally requires that the borrower demonstrate a period of performance according to the restructured terms for six months. 

If we are unable to resolve a nonperforming loan issue, the credit will be charged off when it is apparent there will be a loss. For large commercial type loans, each relationship is individually analyzed for evidence of apparent loss based on quantitative benchmarks or subjectively based upon certain events or particular circumstances. For residential and consumer loans, a charge off is recorded at the time foreclosure is initiated or when the loan becomes 120 to 180 days past due, whichever is earlier. 

For commercial TDRs, an allocation is established within the allowance for credit losses for the difference between the carrying value of the loan and its computed value. To determine the computed value of the loan, one of the following methods is selected: (1) the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan&#8217;s original effective interest rate, (2) the loan&#8217;s observable market price, or (3) the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent. The allocation is established as the difference between the carrying value of the loan and the collectable value. If there are significant changes in the amount or timing of the loan&#8217;s expected future cash flows, the allowance allocation is recalculated and adjusted accordingly. 

When a residential or consumer loan is identified as a TDR, the loan is typically written down to its collateral value less selling costs. 

At March 31, 2022, TDRs consisted of $7.0 million of commercial loans, $32.4 million of commercial real estate loans, $0.1 million of BBCC loans, $2.4 million of residential real estate loans, $2.7 million of direct consumer loans, and $0.2 million of home equity loans totaling $44.8 million. TDRs included within nonaccrual loans totaled $23.8 million at March 31, 2022. At December 31, 2021, TDRs consisted of $7.4 million of commercial loans, $17.2 million of commercial real estate loans, $0.1 million of BBCC loans, $2.4 million of residential real estate loans, $2.7 million of direct consumer loans, and $0.2 million of home equity loans, totaling $30.0 million. TDRs included within nonaccrual loans totaled $11.7 million at December 31, 2021. 

Old National has established specific allowances for credit losses for clients whose loan terms have been modified as TDRs totaling $6.2 million at March 31, 2022 and $0.7 million of December 31, 2021. Old National had not committed to lend any additional funds to clients with outstanding loans that were classified as TDRs at March 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021. 

The terms of certain other loans were modified during 2022 and 2021 that did not meet the definition of a TDR. It is our process to review all classified and criticized loans that, during the period, have been renewed, have entered into a forbearance agreement, have gone from principal and interest to interest only, or have extended the maturity date. In order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification. The evaluation is performed under our internal underwriting policy. We also evaluate whether a concession has been granted or if we were adequately compensated through a market interest rate, additional collateral, or a bona fide guarantee. We also consider whether the modification was insignificant relative to the other terms of the agreement or the delay in a payment. 

In general, once a modified loan is considered a TDR, the loan will always be considered a TDR until it is paid in full, otherwise settled, sold, or charged off. However, guidance also permits for loans to be removed from TDR status when subsequently restructured under these circumstances: (1) at the time of the subsequent restructuring, the borrower is not experiencing financial difficulties, and this is documented by a current credit evaluation at the time of the restructuring, (2) under the terms of the subsequent restructuring agreement, the institution has granted no concession to the borrower; and (3) the subsequent restructuring agreement includes market terms that are no less favorable than those that would be offered for a comparable new loan. For loans subsequently restructured that have cumulative principal forgiveness, the loan should continue to be measured in accordance with ASC 310-10, Receivables &#8211; Overall . However, consistent with ASC 310-40-50-2, Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors, Creditor Disclosure of Troubled Debt Restructurings , the loan would not be required to be reported in the years following the restructuring if the subsequent restructuring meets both of these criteria: (1) has an interest rate at the time of the subsequent restructuring that is not less than a market interest rate; and (2) is performing in compliance with its modified terms after the subsequent restructuring. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Unfunded Commitments 

Net charge-offs on loans totaled $2.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2022, compared to net recoveries of $5 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Annualized, net charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans were 0.05% for the three months ended March 31, 2022, compared to 0.00% for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Management will continue its efforts to reduce the level of non-performing loans and may 

consider the possibility of sales of troubled and non-performing loans, which could result in additional charge-offs to the allowance for credit losses on loans. 

Credit quality within the loans held for investment portfolio is continuously monitored by management and is reflected within the allowance for credit losses for loans. The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of expected losses inherent within the Company&#8217;s loans held for investment portfolio. Credit quality is assessed and monitored by evaluating various attributes and the results of those evaluations are utilized in underwriting new loans and in our process for estimating expected credit losses. Expected credit loss inherent in non-cancelable off-balance-sheet credit exposures is accounted for as a separate liability included in other liabilities on the balance sheet. The allowance for credit losses for loans held for investment is adjusted by a credit loss expense, which is reported in earnings, and reduced by the charge-off of loan amounts, net of recoveries. Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. 

The allowance for credit loss estimation process involves procedures to appropriately consider the unique characteristics of our loan portfolio segments. These segments are further disaggregated into loan classes based on the level at which credit risk of the loan is monitored. When computing the level of expected credit losses, credit loss assumptions are estimated using a model that categorizes loan pools based on loss history, delinquency status, and other credit trends and risk characteristics, including current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In future periods, evaluations of the overall loan portfolio, in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance and credit loss expense in those future periods. 

The allowance level is influenced by loan volumes, loan AQR migration or delinquency status, changes in historical loss experience, and other conditions influencing loss expectations, such as reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. The methodology for estimating the amount of expected credit losses reported in the allowance for credit losses has two basic components: first, an asset-specific component involving individual loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans and the measurement of expected credit losses for such individual loans; and second, a pooled component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics. 

The allowance for credit losses for loans was $280.5 million at March 31, 2022, compared to $107.3 million at December 31, 2021. The increase reflects the initial allowance for credit losses established for acquired PCD loans totaling $78.5 million related to the First Midwest merger. In addition, the provision for credit losses expense in the three months ended March 31, 2022 included $96.3 million of initial provision for credit losses required on acquired non-PCD loans associated with the First Midwest merger. Continued loan growth in future periods, a decline in our current level of recoveries, or an increase in charge-offs could result in an increase in provision expense. Additionally, provision expense may be volatile due to changes in CECL model assumptions of credit quality, macroeconomic factors and conditions, and loan composition, which drive the allowance for credit losses balance. 

We maintain an allowance for credit losses on unfunded commercial lending commitments and letters of credit to provide for the risk of loss inherent in these arrangements. The allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for credit losses for loans, modified to take into account the probability of a drawdown on the commitment. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments is classified as a liability account on the balance sheet within accrued expenses and other liabilities, while the corresponding provision for these credit losses is recorded as a component of other expense. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments totaled $22.0 million at March 31, 2022, compared to $10.9 million at December 31, 2021. The increase in the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments was driven by the merger with First Midwest in February of 2022. 

Market Risk 

Market risk is the risk that the estimated fair value of our assets, liabilities, and derivative financial instruments will decline as a result of changes in interest rates or financial market volatility, or that our net income will be significantly reduced by interest rate changes. 

The objective of our interest rate management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity. 

Potential cash flows, sales, or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities, especially those that earn or pay interest, are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. This interest rate risk arises primarily from our normal business activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors affect our exposure to changes in interest rates, such as general economic and financial conditions, client preferences, historical pricing relationships, and re-pricing characteristics of financial instruments. Our earnings can also be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. Government and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve. 

In managing interest rate risk, we establish guidelines for asset and liability management, including measurement of short and long-term sensitivities to changes in interest rates, which is reviewed with the Enterprise Risk Committee of our Board of Directors. Based on the results of our analysis, we may use different techniques to manage changing trends in interest rates including: 

&#8226; adjusting balance sheet mix or altering interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities; 

&#8226; changing product pricing strategies; 

&#8226; modifying characteristics of the investment securities portfolio; or 

&#8226; using derivative financial instruments, to a limited degree. 

A key element in our ongoing process is to measure and monitor interest rate risk using a model to quantify the likely impact of changing interest rates on Old National&#8217;s results of operations. The model quantifies the effects of various possible interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income. The model measures the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario. The base case scenario assumes that the balance sheet and interest rates are held at current levels. Interest rates are floored at 0.00% in the down 50 basis points scenario. The model shows our projected net interest income sensitivity based on interest rate changes only and does not consider other forecast assumptions. 

The following table illustrates our projected net interest income sensitivity over a two year cumulative horizon based on the asset/liability model at March 31, 2022 and 2021:

Our asset sensitivity increased year over year primarily due to deposit growth, higher mix of floating rate loans, and changes in our hedging strategies. 

A key element in the measurement and modeling of interest rate risk is the re-pricing assumptions of our transaction deposit accounts, which have no contractual maturity dates. Because the models are driven by expected behavior in various interest rate scenarios and many factors besides market interest rates affect our net interest income, we recognize that model outputs are not guarantees of actual results. For this reason, we model many different combinations of interest rates and balance sheet assumptions to understand our overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes, including shocks, ramps, yield curve flattening, yield curve steepening, as well as forecasts of likely interest rate scenarios tested. At March 31, 2022, our projected net interest income sensitivity based on the asset/liability models we utilize was within the limits of our interest rate risk policy for the scenarios tested. 

We use cash flow and fair value hedges, primarily interest rate swaps, collars, and floors, to mitigate interest rate risk. Derivatives designated as hedging instruments were in a net liability position with a fair value loss of $16.8 million at March 31, 2022, compared to a net asset position with a fair value gain of $1.3 million at December 31, 2021. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivative financial instruments. 

Liquidity Risk 

Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments, or may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources. We establish liquidity risk guidelines that we review with the Enterprise Risk Committee of our Board of Directors and monitor through our Balance Sheet Management Committee. The objective of liquidity management is to ensure we have the ability to fund balance sheet growth and meet deposit and debt obligations in a timely and cost-effective manner. Management monitors liquidity through a regular review of asset and liability maturities, funding sources, and loan and deposit forecasts. We maintain strategic and contingency liquidity plans to ensure sufficient available funding to satisfy requirements for balance sheet growth, properly manage capital markets&#8217; funding sources and to address unexpected liquidity requirements. On June 5, 2020, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the SEC that permits us to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities. 

Loan repayments and maturing investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds. However, deposit flows, calls of investment securities and prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities are strongly influenced by interest rates, the housing market, general and local economic conditions, and competition in the marketplace. We continually monitor marketplace trends to identify patterns that might improve the predictability of the timing of deposit flows or asset prepayments.

Our ability to acquire funding at competitive prices is influenced by rating agencies&#8217; views of our credit quality, liquidity, capital, and earnings. Moody&#8217;s Investors Service places us in an investment grade that indicates a low risk of default. For both Old National and Old National Bank: 

&#8226; Moody&#8217;s Investors Service affirmed the Long-Term Rating of &#8220;A3&#8221; for Old National&#8217;s senior unsecured/issuer rating on February 16, 2022. 

&#8226; Moody&#8217;s Investors Service affirmed Old National Bank&#8217;s long-term deposit rating of &#8220;Aa3&#8221; on February 16, 2022. The bank&#8217;s short-term deposit rating was affirmed at &#8220;P-1&#8221; and the bank&#8217;s issuer rating was affirmed at &#8220;A3.&#8221; 

Moody&#8217;s Investors Service concluded a rating review of Old National Bank on February 16, 2022.

Old National Bank maintains relationships in capital markets with brokers and dealers to issue certificates of deposit and short-term and medium-term bank notes as well. At March 31, 2022, Old National and its subsidiaries had the following availability of liquid funds and borrowings: 

(dollars in thousands) Parent Company Subsidiaries Available liquid funds: Cash and due from banks $ 566,567 $ 1,409,985 Unencumbered government-issued debt securities &#8212; 3,228,145 Unencumbered investment grade municipal securities &#8212; 783,906 Unencumbered corporate securities &#8212; 320,762 Availability of borrowings: Amount available from Federal Reserve discount window* &#8212; 680,984 Amount available from Federal Home Loan Bank Indianapolis* &#8212; 1,298,277 Total available funds $ 566,567 $ 7,722,059 

* Based on collateral pledged 

Old National Bancorp has routine funding requirements consisting primarily of operating expenses, dividends to shareholders, debt service, net derivative cash flows, and funds used for acquisitions. Old National Bancorp can obtain funding to meet its obligations from dividends and management fees collected from its subsidiaries, operating line of credit, and through the issuance of debt securities. Additionally, Old National Bancorp has a shelf registration in place with the SEC permitting ready access to the public debt and equity markets. At March 31, 2022, Old National Bancorp&#8217;s other borrowings outstanding were $488.5 million. Management believes the Company has the ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its requirements in the short-term and the long-term. 

Federal banking laws regulate the amount of dividends that may be paid by banking subsidiaries without prior approval. Prior regulatory approval is required if dividends to be declared in any year would exceed net earnings of the current year plus retained net profits for the preceding two years. Prior regulatory approval to pay dividends was not required in 2021 and is not currently required. 

Operational/Technology/Cybersecurity Risk 

Operational/technology/cybersecurity risk is the danger that inadequate information systems, operational problems, breaches in internal controls, information security breaches, fraud, or unforeseen catastrophes will result in unexpected losses and other adverse impacts to Old National, such as reputational harm. We maintain frameworks, programs, and internal controls to prevent or minimize financial loss from failure of systems, people, or processes. This includes specific programs and frameworks intended to prevent or limit the effects of cybersecurity risk including, but not limited to, cyber-attacks or other information security breaches that might allow unauthorized transactions or unauthorized access to client, team member, or company sensitive information. Metrics and measurements are used by our management team in the management of day-to-day operations to ensure effective client service, minimization of service disruptions, and oversight of cybersecurity risk. We continually monitor and report on operational, technology, and cybersecurity risks related to business disruptions and systems failures; cyber-attacks, information security or data breaches; clients, products, and business practices; damage to physical assets; employee and workplace safety; execution, delivery, and process management; and external and internal fraud. 

The Enterprise Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for the oversight, guidance, and monitoring of risks, including operational/technology/cybersecurity risks, being taken by the Company. The monitoring is accomplished through ongoing review of management reports, data on risks and policy limits, and consistent discussion on enterprise risk management strategies, policies, and risk assessments. 

Regulatory/Compliance/Legal Risk 

Regulatory/compliance/legal risk is the risk that the Company violated or was not in compliance with applicable laws, regulations or practices, industry standards, or ethical standards. The legal portion assesses the risk that unenforceable contracts, lawsuits, or adverse judgments can disrupt or otherwise negatively impact the Company. The Board of Directors expects that we will perform business in a manner compliant with applicable laws and/or regulations and expects issues to be identified, analyzed, and remediated in a timely and complete manner. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

Our most significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Certain of these accounting policies require management to use significant judgment and estimates, which can have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities. We consider these policies to be our critical accounting estimates. The judgment and assumptions made are based upon historical experience, future forecasts, or other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgment and assumptions, actual results could differ from estimates, which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

Business Combination and Goodwill 

&#8226; Description. For acquisitions, we are required to record the assets acquired, including identified intangible assets such as core deposit and customer trust relationship intangibles, and the liabilities assumed at their fair value. The difference between consideration and the net fair value of assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management uses significant estimates and assumptions to value such items, including projected cash flows, repayment rates, default rates and losses assuming default, discount rates, and realizable collateral values. The allowance for credit losses for PCD loans is recognized within acquisition accounting. The allowance for credit losses for non-PCD assets is recognized as provision for credit losses in the same reporting period as the acquisition. Fair value adjustments are amortized or accreted into the income statement over the estimated life of the acquired assets or assumed liabilities. The purchase date valuations and any subsequent adjustments determine the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition. The use of different assumptions could produce significantly different valuation results, which could have material positive or negative effects on our results of operations. The carrying value of goodwill recorded must be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, as well as on an interim basis if events or changes indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss must be recognized for any excess of carrying value over fair value of the goodwill. 

&#8226; Judgments and Uncertainties. The determination of fair values is based on valuations using management&#8217;s assumptions of future growth rates, future attrition, discount rates, multiples of earnings or other relevant factors. In addition, we engage third party specialists to assist in the development of fair values. Preliminary estimates of fair values may be adjusted for a period of time subsequent to the acquisition date if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. Adjustments recorded during this period are recognized in the current reporting period. Management uses various valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of these assets and liabilities, and often involves a significant degree of judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular item being valued. Examples of such items include loans, deposits, identifiable intangible assets, and certain other assets and liabilities. 

&#8226; Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions. Changes in these factors, as well as downturns in economic or business conditions, could have a significant adverse impact on the carrying value of assets, including goodwill and liabilities, which could result in impairment losses affecting our financial statements as a whole and our banking subsidiary in which the goodwill resides. 

&#8226; Pandemic. A prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, or any other epidemic that harms the global economy, U.S. economy, or the economies in which we operate could adversely affect our operations. Goodwill is especially susceptible to risk of impairment during prolonged periods of economic downturn. 

For additional information regarding critical accounting estimates, see the section titled &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; included in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. There have been no material changes in the Company&#8217;s application of critical accounting estimates related to allowance for credit losses for loans, derivative financial instruments, or income taxes since December 31, 2021.
