 Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

INTRODUCTION 

The following discussion and analysis is part of Regions Financial Corporation&#8217;s (&#8220;Regions&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and updates Regions&#8217; Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was previously filed with the SEC. This financial information is presented to aid in understanding Regions&#8217; financial position and results of operations and should be read together with the financial information contained in the Form 10-K. See Note 1 "Basis of Presentation" and Note 12 "Recent Accounting Pronouncements" to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. The emphasis of this discussion will be on the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020 for the consolidated statements of income. For the consolidated balance sheets, the emphasis of this discussion will be the balances as of March 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020. 

This discussion and analysis contains statements that may be considered &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See pages 7 through 9 for additional information regarding forward-looking statements. 

CORPORATE PROFILE 

Regions is a financial holding company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, that operates in the South, Midwest and Texas. Regions provides traditional commercial, retail and mortgage banking services, as well as other financial services in the fields of asset management, wealth management, securities brokerage, trust services, merger and acquisition advisory services and other specialty financing. 

Regions conducts its banking operations through Regions Bank, an Alabama state-chartered commercial bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System. At March 31, 2021, Regions operated 1,366 total branch outlets. Regions carries out its strategies and derives its profitability from three reportable business segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management, with the remainder in Other. See Note 10 "Business Segment Information" to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding Regions&#8217; segment reporting structure. 

On February 27, 2020, Regions announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire Ascentium Capital LLC, an independent equipment financing company headquartered in Kingwood, Texas. The transaction closed on April 1, 2020, and included approximately $1.9 billion in loans and leases to small businesses. Refer to the "Ascentium Acquisition" section for more detail. 

Regions&#8217; profitability, like that of many other financial institutions, is dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income as well as non-interest income sources. Net interest income is primarily the difference between the interest income Regions receives on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest expense Regions pays on interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Regions&#8217; net interest income is impacted by the size and mix of its balance sheet components and the interest rate spread between interest earned on its assets and interest paid on its liabilities. Non-interest income includes fees from service charges on deposit accounts, card and ATM fees, mortgage servicing and secondary marketing, investment management and trust activities, capital markets and other customer services which Regions provides. Results of operations are also affected by the provision for credit losses and non-interest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, professional, legal and regulatory expenses, FDIC insurance assessments, and other operating expenses, as well as income taxes. 

Economic conditions, competition, new legislation and related rules impacting regulation of the financial services industry and the monetary and fiscal policies of the Federal government significantly affect most, if not all, financial institutions, including Regions. Lending and deposit activities and fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and investment, consumer income, consumer spending and savings, capital market activities, and competition among financial institutions, as well as customer preferences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing products in Regions&#8217; market areas. 

Regions&#8217; business strategy is focused on providing a competitive mix of products and services, delivering quality customer service, and continuing to develop and optimize distribution channels that include a branch distribution network with offices in convenient locations, as well as electronic and mobile banking. 

FIRST QUARTER OVERVIEW 

Economic Environment in Regions&#8217; Banking Markets 

One of the primary factors influencing the credit performance of Regions&#8217; loan portfolio is the overall economic environment in the U.S. and the primary markets in which it operates. Regions' April 2021 baseline forecast anticipates real GDP growth of 6.2 percent in 2021, 4.1 percent in 2022, and 2.3 percent in 2023. The April baseline forecast anticipates the level of real GDP will return to the fourth quarter 2019 level, the last quarter free of the effects of COVID-19, in the second quarter of 2021. While the downside risks posed by the COVID-19 virus have not been eliminated, they nonetheless have diminished with further progress on the vaccination front. Further reopening of the economy and significant fiscal and monetary 

Table of Conte nts 

support are expected to lead to notably rapid growth over coming quarters, but it is anticipated that by year-end 2022 the economy will be on a path of growth of around 2.0 percent that prevailed prior to the pandemic. As has been the case over the past year, there remains a heightened degree of uncertainty around economic forecasts being made at present. 

There was a marked acceleration in the pace of economic activity in March 2021, as evidenced in the data on nonfarm employment, consumer spending, residential construction, and personal income. The monthly surveys conducted by the ISM show accelerating and broad-based expansions in the manufacturing sector and the broad services sector; and in March, the ISM Manufacturing Index reached its highest level since December 1983 and the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index rose to its highest level on record. The acceleration in the pace of economic activity in March in part reflects payback for activity having been held down by unusually harsh winter weather in February, but also reflects further reopening of the economy and the distribution of the bulk of the third round of Economic Impact Payments of up to $1,400 per eligible recipient. 

The third round of Economic Impact Payments came on top of an already elevated household saving rate. While there are questions as to whether, or to what extent, consumer behavior and attitudes will have changed after the experiences of the pandemic, it is nonetheless expected that coming months will see a significant spike in consumer spending, particularly spending on services, as further progress is made on the vaccination front and the economy more fully reopens. Additional fiscal policy support will also contribute to a faster pace of economic growth. While supply chain/logistics issues pose a headwind, particularly for motor vehicle producers, the broad-based expansion in the manufacturing sector is expected to continue over coming quarters, and business investment spending will contribute to top-line real GDP growth. Single family residential construction will also be additive to growth, but the for-sale segment of the housing market remains plagued by notably low inventories of homes, new and existing, for sale. Along with strong demand, lean inventories have contributed to robust house price appreciation which, in conjunction with higher mortgage interest rates, could weigh on affordability. However, new home construction and sales are expected to contribute to top-line real GDP growth. 

Inflation is expected to accelerate further in the months ahead, reflecting base effects, supply chain/logistics bottlenecks, and services prices adjusting to the economy reopening, while further weakness in the U.S. dollar could also add to inflation pressures. While base effects are obviously transitory, it is unclear whether, or to what extent, inflation pressures will be sustained, particularly to the point the FOMC would feel compelled to respond. Still, to the extent inflation, and inflation expectations, rise over coming quarters, that will be a source of upward pressure on longer-term market interest rates, with added pressure stemming from larger government budget deficits that will necessitate increased debt issuance. With the short end of the yield curve well-anchored, persistent steepening of the yield curve could at some point lead the FOMC to alter the composition of FRB asset purchases, putting more emphasis on longer-dated assets and less emphasis on shorter-dated assets. We expect no changes in the pace of FRB asset purchases in 2021, nor do we anticipate any changes in the Fed funds rate target range at least through 2022. 

The Biden Administration&#8217;s proposed $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan is not incorporated into the April baseline forecast, as at present there are no final details on either the spending side or the tax side of the plan. Still, expectations of the potential economic effects of the plan should be tempered by the fact that spending would be phased in over an eight-year period and may be at least partially offset by tax increases. As such, the net effect on GDP growth in any single year over the 2022-2029 period could be relatively small. 

In March 2021, many of the top depository states in the Regions footprint had significantly lower unemployment rates than the U.S as a whole, which could indicate a more accelerated economic recovery in these states. Furthermore, parts of the Regions footprint, most notably Florida, that are traditionally more reliant on travel and tourism will continue to benefit from further reopening of the economy and increased mobility. However, Texas and Louisiana have above-average exposure to energy, so these economies could be more prone to lasting effects if the recovery does prove to be slower than is now anticipated. 

The continued signs of economic improvement, with consideration of uncertainty inherent in the forecast, impacted Regions' forecast utilized in calculating the ACL as of March 31, 2021. See the "Allowance" section for further information. 

COVID-19 Pandemic 

Regions' business operations and financial results are influenced by the economic environment in which the Company operates. In the first quarter of 2021, the economic forecast continued to show signs of recovery. While some uncertainty remains, the economic forecast shows a much more positive outlook as the economy moves toward fully reopening. There are select areas where the COVID-19 pandemic impacted first quarter conditions, as discussed below. Regions expects that the pandemic will continue to influence economic conditions and the Company's financial results in future quarters. 

While branch lobbies are open for business, Regions continues to keep measures in place to ensure associate and customer safety, such as providing face coverings for all associates and reducing occupancy levels to encourage social distancing. Regions is in the process of implementing a phased approach to return remote working associates to office locations. As of March 31, 2021, approximately 90 percent of the Company's non-branch associates are working remotely. 

Table of Conte nts 

During the first quarter of 2021, the Company continued to offer financial assistance to support customers who were experiencing financial hardships related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This assistance included offering special COVID-related payment deferral or forbearance programs for the Company's mortgage and home equity loan customers. 

Regions' outstanding deferrals have declined 92 percent since the initial relief provided in early 2020 from $5.7 billion as of June 30, 2020 to $437 million as of March 31, 2021. Of total outstanding deferrals, 61 percent are related to residential mortgages that are government guaranteed. Of the loan balances that have exited deferral, 96 percent were either current or less than 30 days past due. 

As a certified SBA lender, Regions experienced a slight increase in lending activity in the first quarter of 2021 as the Company continued to assist customers through the loan process under the PPP. Under this program, Regions has approximately 45,900 loans outstanding totaling approximately $4.3 billion as of March 31, 2021. 

Regions continues to have strong liquidity and capital levels, which have the Company well-prepared to respond to customer borrowing needs. The Company has ample sources of liquidity that include a stable deposit base, cash balances held at the Federal Reserve, borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank, unencumbered highly liquid securities, and borrowing availability at the Federal Reserve's discount window. See the "Liquidity", "Shareholders' Equity", and "Regulatory Capital" sections for further information. 

The COVID-19 pandemic also affected non-interest income. With additional government stimulus and changes in customer behavior, combined with continued enhancements to overdraft practices and transaction postings, the Company estimates consumer service charges will remain 10 percent to 15 percent below pre-pandemic levels. See Table 24 "Non-Interest Income" for more detail. 

Regions has experienced a modest increase in cyber events as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, however the Company's layered control environment has effectively detected and prevented any material impact related to these events. Refer to the "Information Security" section for further detail. 

Supervisory Stress Test Update 

During the third quarter of 2020, the FRB finalized Regions' SCB requirement for the fourth quarter of 2020 through the third quarter of 2021 at 3.0 percent. On April 21, 2021, the Company declared a cash dividend for the second quarter of 2021 of $0.155 per share, which was in compliance with the Federal Reserve's SCB framework. 

While Regions was not required to participate in the 2021 CCAR, the Company chose to participate in part to have the Federal Reserve re-evaluate Regions' SCB. The submission was made in April 2021 and the Company expects to receive the results by June 30, 2021, with an effective date of October 1, 2021. 

First Quarter Results 

Regions reported net income available to common shareholders of $614 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $139 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2020. 

For the first quarter of 2021, net interest income (taxable-equivalent basis) totaled $1.0 billion, up $38 million compared to the first quarter of 2020. The net interest margin (taxable-equivalent basis) was 3.02 percent for the first quarter of 2021 and 3.44 percent in the first quarter of 2020. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by decreases in deposit costs and outstanding borrowings. Net interest margin was negatively impacted by excess cash balances due to significant deposit growth. Refer to Table 20 "Consolidated Average Daily Balances and Yield/Rate Analysis" for further details. 

The benefit from credit losses totaled $142 million in the first quarter of 2021, as compared to a provision of $373 million during the first quarter of 2020. The current quarter benefit was primarily due to continuing improvement in credit metrics, improvement in macroeconomic conditions and recent government stimulus programs. Refer to the "Allowance for Credit Losses" section for further detail. 

Net charge-offs totaled $83 million, or an annualized 0.40 percent of average loans, in the first quarter of 2021, compared to $123 million, or an annualized 0.59 percent for the first quarter of 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by broad-based improvements across most portfolios. See Note 3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

The allowance was 2.44 percent of total loans, net of unearned income at March 31, 2021 compared to 2.69 percent at December 31, 2020. The decrease was impacted by the factors discussed above. The allowance was 280 percent of total non-performing loans at March 31, 2021 compared to 308 percent at December 31, 2020 . Total non-performing loans (excluding loans held for sale) remained flat at 0.87 percent of total loans, net of unearned income, at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Refer to the "Allowance for Credit Losses" section for further detail. 

Non-interest income was $641 million for the first quarter of 2021, a $156 million increase from the first quarter of 2020. The increase was primarily driven by higher mortgage and capital markets income and positive market valuation adjustments on 

Table of Conte nts 

employee benefit assets. The increases were partially offset by lower service charges income. See Table 24 "Non-Interest Income" for more detail. 

Total non-interest expense was $928 million in the first quarter of 2021, a $92 million increase from the first quarter of 2020. The increase was primarily driven by higher salaries and employee benefit expenses. See Table 25 "Non-Interest Expense" for more detail. 

Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $180 million compared to $42 million for the same period in 2020. See "Income Taxes" toward the end of the Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis section of this report for more detail.

The reconciliation with respect to these forward-looking non-GAAP measures is expected to be consistent with the actual non-GAAP reconciliations within Management's Discussion and Analysis of this Form 10-Q. For more information related to the Company's 2021 expectations, refer to the related sub-sections discussed in more detail within Management's Discussion and Analysis of this Form 10-Q. 

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 

The following sections provide expanded discussion of significant changes in certain line items in asset, liability, and shareholders' equity categories. 

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 

Cash and cash equivalents increased approximately $7.0 billion from year-end 2020 to March 31, 2021, due primarily to an increase in cash on deposit with the FRB. Excess liquidity from deposit growth is held at the FRB. Deposit growth was primarily driven by consumer deposits from recent government stimulus payments during the first quarter of 2021. See the "Liquidity" and "Deposits" sections for more information. 

DEBT SECURITIES 

The following table details the carrying values of debt securities, including both available for sale and held to maturity: 

Table 1&#8212;Debt Securities 

March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 &#160; (In millions) U.S. Treasury securities $ 232 $ 183 Federal agency securities 98 105 Mortgage-backed securities: Residential agency 19,330 19,611 Residential non-agency 1 1 Commercial agency 6,774 6,586 Commercial non-agency 570 586 Corporate and other debt securities 1,146 1,204 $ 28,151 $ 28,276 

Debt securities available for sale, which constitute the majority of the securities portfolio, are an important tool used to manage interest rate sensitivity and provide a primary source of liquidity for the Company. Regions maintains a highly rated securities portfolio consisting primarily of agency mortgage-backed securities. See Note 2 "Debt Securities" to the consolidated 

Table of Conte nts 

financial statements for additional information. Also see the "Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk" and "Liquidity" sections for more information. 

Debt securities decreased $125 million from December 31, 2020 to March 31, 2021. The decrease from year-end was primarily the result of a reduction in net unrealized gains due to an increase in market interest rates. 

LOANS HELD FOR SALE 

Loans held for sale totaled $1.5 billion at March 31, 2021, consisting of $1.2 billion of residential real estate mortgage loans, $316 million of commercial mortgage and other loans, and $8 million of non-performing loans. At December 31, 2020, loans held for sale totaled $1.9 billion, consisting of $1.4 billion of residential real estate mortgage loans, $460 million of commercial mortgage and other loans, and $6 million of non-performing loans. In the fourth quarter of 2020, Regions made the decision to sell a certain portfolio of $239 million commercial and industrial loans, which were reclassified to held for sale as of December 31, 2020. As of March 31, 2021, these loans remain in the held for sale portfolio. The levels of residential real estate and commercial mortgage loans held for sale that are part of the Company's mortgage originations to be sold fluctuate depending on the timing of origination and sale to third parties. 

LOANS 

Loans, net of unearned income, represented approximately 64 percent of Regions&#8217; interest-earning assets at March 31, 2021. The following table presents the distribution of Regions&#8217; loan portfolio by portfolio segment and class, net of unearned income:

PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS 

The following sections describe the composition of the portfolio segments and classes disclosed in Table 2, explain changes in balances from 2020 year-end, and highlight the related risk characteristics. Regions believes that its loan portfolio is well diversified by product, client, and geography throughout its footprint. However, the loan portfolio may be exposed to certain concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers, certain types of collateral, certain types of industries, certain loan products, or certain regions of the country. Refer to Note 6 "Allowance for Credit Losses" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for additional information regarding Regions&#8217; portfolio segments and related classes, as well as the risks specific to each. 

Many classes within Regions' portfolio segments continue to experience the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent to which Regions' borrowers are ultimately impacted will be influenced by the duration and severity of the economic impact, the timely distribution and efficacy of a vaccine, as well as the effectiveness of various government stimulus programs in place to support individuals and businesses. See Table 3 and Table 4 below for more detail. 

Table of Conte nts 

Commercial 

The commercial portfolio segment includes commercial and industrial loans to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases and other expansion projects. Commercial and industrial loans increased $371 million since year-end 2020. The March 31, 2021 balance includes $4.3 billion of PPP loans, an increase of $700 million compared to year-end 2020. Although commercial and industrial loans increased modestly, line utilization levels continued to decline to historically low levels since year-end driven by continued excess liquidity and customer deleveraging. 

Commercial also includes owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans to operating businesses, which are loans for long-term financing of land and buildings, and are repaid by cash flows generated by business operations. Owner-occupied commercial real estate construction loans are made to commercial businesses for the development of land or construction of a building where the repayment is derived from revenues generated from the business of the borrower. 

Over half of the Company&#8217;s total loans are included in the commercial portfolio segment. These balances are spread across numerous industries, as noted in the table below. The Company manages the related risks to this portfolio by setting certain lending limits for each significant industry. 

The following tables provide detail of Regions' commercial lending balances in selected industries.

(1) "Real estate" includes REITs, which are unsecured commercial and industrial products that are real estate related. 

(2) "Other" contains balances related to non-classifiable and invalid business industry codes offset by payments in process and fee accounts that are not available at the loan level. 

(3) As customers' businesses evolve (e.g. up or down the vertical manufacturing chain), Regions may need to change the assigned business industry code used to define the customer relationship. When these changes occur, Regions does not recast the customer history for prior periods into the new classification because the business industry code used in the prior period was deemed appropriate. As a result, comparable period changes may be impacted. 

Regions has identified certain industry sectors within the commercial and investor real estate portfolio segments that have the highest risk due to COVID-19. A bottom-up review was performed in the first quarter of 2021 , which narrowed high-risk industry sectors compared to year-end 2020. As of March 31, 2021, these high-risk industries include energy, healthcare, consumer services and travel, retail, restaurants, and hotels. Identified COVID-19 high-risk balances have declined $1.8 billion from $5.2 billion at year-end 2020 to $3.4 billion as of March 30, 2021. 

Industries and sub-sectors identified as high-risk may change in future periods depending on how the macroeconomic environment conditions develop over time. These identified high-risk industries, and specified sectors within these industries, are detailed in Table 4 below. PPP loan balances are not included in Table 4 as these loans are not considered high risk, as they are fully guaranteed by the U.S. government. Regions is closely monitoring customers in these industries and has frequent dialogue with these customers. All loans within these tables are in the commercial portfolio segment, unless specifically identified as IRE.

_______ 

(1) Represents balances considered high-risk that are not included in COVID-19 high-risk industries 

(2) Regions defines classified loans as commercial and investor real estate loans risk-rated substandard accrual and non-accrual, and criticized loans as those risk-rated special mention, substandard accrual and non-accrual. Criticized loans are also referred to as "criticized and classified". 

Of the COVID-19 high-risk industries and sub-sectors noted in the table above, Regions considers certain ones worthy of further discussion as described below. The period over period trends in the credit metrics such as percent criticized and the leveraged percent of balance as illustrated in Table 4 are indicators of a higher level of risk in those industries and sub-sectors. 

Regions' direct energy portfolio is comprised mostly of E&#38;P and midstream sector borrowers. As of March 31, 2021, the outstanding balance of high-risk energy loans declined compared to December 31, 2020 levels. The outstanding balance of criticized loans in this category also decreased and there were no leveraged loans included within the direct energy portfolio at March 31, 2021. During the first three months of 2021, Regions recognized a nominal amount of energy charge-offs. Furthermore, oil prices rebounded from all-time lows in April 2020 returning to pre-pandemic levels and hedge positions are strong for oil producers and natural gas providers. 

Full service restaurant lending remains a focus as areas of the economy begin to reopen. Regions' exposure in restaurant lending identified as high risk continued to decline as outstanding balances decreased $54 million from year-end 2020. The balance of criticized loans in the high-risk restaurant lending portfolio also decreased as compared to December 31, 2020. During the three months ended March 31 2021, Regions recognized gross restaurant charge-offs of $3 million. 

Regions' hotel-related portfolio is primarily comprised of 11 REIT customers. These loans are unsecured commercial and industrial loans; however, they are real estate related. The REIT portfolio benefits from low leverage, strong liquidity, and diversity of property holdings. Regions' exposure in hotel-related lending identified as high risk increased by $8 million compared to December 31, 2020, however the balance of retail-related IRE loans identified as high risk decreased significantly. 

Investor Real Estate 

Loans for real estate development are repaid through cash flows related to the operation, sale or refinance of the property. This portfolio segment includes extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is dependent on the sale of real estate or income generated from the real estate collateral. A portion of Regions&#8217; investor real estate portfolio segment consists of loans secured by residential product types (land, single-family and condominium loans) within Regions&#8217; markets. Additionally, this category includes loans made to finance income-producing properties such as apartment buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers. Total investor real estate loans decreased $41 million in comparison to 2020 year-end balances. 

Residential First Mortgage 

Residential first mortgage loans represent loans to consumers to finance a residence. These loans are typically financed over a 15 to 30 year term and, in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence. These loans 

Table of Conte nts 

increased $68 million in comparison to 2020 year-end balances. The increase in residential first mortgage loans was primarily driven by an increase in originations due to continued historically low market interest rates. Approximately $1.5 billion in new loan originations were retained on the balance sheet through the first three months of 2021. 

Home Equity Lines 

Home equity lines are secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower's residence and allow customers to borrow against the equity in their homes. Home equity lines decreased by $253 million in comparison to 2020 year-end balances. Substantially all of this portfolio was originated through Regions&#8217; branch network. 

Beginning in December 2016, new home equity lines of credit have a 10-year draw period and a 20-year repayment term. During the 10-year draw period customers do not have an interest-only payment option, except on a very limited basis. From May 2009 to December 2016, home equity lines of credit had a 10-year draw period and a 10-year repayment term. Prior to May 2009, home equity lines of credit had a 20-year repayment term with a balloon payment upon maturity or a 5-year draw period with a balloon payment upon maturity. The term &#8220;balloon payment&#8221; means there are no principal payments required until the balloon payment is due for interest-only lines of credit. 

The following table presents information regarding the future principal payment reset dates for the Company's home equity lines of credit as of March 31, 2021. The balances presented are based on maturity date for lines with a balloon payment and draw period expiration date for lines that convert to a repayment period.

Home Equity Loans 

Home equity loans are also secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower's residence, are primarily originated as amortizing loans, and allow customers to borrow against the equity in their homes. Home equity loans decreased by $82 million in comparison to 2020 year-end balances. Substantially all of this portfolio was originated through Regions&#8217; branch network. 

Other Consumer Credit Quality Data 

The Company calculates an estimate of the current value of property secured as collateral for both residential first mortgage and home equity lending products (&#8220;current LTV&#8221;). The estimate is based on home price indices compiled by a third party. The third party data indicates trends for MSAs. Regions uses the third party valuation trends from the MSAs in the Company's footprint in its estimate. The trend data is applied to the loan portfolios taking into account the age of the most recent valuation and geographic area. 

The following table presents current LTV data for components of the residential first mortgage, home equity lines and home equity loans classes of the consumer portfolio segment. Current LTV data for some loans in the portfolio is not available due to mergers and systems integrations. The amounts in the table represent the entire loan balance. For purposes of the table below, if the loan balance exceeds the current estimated collateral the entire balance is included in the &#8220;Above 100%&#8221; category, regardless of the amount of collateral available to partially offset the shortfall.

Indirect&#8212;Vehicles 

Indirect-vehicles lending, which was lending initiated through third-party business partners, largely consists of loans made through automotive dealerships. This portfolio decreased $166 million from year-end 2020 as Regions has discontinued its indirect auto lending business. The Company remains in the direct auto lending business. 

Indirect&#8212;Other Consumer 

Indirect-other consumer lending represents other lending initiatives through third parties, including point of sale lending. This portfolio decreased $169 million from year-end 2020 due to exiting a third party relationship during the fourth quarter of 2019. 

Consumer Credit Card 

Consumer credit card lending represents primarily open-ended variable interest rate consumer credit card loans. These balances decreased $102 million from year-end 2020 reflecting lower credit card transaction volume as well as elevated payment rates. 

Other Consumer 

Other consumer loans primarily include direct consumer loans, overdrafts and other revolving loans. Other consumer loans decreased $60 million from year-end 2020. 

Regions considers factors such as periodic updates of FICO scores, unemployment, home prices, and geography as credit quality indicators for consumer loans. FICO scores are obtained at origination and refreshed FICO scores are obtained by the Company quarterly for all consumer loans. For more information on credit quality indicators refer to Note 3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" . 

Table of Conte nts 

ALLOWANCE 

The allowance consists of two components: the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. Discussion of the methodology used to calculate the allowance is included in Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 6 "Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as well as related discussion in Management's Discussion and Analysis. 

The allowance is sensitive to a number of internal factors, such as modifications in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding, portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings. The allowance is also sensitive to external factors such as the general health of the economy, as evidenced by changes in interest rates, GDP, unemployment rates, changes in real estate demand and values, volatility in commodity prices, bankruptcy filings, health pandemics, government stimulus, and the effects of weather and natural disasters such as droughts, floods and hurricanes. 

Management considers these variables and all other available information when establishing the final level of the allowance. These variables and others have the ability to result in actual credit losses that differ from the originally estimated amounts. 

The allowance totaled $2.1 billion at March 31, 2021 compared to $2.3 billion at December 31, 2020, which represents management's best estimate of expected losses over the life of the loan and credit commitment portfolios. Key drivers of the change in the allowance are presented in Table 7 below. While many of these items overlap regarding impact, they are included in the category most relevant.

_______ 

(1) Regions adopted the CECL accounting guidance on January 1, 2020 and recorded the cumulative effect of the change in accounting guidance as a reduction to retained earnings and an increase to deferred tax assets in the first quarter of 2020. 

(2) This line item includes the net impact of portfolio growth, portfolio run-off, pay-downs and changes in the mix of total outstanding loans.. This line item excludes the impact of PPP loans of $4.3 billion as of March 31, 2021, which are fully backed by the U.S. government and have an immaterial associated allowance. 

Credit metrics are monitored throughout the quarter in order to understand external macro-views of credit metrics, trends and industry outlooks, as well as Regions' internal specific views of credit metrics and trends. The first quarter of 2021 exhibited continued signs of improvement, as evidenced by a modest improvement in almost all credit metrics. Commercial and investor real estate criticized balances decreased approximately $44 million, total net charge-offs decreased $11 million, and non-performing loans, excluding held for sale, decreased approximately $7 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Conversely, classified balances increased $144 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Additionally, mortgage LTVs are holding up well and the HPI showed robust appreciation. Regions continued to perform a bottom-up review of loan portfolios during the first quarter of 2021, which resulted in fewer sectors considered high-risk compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. As of March 31, 2021, $3.4 billion of commercial and investor real estate loans are in COVID-19 high-risk industry segments, a decline of $1.8 billion from December 31, 2020. These high-risk industries include energy, healthcare, consumer services and travel, retail, restaurants, and hotels. Refer to the "Portfolio Characteristics" section for more information about the high-risk industries. As the credit risk within Regions' loan portfolio continues to be evaluated, both negative and positive factors of the ever-evolving economic landscape were considered in determining the allowance estimate. 

As economic activity accelerated and additional fiscal and monetary policy moved through the system, the first quarter of 2021 showed signs of economic improvement, evidenced by higher consumer spend in the current quarter. While economic growth continued to improve, the public health crisis is not resolved and economic uncertainty still remains. Regions' economic forecast utilized in the March 31, 2021 allowance estimate considered the continued improvement of the economic outlook, the economy reopening further and increased distribution of vaccines. Refer to the Economic Environment in Regions' Banking 

Table of Conte nts 

Markets within the "First Quarter Overview" section for more information. Furthermore, Regions benchmarked its internal forecast with external forecasts and external data available. 

The table below reflects a range of macroeconomic factors utilized in the Base forecast over the two-year R&#38;S forecast period as of March 31, 2021. The unemployment rate is the most significant macroeconomic factor among the CECL models. Unemployment remained normalized in the first quarter as noted above. 

Table 8&#8212; Macroeconomic Factors in the Forecast 

Pre-R&#38;S Period Base R&#38;S Forecast March 31, 2021 1Q2021 2Q2021 3Q2021 4Q2021 1Q2022 2Q2022 3Q2022 4Q2022 1Q2023 Real GDP, annualized % change 4.90 % 6.80 % 6.30 % 4.90 % 3.90 % 2.70 % 2.60 % 2.40 % 2.30 % Unemployment rate 6.20 % 5.80 % 5.50 % 5.20 % 4.80 % 4.70 % 4.50 % 4.30 % 4.10 % HPI, year-over-year % change 10.10 % 10.00 % 8.10 % 5.70 % 3.50 % 3.00 % 3.00 % 3.00 % 3.00 % S&#38;P 500 3,833 3,858 3,892 3,911 3,951 3,989 4,018 4,056 4,091 

All of these factors, along with credit improvement described above, were significant drivers of the modeled decreases in the allowance. While Regions' quantitative allowance methodologies strive to reflect all risk factors, any estimate involves assumptions and uncertainties resulting in some level of imprecision. The qualitative framework has a general imprecision component which is meant to acknowledge that model and forecast errors are inherent in any modeling estimate. The March 31, 2021 general imprecision allowance reflected management's caution with respect to the modeled reductions in the allowance given the uncertainty surrounding the pace of economic recovery as the changing status of the pandemic unfolds. 

Based on the overall analysis performed, management deemed an allowance of $2.1 billion to be appropriate to absorb expected credit losses in the loan and credit commitment portfolios as of March 31, 2021. 

Table of Conte nts 

Details regarding the allowance and net charge-offs, including an analysis of activity from the previous year&#8217;s totals, are included in Table 9 "Allowance for Credit Losses." As noted above, economic trends such as interest rates, unemployment, volatility in commodity prices and collateral valuations as well as the length and depth of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of the CARES Act and other policy accommodations will impact the future levels of net charge-offs and may result in volatility of certain credit metrics during the remainder of 2021 and beyond.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs) 

TDRs are modified loans in which a concession is provided to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. As provided initially in the CARES Act passed into law on March 27, 2020 and subsequently extended through the Consolidated Appropriations Act signed into law on December 27, 2020, certain loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic beginning March 1, 2020 through the earlier of 60 days after the end of the pandemic or January 1, 2022 are eligible for relief from TDR classification. Regions elected this provision of both Acts; therefore, modified loans that met the required guidelines for relief are not considered TDRs and are excluded from the disclosures below. 

Under Regions' COVID-19 deferral and forbearance programs, customer payments are deferred for a period of time, typically 90 days. Upon expiration of the deferral period, customers may apply for additional relief or resume making payments on their loans. Repayment plans for the deferrals differ depending on the loan type and repayment ability of the borrower. The TDR relief and short-term nature of most COVID-19 deferrals precluded these modifications from being classified as TDRs as of March 31, 2021. 

Residential first mortgage, home equity, consumer credit card and other consumer TDRs are consumer loans modified under the CAP. Commercial and investor real estate loan modifications are not the result of a formal program, but represent situations where modifications were offered as a workout alternative. Renewals of classified commercial and investor real estate loans are considered to be TDRs, even if no reduction in interest rate is offered, if the existing terms are considered to be below market. Insignificant modifications are not considered TDRs. More detailed information is included in Note 3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements. The following table summarizes the loan balance and related allowance for accruing and non-accruing TDRs for the periods presented:

The following table provides an analysis of the changes in commercial and investor real estate TDRs. TDRs with subsequent restructurings that meet the definition of a TDR are only reported as TDR additions in the period they were first modified. Other than resolutions such as charge-offs, foreclosures, payments, sales and transfers to held for sale, Regions may remove loans from TDR classification if the following conditions are met: the borrower's financial condition improves such that the borrower is no longer in financial difficulty, the loan has not had any forgiveness of principal or interest, the loan has not been restructured as an "A" note/"B" note, the loan has been reported as a TDR over one fiscal year-end and the loan is subsequently refinanced or restructured at market terms such that it qualifies as a new loan. 

For the consumer portfolio, changes in TDRs are primarily due to additions from CAP modifications and outflows from payments and charge-offs. Given the types of concessions currently being granted under the CAP as detailed in Note 3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements, Regions does not expect that the market interest rate condition will be widely achieved. Therefore, Regions expects consumer loans modified through CAP to continue to be identified as TDRs for the remaining term of the loan.

Total 90 days or more past due guaranteed loans excluded were $51 million at March 31, 2021 and $57 million at December 31, 2020. 

Non-performing loans at March 31, 2021 have decreased compared to year-end levels, primarily driven by a slight decline in commercial investor real estate. 

Economic trends such as interest rates, unemployment, volatility in commodity prices, and collateral valuations will impact the future level of non-performing assets. Circumstances related to individually large credits could also result in volatility.

GOODWILL 

Goodwill totaled $5.2 billion at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 and is allocated to each of Regions&#8217; reportable segments (each a reporting unit), at which level goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more often if events and circumstances indicate the fair value of the reporting unit may have declined below the carrying value (refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for further discussion of when Regions tests goodwill for impairment and the Company's methodology and valuation approaches used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit). 

The result of the assessment performed for the first quarter of 2021 did not indicate that the estimated fair values of the Company&#8217;s reporting units (Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank and Wealth Management) had declined below their respective carrying values. Therefore, Regions determined that a test of goodwill impairment was not required for each of Regions&#8217; reporting units for the March 31, 2021 interim period.

DEPOSITS 

Regions competes with other banking and financial services companies for a share of the deposit market. Regions&#8217; ability to compete in the deposit market depends heavily on the pricing of its deposits and how effectively the Company meets customers&#8217; needs. Regions employs various means to meet those needs and enhance competitiveness, such as providing a high level of customer service and competitive pricing and convenient branch locations for its customers. Regions also serves customers through providing centralized, high-quality banking services and the Company's digital channels and contact center. 

The following table summarizes deposits by category: 

Table 15&#8212;Deposits 

March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 &#160; (In millions) Non-interest-bearing demand $ 55,925 $ 51,289 Savings 13,500 11,635 Interest-bearing transaction 24,757 24,484 Money market&#8212;domestic 30,448 29,719 Time deposits 4,970 5,341 Customer deposits 129,600 122,468 Corporate treasury time deposits 2 11 $ 129,602 $ 122,479 

Total deposits at March 31, 2021 increased approximately $7.1 billion compared to year-end 2020 levels, driven by increases in non-interest-bearing demand, savings, interest-bearing transaction and domestic money market categories. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in customer time deposits. Increases across all categories are primarily driven by an increase in customer deposit balances due to recent government stimulus payments and, to a lesser degree, new account growth. Also contributing to non-interest bearing demand growth is an increase in deposits from business customers who continued to retain excess liquidity. Customer time deposits decreased due to maturities, and continued lower interest rates resulted in a decrease in the utilization of time deposit accounts.

Table of Conte nts 

On January 12, 2021, Regions sent notices of redemption, which resulted in the redemption on January 22, 2021, of its 3.20% senior notes due February 2021 pursuant to their terms, at an aggregate redemption price equal to the sum of 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed and any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. 

On February 19, 2021, Regions Bank sent notices of redemption, which resulted in the redemption on March 1, 2021 of its 2.75% senior bank notes due April 1, 2021 and of its senior floating rate bank notes due April 1, 2021 pursuant to their terms, at an aggregate redemption price equal to the sum of 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed and any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. 

The Ascentium note securitizations have various classes and have a weighted-average interest rate of 2.12% at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, with remaining maturities ranging from 3 years to 5 years and a weighted-average of 3.8 years. 

SHAREHOLDERS&#8217; EQUITY 

Shareholders&#8217; equity was $17.9 billion at March 31, 2021 as compared to $18.1 billion at December 31, 2020. During the first three months of 2021, net income increased shareholders' equity by $642 million, cash dividends on common stock reduced shareholders' equity by $149 million and cash dividends on preferred stock reduced shareholder's equity by $28 million. Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income decreased shareholders' equity by $723 million, primarily due to the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on securities available for sale and derivative instruments as a result of changes in market interest rates during the three months ended March 31, 2021. The derivative instruments are hedges designed to protect net interest income in a low short-term interest rate environment, such as the one that currently exists. 

See Note 5 "Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income" section for additional information. 

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS 

Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies. These regulatory capital requirements involve quantitative measures of the Company's assets, liabilities and selected off-balance sheet items, and also qualitative judgments by the regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can subject the Company to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory actions. 

Under the Basel III Rules, Regions is designated as a standardized approach bank. Additional discussion of the Basel III Rules, their applicability to Regions, recent proposals and final rules issued by the federal banking agencies and recent laws enacted that impact regulatory requirements is included in the &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; subsection of the &#8220;Business&#8221; section in the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the "Regulatory Requirements" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis in the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional discussion is also included in Note 13 "Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions" to the consolidated financial statements in the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

In the third quarter of 2020, the federal banking agencies finalized a rule related to the impact of CECL on regulatory capital requirements. The rule allows an add-back to regulatory capital for the impacts of CECL for a two-year period. At the end of the two years, the impact is then phased-in over the following three years. The add-back is calculated as the impact of initial adoption, adjusted for 25 percent of subsequent changes in the allowance. At March 31, 2021, the impact of the addback on CET1 was approximately $528 million, or approximately 50 basis points. 

The following table summarizes the applicable holding company and bank regulatory requirements:

In October of 2020, the SCB framework that was finalized in the first quarter of 2020, was implemented. This new framework created a firm-specific risk sensitive buffer that is applied to regulatory minimum capital levels to help determine effective minimum ratio requirements. The SCB is now floored at 2.5 percent to ensure effective minimum capital levels do not decline as a result of this rule change. At implementation, the SCB replaced the current Capital Conservation Buffer, which was a static 2.5 percent in addition to the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios shown above. 

During the third quarter of 2020, and in connection with the results of its supervisory stress test released in June 2020, the Federal Reserve finalized Regions' SCB requirement for the fourth quarter of 2020 through the third quarter of 2021 at 3.0 percent. The 3.0 percent requirement represented the amount of capital degradation under the supervisory severely adverse scenario, inclusive of four quarters of planned common stock dividends. In December 2020, the Federal Reserve disclosed the results of its supervisory stress test associated with the capital plan resubmission. While the Federal Reserve did not recalibrate SCBs as a part of the resubmission for participating banks, Regions&#8217; implied SCB would have been floored at 2.5 percent based on capital degradation in the supervisory severely adverse scenario had the SCB been updated. The decision to update SCB requirements based on the resubmission results was initially deferred to March 31, 2021 and subsequently deferred again to June 30, 2021. As such, the Federal Reserve may decide at any point through June 30, 2021 to update Regions' and other firms' SCB requirement based on the results. Additionally, Regions chose to participate in 2021 CCAR in part to have the Federal Reserve re-evaluate Regions' SCB. The submission was made in April 2021 and the Company expects to receive the results by June 30, 2021, with an effective date October 1, 2021. 

The Federal Reserve approved its rule for tailoring enhanced prudential standards for bank holding companies with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The framework outlines tailored standards for matters related to capital and liquidity. Regions is a "Category IV" institution under these rules. 

LIQUIDITY 

Regions maintains a robust liquidity management framework designed to effectively manage liquidity risk in accordance with sound risk management principals and regulatory expectations. The framework establishes sustainable processes and tools to effectively identify, measure, mitigate, monitor, and report liquidity risks beginning with Regions&#8217; Liquidity Management Policy and the Liquidity Risk Appetite Statements approved by the Board. Processes within the liquidity management framework include, but are not limited to, liquidity risk governance, cash management, liquidity stress testing, liquidity risk limits, contingency funding plans, and collateral management. While the framework is designed to comply with liquidity regulations, the processes are further tailored to be commensurate with Regions&#8217; operating model and risk profile. 

See the "Liquidity" section for more information. Also, see the &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8212;Liquidity Regulation&#8221; subsection of the &#8220;Business&#8221; section, the "Risk Factors" section and the "Liquidity" section in the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

In general, ratings agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, probability of government support, and level and quality of earnings. Any downgrade in credit ratings by one or more ratings agencies may impact Regions in several ways, including, but not limited to, Regions&#8217; access to the capital markets or short-term funding, borrowing cost and capacity, collateral requirements, and acceptability of its 

Table of Conte nts 

letters of credit, thereby potentially adversely impacting Regions&#8217; financial condition and liquidity. See the &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section in the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. 

A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and the ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 

NON-GAAP MEASURES 

The table below presents computations of earnings and certain other financial measures, which exclude certain significant items that are included in the financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include &#8220;adjusted average balances of loans&#8221;, "adjusted ending balances of loans", "ACL to loans excluding PPP, net ratio", "adjusted net interest margin", &#8220;adjusted efficiency ratio&#8221;, &#8220;adjusted fee income ratio&#8221;, &#8220;return on average tangible common shareholders' equity&#8221; on a consolidated operations basis, and end of period &#8220;tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity&#8221;, and related ratios. Regions believes that expressing earnings and certain other financial measures excluding these significant items provides a meaningful basis for period-to-period comparisons, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the Company and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of Regions&#8217; business because management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations. Regions believes that presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as that applied by management. Management and the Board utilize these non-GAAP financial measures as follows: 

&#8226; Preparation of Regions&#8217; operating budgets 

&#8226; Monthly financial performance reporting 

&#8226; Monthly close-out reporting of consolidated results (management only) 

&#8226; Presentations to investors of Company performance 

&#8226; Metrics for incentive compensation 

Average total loans and ending total loans are presented excluding loan balances related to loans originated through the SBA's PPP program, the indirect-other consumer exit portfolio and the indirect-vehicles exit portfolio to arrive at adjusted average total loans (non-GAAP) and adjusted ending total loans (non-GAAP). Regions believes adjusting average and ending total loans provides a meaningful calculation of loan growth rates and presents them on the same basis as that applied by management. 

Ending total loans are presented excluding loan balances related to loans originated through the SBA's PPP program. Regions believes the related ACL to loans excluding PPP ratio provides meaningful information about credit loss allowance levels when the SBA's PPP loans, which are fully backed by the U.S. government, are excluded from total loans and the related credit loss is excluded from the total allowance for credit losses. 

Net interest margin is presented excluding the impact of SBA PPP loans and excess cash, defined as cash exceeding $750 million. Regions believes the adjusted net interest margin (non-GAAP) provides investors with meaningful additional information about Regions' performance when margin associated with the SBA's PPP loans and excess cash are excluded from net interest margin (GAAP). 

The adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP), which is a measure of productivity, is generally calculated as adjusted non-interest expense divided by adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. The adjusted fee income ratio (non-GAAP) is generally calculated as adjusted non-interest income divided by adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Management uses these ratios to monitor performance and believes these measures provide meaningful information to investors. Non-interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the adjusted efficiency ratio. Non-interest income (GAAP) is presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the adjusted fee income ratio. Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis and non-interest income are added together to arrive at total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Adjustments are made to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP), which is the denominator for the adjusted efficiency and adjusted fee income ratios. 

Tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity ratios have become a focus of some investors in analyzing the capital position of the Company absent the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Traditionally, the Federal Reserve and other banking regulatory bodies have assessed a bank&#8217;s capital adequacy based on Tier 1 capital, the calculation of which is codified in federal banking regulations. Analysts and banking regulators have assessed Regions&#8217; capital adequacy using the tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity measure. Because tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity is not formally defined by GAAP, this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure and other entities may calculate it differently than Regions&#8217; disclosed calculations. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess Regions&#8217; capital adequacy using tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity, Regions believes that it is useful to provide investors the ability to assess Regions&#8217; capital adequacy on this same basis. 

Table of Conte nts 

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. In particular, a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to shareholders. 

The following tables provide: 1) a reconciliation of average total loans (GAAP) to adjusted average total loans (non-GAAP), 2) a reconciliation of ending total loans (GAAP) to adjusted ending total loans (non-GAAP), 3) a reconciliation of ending total loans excluding PPP loans (non-GAAP), a reconciliation of ACL (GAAP) to ACL excluding PPP loans' ACL (non-GAAP), and a computation of ACL to ending loans excluding PPP loans (non-GAAP), 4) a reconciliation of net interest margin (GAAP) to adjusted net interest margin (non-GAAP), 5) a reconciliation of net income (GAAP) to net income available to common shareholders (GAAP), 6) a reconciliation of non-interest expense (GAAP) to adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), 7) a reconciliation of net interest income, taxable equivalent basis (GAAP) to adjusted net interest income, taxable equivalent basis (non-GAAP), 8) a reconciliation of non-interest income (GAAP) to adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP), 9) a computation of adjusted total revenue (non-GAAP), 10) a computation of the adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP), 11) a computation of the adjusted fee income ratio (non-GAAP), and 12) a reconciliation of average and ending shareholders&#8217; equity (GAAP) to average and ending tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity (non-GAAP) and calculations of related ratios (non-GAAP).

(1) Debt securities are included on an amortized cost basis with yield and net interest margin calculated accordingly. 

(2) Loans, net of unearned income include non-accrual loans for all periods presented. 

(3) Interest income includes net loan fees of $34 million and $2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

(4) Due to the impact of interest bearing deposits in other banks on the balance sheet in 2021, other earning assets and interest bearing deposits in other banks for prior periods have been revised to reflect the 2021 presentation. 

(5) Total deposit costs may be calculated by dividing total interest expense on deposits by the sum of interest-bearing deposits and non-interest-bearing deposits. The rates for total deposit costs equal 0.06% and 0.35% for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

(6) The computation of taxable-equivalent net interest income is based on the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% for both March 31, 2021 and 2020 adjusted for applicable state income taxes net of the related federal tax benefit. 

The increase in net interest income for the first quarter 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 was driven by declines in deposit costs, combined with decreases in outstanding borrowings and FHLB advances as a part of Regions' active cash management strategy. The decline in interest expense was partially offset by a decline in interest income on loans which was aided in the first quarter of 2021 by increases in loan balances and fee income attributable to PPP lending, the Company's April 

Table of Conte nts 

2020 acquisition of Ascentium Capital LLC, and increased production of residential first mortgage loans. Additionally, the Company's hedging strategy became active in the first quarter of 2020, with benefits expanding as more notional became active throughout 2020, which also contributed to the increase in net interest income. The hedges had a positive impact of approximately $102 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $9 million in the first quarter of 2020. 

The decline in net interest margin for the first quarter 2021, compared to the same period in 2020, was primarily driven by elevated liquidity as indicated by higher cash balances, increases in loan balances due to PPP lending and loan production at lower market interest rates. Additionally, net interest margin was negatively impacted by the repricing of fixed rate loan portfolios and the securities portfolio at lower market interest rates. Excluding the impact of PPP lending and excess cash, which Regions considers to be balances in excess of $750 million, adjusted net interest margin (non-GAAP) for the first quarter 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 declined modestly to 3.40%. See Table 19 "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations" for a reconciliation of adjusted net interest margin. 

MARKET RISK&#8212;INTEREST RATE RISK 

Regions&#8217; primary market risk is interest rate risk. This includes uncertainty with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as relative interest rate levels, which are impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the Company offers. To quantify this risk, Regions measures the change in its net interest income in various interest rate scenarios compared to a base case scenario. Net interest income sensitivity to market rate movements is a useful short-term indicator of Regions&#8217; interest rate risk. 

Sensitivity Measurement &#8212;Financial simulation models are Regions&#8217; primary tools used to measure interest rate exposure. Using a wide range of sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates. Models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of Regions&#8217; balance sheet. Assumptions are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve, and the changing composition of the balance sheet that results from both strategic plans and from customer behavior. Among the assumptions are expectations of balance sheet growth and composition, the pricing and maturity characteristics of existing business and the characteristics of future business. Interest rate-related risks are expressly considered, such as pricing spreads, the pricing of deposit accounts, prepayments and other option risks. Regions considers these factors, as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty surrounding their future behavior. 

The primary objective of asset/liability management at Regions is to coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to sustain reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest rate cycles. In computing interest rate sensitivity for measurement, Regions compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using &#8220;market forward rates.&#8221; The standard set of interest rate scenarios includes the traditional instantaneous parallel rate shifts of plus 100 and 200 basis points. Given low market rates by historical standards, the Company focuses on a falling rate shock scenario where all rates fall to levels consistent with historical minimums. In addition to parallel curve shifts, multiple curve steepening and flattening scenarios are contemplated. Regions includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements phased in over a six-month period that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate movements. 

Exposure to Interest Rate Movements &#8212;As of March 31, 2021, Regions was asset sensitive to both gradual and instantaneous parallel yield curve shifts as compared to the base case for the 12-month measurement horizon ending March 2022. 

The first quarter of 2021 continued the trend of strong growth in low-cost deposits and cash balances held with the Federal Reserve. Retention of these balance sheet liquidity inflows is uncertain and much of the recent deposit growth is expected to be more rate sensitive under a rising rate scenario. Therefore, additional sensitivity analysis focused on pandemic-related "surge" deposit pricing behavior and retention is outlined in Table 21. 

The estimated exposure associated with the rising and falling rate scenarios in the table below reflects the combined impacts of movements in short-term and long-term interest rates. Net interest income sensitivity to short-term rates is approximately neutral when excluding pandemic-related deposit increases. An increase or reduction in short-term interest rates (such as the Fed Funds rate, the rate of Interest on Excess Reserves and 1-month LIBOR) will drive the yield on assets and liabilities contractually tied to such rates higher or lower. Under that environment, it is expected that changes in funding costs and balance sheet hedging income will completely offset the change in asset yields. Importantly, the potential to retain "surge" deposits with lower than expected repricing behavior represents an opportunity for further net interest income growth. 

Net interest income remains exposed to longer yield curve tenors. While this was a headwind to net interest income during the pandemic, it also represents a tailwind to net interest income growth as the yield curve steepens. An increase in intermediate and long-term interest rates (such as intermediate to longer-term U.S. Treasuries, swap and mortgage rates) will drive yields higher on certain fixed rate, newly originated or renewed loans, increase prospective yields on certain investment portfolio purchases, and reduce amortization of premium expense on existing securities in the investment portfolio. The opposite is true in an environment where intermediate and long-term interest rates fall. 

Table of Conte nts 

The interest rate sensitivity analysis presented below in Table 21 is informed by a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding the progression of the balance sheet in both the baseline scenario as well as the scenarios of instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve. Though there are many assumptions which affect the estimates for net interest income, those pertaining to deposit pricing, deposit mix and overall balance sheet composition are particularly impactful. Given the uncertainties associated with the prolonged period of low interest rates and industry liquidity, management evaluates the impact to its sensitivity analysis of these key assumptions. Sensitivity calculations are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future results. 

The Company&#8217;s baseline balance sheet assumptions include management's best estimate for balance sheet growth in the coming 12 months. However, the behavior of pandemic-related "surge" deposits under a rising rate scenario is uncertain. Therefore, Table 21 includes two balance sheet scenarios to help inform a potential range of outcomes. The first is an opportunity scenario, and assumes that these deposits behave more like stable, legacy balances, which is consistent with historical disclosures. The second is a reduction scenario that assumes that these depositors will be more sensitive to rate, requiring a higher interest rate in order to hold their balances with the bank. For this scenario, "surge" deposits are assumed to be all balance growth on legacy accounts from February 2020 to March 2021, or roughly $27.5 billion. These deposits, including non-interest bearing, are attributed with a 75% repricing beta in rising rate scenarios. 

The behavior of deposit pricing in response to changes in interest rate levels is largely informed by analyses of prior rate cycles. In the base case scenario and falling rate scenarios in Table 21, interest-bearing deposit rates move into the single digits. The deposit beta model is dynamic across both interest rate level and time. Currently, the Scenario One gradual +100 basis point shock outlined in the table below includes an approximate 20% to 25% interest-bearing deposit beta for legacy deposits. Again, the "surge" deposit interest-bearing deposit beta is bookended in each scenario,assuming legacy betas and a 75% beta, respectively. Deposit pricing outperformance or underperformance of 5% in that scenario would increase or decrease net interest income by approximately $28 million, respectively. 

In rising rate scenarios only, management assumes that the mix of legacy deposits will change versus the base case as informed by analyses of prior rate cycles. Management assumes that in rising rate scenarios, some shift from non-interest bearing to interest-bearing products will occur. The magnitude of the shift is rate dependent and equates to approximately $3.0 billion over 12 months in the gradual +100 basis point scenario in Table 21. 

The table below summarizes Regions' positioning in various parallel yield curve shifts (i.e., including all yield curve tenors). The scenarios are inclusive of all interest rate hedging activities. More information regarding hedges is disclosed in Table 22 and its accompanying description. Importantly, outstanding receive-fixed cash flow hedges begin to mature in late 2022. While those maturities are outside of the 12-month horizon of the analysis outlined in Table 21, the hedge maturity profile will begin to add asset sensitivity at a time when markets currently expect the FOMC to begin to increase short-term interest rates. Regions expects to maintain a persistent amount of hedges through time to support a consistent, sustainable earnings profile and will adjust outstanding derivatives depending on changing market dynamics and the balance sheet mix.

Table of Conte nts 

(5) The -100 basis point (floored) scenario represents a 12-month average rate shock where all rates are floored at historical lows observed during the pandemic. 

Regions has established scenarios by which yield curve tenors will fall to a consistent level. The shock magnitude for each tenor, when compared to market forward rates, equated to the lesser of the shock scenario amount, or a rate equal to the historical all-time minimum. Further, the scenarios presented do not allow for negative rates. The falling rate scenarios in Table 21 above quantify the expected impact for both gradual and instantaneous shocks under this environment. 

Interest rate movements may also have an impact on the value of Regions&#8217; securities portfolio, which can directly impact the carrying value of shareholders&#8217; equity. Regions from time to time may hedge these price movements with derivatives (as discussed below). 

Derivatives &#8212;Regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of interest rate sensitivity. ALCO, which consists of members of Regions&#8217; senior management team, in its oversight role for the management of interest rate sensitivity, approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging strategies. Derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with customer derivatives, which include interest rate, credit and foreign exchange risks. The most common derivatives Regions employs are forward rate contracts, Eurodollar futures contracts, interest rate swaps, options on interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and forward sale commitments. 

Forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at a future date at a specified price or yield. A Eurodollar futures contract is a future on a Eurodollar deposit. Eurodollar futures contracts subject Regions to market risk associated with changes in interest rates. Because futures contracts are cash settled daily, there is minimal credit risk associated with Eurodollar futures. Interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically entered into to exchange fixed for variable (or vice versa) streams of interest payments. The notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a reference for the size of interest settlements. Interest rate options are contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a predetermined price and time. Forward sale commitments are contractual obligations to sell market instruments at a future date for an already agreed-upon price. Foreign currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency for another on a specified date and at a specified rate. These contracts are executed on behalf of the Company's customers and are used by customers to manage fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The Company is subject to the credit risk that another party will fail to perform. 

Regions has made use of interest rate swaps and floors in balance sheet hedging strategies to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-rate funding position to a variable-rate position and to effectively convert a portion of its variable-rate loan portfolios to fixed-rate. Regions also uses derivatives to economically manage interest rate and pricing risk associated with its mortgage origination business. In the period of time that elapses between the origination and sale of mortgage loans, changes in interest rates have the potential to cause a decline in the value of the loans in this held-for-sale portfolio. Futures contracts and forward sale commitments are used to protect the value of the loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in interest rates and pricing. 

The following table presents additional information about the hedging interest rate derivatives used by Regions to manage interest rate risk:

_________ 

(1) Variable rate indexes on swap and floor contracts reference a combination of short-term LIBOR benchmarks, primarily 1-month LIBOR. 

As of March 31, 2021, the entire $21.8 billion notional of the cash flow hedging relationships designated in Table 22 above were active. Total cash flow hedges have a current weighted average maturity of approximately 3.6 years. During the first quarter of 2021, Regions shortened a portion of its future hedge exposure to balance its future interest rate risk needs with the evolving macro-economic environment. Notional of $2.3 billion swaps maturing in August of 2023 were terminated and replaced shorter maturity swaps. An additional $2.25 billion swaps and floors were terminated and replaced with shorter maturity swaps. The net impact was a reduction of $2 billion of floors, mostly maturing in January 2025, and an addition of $2 

Table of Conte nts 

billion of swaps, mostly maturing in December 2022. Subsequent to March 31, 2021, through May 3, 2021, Regions terminated $1.750 billion of swaps maturing in 2025, which were replaced with shorter maturity swaps. 

Importantly, the gain on unwound hedges is deferred and amortized into net interest income over the life of the original hedge, creating no change in the expected net interest income profile under market forward interest rates. These changes and the resulting hedge maturity profile allow for an increasing asset sensitive balance sheet position at a time when the FOMC seems more likely to move short-term rates higher. 

The following table presents cash flow hedge notional amounts outstanding at each year-end period.

_________ 

(1) All cash flow hedges active within the 12-month measurement horizon are included in the income sensitivity levels as disclosed in Table 21. 

Regions manages the credit risk of these instruments in much the same way as it manages credit risk of the loan portfolios by establishing credit limits for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer transactions. For non-dealer transactions, the need for collateral is evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the financial strength of the counterparty. Credit risk is also reduced significantly by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements. When there is more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a legally enforceable master netting agreement in place, the exposure represents the net of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from and/or posted to that counterparty. All hedging interest rate swap derivatives traded by Regions are subject to mandatory clearing. The counterparty risk for cleared trades effectively moves from the executing broker to the clearinghouse allowing Regions to benefit from the risk mitigation controls in place at the respective clearinghouse. The &#8220;Credit Risk&#8221; section in Regions&#8217; Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 contains more information on the management of credit risk. 

Regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers. Interest rate swaps, interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most common derivatives sold to customers. Other derivative instruments with similar characteristics are used to hedge market risk and minimize volatility associated with this portfolio. Instruments used to service customers are held in the trading account, with changes in value recorded in the consolidated statements of income. 

The primary objective of Regions&#8217; hedging strategies is to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes, from an economic perspective, on net interest income and the net present value of its balance sheet. The overall effectiveness of these hedging strategies is subject to market conditions, the quality of Regions&#8217; execution, the accuracy of its valuation assumptions, counterparty credit risk and changes in interest rates. See Note 8 "Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities" to the consolidated financial statements for a tabular summary of Regions&#8217; quarter-end derivatives positions and further discussion. 

Regions accounts for residential MSRs at fair market value with any changes to fair value being recorded within mortgage income. Regions enters into derivative transactions to economically mitigate the impact of market value fluctuations related to residential MSRs. Derivative instruments entered into in the future could be materially different from the current risk profile of Regions&#8217; current portfolio. 

LIBOR TRANSITION 

On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced that LIBOR will not be available for use after December 31, 2021. Further, existing contracts referencing 1-week or 2-month USD LIBOR settings must be remediated no later than December 31. 2021. Existing contracts referencing all other USD LIBOR settings must be remediated no later than June 30, 2023. Regions holds instruments that may be impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR, including loans, investments, derivative products, floating-rate obligations, and other financial instruments that use LIBOR as a benchmark rate. However, Regions' LIBOR exposure is primarily in settings other than 1-week or 2-month USD LIBOR. The Company has established a LIBOR Transition Program, which includes dedicated leadership and staff, with all relevant business lines and support groups engaged. As part of this program, the Company continues to identify, assess, and monitor risks associated with the discontinuation of LIBOR. Steps to mitigate risks associated with the transition are being overseen by Regions&#8217; Executive LIBOR Steering Committee. Regions is 

Table of Conte nts 

following industry efforts to develop alternative reference rates and is operationally ready to offer new benchmarks as they are adopted by regulatory agencies and industry groups. 

Regions has taken proactive steps to facilitate the transition on behalf of customers, which include: 

&#8226; The adoption and ongoing implementation of fallback provisions that provide for the determination of replacement rates for LIBOR-linked financial products. 

&#8226; The adoption of new products linked to alternative reference rates, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, consistent with guidance provided by the US regulators, ARRC, and GSEs. 

Regions continues to evaluate its financial and operational infrastructure in its effort to transition all financial and strategic processes, systems, and models to reference rates other than LIBOR. Regions has also implemented processes to educate all client-facing associates and coordinate communications with customers regarding the transition. 

As of March 31, 2021, Regions had approximately $33.3 billion of total outstanding commercial and investor real estate loans and $1.2 billion of total consumer loans that reference LIBOR. Regions also has securities within its investment portfolio of $475 million that reference LIBOR. Furthermore, Regions' Series B and C preferred stock reference LIBOR when their dividend rate begins to float after 2023 and had total carrying values of $433 million and $490 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2021. 

In the third quarter of 2020, Regions adopted temporary accounting relief for affected transactions that reference LIBOR. See Note 1 &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; in Regions&#8217; Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for details. 

LIQUIDITY 

Liquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of Regions and affects Regions&#8217; ability to meet the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of its customers. Regions&#8217; goal in liquidity management is to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, while at the same time meeting the Company&#8217;s cash flow needs in normal and stressed conditions. As discussed below, Regions has a variety of liquidity sources, which it may utilize to fund customer needs. Having and using various sources of liquidity to satisfy the Company&#8217;s funding requirements is important. 

Regions intends to fund its obligations primarily through cash generated from normal operations. Assets, consisting principally of loans and securities, are funded by customer deposits, borrowed funds and shareholders&#8217; equity. Regions also has obligations related to potential litigation contingencies. See Note 11 "Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees" to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the Company&#8217;s funding requirements. 

The securities portfolio is one of Regions&#8217; primary sources of liquidity. Proceeds from maturities and principal and interest payments of securities provide a continual flow of funds available for cash needs (see Note 2 "Debt Securities"to the consolidated financial statements). The agency guaranteed mortgage-backed securities portfolio is another source of liquidity in various secured borrowing capacities. 

Maturities in the loan portfolio also provide a steady flow of funds. Regions&#8217; liquidity is further enhanced by its relatively stable customer deposit base. Liquidity needs can also be met by borrowing funds in state and national money markets, although Regions does not assume reliance on short-term unsecured sources of funding. 

The balance with the FRB is the primary component of the balance sheet line item, &#8220;interest-bearing deposits in other banks.&#8221; At March 31, 2021, Regions had approximately $23.0 billion in cash on deposit with the FRB, an increase from approximately $16.4 billion at December 31, 2020, which has continued to be impacted by deposits associated with government programs offered in relation to COVID-19. Refer to the "Cash and Cash Equivalents" section for more information. 

Regions&#8217; borrowing availability with the FRB as of March 31, 2021, based on assets pledged as collateral on that date, was $13.3 billion. 

Regions&#8217; financing arrangement with the FHLB adds additional flexibility in managing the Company's liquidity position. As of March 31, 2021, Regions had no FHLB borrowings and its total borrowing capacity from the FHLB totaled approximately $15.4 billion. FHLB borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral pledged to the FHLB. Regions Bank pledges certain securities and loans as collateral, which comprise its FHLB borrowing capacity. Additionally, investment in FHLB stock is required based on membership and in relation to the level of outstanding borrowings. The FHLB has been and is expected to continue to be a reliable and economical source of funding. 

Regions maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC that can be utilized by Regions to issue various debt and/or equity securities. Additionally, Regions' Board has authorized Regions Bank to issue up to $10 billion in aggregate principal amount of bank notes outstanding at any one time.

Regions may, from time to time, consider opportunistically retiring outstanding issued securities, including subordinated debt in privately negotiated or open market transactions for cash or common shares. Regulatory approval would be required for retirement of some instruments. 

Regions performs specific procedures, including scenario analyses and stress testing to maintain appropriate levels of available liquidity and to provide for liquidity risks. Regions' liquidity policy requires the holding company to maintain cash sufficient to cover the greater of (1) 18 months of debt service and other cash needs or (2) a minimum cash balance of $500 million. Cash and cash equivalents at the holding company totaled $1.3 billion at March 31, 2021. Overall liquidity risk limits are established by the Board through its Risk Appetite Statement and Liquidity Policy. The Company's Board, LROC and ALCO regularly review compliance with the established limits. 

On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law as a response to the economic uncertainty amid the COVID-19 pandemic. A focus of the Act is the establishment of federally guaranteed loans for small businesses under the PPP. Regions, a certified SBA lender, has and will continue to assist its customers through the process of utilizing this program. As a lending institution in this program, additional liquidity is available to the Company through the Federal Reserve's Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility. As of March 31, 2021, Regions has not used the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility. 

CREDIT RISK 

Regions&#8217; objective regarding credit risk is to maintain a credit portfolio that provides for stable credit costs with acceptable volatility through an economic cycle. Regions has various processes to manage credit risk as described below. In order to assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio, Regions considers risk factors within the loan portfolio segments and classes, the current U.S. economic environment and that of its primary banking markets, as well as counterparty risk. See the &#8220;Portfolio Characteristics&#8221; section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for a discussion of risk characteristics of each loan type. 

INFORMATION SECURITY RISK 

Regions faces information security risks, such as evolving and adaptive cyber attacks that are conducted regularly against Regions and other large financial institutions to compromise or disable information systems, which have increased in recent years. This trend is expected to continue for a number of reasons, including increases in technology-based products and services used by us and our customers, the growing use of mobile, cloud, and other emerging technologies, and the increasing sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external parties or fraud on the part of employees. 

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Regions has experienced a modest increase in cyber events, such as phishing attacks and malicious traffic from outside the United States. However, the Company's layered control environment has effectively detected and prevented any material impact related to these events. 

Even if Regions successfully prevents cyber attacks to its own network, the Company may still incur losses that result from customers' account information being obtained through breaches of retailers' networks where customers have transacted business. The fraud losses, as well as the costs of investigations and re-issuing new customer cards, may impact Regions' financial results. In addition, Regions also relies on some vendors to provide certain components of its business infrastructure, and although Regions actively assesses and monitors the information security capabilities of these vendors, Regions' reliance on them may also increase exposure to information security risk. 

In the event of a cyber attack or other data breach, Regions may be required to incur significant expenses, including with respect to remediation costs, costs of implementing additional preventative measures, addressing any reputational harm and addressing any related regulatory inquiries or civil litigation arising from the event. Refer to the "Information Security Risk" section in Management's Discussion and Analysis included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for further discussion of Regions' information security risk. 

PROVISION FOR (BENEFIT FROM) CREDIT LOSSES 

The provision for (benefit from) credit losses is used to maintain the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit losses at a level that in management&#8217;s judgment is appropriate to absorb expected credit losses over the contractual life of the loan and credit commitment portfolio at the balance sheet date. The benefit from credit losses totaled $142 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to a provision for credit losses of $373 million during the first quarter of 2020. Refer to the "Allowance" section for further detail.

Service charges on deposit accounts&#8212; Service charges on deposit accounts include non-sufficient fund and overdraft fees, corporate analysis service charges, overdraft protection fees and other customer transaction-related service charges. The decrease during the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period of 2020 was the result of lower consumer spending. The impact of COVID-19 hit late in the first quarter of 2020; and as such, part of the quarter was free from impact. Overall customer spending behaviors have changed, which combined with enhancements to overdraft practices and transaction posting procedures, are expected to keep service charges ten to fifteen percent below pre-pandemic levels. See the "First Quarter Overview" section for further detail. 

Card and ATM fees&#8212; Card and ATM fees include the combined amounts of credit card/bank card income and debit card and ATM related revenue. In the first quarter of 2021 , card and ATM fees had recovered to pre-pandemic levels, primarily driven by debit card spending and transaction volumes. Although discretionary spend is recovering, credit card spend remains slightly behind prior year levels. 

Mortgage income&#8212; Mortgage income is generated through the origination and servicing of residential mortgage loans for long-term investors and sales of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. The increase in mortgage income in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period of 2020 was due to increased loan production and sales income as lower interest rates drove higher loan application volume. 

Capital markets income&#8212; Capital markets income primarily relates to capital raising activities that include securities underwriting and placement, loan syndication, as well as foreign exchange, derivatives, merger and acquisition and other advisory services. The increase in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period of 2020 was primarily driven by increases in positive market-related credit valuation adjustments tied to credit derivatives within commercial swap income, fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate, securities underwriting and placement fees, and M&#38;A advisory services. 

Securities gains (losses), net&#8212; Net securities gains (losses) primarily result from the Company's asset/liability management process. See Table 1 "Debt Securities" section for additional information. 

Market value adjustments on employee benefit assets&#8212; Market value adjustments on employee benefit assets are the reflection of market value variations related to assets held for certain employee benefits. The adjustment reported as employee benefit assets - other is offset in salaries and benefits. Changes in market valuation adjustments in 2021 compared to 2020 were driven by the overall performance of the equity markets. 

Other miscellaneous income &#8212;Other miscellaneous income includes net revenue from affordable housing, valuation adjustments to equity investments (other than the item shown separately above), fees from safe deposit boxes, check fees and other miscellaneous income. Net revenue from affordable housing includes actual gains and losses resulting from the sale of 

Table of Conte nts 

affordable housing investments, cash distributions from the investments and any related impairment charges. Other miscellaneous income increased in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020 due to increases in commercial loan related fee income and SBIC income.

Salaries and employee benefits&#8212; Salaries and employee benefits consist of salaries, incentive compensation, long-term incentives, payroll taxes, and other employee benefits such as 401(k), pension, and medical, life and disability insurance, as well as, expenses from liabilities held for employee benefit purposes. Salaries and employee benefits increased during the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020, driven primarily by higher 401(k) expenses as a result of positive market valuation adjustments on employee benefit assets and higher production-based incentives. Offsetting these increases, full-time equivalent headcount decreased to 18,926 at March 31, 2021 from 19,743 at March 31, 2020, reflecting the continuing impact of the Company's efficiency initiatives implemented as part of its strategic priorities which offset the addition of 401 associates from the April 2020 equipment finance acquisition. 

Equipment and software expense&#8212; Equipment and software expense includes depreciation, maintenance and repairs, rent, taxes, and other expenses of equipment and software (software is rented and internally developed) utilized by Regions and its affiliates. Equipment and software expense increased during the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, driven primarily by software rental expense and depreciation. 

Outside services&#8212; Outside services consists of expenses related to routine services provided by third parties, such as contract labor, servicing costs, data processing, loan pricing and research, data license purchases, data subscriptions, and check printing. Outside services decreased during the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 due primarily to Regions exiting a third party lending relationship. 

Professional, legal and regulatory expenses&#8212; Professional, legal and regulatory expenses consist of amounts related to legal, consulting, other professional fees and regulatory charges. Professional, legal and regulatory expenses increased primarily due to elevated legal and consulting costs. 

Branch consolidation, property and equipment charges&#8212; Branch consolidation, property and equipment charges include valuation adjustments related to owned branches when the decision to close them is made. Accelerated depreciation and lease write-off charges are recorded for leased branches through and at the actual branch close date. Branch consolidation, property and equipment charges also include costs related to occupancy optimization initiatives. 

Other miscellaneous expenses&#8212; Other miscellaneous expenses include expenses related to communications, postage, supplies, certain credit-related costs, foreclosed property expenses, mortgage repurchase costs, operational losses and other costs (benefits) related to employee benefit plans. Other miscellaneous expenses increased during the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to increases in digital banking expenses, operational losses, and other 

Table of Conte nts 

miscellaneous expenses. Offsetting these increases were lower expenses associated with limited travel as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

INCOME TAXES 

The Company&#8217;s income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $180 million compared to $42 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, resulting in effective tax rates of 21.9 percent and 20.6 percent, respectively. The Company expects the full-year tax rate to be approximately 22 percent for 2021. 

The effective tax rate is affected by many factors including, but not limited to, the level of pre-tax income, the mix of income between various tax jurisdictions with differing tax rates, enacted tax legislation, net tax benefits related to affordable housing investments, bank-owned life insurance, tax-exempt interest and nondeductible expenses. In addition, the effective tax rate is affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period-to-period, such as the termination of certain leveraged leases, share-based payments, valuation allowance changes and changes to unrecognized tax benefits. Accordingly, the comparability of the effective tax rate between periods may be impacted. 

At March 31, 2021, the Company reported a net deferred tax liability of $344 million compared to a net deferred tax liability of $505 million at December 31, 2020 . The decrease in the net deferred tax liability was primarily due to the decrease in unrealized gains on available for sale securities and derivative instruments. 

ASCENTIUM ACQUISITION 

On April 1, 2020, Regions completed its acquisition of an equipment finance company Ascentium Capital, LLC. The acquisition gives Regions the ability to increase business loans and leases to small business customers using Ascentium's tech-enabled same-day credit decision and funding capabilities. 

As a result of the acquisition Regions recorded approximately $2.4 billion of assets and assumed $1.9 billion of liabilities. Of the total assets acquired, $1.9 billion were loans and leases that are included in Regions' commercial and industrial loan portfolio. Of the liabilities assumed, $1.8 billion were long-term borrowings. Regions subsequently paid down a significant portion of the borrowings, and as of March 31, 2021, $81 million of long-term debt remained. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated fair value. 

Of the loans acquired, a portion were determined to be credit deteriorated on the date of purchase. Purchased loans that have experienced a more than insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination are considered to be credit deteriorated. PCD loans are initially recorded at purchase price less the ALLL recognized at acquisition. Subsequent credit loss activity is recorded within the provision for credit losses. 

Regions recorded PCD loans of $873 million as a result of the acquisition, which was reflective of a nominal discount. Regions recorded an ALLL related to these loans of $60 million, which was included in the total acquired asset value as part of the acquisition. 

The non-credit discount related to Ascentium's PCD loans and the fair value mark on non-PCD loans will be amortized to interest income over the contractual life of the loan using the effective interest method. The amortization will not be material. 

In conjunction with the acquisition, Regions initially recognized goodwill of $348 million and other intangible assets of $47 million. Purchase accounting adjustments of $16 million reduced goodwill during the measurement period. Intangible assets are comprised of trademarks, customer lists and other intangibles. Intangible assets will be amortized over the expected useful life of each recognized asset.
