 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 

Management believes the following sections provide an overview of several of the most relevant matters necessary for an understanding of the financial aspects of Regions Financial Corporation&#8217;s (&#8220;Regions&#8221; or &#8220;the Company&#8221;) business, particularly regarding its 2019 results. Cross references to more detailed information regarding each topic within MD&#38;A and the consolidated financial statements are included. This summary is intended to assist in understanding the information provided, but should be read in conjunction with the entire MD&#38;A and consolidated financial statements, as well as the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

2019 Results 

Regions reported net income from continuing operations available to common shareholders of $1.5 billion , or $1.50 per diluted share, in 2019 compared to net income available to common shareholders from continuing operations of $1.5 billion , or $1.36 per diluted share, in 2018 . 

Net interest income and other financing income (taxable-equivalent basis) totaled $3.8 billion in both 2019 and 2018 . The net interest margin (taxable-equivalent basis) was 3.45 percent in 2019 , reflecting a 3 basis point decrease from 2018 . Net interest margin was negatively impacted by the remixing of lower yielding deposit products to higher yielding deposit products and debt instruments, as well as higher average loan balances. These factors were partially offset by the benefits from securities repositioning and favorable loan remixing. 

The provision for loan losses totaled $387 million in 2019 compared to $229 million in 2018 . The provision was higher than net charge-offs by $29 million in 2019. The increase in the provision for loan losses was driven primarily by higher average loan balances, higher net charge-offs, and an increase in classified loans. Refer to the "Allowance for Credit Losses" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis for further detail. 

Non-interest income from continuing operations was $ 2.1 billion in 2019 and compared to $ 2.0 billion in 2018 . The increase was primarily driven by increases in service charges on deposit accounts, card and ATM fees, mortgage income, and other miscellaneous income. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in capital markets income and losses on sales of securities during 2019. See Table 5 "Non-Interest Income from Continuing Operations" for further details. 

Non-interest expense from continuing operations was $ 3.5 billion in 2019 and $ 3.6 billion in 2018 . The decrease was driven primarily by lower salaries and employee benefits, occupancy expense, professional, legal and regulatory expenses, as well as a reduction in FDIC insurance assessments. These decreases were partially offset by increases in branch consolidation charges and expenses related to the early extinguishment of debt. See Table 6 "Non-Interest Expense from Continuing Operations" for further details. 

Regions' effective tax rate was 20.3 percent in 2019 compared to 19.8 percent in 2018.

Capital Actions 

While Regions was not required to participate in the 2019 CCAR, Regions did submit its planned capital actions to the Federal Reserve which included increasing its quarterly common stock dividend from $0.14 per share to $0.155 per share beginning in the third quarter of 2019 and the execution of up to $1.370 billion in common share repurchases. The 2019 capital plan covers the period from the third quarter of 2019 through the second quarter of 2020. As of December 31, 2019 , Regions had repurchased approximately 47.5 million shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately $721.5 million under this plan.

Regulatory Capital 

Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies. Under the Basel III Rules, Regions is designated as a standardized approach bank. The Basel III Rules maintained the minimum guidelines for Regions to be considered well-capitalized for Tier 1 capital and Total capital at 6.0% and 10.0%, respectively. At December 31, 2019 , Regions&#8217; Basel III Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios were estimated to be 10.91% and 12.68% , respectively. 

The Basel III Rules also officially defined CET1. Regions' Basel III CET1 ratio at December 31, 2019 was estimated to be 9.68 %.

##TABLE_END Loan Portfolio and Credit 

During 2019, total loans decreased by $189 million or 0.2 percent compared to 2018 . The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in the indirect vehicles portfolio of $1.2 billion, which reflects Regions' decision in January 2019 to discontinue its indirect auto lending business. Additionally, the home equity portfolio declined compared to 2018 due to continued payoffs and paydowns in excess of current year originations. These declines were partially offset by increases in the commercial and industrial and indirect-other consumer loan portfolios. 

The economy has been and will continue to be the primary factor which influences Regions&#8217; loan portfolio. In 2019, economic growth trends declined modestly compared to 2018, which resulted in lower market interest rates and muted loan growth during the year. However, labor market and housing market conditions were healthy over the course of 2019. Overall, economic growth is expected to continue to be moderate in 2020. Management&#8217;s expectation for 2020 adjusted average loan growth is in the low single digits consistent with the GDP forecast. Refer to the "Economic Environment in Regions' Banking Markets" section of MD&#38;A for further discussion. 

Net charge-offs totaled $358 million, or 0.43 percent of average loans, in 2019 , compared to $323 million, or 0.40 percent in 2018 , reflecting increased charge-offs in the commercial and industrial and indirect-other consumer loan portfolios. The allowance for loan losses was 1.05 percent of total loans, net of unearned income at December 31, 2019 , an increase from 1.01 percent at December 31, 2018 . The coverage ratio of allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans was 171 percent at December 31, 2019 , compared to 169 percent at December 31, 2018 .

##TABLE_END Liquidity 

At the end of 2019 , Regions Bank had $2.5 billion in cash on deposit with the Federal Reserve and the loan-to-deposit ratio was 85 percent. Cash and cash equivalents at the parent company totaled $ 1.9 billion. Regions' liquidity policy related to minimum holding company cash requires the holding company to maintain cash sufficient to cover the greater of (1) 18 months of debt service and other cash needs or (2) a minimum cash balance of $500 million. 

At December 31, 2019 , the Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve was $16.9 billion based on available collateral. Borrowing availability with the FHLB was $17.5 billion based on available collateral at the same date. Debt securities of approximately $8.3 billion were pledged as of December 31, 2019, leaving approximately $14.2 billion of unencumbered liquid securities available for pledging. Regions also maintains a shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that can be utilized by the Company to issue various debt and/or equity securities. Additionally, Regions' Board has authorized Regions Bank to issue up to $10 billion in aggregate principal amount of bank notes outstanding at any one time. 

Regions is required to conduct liquidity stress testing and measure its available sources of liquidity against minimums as established through stress testing. Regions was fully compliant with those requirements as of year-end.

GENERAL 

The following discussion and financial information is presented to aid in understanding Regions&#8217; financial position and results of operations. The emphasis of this discussion will be on continuing operations for the years 2019 and 2018 ; in addition, financial information for prior years will also be presented when appropriate. 

Regions&#8217; profitability, like that of many other financial institutions, is dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income and other financing income as well as non-interest income sources. Net interest income and other financing income is primarily the difference between the interest income Regions receives on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest expense Regions pays on interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Regions&#8217; net interest income and other financing income is impacted by the size and mix of its balance sheet components and the interest rate spread between interest earned on its assets and interest paid on its liabilities. Net interest income and other financing income also includes rental income and depreciation expense associated with operating leases for which Regions is the lessor. Non-interest income includes fees from service charges on deposit accounts, card and ATM fees, mortgage servicing and secondary marketing, investment management and trust activities, capital markets and other customer services which Regions provides. Results of operations are also affected by the provision for loan losses and non-interest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, professional, legal and regulatory expenses, FDIC insurance assessments, and other operating expenses, as well as income taxes. 

Economic conditions, competition, new legislation and related rules impacting regulation of the financial services industry and the monetary and fiscal policies of the Federal government significantly affect most, if not all, financial institutions, including Regions. Lending and deposit activities and fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and investment, consumer income, consumer spending and savings, capital market activities, and competition among financial institutions, as well as customer preferences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing products in Regions&#8217; market areas. 

Regions&#8217; business strategy is focused on providing a competitive mix of products and services, delivering quality customer service, and continuing to develop and optimize distribution channels that include a branch distribution network with offices in convenient locations, as well as electronic and mobile banking. 

Recent Acquisitions 

On May 31, 2019, Regions entered into an agreement to acquire Highland Associates, Inc., an institutional investment firm based in Birmingham, Alabama. The transaction closed on August 1, 2019. 

Dispositions 

On April 4, 2018, Regions entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell Regions Insurance Group, Inc. and related affiliates to BB&#38;T Insurance Holdings, Inc. (now Truist Insurance Holdings, Inc). The transaction closed on July 2, 2018. The gain associated with the transaction amounted to $281 million ($196 million after-tax). 

On January 11, 2012, Regions entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell Morgan Keegan and related affiliates to Raymond James. The sale closed on April 2, 2012. Regions Investment Management, Inc. and Regions Trust were not included in the sale; they are included in the Wealth Management segment. 

Results of operations for the entities sold are presented separately as discontinued operations for all periods presented on the consolidated statements of income. Other expenses related to the transaction are also included in discontinued operations. Refer to Note 3 "Discontinued Operations" and Note 24 "Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees" to the consolidated financial statements for further details. 

Business Segments 

Regions provides traditional commercial, retail and mortgage banking services, as well as other financial services in the fields of asset management, wealth management, securities brokerage, and other specialty financing. Regions carries out its strategies and derives its profitability from three reportable segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management, with the remainder split between Discontinued Operations and Other. 

See Note 23 "Business Segment Information" to the consolidated financial statements for further information on Regions&#8217; business segments.

________ 

(1) Due to the immaterial impact of the discontinued operations, the balance sheet has not been presented on a continuing operations basis. 

(2) See Table 2 for GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 

(3) Current year Basel III common equity Tier 1, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, and Leverage capital ratios are estimated. 

NON-GAAP MEASURES 

The table below presents computations of earnings and certain other financial measures, which exclude certain significant items that are included in the financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include &#8220;adjusted average total loans&#8221;, &#8220;adjusted net interest margin&#8221;, &#8220;adjusted efficiency ratio&#8221;, &#8220;adjusted fee income ratio&#8221;, &#8220;return on average tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity&#8221; on a consolidated and continuing operations basis, and end of period &#8220;tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity&#8221;, and related ratios. Regions believes that expressing earnings and certain other financial measures excluding these significant items provides a meaningful base for period-to-period comparisons, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the Company and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of Regions&#8217; business because management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations. Regions believes that presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as that applied by management. Management and the Board utilize these non-GAAP financial measures as follows: 

&#8226; Preparation of Regions&#8217; operating budgets 

&#8226; Monthly financial performance reporting 

&#8226; Monthly close-out reporting of consolidated results (management only) 

&#8226; Presentations to investors of Company performance 

Total average loans is presented (1) including the impact of the fourth quarter of 2018 reclassification of purchase cards to commercial and industrial loans from others assets, (2) excluding the impact of the first quarter 2018 residential first mortgage loan sale, and (3) excluding the indirect vehicles exit portfolio to arrive at adjusted average total loans (non-GAAP). Regions believes adjusting average total loans provides a meaningful calculation of loan growth rates and presents them on the same basis as that applied by management. 

The adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP), which is a measure of productivity, is generally calculated as adjusted non-interest expense divided by adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. The adjusted fee income ratio (non-GAAP) is generally calculated as adjusted non-interest income divided by adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Management uses these ratios to monitor performance and believes these measures provide meaningful information to investors. Non-interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the adjusted efficiency ratio. Non-interest income (GAAP) is presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the adjusted fee income ratio. Net interest income and other financing income on a taxable-equivalent basis (GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments related to Tax Reform to arrive at adjusted net interest income and other financing income on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP). Net interest income and other financing income on a taxable-equivalent basis and non-interest income are added together to arrive at total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Adjustments are made to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP), which is the denominator for the adjusted efficiency and adjusted fee income ratios. 

Tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity ratios have become a focus of some investors in analyzing the capital position of the Company absent the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Traditionally, the Federal Reserve and other banking regulatory bodies have assessed a bank&#8217;s capital adequacy based on Tier 1 capital, the calculation of which is codified in federal banking regulations. Analysts and banking regulators have assessed Regions&#8217; capital adequacy using the tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity measure. Because tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity is not formally defined by GAAP, this measure is considered to be 

a non-GAAP financial measure and other entities may calculate it differently than Regions&#8217; disclosed calculations. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess Regions&#8217; capital adequacy using tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity, Regions believes that it is useful to provide investors the ability to assess Regions&#8217; capital adequacy on this same basis. 

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. In particular, a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to stockholders. 

The following tables provide: 1) a reconciliation of average total loans to adjusted average total loans (non-GAAP), 2) a reconciliation of net income (GAAP) to net income available to common shareholders (GAAP), 3) a reconciliation of net income available to common shareholders (GAAP) to net income available to common shareholders from continuing operations (GAAP) 4) a reconciliation of non-interest expense from continuing operations (GAAP) to adjusted non-interest expense from continuing operations (non-GAAP), 5) a reconciliation of net interest income and other financing income/margin, taxable equivalent basis (GAAP) to adjusted net interest income and other financing income/margin, taxable equivalent basis (non-GAAP), 6) a reconciliation of non-interest income from continuing operations (GAAP) to adjusted non-interest income from continuing operations (non-GAAP), 7) a computation of adjusted total revenue (non-GAAP), 8) a computation of the adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP), 9) a computation of the adjusted fee income ratio (non-GAAP), and 10) a reconciliation of average and ending stockholders&#8217; equity (GAAP) to average and ending tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity (non-GAAP) and calculations of related ratios (non-GAAP).

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND RELATED POLICIES 

In preparing financial information, management is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses for the periods shown. The accounting principles followed by Regions and the methods of applying these principles conform with GAAP, regulatory guidances, where applicable, and general banking practices. Estimates and assumptions most significant to Regions are related primarily to the allowance for credit losses, fair value measurements, intangible assets (goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets), residential MSRs and income taxes, and are summarized in the following discussion and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses (&#8220;allowance&#8221;) consists of two components: the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. Unfunded credit commitments include items such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and binding unfunded loan commitments. The allowance represents management&#8217;s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan and credit commitment portfolios as of period end. Regions determines its allowance in accordance with GAAP and applicable regulatory guidance. 

For non-accrual commercial and investor real estate loans equal to or greater than $2.5 million, the allowance for loan losses is based on note-level evaluation considering the facts and circumstances specific to each borrower. For all other commercial and investor real estate loans, the allowance for loan losses is based on statistical models using a PD and an LGD. Historical default information for similar loans is used as an input for the statistical model. 

For residential first mortgages, home equity lending and other consumer-related loans, individual products are reviewed on a group basis (e.g., residential first mortgage pools). Historical loss information for similar loans is used as an input for the models. 

Factors considered by management in determining the adequacy of the allowance include, but are not limited to: 1) detailed reviews of individual loans; 2) historical and current trends in gross and net loan charge-offs for the various classes of loans evaluated; 3) the Company&#8217;s policies relating to delinquent loans and charge-offs; 4) the level of the allowance in relation to total loans and to historical loss levels; 5) levels and trends in non-performing, criticized, classified and past due loans; 6) collateral values of properties securing loans; 7) the composition of the loan portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments; 8) management&#8217;s analysis of current economic conditions; and 9) migration of loans between risk rating categories. 

In support of collateral values, Regions obtains updated valuations for large commercial and investor real estate non-performing loans on at least an annual basis. For loans that are individually identified for impairment, those valuations are currently discounted as appropriate from the most recent appraisal to consider continued declines in values. The discounted valuations are utilized in the measurement of the level of impairment in the allowance calculation. For loans that are not individually identified for impairment and secured by collateral, Regions considers the impact of declines in valuations in the loss given default estimates within the allowance calculation. 

The allowance is sensitive to a variety of internal factors, such as modifications in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding, portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings. As a matter of business practice, Regions may require some form of credit support, such as a guarantee. Guarantees are legally binding and entered into simultaneously with the primary loan agreements. Evaluation of guarantors&#8217; ability and willingness to pay is considered as part of the risk rating process, which provides the basis for the allowance for loan losses for the commercial and investor real estate portfolios. In concluding that the risk rating is appropriate, Regions considers a number of factors including whether underlying cash flow is adequate to service the debt, payment history, and whether there is appropriate guarantor support. 

The allowance is also sensitive to a variety of external factors, such as the general health of the economy, as evidenced by volatility in commodity prices, changes in real estate demand and values, interest rates, unemployment rates, bankruptcy filings, fluctuations in the GDP, and the effects of weather and natural disasters such as droughts, floods and hurricanes. 

Management considers these variables and all other available information when establishing the final level of the allowance. These variables and others have the ability to result in actual loan losses that differ from the originally estimated amounts. 

Management considers the current level of the allowance appropriate to absorb losses inherent in the loan and credit commitment portfolios. Management&#8217;s determination of the appropriateness of the allowance requires the use of judgments and estimations that may change in the future. Changes in the factors used by management to determine the appropriateness of the allowance or the availability of new information could cause the allowance to be increased or decreased in future periods. In addition, bank regulatory agencies, as part of their examination process, may require changes in the level of the allowance based on their judgments and estimates. Volatility in certain credit metrics is to be expected. Additionally, changes in circumstances related to individually large credits or certain portfolios may result in volatility. 

Management&#8217;s estimate of the allowance for the commercial and investor real estate portfolio segments could be affected by estimates of losses inherent in various product types as a result of fluctuations in the internal and external factors mentioned above. For pooled commercial and investor real estate accounts, a 5 percent increase in the PD for non-defaulted accounts and a 5 percent increase in the LGD for all accounts would result in an increase to estimated inherent losses of approximately $39 million. 

Losses on residential real estate mortgages, home equity lending and other consumer-related loans can be affected by such factors as collateral value, loss severity, and other internal and external factors mentioned above. A 5 percent increase or decrease in the estimated loss rates on these loans would change estimated inherent losses by approximately $13 million. 

These pro forma analyses demonstrate the sensitivity of the allowance to key assumptions; however, they do not reflect an expected outcome. 

For further discussion of the allowance for credit losses, see Note 1 &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; and Note 6 "Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements. 

Fair Value Measurements 

A portion of the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities is carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded either in earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). These include debt securities available for sale, mortgage loans held for sale, equity investments (with and without readily determinable market values), residential MSRs and derivative assets and liabilities. From time to time, the estimation of fair value also affects other loans held for sale, which are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Fair value determination is also relevant for certain other assets such as foreclosed property and other real estate, which are recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan/property or fair value, less estimated costs to sell the property. For example, the fair value of other real estate is determined based on recent appraisals by third parties and other market information, less estimated selling costs. Adjustments to the appraised value are made if management becomes aware of changes in the fair value of specific properties or property types. The determination of fair value also impacts certain other assets that are periodically evaluated for impairment using fair value estimates, including goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. 

Fair value is generally defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) as opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability (an entry price), in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. While management uses judgment when determining the price at which willing market participants would transact when there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for the asset or liability in relation to &#8220;normal&#8221; market activity, management&#8217;s objective is to determine the point within the range of fair value estimates that is most representative of a sale to a third-party investor under current market conditions. The value to the Company if the asset or liability were held to maturity is not included in the fair value estimates. 

A fair value measure should reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including the assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset and the risk of nonperformance. Fair value is measured based on a variety of inputs the Company utilizes. Fair value may be based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets (Level 1 valuations). If market prices are not available, quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market are used (Level 2 valuations). Where observable market data is not available, the valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market, but observable based on Company-specific data (Level 3 valuations). These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company&#8217;s own estimates for assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques typically include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques, but may also include the use of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or liability. 

See Note 1 &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of determining fair value, including pricing validation processes. 

Intangible Assets 

Regions&#8217; intangible assets consist primarily of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses (&#8220;goodwill&#8221;) and other identifiable intangible assets (primarily core deposit intangibles and purchased credit card relationships). Goodwill totaled $4.8 billion at both December 31, 2019 and 2018 . Goodwill is allocated to each of Regions&#8217; reportable segments (each a reporting unit: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management). Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1 or more often if events and circumstances indicate impairment may exist (refer to Note 1 &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion). 

Accounting guidance permits the Company to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. If, based on the weight of the evidence, the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value exceeds book value, then an impairment test is not necessary. If the Company elects to bypass the qualitative assessment, or concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, a two-step goodwill impairment test is performed. In Step One, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount, including goodwill. To the extent that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, impairment is not indicated and no further testing is required. Conversely, if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below its carrying amount, Step Two must be performed. Step Two consists of determining the implied estimated fair value of goodwill, which is the net 

difference between the valuation adjustments of assets and liabilities excluding goodwill and the valuation adjustment to equity (from Step One) of the reporting unit. The carrying value of equity for each reporting unit is determined from an allocation based upon risk weighted assets. Adverse changes in the economic environment, declining operations of the reporting unit, or other factors could result in a decline in the estimated implied fair value of goodwill. If the estimated implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, a loss (which could be material) would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to the estimated implied fair value. 

The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2019, by performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level to determine whether any indicators of impairment existed. In performing the qualitative assessment, the Company evaluated events and circumstances since the last impairment analysis, recent operating performance including reporting unit performance, changes in market capitalization, regulatory actions and assessments, changes in the business climate, company-specific factors, and trends in the banking industry. After assessing the totality of the events and circumstances, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management reporting units exceed their respective carrying values. Therefore, Step One and Step Two of the goodwill impairment test were deemed unnecessary. Refer to Note 10 "Intangible Assets" to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of goodwill. 

Specific factors as of the date of filing the financial statements that could negatively impact the assumptions used in assessing goodwill for impairment include: a protracted decline in the Company&#8217;s market capitalization; adverse business trends resulting from litigation and/or regulatory actions; higher loan losses; forecasts of high unemployment levels; future increased minimum regulatory capital requirements above current thresholds (refer to Note 13 "Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions" to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of current minimum regulatory requirements); future federal rules and regulations (e.g., such as those resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act); and/or a significant protraction in the current level of interest rates. 

Other material identifiable intangible assets, primarily core deposit intangibles and purchased credit card relationships, are reviewed at least annually (usually in the fourth quarter) for events or circumstances which could impact the recoverability of the intangible asset. These events could include loss of core deposits, significant losses of credit card accounts and/or balances, increased competition or adverse changes in the economy. To the extent an other identifiable intangible asset is deemed unrecoverable, an impairment loss would be recorded to reduce the carrying amount. These events or circumstances, if they occur, could be material to Regions&#8217; operating results for any particular reporting period but the potential impact cannot be reasonably estimated. 

Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights 

Regions has elected to measure and report its residential MSRs using the fair value method. Although sales of residential MSRs do occur, residential MSRs do not trade in an active market with readily observable market prices and the exact terms and conditions of sales may not be readily available, and are therefore Level 3 valuations in the fair value hierarchy previously discussed in the &#8220;Fair Value Measurements&#8221; section. Specific characteristics of the underlying loans greatly impact the estimated value of the related residential MSRs. As a result, Regions stratifies its residential mortgage servicing portfolio on the basis of certain risk characteristics, including loan type and contractual note rate, and values its residential MSRs using discounted cash flow modeling techniques. These techniques require management to make estimates regarding future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration historical and forecasted residential mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, escrow balances and servicing costs. Changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds or other factors impact the fair value of residential MSRs which impacts earnings. The carrying value of residential MSRs was $345 million at December 31, 2019 . Based on a hypothetical sensitivity analysis, Regions estimates that a reduction in primary mortgage market rates of 25 basis points and 50 basis points would reduce the December 31, 2019 fair value of residential MSRs by approximately 7 percent ($24 million) and 14 percent ($48 million), respectively. Conversely, 25 basis point and 50 basis point increases in these rates would increase the December 31, 2019 fair value of residential MSRs by approximately 7 percent ($23 million) and 13 percent ($43 million), respectively. Regions also estimates that an increase in servicing costs of approximately $10 per loan, or 16 percent, would result in a decline in the value of the residential MSRs by approximately $12 million. 

The pro forma fair value analysis presented above demonstrates the sensitivity of fair values to hypothetical changes in primary mortgage rates. This sensitivity analysis does not reflect an expected outcome. Refer to the &#8220;Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights&#8221; discussion in the &#8220;Balance Sheet&#8221; analysis section found later in this report. 

Income Taxes 

Accrued income taxes are reported as a component of either other assets or other liabilities, as appropriate, in the consolidated balance sheets and reflect management&#8217;s estimate of income taxes to be paid or received. 

Deferred income taxes represent the amount of future income taxes to be paid or received and are accounted for using the asset and liability method. The net balance is reported as a component of either other assets or other liabilities, as appropriate, in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company determines the realization of deferred tax assets by considering all positive and negative evidence available, including the impact of recent operating results, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, 

future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards and tax planning strategies. In projecting future taxable income, the Company utilizes forecasted pre-tax earnings, adjusts for the estimated book-tax differences and incorporates assumptions, including the amounts of income allocable to taxing jurisdictions. These assumptions require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates the Company uses to manage the underlying businesses. The realization of the deferred tax assets could be reduced in the future if these estimates are significantly different than forecasted. For a detailed discussion of realization of deferred tax assets, refer to the &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; section found later in this report. 

The Company is subject to income tax in the U.S. and multiple state and local jurisdictions. The tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction may be interpreted differently in certain situations, which could result in a range of outcomes. Thus, the Company is required to exercise judgment regarding the application of these tax laws and regulations. The Company will evaluate and recognize tax liabilities related to any tax uncertainties. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities. 

The Company&#8217;s estimate of accrued income taxes, deferred income taxes and income tax expense can also change in any period as a result of new legislative or judicial guidance impacting tax positions, as well as changes in income tax rates. Any changes, if they occur, can be significant to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. On December 22, 2017, Tax Reform was enacted. Effective January 1, 2018, Tax Reform reduced the maximum corporate statutory federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. See Note 20 "Income Taxes" to the consolidated financial statements for further details. 

OPERATING RESULTS 

NET INTEREST INCOME AND OTHER FINANCING INCOME AND NET INTEREST MARGIN 

Net interest income and other financing income is Regions&#8217; principal source of income and is one of the most important elements of Regions&#8217; ability to meet its overall performance goals. Net interest income and other financing income (taxable-equivalent basis) increased $11 million in 2019 compared to 2018 , driven primarily by higher short-term market interest rates, higher average loan balances, favorable loan remixing, and securities repositioning. The increases were largely offset by higher funding costs and the impact of lower long-term interest rates on asset pricing. 

The net interest margin decreased to 3.45 percent in 2019 from 3.48 percent in 2018 , as the increases in funding rates exceeded increases in yields on earning assets. This is primarily attributed to market interest rate dynamics, including the impact of remixing from lower yielding deposit products to higher yielding deposit products and debt instruments. Higher average loan balances also contributed to the decrease in net interest margin. Comparing 2019 to 2018 , average earning asset yields were 20 basis points higher, while interest-bearing liability rates were 31 basis points higher. As a result, the net interest rate spread decreased 11 basis points to 3.04 percent in 2019 compared to 3.15 percent in 2018 . 

The Federal Reserve began to increase policy accommodation during 2019 , through lowering its policy rate and resuming increases to its balance sheet. This, coupled with slowing global economic growth trends, resulted in decreases in long-term interest rates in 2019 . Long-term interest rates are generally represented by the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note. The average yield on the benchmark rate decreased to 2.14 percent in 2019 , compared to 2.91 percent in 2018 . However, the taxable investment securities portfolio, which contains significant residential fixed-rate exposure, increased in yield to 2.65 percent in 2019 from 2.50 percent in 2018 . The yield increase was largely attributable to securities portfolio optimization strategies and reinvestment at higher long-term interest rate levels throughout 2018 and the first half of 2019. Specifically, the optimization strategies, which were completed in 2019, included reducing the overall size of the portfolio through a combination of sales and maturities of lower yielding securities as well as the repositioning of agency MBS into prepayment protected securities, primarily agency commercial MBS. 

The loan portfolio also increased in yield to 4.69 percent in 2019 from 4.52 percent in 2018 . The Company's loan yields are primarily influenced by short-term interest rates such as 30-day LIBOR. While short-term interest rates had declined by year-end, the 30-day LIBOR averaged 2.22 percent in 2019 , compared to 2.02 percent in 2018 . Reinvestment of fixed rate loans at higher long-term interest rates throughout 2018 and the first half of 2019 also contributed to the yield increase. Loan yields were also positively impacted by favorable remixing during 2019, including the intentional runoff of lower yielding auto loans, which were replaced by higher yielding unsecured consumer loans. 

The Company's funding costs also increased in 2019 as compared to 2018 . Deposit costs increased to 47 basis points for 2019 compared to 26 basis points for 2018 . The increase was due primarily to higher short-term interest rates and portfolio remixing from lower yielding to higher yielding deposit products. The average long-term borrowing balance of $10 billion in 2019 was consistent with 2018 . However, the cost on these borrowings increased 24 basis points, as the majority of Regions' long-term debt is effectively converted to floating rate debt through the execution of interest rate swaps. Shorter-term FHLB advances also repriced higher in 2019 as the majority of these borrowings are floating rate debt as well. See the "Borrowings" section in Management's Discussion and Analysis and Note 12 "Borrowings" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

##TABLE_END

______ 

Notes: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

The change in interest not due solely to volume or yield/rate has been allocated to the volume column and yield/rate column in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

The computation of taxable-equivalent net interest income and other financing income is based on the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% for both December 31, 2019 and 2018 and 35% for December 31, 2017, adjusted for applicable state income taxes net of the related federal tax benefit. 

##TABLE_END The mix of earning assets can affect the interest rate spread. Regions&#8217; primary types of earning assets are loans and investment securities. Certain types of earning assets have historically generated larger spreads; for example, loans typically generate larger spreads than other assets, such as securities, Federal funds sold or securities purchased under agreements to resell. Average earning assets in 2019 totaled $110.2 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion as compared to the prior year. 

Average loans as a percentage of average earning assets was 76 percent and 74 percent in 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The remaining categories of earning assets are shown in Table 3 &#8220;Consolidated Average Daily Balances and Yield/Rate Analysis&#8221;. The proportion of average earning assets to average total assets, which was 88 percent in both 2019 and 2018 , measures the effectiveness of management&#8217;s efforts to invest available funds into the most profitable earning vehicles. Funding for Regions&#8217; earning assets comes from interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing sources. Another significant factor affecting the net interest margin is the percentage of earning assets funded by interest-bearing liabilities. The percentage of average earning assets funded by average interest-bearing liabilities was 66 percent in 2019 and 65 percent in 2018 . 

PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES 

The provision for loan losses is used to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that in management&#8217;s judgment is appropriate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. During 2019 , the provision for loan losses totaled $387 million and net charge-offs were $358 million . This compares to a provision for loan losses of $229 million and net charge-offs of $323 million in 2018 . 

For further discussion and analysis of the total allowance for credit losses, see the "Allowance for Credit Losses" and &#8220;Risk Management&#8221; sections found later in this report. See also Note 6 "Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements.

Service Charges on Deposit Accounts 

Service charges on deposit accounts include non-sufficient fund and overdraft fees, corporate analysis service charges, overdraft protection fees and other customer transaction-related service charges. The increase in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to continued customer account growth and increases in non-sufficient fund fee activity. 

Card and ATM Fees 

Card and ATM fees include the combined amounts of credit card/bank card income and debit card and ATM related revenue. The increase in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily the result of account growth and the related increases in commercial and consumer credit card interchange income and checkcard interchange income. 

Capital Markets Income 

Capital markets income primarily relates to capital raising activities that includes securities underwriting and placement, loan syndication and placement, as well as foreign exchange, derivatives, merger and acquisition and other advisory services. The decrease in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to declines in merger and acquisition advisory services and commercial swap income. Negative market-related credit valuation adjustments tied to customer derivatives were $8 million higher in 2019, which drove the decline in commercial swap income. The decreases were partially offset by higher securities underwriting and placement fees. 

Mortgage Income 

Mortgage income is generated through the origination and servicing of residential mortgage loans for long-term investors and sales of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. The increase in mortgage income in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily driven by increases in mortgage production and sales and servicing income, partially offset by a reduction in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights. See Note 7 "Servicing of Financial Assets" to the consolidated financial statements for more information. 

Bank-owned Life Insurance 

Bank-owned life insurance increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to an increase in claims benefits throughout the year and favorable market valuation adjustments. 

Securities Gains (Losses), net 

Net securities gains (losses) primarily result from the Company's asset/liability management process. The net loss incurred during 2019 was primarily due to a securities portfolio optimization strategy which included repositioning MBS. See Table 7 "Debt Securities" section and Note 4 "Debt Securities" to the consolidated financial statements for more information. 

Market Value Adjustments on Employee Benefit Assets 

Market value adjustments on employee benefit assets, both defined benefit and other, are the reflection of market value variations related to assets held for certain employee benefits. The adjustments reported as employee benefit assets - other are offset in salaries and benefits expense. 

Other Miscellaneous Income 

Other miscellaneous income includes net revenue from affordable housing, valuation adjustments to equity investments, fees from safe deposit boxes, check fees and other miscellaneous income. Net revenue from affordable housing includes actual gains and losses resulting from the sale of affordable housing investments, cash distributions from the investments and any related impairment charges. Other miscellaneous income increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to an increase in commercial leasing income driven by less impairment charges on operating lease assets during 2019 , a gain associated with the sale of affordable housing residential mortgage loans, and an increase in consumer merchant commission income. These items were partially offset by decreases in the values of low income housing investments in 2019 and net gains associated with the sale of certain low income housing investments in the first quarter of 2018 .

Salaries and Employee Benefits 

Salaries and employee benefits consist of salaries, incentive compensation, long-term incentives, payroll taxes, and other employee benefits such as 401(k), pension, and medical, life and disability insurance, as well as, expenses from liabilities held for employee benefit purposes. Salaries and employee benefits decreased during 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to lower severance costs and reduced headcount. Full-time equivalent headcount from continuing operations decreased to 19,564 at December 31, 2019 from 19,969 at December 31, 2018 , reflecting the continuing impact of the Company's efficiency initiatives implemented as part of its strategic priorities. 

Net Occupancy Expense 

Net occupancy expense includes rent, depreciation, ad valorem taxes, utilities, insurance, and maintenance. Net occupancy expense decreased during 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to occupancy optimization initiatives, including branch closures. 

Professional, Legal and Regulatory Expenses 

Professional, legal and regulatory expenses consist of amounts related to legal, consulting, other professional fees and regulatory charges. Professional, legal and regulatory expenses decreased during 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to lower consulting fees and a reduction in legal costs. 

FDIC Insurance Assessments 

FDIC insurance assessments decreased during 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the discontinuation of the FDIC assessment surcharge that was in place throughout the first nine months of 2018. 

Branch Consolidation, Property and Equipment Charges 

Branch consolidation, property and equipment charges include valuation adjustments related to owned branches when the decision to close them is made. Accelerated depreciation and lease write-off charges are recorded for leased branches through and at the actual branch close date. Branch consolidation, property and equipment charges also include costs related to other occupancy optimization initiatives. 

Visa Class B Shares Expense 

Visa class B shares expense is associated with shares sold in a prior year. The Visa class B shares have restrictions tied to finalization of certain covered litigation. Visa class B shares expense increased during 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of increases in Visa's stock price and changes in the status of the covered litigation. 

Provision (Credit) for Unfunded Credit Losses 

Provision (credit) for unfunded credit losses is the adjustment to the reserve for unfunded credit commitments, which can fluctuate based on the amount of outstanding commitments and the level of risk associated with those commitments. A provision for unfunded credit losses is primarily due to increased volume and/or increased levels of estimated risk in commitments, while a (credit) for unfunded credit losses is primarily due to reduced volume and/or levels of estimated risk in commitments. Beginning in 2020, adjustments to the reserve for unfunded credit commitments will be included within the provision for credit losses. 

Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt 

In 2019, Regions commenced a tender offer and received tenders for $740 million of its outstanding 3.20% senior notes due 2021, incurring a related early extinguishment pre-tax charge of approximately $16 million. See Note 12 "Borrowings" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

Other Miscellaneous Expenses 

Other miscellaneous expenses include expenses related to communications, postage, supplies, certain credit-related costs, foreclosed property expenses, mortgage repurchase costs and other costs (benefits) related to employee benefit plans. Other miscellaneous expenses decreased during 2019 compared to 2018 primarily driven by a $60 million contribution to Regions' Financial Corporation charitable foundation that was made in 2018. This was partially offset by higher operational losses and an increase in non-service related pension costs associated with a lower discount rate. 

INCOME TAXES 

The Company&#8217;s income tax expense from continuing operations for the year ended 2019 was $403 million compared to income tax expense of $387 million for the same period in 2018, resulting in effective tax rates of 20.3 percent and 19.8 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate is lower in the prior period principally due to tax benefits recognized due to Tax Reform. 

The effective tax rate is affected by many factors including, but not limited to, the level of pre-tax income, the mix of income between various tax jurisdictions with differing tax rates, net tax benefits related to affordable housing investments, bank-owned life insurance, tax-exempt interest and nondeductible expenses. In addition, the effective tax rate is affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period-to-period, such as the termination of certain leveraged leases, share- 

based payments, valuation allowance changes and changes to unrecognized tax benefits. Accordingly, the comparability of the effective tax rate between periods may be impacted. 

At December 31, 2019, the Company reported a net deferred tax liability of $328 million compared to a net deferred asset of $20 million at December 31, 2018. The change from a net deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax liability was due principally to a change in the net market valuation adjustment related to available for sale securities and derivative instruments from a net loss to a net gain. 

The Company continually assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets based on an evaluative process that considers all available positive and negative evidence. As part of this evaluative process, the Company considers the following sources of taxable income: 1) the future reversals of taxable temporary differences; 2) future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards; and 3) tax-planning strategies. In making a conclusion, the Company has evaluated all available positive and negative evidence impacting these sources of taxable income. The primary sources of evidence impacting the Company's judgment regarding the realization of its deferred tax assets are summarized below. 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

History of earnings - In 2019, the Company has continued its positive earnings trend with positive earnings from 2012 through 2019. There is no history of significant tax carryforwards expiring unused. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Reversals of taxable temporary differences - The Company anticipates that future reversals of taxable temporary differences, including the accretion of taxable temporary differences related to leveraged leases acquired in a prior business combination, can absorb up to approximately $718 million of deferred tax assets, which is significantly larger than the $461 deferred tax asset balance net of valuation allowance at December 31, 2019. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Creation of future taxable income - The Company has projected future taxable income that could offset excess deferred tax assets. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Ability to implement tax planning strategies - The Company has the ability to implement tax planning strategies such as asset sales to maximize the realization of deferred tax assets. 

##TABLE_END Based on this evaluative process, the Company established a valuation allowance in the amount of $32 million at December 31, 2019 and $30 million at December 31, 2018 because the Company believes that a portion of state net operating loss carryforwards will not be utilized. See Note 1 &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; and Note 20 "Income Taxes" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about income taxes. 

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 

On April 4, 2018, Regions entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell Regions Insurance Group, Inc. and related affiliates to BB&#38;T Insurance Holdings, Inc. (now Truist Insurance Holdings, Inc). The transaction closed on July 2, 2018. On April 2, 2012, Morgan Keegan was sold. 

Regions' results from discontinued operations are presented in Note 3 "Discontinued Operations" to the consolidated financial statements. The results from discontinued operations in 2019 were immaterial. Income from discontinued operations in 2018 included the gain associated with the sale of Regions Insurance Group, Inc. and affiliates of $281 million ($196 million after tax). 

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 

The following sections provide expanded discussion of significant changes in certain line items in asset, liability, and equity categories. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

At December 31, 2019 , cash and cash equivalents totaled $4.1 billion compared to $3.5 billion at December 31, 2018 . The increase was due primarily to an increase in cash on deposit with the FRB, as the result of normal day-to-day operating variations. 

Debt Securities 

Debt securities available for sale, which constitute the majority of the securities portfolio, are an important tool used to manage interest rate sensitivity and provide a primary source of liquidity for the Company. Regions maintains a highly rated securities portfolio consisting primarily of agency mortgage-backed securities. Regions&#8217; investment policy emphasizes credit quality and liquidity. Debt securities rated in the highest category by nationally recognized rating agencies and debt securities backed by the U.S. Government and government sponsored agencies, both on a direct and indirect basis, represented approximately 94 percent of the investment portfolio at December 31, 2019 . All other debt securities rated below AAA, not backed by the U.S. Government or government sponsored agencies, or which are not rated represented approximately 6 percent of total debt securities at December 31, 2019 . The &#8220;Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk&#8221; and "Liquidity Risk" sections, found later in this report, further explain Regions&#8217; interest rate and liquidity risk management practices. 

The average life of the debt securities portfolio at December 31, 2019 was estimated to be 5.3 years, with a duration of approximately 4.2 years. These metrics compare with an estimated average life of 5.7 years, with a duration of approximately 4.2 years for the portfolio at December 31, 2018 . 

During 2019, the Company executed securities portfolio optimization strategies, which included reducing the overall size through a combination of maturities and sales, and repositioning the composition of the portfolio. The repositioning strategy consisted of the sale of primarily agency MBS that were lower yielding and reinvestment into higher-yielding prepayment protected securities, primarily agency commercial MBS, in an effort to reduce future net interest income and other financing income variability to the long end of the yield curve. 

See Note 4 "Debt Securities" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Loans Held For Sale 

At December 31, 2019 , loans held for sale totaled $637 million , consisting of $436 million of residential real estate mortgage loans, $188 million of commercial mortgage and other loans, and $13 million of non-performing loans. At December 31, 2018 , loans held for sale totaled $304 million , consisting of $256 million of residential real estate mortgage loans, $38 million of commercial mortgage and other loans, and $10 million of non-performing loans. The levels of residential real estate and commercial mortgage loans held for sale that are part of the Company's mortgage originations to be sold fluctuate depending on the timing of origination and sale to third parties. 

Loans 

GENERAL 

Average loans, net of unearned income, represented 76 percent of average interest-earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2019 , compared to 75 percent for the year ended December 31, 2018 . Lending at Regions is generally organized along three portfolio segments: commercial loans (including commercial and industrial, and owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage and construction loans), investor real estate loans (commercial real estate mortgage and construction loans) and consumer loans (residential first mortgage, home equity, indirect-vehicles, indirect-other consumer, consumer credit card and other consumer loans). 

Table 9 illustrates a year-over-year comparison of loans, net of unearned income, by portfolio segment and class as of December 31 and Table 10 provides information on selected loan maturities as of December 31:

_________ 

(1) Excludes consumer portfolio segment. 

(2) Excludes $242 million of small business credit card accounts. 

Loans, net of unearned income, totaled $83.0 billion at December 31, 2019 , a decrease of $189 million from year-end 2018 levels. Regions manages loan growth with a focus on risk management and risk-adjusted return on capital. Loan balances increased year over year in the commercial and investor real estate portfolio segments but decreased in the consumer portfolio segment. Within the consumer portfolio segment, the year over year balance decline is attributable to Regions' decision in January 2019 to discontinue its indirect auto lending business and a decline in home equity loans. 

PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS 

The following sections describe the composition of the portfolio segments and classes disclosed in Table 9, explain changes in balances from the 2018 year-end, and highlight the related risk characteristics. Regions believes that its loan portfolio is well diversified by product, client, and geography throughout its footprint. However, the loan portfolio may be exposed to certain concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers, certain types of collateral, certain types of industries, certain loan products, or certain regions of the country. See Note 5 "Loans" and Note 6 "Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion. 

Commercial 

The commercial portfolio segment includes commercial and industrial loans to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases and other expansion projects. Commercial and industrial loans increased $689 million or 2 percent since year-end 2018 . The increase was broad-based across industry sectors and geographic markets, driven primarily by expansion of existing customer relationships and the addition of new relationships. Commercial also includes owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans to operating businesses, which are loans for long-term financing of land and buildings, and are repaid by cash flow generated by business operations. Owner-occupied commercial real estate construction loans are made to commercial businesses for the development of land or construction of a building where the repayment is derived from revenues generated from the business of the borrower. 

Over half of the Company&#8217;s total loans are included in the commercial portfolio segment. These balances are spread across numerous industries, as noted in the table below. The Company manages the related risks to this portfolio by setting certain lending limits for each significant industry. 

The following table provides detail of Regions' commercial portfolio balances in selected industries as of December 31 :

"Other" contains balances related to non-classifiable and invalid business industry codes offset by payments in process and fee accounts that are not available at the loan level. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) 

As customers' businesses evolve (e.g. up or down the vertical manufacturing chain), Regions may need to change the assigned business industry code used to define the customer relationship. When these changes occur, Regions does not recast the customer history for prior periods into the new classification because the business industry code used in the prior period was deemed appropriate. As a result, year over year changes may be impacted. 

##TABLE_END

Investor Real Estate 

Loans for real estate development are repaid through cash flows related to the operation, sale or refinance of the property. This portfolio segment includes extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is dependent on the sale of real estate or income generated from the real estate collateral. A portion of Regions&#8217; investor real estate portfolio segment consists of loans secured by residential product types (land, single-family and condominium loans) within Regions&#8217; markets. Additionally, this category includes loans made to finance income-producing properties such as apartment buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers. Total investor real estate loans increased $121 million in comparison to 2018 year-end balances. Due to the nature of the cash flows typically used to repay investor real estate loans, these loans are particularly vulnerable to weak economic conditions. 

Residential First Mortgage 

Residential first mortgage loans represent loans to consumers to finance a residence. These loans are typically financed over a 15 to 30 year term and, in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence. The balance as of December 31, 2019 increased $209 million in comparison to 2018 year-end balances. Partially offsetting this increase was the first quarter 2019 sale of $167 million of affordable housing residential mortgage loans, which generated an $8 million pre-tax gain. Approximately $3.1 billion in new loan originations were retained on the balance sheet through the year ended 2019. 

Home Equity 

Home equity lending includes both home equity loans and lines of credit. This type of lending, which is secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower's residence, allows customers to borrow against the equity in their homes. The home equity portfolio declined by $873 million in comparison to 2018 year-end balances. The decline in the home equity portfolio year-over-year was due to continued payoffs and paydowns exceeding production during the year. Substantially all of this portfolio was originated through Regions&#8217; branch network. 

The following table presents information regarding the future principal payment reset dates for the Company's home equity lines of credit as of December 31, 2019 . The balances presented are based on maturity date for lines with a balloon payment and draw period expiration date for lines that convert to a repayment period.

##TABLE_END

Of the $8.4 billion home equity portfolio at December 31, 2019 , approximately $ 5.3 billion were home equity lines of credit and $ 3.1 billion were closed-end home equity loans (primarily originated as amortizing loans). Beginning in December 2016, new home equity lines of credit have a 10-year draw period and a 20-year repayment term. During the 10-year draw period customers do not have an interest-only payment option, except on a very limited basis. From May 2009 to December 2016, home equity lines of credit had a 10-year draw period and a 10-year repayment term. Prior to May 2009, home equity lines of credit had a 20-year repayment term with a balloon payment upon maturity or a 5-year draw period with a balloon payment upon maturity. The term &#8220;balloon payment&#8221; means there are no principal payments required until the balloon payment is due for interest-only lines of credit. 

Other Consumer Credit Quality Data 

The Company calculates an estimate of the current value of property secured as collateral for both residential first mortgage and home equity lending products (&#8220;current LTV&#8221;). The estimate is based on home price indices compiled by a third party. The third party data indicates trends for MSAs. Regions uses the third party valuation trends from the MSAs in the Company's footprint in its estimate. The trend data is applied to the loan portfolios taking into account the age of the most recent valuation and geographic area. 

The following table presents current LTV data for components of the residential first mortgage and home equity classes of the consumer portfolio segment. Current LTV data for some loans in the portfolio is not available due to mergers and systems integrations. The amounts in the table represent the entire loan balance. For purposes of the table below, if the loan balance exceeds the current estimated collateral the entire balance is included in the &#8220;Above 100%&#8221; category, regardless of the amount of collateral available to partially offset the shortfall.

Indirect&#8212;Vehicles 

Indirect-vehicles lending, which is lending initiated through third-party business partners, largely consists of loans made through automotive dealerships. This portfolio decreased $1.2 billion from year-end 2018 due to the termination of a third-party arrangement during the fourth quarter of 2016 and Regions' decision in January 2019 to discontinue its indirect auto lending business due to margin compression impacting overall returns on the portfolio. Regions ceased originating new indirect auto loans in the first quarter of 2019 and completed any in-process indirect auto loan closings at the end of the second quarter of 2019. The Company will remain in the direct auto lending business. 

Indirect&#8212;Other Consumer 

Indirect-other consumer lending represents other lending initiatives through third parties, including point of sale lending. This portfolio class increased $900 million from year-end 2018 , primarily due to continued growth in existing arrangements with third parties. The Company exited a third party relationship during the fourth quarter of 2019. 

Consumer Credit Card 

Consumer credit card lending represents primarily open-ended variable interest rate consumer credit card loans. These balances increased $42 million from year-end 2018 . 

Other Consumer 

Other consumer loans primarily include direct consumer loans, overdrafts and other revolving loans. Other consumer loans increased $29 million from year-end 2018 . 

Regions qualitatively considers factors such as periodic updates of FICO scores, unemployment, home prices, and geography as credit quality indicators for consumer loans. FICO scores are obtained at origination and refreshed FICO scores are obtained by the Company quarterly for all consumer loans. The following tables present estimated current FICO score data for components of classes of the consumer portfolio segment. Current FICO data is not available for the remaining loans in the portfolio for various reasons; for example, if customers do not use sufficient credit, an updated score may not be available. Residential first mortgage and home equity balances with FICO scores below 620 were 5 percent of the combined portfolios for both December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 .

##TABLE_END

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses ("allowance") consists of two components: the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. The allowance for loan losses totaled $869 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $840 million 

at December 31, 2018 . The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of net loans increased to 1.05 percent as of December 31, 2019 from 1.01 percent at December 31, 2018 , reflecting an increase in classified loans. 

The provision for loan losses increased from $229 million in 2018 to $387 million in 2019 . During 2018, lower than anticipated losses associated with certain 2017 hurricanes resulted in the release of the Company's $40 million hurricane-specific loan loss allowance, and the sale of $254 million in residential first mortgage loans consisting primarily of performing troubled debt restructured loans resulted in a $16 million net reduction to the provision for loan losses. Both of these factors, combined with broad-based improved credit metrics, resulted in a lower provision for loan losses for 2018. Contributing to the increase in the provision for loan losses during 2019 were higher average loan balances due to loan growth in the first quarter of 2019, higher net charge-offs, and an increase in classified loans. The provision for loan losses was higher than net charge-offs for 2019 by approximately $29 million. Net charge-offs for 2019 were approximately $35 million higher as compared to 2018 . 

Management expects that net loan charge-offs will be in the 0.45 percent to 0.55 percent range for 2020 ; based on recent trends and current market conditions. Economic trends such as interest rates, unemployment, volatility in commodity prices and collateral valuations will impact the future levels of net charge-offs and may result in volatility in certain credit metrics. Additionally, changes in circumstances related to individually large credits or certain portfolios may result in volatility. 

Details regarding the allowance and net charge-offs, including an analysis of activity from previous years' totals, are included in Table 15 &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses.&#8221;

CECL Adoption 

On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted a new accounting standard , which replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss (CECL) methodology. Upon the adoption of CECL, the allowance is intended to cover expected credit losses over the contractual life of loans measured at amortized cost, including unfunded commitments. Management&#8217;s measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and R&#38;S forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported asset amount. During the R&#38;S forecast period, Regions incorporated forward-looking information by utilizing its internally formulated and approved "base" economic scenario. The scenario was developed by the Chief Economist and approved by the Scenario Design Committee. The approved economic forecast considered market forward/consensus information and was consistent with Regions' organization-wide economic outlook. Regions utilized a two year R&#38;S forecast period for all portfolio segments, which closely aligned with other internal forecast periods. Key macroeconomic factors that Regions utilized over the two year R&#38;S forecast period are as follows: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Unemployment rates between 3.3% and 3.7% 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Real GDP, annualized percent change between 1.3% and 2.0% 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

10 year US Treasury rates between 1.8% and 1.9% 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

US Federal Funds rates between 1.3% and 1.6% 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

CPI year-over-year change between 1.8% and 2.1% 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Core logic HPI approximately 3% increase per year 

##TABLE_END See the "Economic Environment in Regions' Banking Markets" section found later in the Credit Risk section of this report for further discussion of the current U.S. economic environment and its influence to Regions' credit performance. 

For periods beyond which Regions utilized R&#38;S forecasts, Regions reverted to historical credit loss information. Regions reverts to TTC loss rates derived from taking the simple average of all historical quarterly observations for PD, LGD, EAD and 

prepayment rates. The mean reversion rate represents the weighted-average of forecasted R&#38;S and TTC rates, with the weight increasing exponentially over time. The reversion periods for classes of commercial and investor real estate loans were six months to two years and the reversion periods for classes of consumer loans were between two and four years. The length of the reversion period differed by portfolio segment depending on the time it takes for charge-off rates to revert to the long-term average. Regions may adjust any and/or all of the factors discussed above in future periods. 

These assumptions and estimates will be monitored and challenged by appropriate corporate governance. 

The CECL allowance is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist. The allowance is calculated for most portfolios and classes using econometric models. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. While quantitative allowance methodologies strive to reflect all risk factors, any estimate involves assumptions and uncertainties resulting in some level of imprecision. Regions adjusts the modeled allowance considering quantitative and qualitative factors which may not be directly measured in the modeled calculations. Regions' qualitative framework provides for specific model adjustments and general imprecision adjustments. Specific model adjustments capture specific issues or events that are not adequately captured in model outcomes. General imprecision adjustments address other sources of imprecision that are not separately identifiable or quantifiable and have not been captured by a specific model adjustment. 

The table below summarizes the estimated allowance by portfolio segment upon adoption of CECL as compared to prior to adoption. The CECL estimate is based upon an increase of approximately $500 million at adoption.

##TABLE_END

As shown in the table above, the estimated increase in the allowance at adoption of CECL was primarily the result of significant increases within the consumer portfolio segment. Classes within the consumer segment that were most impacted include residential first mortgages, home equity and indirect-other consumer. The impact to the residential first mortgage and home equity classes is mainly driven by their longer time to maturity. Additionally, a significant portion of the indirect-other consumer class is unsecured lending through third parties which yield higher loss rates. Under CECL, these higher loss rates compounded over a life of loan estimate result in a significantly larger allowance estimate. 

Regions' CECL estimate is sensitive to a number of factors, which may differ depending on the portfolio or class. Changes in economic conditions or in Regions' assumptions and estimates could affect its estimate of expected losses. Regions used its best judgment to assess economic conditions and loss data in estimating the CECL allowance and these estimates are subject to periodic refinement based on changes in underlying external or internal data. 

For further information on the estimated impact upon adoption of CECL, see Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated financial statements. 

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs) 

TDRs are modified loans in which a concession is provided to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. Residential first mortgage, home equity, consumer credit card and other consumer TDRs are consumer loans modified under the CAP. Commercial and investor real estate loan modifications are not the result of a formal program, but represent situations where modifications were offered as a workout alternative. Renewals of classified commercial and investor real estate loans are considered to be TDRs, even if no reduction in interest rate is offered, if the existing terms are considered to be below market. More detailed information is included in Note 6 "Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements. The following table summarizes the loan balance and related allowance for accruing and non-accruing TDRs for the periods ending December 31:

Note: All loans listed in the table above are considered impaired under applicable accounting literature. 

The following table provides an analysis of the changes in commercial and investor real estate TDRs. TDRs with subsequent restructurings that meet the definition of a TDR are only reported as TDR additions in the period they were first modified. Other than resolutions such as charge-offs, foreclosures, payments, sales and transfers to held for sale, Regions may remove loans from TDR classification if the following conditions are met: the borrower's financial condition improves such that the borrower is no longer in financial difficulty, the loan has not had any forgiveness of principal or interest, the loan has not been restructured as an "A" note/"B" note, the loan has been reported as a TDR over one fiscal year-end and the loan is subsequently refinanced or restructured at market terms such that it qualifies as a new loan. 

For the consumer portfolio, changes in TDRs are primarily due to additions from CAP modifications and outflows from payments and charge-offs. Given the types of concessions currently being granted under the CAP as detailed in Note 6 "Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements. Regions does not expect that the market interest rate condition will be widely achieved. Therefore, Regions expects consumer loans modified through CAP to continue to be identified as TDRs for the remaining term of the loan.

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) 

Excludes residential first mortgage loans that are 100% guaranteed by the FHA and all guaranteed loans sold to the GNMA where Regions has the right but not the obligation to repurchase. Total 90 days or more past due guaranteed loans excluded were $66 million at December 31, 2019 , $84 million at December 31, 2018 , $124 million at December 31, 2017 , $113 million at December 31, 2016 and $107 million at December 31, 2015 . 

##TABLE_END

Non-performing loans increased slightly during 2019 driven by increases in the administrative, support, waste and repair, manufacturing, and retail trade industries. 

Economic trends such as interest rates, unemployment, volatility in commodity prices, and collateral valuations will impact the future level of non-performing assets. Circumstances related to individually large credits could also result in volatility. 

At December 31, 2019 , Regions had approximately $130 million to $210 million of potential problem commercial and investor real estate loans that were not included in non-accrual loans, but for which management had concerns as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with their present loan repayment terms. This is a likely estimate of the amount of commercial and investor real estate loans that have the potential to migrate to non-accrual status in the next quarter. 

In order to arrive at the estimate of potential problem loans, credit personnel forecast certain larger dollar loans that may potentially be downgraded to non-accrual at a future time, depending on the occurrence of future events. These personnel consider a variety of factors, including the borrower&#8217;s capacity and willingness to meet the contractual repayment terms, make principal curtailments or provide additional collateral when necessary, and provide current and complete financial information including global cash flows, contingent liabilities and sources of liquidity. Based upon the consideration of these factors, a probability weighting is assigned to loans to reflect the potential for migration to the pool of potential problem loans during this specific time period. Additionally, for other loans (for example, smaller dollar loans), a trend analysis is incorporated to determine the estimate of potential future downgrades. Because of the inherent uncertainty in forecasting future events, the estimate of potential problem loans ultimately represents the estimated aggregate dollar amounts of loans as opposed to an individual listing of loans. 

The majority of the loans on which the potential problem loan estimate is based are considered criticized and classified. Detailed disclosures for substandard accrual loans (as well as other credit quality metrics) are included in Note 6 "Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements. 

The following table provides an analysis of non-accrual loans (excluding loans held for sale) by portfolio segment:

Other Earning Assets 

Other earning assets consist primarily of FRB and FHLB stock, marketable equity securities and operating lease assets . The balance at December 31, 2019 totaled $1.5 billion compared to $1.7 billion at December 31, 2018 . Refer to Note 8 "Other Earning Assets" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

Goodwill 

Goodwill totaled $4.8 billion at both December 31, 2019 and 2018 . Refer to the &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; section earlier in this report for detailed discussions of the Company&#8217;s methodology for testing goodwill for impairment. Refer to Note 1 &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; and Note 10 "Intangible Assets" to the consolidated financial statements for the methodologies and assumptions used in the goodwill impairment analysis. 

Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights at Fair Value 

Residential MSRs decreased approximately $73 million from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 . The year-over-year decrease is primarily due to lower purchases of servicing rights during 2019 and a decline resulting from changes in valuation inputs or assumptions. An analysis of residential MSRs is presented in Note 7 "Servicing of Financial Assets" to the consolidated financial statements. 

Deposits 

Regions competes with other banking and financial services companies for a share of the deposit market. Regions&#8217; ability to compete in the deposit market depends heavily on the pricing of its deposits and how effectively the Company meets customers&#8217; needs. Regions employs various means to meet those needs and enhance competitiveness, such as providing a high level of customer service, competitive pricing and convenient branch locations for its customers. Regions also serves customers through providing centralized, high-quality banking services and alternative product delivery channels such as mobile and internet banking. 

Deposits are Regions&#8217; primary source of funds, providing funding for 86 percent of average earning assets in 2019 and 87 percent of average earning assets in 2018 . Table 22 &#8220;Deposits&#8221; details year-over-year deposits on a period-ending basis. Total deposits at December 31, 2019 increased approximately $3.0 billion compared to year-end 2018 levels. The increase in deposits was primarily driven by increases in corporate treasury other deposits, money market accounts, interest-bearing transaction accounts and time deposits. These increases were partially offset by decreases in non-interest-bearing demand, savings, and to a lesser extent, corporate treasury time deposits. 

Deposit costs increased to 47 basis points for 2019 , compared to 26 basis points for 2018 and 16 basis points for 2017 . The rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased to 0.74 percent in 2019 compared to 0.42 percent for 2018 and 0.26 percent for 2017 . The increases are largely due to portfolio remixing, resulting from the rise of short-term rates in late 2018 that remained elevated during the first half of 2019. The portfolio remixing stabilized in late 2019 as the FOMC reduced its short-term policy rate. Low deposit costs are driven primarily by the composition of the Company's deposit base, which includes a significant amount of low-cost, and relatively small account balance consumer and private wealth deposits. The deposit base composition is a key component of the Company's franchise value. 

The following table summarizes deposits by category as of December 31 :

##TABLE_END

Non-interest-bearing demand deposits decreased $940 million to $ 34.1 billion at year-end 2019 due primarily to commercial customers using liquidity to pay down debt or invest in their businesses, as well as portfolio remixing. Non-interest-bearing deposits accounted for approximately 35 percent of total deposits for 2019 compared to 37 percent for 2018 . 

Interest-bearing transaction accounts increased $871 million to $20.0 billion due to the offering of higher rates, which resulted in portfolio remixing. Interest-bearing transaction deposits accounted for approximately 21 percent of total deposits for 2019 compared to 20 percent for 2018. 

Domestic money market accounts increased $1.2 billion to $25.3 billion at year-end 2019 due to the offering of higher rates, portfolio remixing, and overall account growth. Domestic money market accounts accounted for approximately 26 percent of total deposits at both year-end 2019 and 2018. 

Included in time deposits are certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts. The balance of time deposits increased $320 million in 2019 to $7.4 billion compared to $7.1 billion in 2018 due primarily to higher rates being offered on certificates of deposit accounts and customer preference, which drove portfolio remixing and account growth. Time deposits accounted for 8 percent of total deposits in both 2019 and 2018 . See Table 23 &#8220;Maturity of Time Deposits of $100,000 or More&#8221; for maturity information. 

Corporate treasury other deposits consist of balances managed by Corporate Treasury, including Eurodollar deposits and selected deposits.

Borrowings 

Short-Term Borrowings 

Short-term borrowings, which consist of FHLB advances, totaled $2.1 billion at December 31, 2019 as compared to $1.6 billion at December 31, 2018 . The levels of these borrowings can fluctuate depending on the Company&#8217;s funding needs and the sources utilized. The increase in 2019 was partially offset by a decline in long-term borrowings related primarily to maturities of long-term FHLB advances. 

Short-term secured borrowings, such as securities sold under agreements to repurchase and FHLB advances, are a core portion of Regions' funding strategy. 

The securities financing market and specifically short-term FHLB advances continue to provide reliable funding at attractive rates. See the "Liquidity" section for further detail of Regions' borrowing capacity with the FHLB. 

Long-Term Borrowings 

Total long-term borrowings decreased approximately $4.5 billion to $7.9 billion at December 31, 2019 . The decrease was primarily due to a $4.4 billion decrease in FHLB advances. Additionally, Regions tendered approximately $740 million of its senior notes. Offsetting these decreases was an issuance of $500 million of senior notes. 

See Note 12 "Borrowings" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of both short-term and long-term borrowings.

On December 9, 2019 Fitch Ratings revised the outlook for Regions Financial Corporation, and its subsidiary, Regions Bank to Positive from Stable. The positive outlook reflects the Company's improved asset quality levels, risk appetite and strategy. 

On July 31, 2019, Fitch Ratings upgraded its short-term default rating for Regions Bank and Regions Financial Corporation to F1 from F2. Fitch also upgraded its short-term deposit rating for Regions Bank to F1 from F2. Fitch attributed the upgrade to changes in its short-term ratings criteria, while also referencing the Company&#8217;s robust liquidity management and funding profile. Furthermore, Fitch viewed the Company&#8217;s liquidity stress testing process as supportive of the rating given the measurement and monitoring of liquidity outflow coverage under various stress scenarios and time horizons. 

In general, ratings agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, probability of government support, and level and quality of earnings. Any downgrade in credit ratings by one or more ratings agencies may impact Regions in several ways, including, but not limited to, Regions&#8217; access to the capital markets or short-term funding, borrowing cost and capacity, collateral requirements, and acceptability of its letters of credit, thereby potentially adversely impacting Regions&#8217; financial condition and liquidity. See the &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. 

A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and the ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 

Stockholders' Equity 

Stockholders&#8217; equity was $ 16.3 billion at December 31, 2019 as compared to $15.1 billion at December 31, 2018 . During 2019 , net income increased stockholders&#8217; equity by $1.6 billion. Cash dividends on common stock and cash dividends on preferred stock reduced stockholders' equity by $ 582 million and $ 79 million, respectively. Common stock repurchased during 2019 reduced stockholders' equity by $ 1.1 billion. These shares were immediately retired and therefore are not included in treasury stock. Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income increased stockholders' equity by $ 874 million, primarily due to the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on securities available for sale and derivative instruments as a result of changes in market interest rates during 2019. Furthermore, during the second quarter of 2019 the Company issued Series C Preferred Stock, which increased stockholders' equity by $490 million. 

During the second quarter of 2019, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $1.37 billion of the Company's common stock, permitting repurchases from the beginning of the third quarter of 2019 through the end of the second quarter of 2020. 

See Note 15 "Stockholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS 

CAPITAL RULES 

Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies. These regulatory capital requirements involve quantitative measures of the Company's assets, liabilities and selected off-balance sheet items, and also qualitative judgments by the regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can subject the Company to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory actions. See Note 13 "Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions" to the consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the applicable holding company and bank regulatory capital requirements. 

Under the Basel III Rules, Regions is designated as a standardized approach bank and, as such, began transitioning to the Basel III Rules in January 2015 subject to a phase-in period extending to January 2019. The Basel III Rules are now fully phased in, other than deductions and adjustments as described below, and among other things, (i) impose a capital measure called CET1, (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and &#8220;Additional Tier 1 capital&#8221; instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions/adjustments to capital as compared to prior regulations. The Basel III Rules also prescribe a standardized approach for risk-weightings of assets and off-balance sheet exposures to derive the capital ratios. 

Additionally, the Basel III Rules impose a capital conservation buffer designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. The capital conservation buffer is on top of minimum risk-weighted asset ratios and is equal to the lowest difference between the three risk-based capital ratios less the applicable minimum required ratio. As of January 1, 2019, the capital conservation buffer is fully phased in and is 2.5% of CET1 to risk-weighted assets. In addition, the Basel III Rules provide for a countercyclical capital buffer applicable only to advanced approach institutions, and therefore not currently applicable to Regions or Regions Bank. Banking institutions with ratios that are above the minimum but below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when applicable, face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall and the institution&#8217;s ERI. ERI is compiled using the past four quarter trailing net income, net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income. 

The Basel III Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. For example, goodwill and selected other intangible assets, and disallowed deferred tax assets are deducted. MSRs, certain other deferred tax assets and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities are also deducted from CET1 if they exceed defined thresholds. Under the Basel III Rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items are included; however, standardized approach banking organizations, including Regions and Regions Bank, were allowed to make a one-time permanent election to exclude these items. Regions and Regions Bank made this election in order to avoid significant variations in the level of capital, including the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of their securities portfolios. 

Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and was to be phased in over a 4-year period, beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter. In July 2019, the federal banking agencies finalized a rule to revise and simplify the capital treatment of selected categories of deferred tax assets, MSRs, investments in non-consolidated financial entities and minority interests for banking organizations, such as Regions and Regions Bank, that are not subject to the advanced approach. In November 2019, federal banking agencies also adopted rules that change the capital treatment of high volatility commercial real estate loans under the standardized approach, which increases regulatory capital ratios for some standardized approach banking organizations such as Regions by changing the definition of these real estate loans. Regions will fully implement these changes during the second quarter of 2020. 

In December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms (the standards are commonly referred to as &#8220;Basel IV&#8221;). Among other things, these standards revise the Basel 

Committee&#8217;s standardized approach for credit risk (including by recalibrating risk-weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain &#8220;unconditionally cancellable commitments,&#8221; such as unused credit card lines of credit) and provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital. Under the Basel framework, these standards will generally be effective on January 1, 2022, with an aggregate output floor phasing in through January 1, 2027. Under the current U.S. capital rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approach institutions, and not to Regions or Regions Bank. The impact of Basel IV on the Company will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the federal banking regulators. 

On April 10, 2018, the federal banking agencies issued a proposal to simplify capital rules for large banks. The proposal introduces a SCB, which would replace the existing capital conservation buffer and incorporate forward-looking stress test results into non-stress capital requirements. The SCB, subject to a minimum of 2.5%, would reflect stressed losses in the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s supervisory stress tests and would also include four quarters of planned common stock dividends. Details of this proposal are discussed under the &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8212;Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review and Stress Testing&#8221; section of the &#8220;Business&#8221; section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although the proposal, if adopted, would change the way in which the minimum capital ratios are calculated, institutions would continue to be subject to progressively more stringent constraints on capital actions as they approach the minimum ratios. 

In December 2018, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that amends regulatory capital rules to provide banks with the option to phase in the day-one effects on regulatory capital that may result from adoption of the new current expected credit losses accounting standard (see the "Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Accounting Changes" section in Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"). Additionally, the agencies finalized amendments to stress testing regulations which delay incorporation of the new accounting standard in stress testing until the 2020 stress test cycle. 

EGRRCPA was enacted on May 24, 2018, and makes limited amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act as well as modifications to other post-crisis regulatory requirements. As a result of EGRRCPA, Regions is no longer subject to company-run stress testing requirements and changes Regions&#8217; supervisory stress testing cycle from annual to biennial. In October 2019, the federal banking agencies finalized rules that would tailor the application of enhanced prudential standards per the EGRRCPA and would assign each institution with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets, as well as its bank subsidiaries, to one of four categories based on its size and five risk-based indicators. Regions is a &#8220;Category IV&#8221; institution. Broader discussion of the impact of EGRRCPA on Regions and Regions Bank is included under the &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; section of the &#8220;Business&#8221; section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

In February 2019, the Federal Reserve provided relief to BHCs with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion, including Regions, in the form of a one-year extension to the requirement to submit a capital plan to the Federal Reserve. Thus, Regions must submit a capital plan to the Federal Reserve by April 6, 2020. In addition, Regions was not subject to the supervisory capital stress testing or the company-run capital stress testing requirements for 2019, but will be subject to supervisory capital stress testing for 2020. However, Regions is still required to maintain a capital plan that is reviewed and approved by Regions&#8217; Board of Directors. Furthermore, while Regions was not required to submit a full capital plan to the Federal Reserve in 2019, the Company was required to submit its planned capital actions for the period between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020. The Federal Reserve announced that for the period from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020, Regions, like other firms granted an extension, was approved to make capital distributions up to the amount that would have allowed the firm to remain above all minimum capital requirements in CCAR 2018, adjusted for any changes in Regions&#8217; regulatory capital ratios since the Federal Reserve acted on Regions&#8217; 2018 capital plan. 

Additional discussion of the Basel III Rules and their applicability to Regions is included in Note 13 "Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions" to the consolidated financial statements. Discussion of the final rule to provide relief for the initial capital decrease at adoption of CECL is included in the &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section and in Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated financial statements. 

LIQUIDITY 

The federal banking agencies have adopted rules implementing Basel III&#8217;s LCR, which is designed to ensure that a covered bank or BHC maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets under an acute 30-day liquidity stress scenario. Under the tailoring rules, Regions has been designated as a Category IV institution and is no longer subject to any LCR requirement. Category IV institutions, including Regions, remain subject to liquidity risk management requirements, but these requirements are now tailored such that collateral positions are calculated only monthly, a more limited set of liquidity risk limits exists, and fewer elements of intraday liquidity risk exposures are monitored. Also, liquidity stress testing is required quarterly rather than monthly, and liquidity data on the FR 2052a is reported on a monthly basis. Regions remains subject to the liquidity buffer requirements. 

Regions maintains a robust liquidity management framework designed to effectively manage liquidity risk in accordance with sound risk management principals. The framework establishes sustainable processes and tools to effectively identify, measure, mitigate, monitor, and report liquidity risks beginning with Regions&#8217; Liquidity Management Policy and the Liquidity Risk Appetite Statements approved by the Board. Processes within the liquidity management framework include, but are not limited to, liquidity 

risk governance, cash management, liquidity stress testing, liquidity risk limits, contingency funding plans, and collateral management. While the framework is designed to comply with liquidity regulations, the processes often go beyond minimum regulatory requirements and are commensurate with Regions&#8217; operating model and risk profile. 

See the &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8212;Liquidity Regulation&#8221; subsection of the &#8220;Business&#8221; section, the "Risk Factors" section and the "Liquidity" section later in this report for more information. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

Regions periodically invests in various limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects, which are funded through a combination of debt and equity. See Note 2 "Variable Interest Entities" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 

Regions' off-balance sheet credit risk includes obligations for loans sold with recourse, unfunded loan commitments, and letters of credit. See Note 7 "Servicing of Financial Assets" and Note 24 "Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 

EFFECTS OF INFLATION 

The majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature; therefore, a financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies, which have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories that are greatly impacted by inflation. While the implications differ for a bank, inflation does have influence on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting level of capitalization. Inflation also affects the level of market interest rates, and therefore, the pricing of financial instruments. 

Management believes the most significant potential impact of inflation on financial results is a direct result of Regions&#8217; ability to manage the impact of changes in interest rates. The Company was modestly asset sensitive as of December 31, 2019 , primarily driven by exposure to middle and long term rates from future fixed-rate business originations. However, recent hedging activity has reduced the exposure to net interest income and other financing income due to changes in interest rates. Forward starting hedges beginning in 2020 and beyond are designed to protect net interest income and other financing income and net interest margin against a continued low interest rate environment. Refer to Table 25 &#8220;Interest Rate Sensitivity&#8221; for additional details on Regions&#8217; interest rate sensitivity. 

EFFECTS OF DEFLATION 

A period of deflation would affect all industries, including financial institutions. Potentially, deflation could lead to lower profits, higher unemployment, lower production and deterioration in overall economic conditions. In addition, deflation could depress economic activity and impair bank earnings through reduced balance sheet growth and less favorable product pricing, as well as impairment in the ability of borrowers to repay loans. 

Management believes the most significant potential impact of deflation on financial results relates to Regions&#8217; ability to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to cushion against future market and credit related losses. However, the Company can utilize certain risk management tools to help it maintain its balance sheet strength even if a deflationary scenario were to develop. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Regions is exposed to various risks as part of the normal course of operations. The exposure to risk requires sound risk management practices that comprise an integrated and comprehensive set of programs and processes that apply to the entire Company. Accordingly, Regions has established a risk management framework to manage risks and provide reasonable assurance of the achievement of the Company&#8217;s strategic objectives. 

The primary risk exposures identified and managed through the Company&#8217;s risk management framework are market risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, operational risk, legal risk, compliance risk, reputational risk and strategic risk. 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Market risk is the risk to the Company&#8217;s financial condition resulting from adverse movements in market rates or prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates or equity prices. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Liquidity risk is the potential that the Company will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding (referred to as "funding liquidity risk") or the potential that the Company cannot easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions (referred to as "market liquidity risk"). 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Credit risk is the risk that arises from the potential that a borrower or counterparty will fail to perform on an obligation. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events. 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Legal risk is the risk that arises from the potential that unenforceable contracts, lawsuits, or adverse judgments can disrupt or otherwise negatively affect the operations or condition of the Company. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Compliance risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules, or regulations, or from non-conformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures, or ethical standards. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Reputational risk is the potential that negative publicity regarding the Company&#8217;s business practices, whether true or not, will cause a decline in the customer base, costly litigation, or revenue reductions. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Strategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience from adverse business decisions, poor implementation of business decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and operating environment. 

##TABLE_END Several of these primary risk exposures are expanded upon further within the remaining sections of Management's Discussion and Analysis. 

Regions&#8217; risk management framework outlines the Company&#8217;s approach for managing risk that includes the following four components: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Collaborative Risk Culture - A strong, collaborative risk culture is fundamental to the Company's core values and operating principles. It ensures focus on risk in all activities and encourages the necessary mindset and behavior to enable effective risk management and promote sound risk-taking within the bounds of the Company&#8217;s risk appetite. The Company's risk culture requires that risks be promptly identified, escalated, and challenged; thereby, benefiting the overall performance of the Company. Sustaining a collaborative risk culture is critical to the Company's success and is a clear expectation of executive management and the Board. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Sound Risk Appetite - The Company's risk appetite statements define the types and levels of risk the Company is willing to take to achieve its objectives. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Sustainable Risk Processes - Effective risk management requires sustainable processes and tools to effectively identify, measure, mitigate, monitor, and report risk. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Responsible Risk Governance - Governance serves as the foundation for comprehensive management of risks facing the Company. It outlines clear responsibility and accountability for managing, monitoring, escalating, and reporting both existing and emerging risks. 

##TABLE_END Clearly defined roles and responsibilities are critical to the effective management of risk and are central to the four components of the Company&#8217;s approach to risk management. Regions utilizes the Three Lines of Defense concept to clearly designate risk management activities within the Company. 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

1st Line of Defense activities provide for the identification, acceptance and ownership of risks. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

2nd Line of Defense activities provide for objective oversight of the Company&#8217;s risk-taking activities and assessment of the Company&#8217;s aggregate risk levels. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

3rd Line of Defense activities provide for independent reviews and assessments of risk management practices across the Company. 

##TABLE_END The Board provides the highest level of risk management governance. The principal risk management functions of the Board are to oversee processes for evaluating the adequacy of internal controls, risk management, financial reporting and compliance with laws and regulations. The Board has designated an Audit Committee of outside directors to focus on oversight of management's establishment and maintenance of appropriate disclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting. See the "Financial Disclosures and Internal Controls" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional information. The Board has also designated a Risk Committee of outside directors to focus on Regions&#8217; overall risk profile. The Risk Committee annually approves an Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement that reflects core business principles and strategic vision by including quantitative limits and qualitative statements that are organized by risk type. This statement is designed to be a high-level document that sets the tone for the Board&#8217;s risk appetite, which is the maximum amount of risk the Company is willing to accept in pursuit of its business objectives. By establishing boundaries around risk taking and business decisions, and by incorporating the needs and goals of its stockholders, regulators, customers and other stakeholders, the Company&#8217;s risk appetite is aligned with its strategic priorities and goals. 

The Risk Management Group, led by the Company&#8217;s Chief Risk Officer, ensures the consistent application of Regions&#8217; risk management approach within the structure of the Company&#8217;s operating, capital and strategic plans. The primary activities of the Risk Management Group include: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Interpreting internal and external signals that point to possible risk issues for the Company; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Identifying risks and determining which Company areas and/or products will be affected; 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Ensuring there are mechanisms in place to specifically determine how risks will affect the Company as a whole and the individual area and or product; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Assisting business groups in analyzing trends and ensuring Company areas have appropriate risk identification and mitigation processes in place; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Reviewing the limits, parameters, policies, and procedures in place to ensure the continued appropriateness of risk controls. 

##TABLE_END As part of its ongoing assessment process, the Risk Management Group makes recommendations to management and the Risk Committee of the Board regarding adjustments to these controls as conditions or risk tolerances change. In addition, the Internal Audit division provides an independent assessment of the Company&#8217;s internal control structure and related systems and processes. 

Management, with the assistance of the Risk Management Group, follows a formal process for identifying, measuring and documenting key risks facing each business group and determining how those risks can be controlled or mitigated, as well as how the controls can be monitored to ensure they are effective. The Risk Committee receives reports from management to ensure operations are within the limits established by the Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement. 

Some of the more significant processes used by management to manage and control risks are described in the remainder of this report. External factors beyond management&#8217;s control may result in losses despite the Risk Management Group&#8217;s efforts. 

MARKET RISK&#8212;INTEREST RATE RISK 

Regions&#8217; primary market risk is interest rate risk. This includes uncertainty with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as relative interest rate levels, which are impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the Company offers. To quantify this risk, Regions measures the change in its net interest income and other financing income in various interest rate scenarios compared to a base case scenario. Net interest income and other financing income sensitivity to market rate movements is a useful short-term indicator of Regions&#8217; interest rate risk. 

Sensitivity Measurement &#8212;Financial simulation models are Regions&#8217; primary tools used to measure interest rate exposure. Using a wide range of sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income and other financing income caused by changes in interest rates. Models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of Regions&#8217; balance sheet. Assumptions are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve, and the changing composition of the balance sheet that results from both strategic plans and from customer behavior. Among the assumptions are expectations of balance sheet growth and composition, the pricing and maturity characteristics of existing business and the characteristics of future business. Interest rate-related risks are expressly considered, such as pricing spreads, the pricing of deposit accounts, prepayments and other option risks. Regions considers these factors, as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty surrounding their future behavior. 

The primary objective of asset/liability management at Regions is to coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to sustain reasonable and stable net interest income and other financing income throughout various interest rate cycles. In computing interest rate sensitivity for measurement, Regions compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using &#8220;market forward rates.&#8221; The standard set of interest rate scenarios includes the traditional instantaneous parallel rate shifts of plus 100 and 200 basis points. Given low market rates by historical standards, the Company presents varying magnitudes of down rate shock scenarios based on historical yield curve minimums as explained in the following section. In addition to parallel curve shifts, multiple curve steepening and flattening scenarios are contemplated. Regions includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements phased in over a six-month period that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate movements. 

Exposure to Interest Rate Movements&#8212; As of December 31, 2019 , Regions was modestly asset sensitive to both gradual and instantaneous parallel yield curve shifts as compared to the base case for the measurement horizon ending December 2020 . The estimated exposure associated with falling rate scenarios in the table below reflects the combined impacts of movements in short-term and long-term interest rates. The decline in short-term interest rates (such as the Fed Funds rate, the rate of Interest on Excess Reserves and 1 month LIBOR) will lead to a reduction of yield on assets and liabilities contractually tied to such rates. Deposit and other funding costs are currently low when compared to historical levels. Therefore, it is expected that declines in funding costs will only partially offset the decline in asset yields. A reduction in intermediate and long-term interest rates (such as intermediate to longer-term U.S. Treasuries, swap and mortgage rates) will drive yields lower on certain fixed rate, newly originated or renewed loans, reduce prospective yields on certain investment portfolio purchases, and increase amortization of premium expense on existing securities in the investment portfolio. 

The table below summarizes Regions' positioning in various parallel yield curve shifts (i.e., including all yield curve tenors). The scenarios are inclusive of all interest rate risk hedging activities. Forward starting hedges that have been transacted are 

contemplated to the extent they start within the measurement horizon. These forward starting hedging relationships, which primarily begin in early 2020, are being used to protect net interest income and other financing income as the macroeconomic cycle continues to evolve. Twelve-month horizon asset sensitivity levels declined throughout 2019 as forward starting hedges moved into the measurement window. Sensitivity levels are expected to continue to diminish in 2020 as additional forward starting hedges begin. More information regarding forward starting hedges is disclosed in Table 26 and its accompanying description.

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START (1) 

Disclosed interest rate sensitivity levels represent the 12 month forward looking net interest income and other financing income changes as compared to market forward rate cases and include expected balance sheet growth and remixing. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) 

Forward starting cash flow hedges already transacted will reduce sensitivity levels through 2020 as they continue to move into the measurement horizon (see Table 27 for additional information regarding hedge start dates). 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) 

Estimates for a gradual parallel yield curve shift of minus 100 basis points, with long-term yield curve levels floored at approximately 1% as discussed below, inclusive of forward starting cash flow hedges already transacted, would be a decrease to 12 month net interest income and other financing income of less than one percent by year-end 2020. 

##TABLE_END As market interest rates have increased in recent years, larger magnitude falling rate shock scenarios have become possible, although the probability of such a movement is currently low. Regions has established scenarios by which yield curve tenors will fall to a consistent level. The shock magnitude for each tenor, when compared to market forward rates, equates to the lesser of the shock scenario amount, or a rate 35 basis points lower than the historical all-time minimum. For example, the 10 year Treasury yield is floored at approximately 1.0%. Use of this steepening scenario provides a sufficiently punitive rate environment, while maintaining a higher level of reasonableness. The falling rate scenarios in Table 25 above quantify the expected impact for both gradual and instantaneous shocks under this environment. 

As discussed above, the interest rate sensitivity analysis presented in Table 25 is informed by a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding the progression of the balance sheet in both the baseline scenario as well as the scenarios of instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve. Though there are many assumptions which affect the estimates for net interest income and other financing income, those pertaining to deposit pricing, deposit mix and overall balance sheet composition are particularly impactful. Given the uncertainties associated with the prolonged period of low interest rates, management evaluates the impact to its sensitivity analysis of these key assumptions. Sensitivity calculations are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future results. 

The Company&#8217;s baseline balance sheet assumptions include moderate loan and deposit growth reflecting management's best estimate. The behavior of deposits in response to changes in interest rate levels is largely informed by analyses of prior rate cycles, but with suitable adjustments based on management&#8217;s expectations in the current rate environment. In the -100 basis point gradual interest rate change scenario in Table 25, the interest-bearing deposit re-pricing sensitivity over the 12 month horizon is expected to be approximately 30 percent of changes in short-term market rates (e.g., Fed Funds). A 5 percentage point lower sensitivity than the baseline assumption would decrease 12 month net interest income and other financing income in the gradual -100 basis points scenario by approximately $23 million when compared to the unadjusted scenario. While the estimates should be used as a guide, differences may result driven by the pace of rate changes, and other market and competitive factors. 

In rising rate scenarios only, management assumes that the mix of deposits will change versus the baseline balance sheet growth assumptions as informed by analyses of prior rate cycles. Management assumes that in rising rate scenarios, some shift from non-interest bearing to interest-bearing products will occur. The magnitude of the shift is rate dependent and equates to approximately $1.5 billion over 12 months in the gradual +100 basis point scenario in Table 25. In the event this shift increased 

by an additional $1.5 billion over 12 months, the result would be a reduction of 12 month net interest income and other financing income in the gradual +100 basis points scenario by approximately $10 million. 

Interest rate movements may also have an impact on the value of Regions&#8217; securities portfolio, which can directly impact the carrying value of stockholders&#8217; equity. Regions from time to time may hedge these price movements with derivatives (as discussed below). 

Derivatives &#8212;Regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of interest rate sensitivity. ALCO, which consists of members of Regions&#8217; senior management team, in its oversight role for the management of interest rate sensitivity, approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging strategies. Derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with customer derivatives, which include interest rate, credit and foreign exchange risks. The most common derivatives Regions employs are forward rate contracts, Eurodollar futures contracts, interest rate swaps, options on interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and forward sale commitments. 

Forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at a future date at a specified price or yield. A Eurodollar futures contract is a future on a Eurodollar deposit. Eurodollar futures contracts subject Regions to market risk associated with changes in interest rates. Because futures contracts are cash settled daily, there is minimal credit risk associated with Eurodollar futures. Interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically entered into to exchange fixed for variable (or vice versa) streams of interest payments. The notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a reference for the size of interest settlements. Interest rate options are contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a predetermined price and time. Forward sale commitments are contractual obligations to sell market instruments at a future date for an already agreed-upon price. Foreign currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency for another on a specified date and at a specified rate. These contracts are executed on behalf of the Company's customers and are used by customers to manage fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The Company is subject to the credit risk that another party will fail to perform. 

Regions has made use of interest rate swaps and floors in balance sheet hedging strategies to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-rate funding position and available for sale securities portfolios to a variable-rate position and to effectively convert a portion of its variable-rate loan portfolios to fixed-rate. Regions also uses derivatives to economically manage interest rate and pricing risk associated with its mortgage origination business. In the period of time that elapses between the origination and sale of mortgage loans, changes in interest rates have the potential to cause a decline in the value of the loans in this held-for-sale portfolio. Futures contracts and forward sale commitments are used to protect the value of the loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in interest rates and pricing.

Regions manages the credit risk of these instruments in much the same way as it manages credit risk of the loan portfolios by establishing credit limits for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer transactions. For non-dealer transactions, the need for collateral is evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the financial strength of the counterparty. Credit risk is also reduced significantly by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements. When there is more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a legally enforceable master netting agreement in place, the exposure represents the net of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from and/or posted to that counterparty. All hedging interest rate swap derivatives traded by Regions are subject to mandatory clearing. The counterparty risk for cleared trades effectively moves from the executing broker to the clearinghouse allowing Regions to benefit from the risk mitigation controls in place at the respective clearinghouse. The &#8220;Credit Risk&#8221; section in this report contains more information on the management of credit risk. 

Regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers. Interest rate swaps, interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most common derivatives sold to customers. Other derivative instruments with similar characteristics are used to hedge market risk and minimize volatility associated with this portfolio. Instruments used to service customers are held in the trading account, with changes in value recorded in the consolidated statements of income. 

The primary objective of Regions&#8217; hedging strategies is to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes, from an economic perspective, on net interest income and other financing income and the net present value of its balance sheet. The overall effectiveness of these hedging strategies is subject to market conditions, the quality of Regions&#8217; execution, the accuracy of its valuation assumptions, counterparty credit risk and changes in interest rates. See Note 21 "Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities" to the consolidated financial statements for a tabular summary of Regions&#8217; year-end derivatives positions and further discussion. 

Regions accounts for residential MSRs at fair market value with any changes to fair value being recorded within mortgage income. Regions enters into derivative transactions to economically mitigate the impact of market value fluctuations related to residential MSRs. Derivative instruments entered into in the future could be materially different from the current risk profile of Regions&#8217; current portfolio. 

LIBOR Transition - In 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that by the end of 2021 panel banks will no longer be required to submit estimates that are used to construct LIBOR, confirming that the continuation of LIBOR will not be guaranteed beyond that date. Regions holds instruments that may be impacted by the likely discontinuance of LIBOR, including loans, investments, hedging products, floating-rate obligations and other financial instruments that use LIBOR as a benchmark rate. The Company cannot currently predict the full impact of the LIBOR discontinuation on net interest income and other financing income or the related processes. However, Regions is coordinating with regulators and industry groups to identify appropriate alternative rates for contracts expiring after 2021, as well as preparing for this transition as it relates to both new and existing exposures. The Company has established a LIBOR Transition Program, which includes dedicated leadership and staff with all relevant business lines and support groups engaged. A LIBOR impact risk assessment has been performed, which 

identified the associated risks across products, systems, models, and processes. Plans to mitigate risks associated with the transition are being overseen by Regions&#8217; LIBOR Steering Committee as part of the LIBOR Transition Program. Continuing activities of the LIBOR Transition Program include facilitating the transition of all financial and strategic processes, systems and models; performing assessments of the transition impact to contracts and products; evaluating necessary operational and infrastructure enhancements upon implementation of alternative benchmark rates; and coordinating communications with customers. 

MARKET RISK&#8212;PREPAYMENT RISK 

Regions, like most financial institutions, is subject to changing prepayment speeds on mortgage-related assets under different interest rate environments. Prepayment risk is a significant risk to earnings and specifically to net interest income and other financing income. For example, mortgage loans and other financial assets may be prepaid by a debtor, so that the debtor may refinance its obligations at lower rates. As loans and other financial assets prepay in a falling rate environment, Regions must reinvest these funds in lower-yielding assets. Prepayments of assets carrying higher rates reduce Regions&#8217; interest income and overall asset yields. Conversely, in a rising rate environment, these assets will prepay at a slower rate, resulting in opportunity cost by not having the cash flow to reinvest at higher rates. Prepayment risk can also impact the value of securities and the carrying value of equity. Regions&#8217; greatest exposures to prepayment risks primarily rest in its mortgage-backed securities portfolio, the mortgage fixed-rate loan portfolio and the residential MSR, all of which tend to be sensitive to interest rate movements. Each of these assets is also exposed to prepayment risk due to factors which are not necessarily the result of interest rates, but rather due to changes in policies or programs related, either directly or indirectly, to the U.S. Government's governance over certain lending and financing within the mortgage market. Such policies can work to either encourage or discourage financing dynamics and represent a risk that is extremely difficult to forecast and may be the result of non-economic factors. The Company attempts to monitor and manage such exposures within reasonable expectations while acknowledging all such risks cannot be foreseen or avoided. Further, Regions has prepayment risk that would be reflected in non-interest income in the form of servicing income on the residential MSR. Regions actively monitors prepayment exposure as part of its overall net interest income and other financing income forecasting and interest rate risk management. 

LIQUIDITY 

Liquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of Regions and affects Regions&#8217; ability to meet the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of its customers. 

Regions intends to fund its obligations primarily through cash generated from normal operations. Regions also has obligations related to potential litigation contingencies. See Note 24 "Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees" to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the Company&#8217;s funding requirements. 

Assets, consisting principally of loans and securities, are funded by customer deposits, borrowed funds and stockholders&#8217; equity. Regions&#8217; goal in liquidity management is to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, while at the same time meeting the Company&#8217;s cash flow needs in normal and stressed conditions. Having and using various sources of liquidity to satisfy the Company&#8217;s funding requirements is important. 

In order to ensure an appropriate level of liquidity is maintained, Regions performs specific procedures including scenario analyses and stress testing at the bank, holding company, and affiliate levels. Regions' liquidity policy requires the holding company to maintain cash sufficient to cover the greater of (1) 18 months of debt service and other cash needs or (2) a minimum cash balance of $500 million. Cash and cash equivalents at the holding company totaled $ 1.9 billion at December 31, 2019 . Compliance with the holding company cash requirements is reported to the Risk Committee of the Board on a quarterly basis. Regions also has minimum liquidity requirements for the Bank and subsidiaries. These minimum requirements are informed by internal stress testing measures which are reflective of Regions' portfolio and business mix. The Bank's funding and contingency planning does not currently assume any reliance on short-term unsecured sources. Risk limits are established by the Board through its Risk Appetite Statement and Liquidity Policy. The Company's Board, LROC and ALCO regularly review compliance with the established limits. 

The securities portfolio is one of Regions&#8217; primary sources of liquidity. Proceeds from maturities and principal and interest payments of securities provide a constant flow of funds available for cash needs (see Note 4 "Debt Securities" to the consolidated financial statements). The agency guaranteed mortgage-backed securities portfolio is another source of liquidity in various secured borrowing capacities. 

Maturities in the loan portfolio also provide a steady flow of funds. Regions&#8217; liquidity is further enhanced by its relatively stable customer deposit base. Liquidity needs can also be met by borrowing funds in state and national money markets, although Regions does not assume reliance on short-term unsecured sources of funding. 

The balance with the FRB is the primary component of the balance sheet line item, &#8220;interest-bearing deposits in other banks.&#8221; At December 31, 2019 , Regions had approximately $2.5 billion in cash on deposit with the FRB, an increase from approximately $1.5 billion at December 31, 2018. The average balance held with the FRB was approximately $666 million and $1.3 billion during 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Refer to the "Cash and Cash Equivalents" section for more information. 

Regions&#8217; borrowing availability with the FRB as of December 31, 2019 , based on assets pledged as collateral on that date, was $16.9 billion . 

Regions&#8217; financing arrangement with the FHLB adds additional flexibility in managing the Company's liquidity position. As of December 31, 2019 , Regions&#8217; outstanding balance of FHLB borrowings was $4.6 billion and its total borrowing capacity from the FHLB totaled approximately $17.5 billion . FHLB borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral pledged to the FHLB. Regions Bank pledged certain securities, commercial and real estate mortgage loans, residential first mortgage loans on one-to-four family dwellings and home equity lines of credit as collateral for the outstanding FHLB advances. Additionally, investment in FHLB stock is required in relation to the level of outstanding borrowings. Refer to Note 8 "Other Earning Assets" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The FHLB has been and is expected to continue to be a reliable and economical source of funding. 

Regions maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC that can be utilized by Regions to issue various debt and/or equity securities. Additionally, Regions' Board has authorized Regions Bank to issue up to $10 billion in aggregate principal amount of bank notes outstanding at any one time. Refer to Note 12 "Borrowings" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

Regions may, from time to time, consider opportunistically retiring outstanding issued securities, including subordinated debt in privately negotiated or open market transactions for cash or common shares. Regulatory approval would be required for retirement of some instruments.

CREDIT RISK 

Regions&#8217; objective regarding credit risk is to maintain a credit portfolio that provides for stable credit costs with acceptable volatility through an economic cycle. Regions has various processes to manage credit risk as described below. In order to assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio, Regions considers risk factors within the loan portfolio segments and classes, the current U.S. economic environment and that of its primary banking markets, as well as counterparty risk. See the "Portfolio Characteristics" section found earlier in this report for further information regarding the risk characteristics of each loan type. See further discussion of the current U.S. economic environment and counterparty risk below. 

Management Process 

Credit risk is managed by maintaining a sound credit risk culture, throughout all lines of defense, which ensures that the levels and types of risk taken are aligned with Regions' credit risk appetite. The credit quality of borrowers and counterparties has a significant impact on Regions' earnings; however, the nature of the risk differs by each of the defined businesses which engage in multiple forms of commercial, investor real estate and consumer lending. Regions categorizes the credit risks it faces by asset quality, counterparty exposure, and diversification levels which provides a structure to assess credit risk and guides credit decision-making. Credit policies, another key component of Regions' culture, are designed and adjusted, as needed, to promote sound credit risk management. These policies guide lending activities in a manner consistent with Regions' strategy and provide a framework for achieving asset quality and earnings objectives. 

Effective credit risk management requires coordinated identification, measurement, mitigation, monitoring and reporting of credit risk exposure, credit quality, and emerging risk trends. Accordingly, Regions has implemented a credit risk governance structure that provides oversight from the Board to the organizational units in order to maintain open channels of communication. 

Occasionally, borrowers and counterparties do not fulfill their obligations and Regions must take steps to mitigate and manage losses. Teams are in place to appropriately identify and manage nonperforming loans, collections, loan modifications, and loss mitigation efforts. Regions maintains an allowance for credit losses that management considers adequate to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio. 

For a discussion of the process and methodology used to calculate the allowance for credit losses refer to the &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates and Related Policies&#8221; section found earlier in this report, and Note 1 &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; and Note 6 "Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements. Details regarding the allowance for credit losses, including an analysis of activity from the previous year&#8217;s total, are included in Table 15 &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses.&#8221; Also, refer to Table 16 &#8220;Allocation of the Allowance for Loan Losses&#8221; for details pertaining to management&#8217;s allocation of the allowance for loan losses to each loan category. 

Responsibility and accountability for effectively managing all risks, including credit risk, in the various business units lies with the first line of defense. Risk Management, in the second line of defense, oversees, assesses and effectively challenges the risk-taking activities of the first line of defense. Finally, Credit Risk Review provides ongoing oversight, as a third line of defense function, of the credit portfolios to ensure Regions&#8217; activities, and controls, are appropriate for the size, complexity and risk profile of the Company. 

Economic Environment in Regions&#8217; Banking Markets 

One of the primary factors influencing the credit performance of Regions&#8217; loan portfolio is the overall economic environment in the U.S. and the primary markets in which it operates. Regions forecasts real GDP growth of approximately 2.0 percent in 2020, with consumer spending and government spending the main drivers with some support from residential construction. 

Household balance sheets continue to improve, with sustained house price appreciation augmenting increases in equity prices to fuel rising household net worth. Though the level of household debt has continued to climb, the rate of growth of household debt remains below the average growth rates seen over past cycles. Moreover, household debt-to-income ratios remain significantly lower than was the case prior to the 2007-2009 recession, and continued low interest rates have left monthly household debt service burdens hovering near historical lows. Further improvement in labor market conditions in 2020 will sustain faster wage growth, which in turn will sustain growth in disposable personal income. Wage growth has increased across all industry groups and for workers of all skill levels. Healthy labor market conditions are sustaining elevated consumer confidence. For these reasons, Regions expects consumer spending will remain the primary driver of economic growth in 2020. 

Residential fixed investment made a modest positive contribution to real GDP growth over the second half of 2019, ending a multi-year period in which residential fixed investment was a persistent drag on top-line growth, aided by materially lower mortgage interest rates. Still, Regions&#8217; view remains that supply side constraints continue to limit both new single family construction and sales of new and existing single family homes. Thus, while single family housing starts and new single family home sales are expected to rise further in 2020, ongoing supply side constraints result in the magnitude of these increases being smaller than would otherwise have been the case. Nonetheless, we anticipate residential fixed investment making a positive contribution to top-line real GDP growth for 2020 as a whole. 

Business investment spending softened over the course of 2019. Weaker global economic growth, lingering uncertainty over the course of trade policy, and weakening business sentiment posed stiff headwinds for business investment spending. This was part of the malaise in the broader manufacturing sector that manifested in the ISM Manufacturing Index dipping below the 50.0 percent break between contraction and expansion and a string of declines in manufacturing output as measured in the data on industrial production. As 2019 wound to a close, however, there were signs that the headwinds confronting the manufacturing sector were abating. Global economic growth was stabilizing, and progress had been made on the trade front, both encouraging signs. On the whole, then, while it is unlikely that 2020 will see robust growth in business investment spending, neither is business investment spending likely to extend the contraction seen over the second half of 2019. 

As measured by the PCE Deflator, the FOMC&#8217;s preferred gauge of inflation, both headline and core inflation decelerated 

in 2019. One factor behind the deceleration in core inflation is that consumers ended up bearing little of the burden of tariffs imposed on goods imported into the U.S. With the U.S. and China having agreed to a &#8220;Round 1&#8221; trade deal, tariffs pose less of an inflationary threat in 2020. It is expected that services prices will rise at a faster pace in 2020, as service providers generally have greater latitude to pass along faster growth in labor costs to consumers in the form of higher prices. Even so, Regions' baseline forecast does not have core PCE inflation pushing above the FOMC&#8217;s 2.0 percent target rate until the fourth quarter of 2020, and even if that does happen sooner, FOMC members have strongly suggested that they are willing to tolerate inflation running ahead of their target rate for an extended period. As such, inflation is unlikely to be a major concern for the FOMC in 2020. 

Inflation pressures have remained somewhat muted, which has given the FOMC the latitude to pause from the string of rate cuts delivered in 2019. Though delivering the third 25-basis point Fed funds rate cut of 2019 at their October meeting, the FOMC also signaled that no further cuts were expected as long as economic growth and inflation evolve as they anticipate, signaling modest growth with inflation pressures remaining muted. Market participants are comfortable with this shift. The &#8220;dot plot&#8221; released in conjunction with the December 2019 FOMC meeting implies no further Fed funds rate cuts in 2020. Still, with the risks to the growth outlook remaining tilted to the downside, it is reasonable to assume the FOMC&#8217;s next move will be a rate cut rather than a rate hike. The bar for any changes in the Fed funds rate is set high, but the bar for a rate hike is set considerably higher than is the bar for a rate cut. 

For the Regions footprint as a whole, rates of job, income, and overall economic growth have been and are expected to remain broadly consistent with those seen nationally. There are, however, differences in rates of growth among the individual states and metropolitan areas across the footprint. Those markets which are larger and more economically diverse and boast more favorable demographic trends have been and are expected to remain among the better performing markets within Regions' footprint. Job growth remained solid and notably broad based across major industry groups in 2019. Still, while manufacturing and agriculture stand to benefit from the easing of trade tensions, they also are at risk should trade tensions again escalate in 2020. On balance, however, continued job growth is expected to keep downward pressure on unemployment rates across the footprint in 2020. 

In summation, real GDP growth is expected to be around 2.0 percent in 2020, with consumer spending and government spending the main drivers of growth, with support from residential fixed investment, while business investment remains a soft spot. Global economic growth is expected to stabilize, if not firm slightly, in 2020 which, along with the recent easing of trade tensions, should allow for at least modest growth in U.S. exports. With stable growth and muted inflation pressures, the FOMC is expected to remain on hold through 2020. There remains room for trade disputes to escalate in 2020, which poses a downside risk to Regions&#8217; baseline outlook. While uncertainty over the outcome of the 2020 elections could weigh on economic decisions, any such election-related uncertainty would likely be more impactful over the latter part of 2020. The Company also can anticipate downside risks stemming from the high degree of leverage on corporate balance sheets, though this poses a more pronounced risk to the outlook in 2021 than in 2020. Upside risks include elevated consumer confidence and solid growth in disposable income leading to faster growth in consumer spending than the baseline forecast anticipates, and the possibility that productivity growth accelerates to a greater extent than anticipated, thus facilitating a faster pace of real GDP growth despite more pressing labor supply constraints. 

Counterparty Risk 

Counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction or contract could be unable or unwilling to fulfill its contractual or legal obligations. Exposure may be to a financial institution (such as a commercial bank, an insurance company, a broker dealer, etc.) or a corporate client. 

Regions has a centralized approach to approval, management, and monitoring of counterparty exposure. The Counterparty Risk Management Group is responsible for the independent credit risk management of financial institution counterparties and their affiliates. Market Risk Management is responsible for the measurement and stress testing of counterparty exposures. The Corporate and Commercial Credit groups are responsible for the independent credit risk management of client side counterparties. 

Financial institution exposure may result from a variety of transaction types generated in one or more departments of the Company. Aggregate exposure limits are established to manage the exposure generated by various areas of the Company. Counterparty client credit risk arises when Regions sells a risk management product to hedge risks in the client&#8217;s business. Exposures to counterparties are aggregated across departments and regularly reported to senior management. 

INFORMATION SECURITY RISK 

Regions faces a variety of operational risks, including information security risks. Information security risks, such as evolving and adaptive cyber attacks that are conducted regularly against Regions and other large financial institutions to compromise or disable information systems, have generally increased in recent years. This trend is expected to continue for a number of reasons, including the proliferation of new technologies, including technology-based products and services used by us and our customers, the increasing use of mobile devices and cloud technologies, the ability to conduct more financial transactions online, and the increasing sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external parties or fraud on the part of employees. 

Regions devotes significant financial and non-financial resources to identify and mitigate threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of its information systems. Regions regularly assesses the threats and vulnerabilities to its environment so it can update and maintain its systems and controls to effectively mitigate these risks. Layered security controls are designed to complement each other to protect customer information and transactions. Regions regularly tests its control environment utilizing practices such as penetration testing and more targeted assessments to ensure its controls are working as expected. Regions will continue to commit the resources necessary to mitigate these growing cyber risks, as well as continue to develop and enhance controls, processes and technology to respond to evolving disruptive technology and to protect its systems from attacks or unauthorized access. In addition, Regions maintains a strong commitment to a comprehensive risk management program that includes due diligence and oversight of third-party relationships with vendors. 

Regions&#8217; system of internal controls also incorporates an organization-wide protocol for the appropriate reporting and escalation of information security matters to management and the Board, to ensure effective and efficient resolution and, if necessary, disclosure of any matters. The Board is actively engaged in the oversight of Regions&#8217; continuous efforts to reinforce and enhance its operational resilience and receives education to ensure that their oversight efforts accommodate for the ever-evolving information security threat landscape. The Board monitors Regions&#8217; information management risk policies and practices primarily through its Risk Committee, which oversees areas of operational risk such as information technology activities; risks associated with development, infrastructure, and cybersecurity; approval and oversight of internal and third-party information security risk assessments, strategies, policies and programs; and disaster recovery, business continuity, and incident response plans. Additionally, the Board&#8217;s Audit Committee regularly reviews Regions&#8217; cybersecurity practices, mainly by receiving reports on the cybersecurity management program prepared by the Chief Information Security Officer, risk management, and Internal Audit. The Board annually reviews the information security program and, through its various committees, is briefed at least quarterly on information security matters. 

Regions participates in information sharing organizations such as FS-ISAC, to gather and share information with peer banks and other financial institutions to better prepare and protect its information systems from attack. FS-ISAC is a nonprofit organization whose objective is to protect the financial services sector against cyber and physical threats and risk. It acts as a trusted third party that provides anonymity to allow members to submit threat, vulnerability and incident information in a non-attributable and trusted manner so information that would normally not be shared is instead made available to other members for the greater good of the membership. In addition to FS-ISAC, Regions is a member of BITS. BITS serves the financial community and its members by providing industry best practices on a variety of security and fraud topics. 

Regions has contracts with vendors to provide denial of service mitigation. These vendors have also committed the necessary resources to support Regions in the event of a cyber event. Even though Regions devotes significant resources to combat cyber security risks, there is no guarantee that these measures will provide absolute security. As an additional security measure, Regions has engaged a computer forensics firm and an industry-leading consulting firm on retainer in case of a cyber event. Regions has also developed and maintains robust business continuity and disaster recovery plans that it could implement in the event of a cyber event so as to mitigate the effects of any such event and minimize necessary recovery time. Some of Regions' financial risk exposure with respect to data breaches may be offset by applicable insurance. 

Even if Regions successfully prevents cyber attacks to its own network, the Company may still incur losses that result from customers' account information being obtained through breaches of retailers' networks where customers have transacted business. The fraud losses, as well as the costs of investigations and re-issuing new customer cards, may impact Regions' financial results. In addition, Regions also relies on some vendors to provide certain components of its business infrastructure, and although Regions actively assesses and monitors the information security capabilities of these vendors, Regions' reliance on them may also increase exposure to information security risk. 

In the event of a cyber-attack or other data breach, Regions may be required to incur significant expenses, including with respect to remediation costs, costs of implementing additional preventative measures, addressing any reputational harm and addressing any related regulatory inquiries or civil litigation arising from the event. 

FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE AND INTERNAL CONTROLS 

Regions maintains internal controls over financial reporting, which generally include those controls relating to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Regions&#8217; process for evaluating internal controls over financial reporting starts with understanding the risks facing each of its functions and areas, how those risks are controlled or mitigated, and how management monitors those controls to ensure that they are in place and effective. These risks, control procedures and monitoring tools are documented in a standard format. This format not only documents the internal control structures over all significant accounts, but also places responsibility on management for establishing feedback mechanisms to ensure that controls are effective. 

Regions also has processes to ensure appropriate disclosure controls and procedures are maintained. These controls and procedures as defined by the SEC are generally designed to ensure that financial and non-financial information required to be 

disclosed in reports filed with the SEC is reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms, and that such information is communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Regions&#8217; Disclosure Review Committee, which includes representatives from the legal, tax, finance, risk management, accounting, investor relations, and treasury departments, meets quarterly to review recent internal and external events to determine whether all appropriate disclosures have been made in reports filed with the SEC. In addition, the CEO and CFO meet quarterly with the SEC Filings Review Committee, which includes senior representatives from accounting, legal, risk management, treasury, and the business groups. The SEC Filings Review Committee provides a forum in which senior executives disclose to the CEO and CFO any known significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in Regions&#8217; internal controls over financial reporting, and provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements and other contents of the Company&#8217;s Form 10-K and 10-Q filings are accurate, complete and timely. As part of this process, certifications of internal control effectiveness are obtained from Regions&#8217; associates who are responsible for maintaining and monitoring effective internal controls over financial reporting. These certifications are reviewed and presented to the CEO and CFO as support of the Company&#8217;s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting. The Form 10-K is presented to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors for approval, and the Forms 10-Q are reviewed by the Audit Committee. Financial results and other financial information are also reviewed with the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis. 

As required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the CEO and the CFO review and make certifications regarding the accuracy of Regions&#8217; periodic public reports filed with the SEC, as well as the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. With the assistance of the financial review committees noted in the previous paragraph, Regions continually assesses and monitors disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, and makes refinements as necessary.
