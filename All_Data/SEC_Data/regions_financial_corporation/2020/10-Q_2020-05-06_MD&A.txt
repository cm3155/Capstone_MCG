CORPORATE PROFILE 

Regions is a financial holding company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, that operates in the South, Midwest and Texas. Regions provides traditional commercial, retail and mortgage banking services, as well as other financial services in the fields of asset management, wealth management, securities brokerage, trust services, merger and acquisition advisory services and other specialty financing. 

Regions conducts its banking operations through Regions Bank, an Alabama state-chartered commercial bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System. At March 31, 2020 , Regions operated 1,427 total branch outlets. Regions carries out its strategies and derives its profitability from three reportable business segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management, with the remainder in Other. See Note 10 "Business Segment Information" to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding Regions&#8217; segment reporting structure. 

On May 31, 2019, Regions entered into an agreement to acquire Highland Associates, Inc., an institutional investment firm based in Birmingham, Alabama. The transaction closed on August 1, 2019. 

On February 27, 2020, Regions entered into an agreement to acquire Ascentium Capital LLC, an independent equipment financing company headquartered in Kingwood, Texas. The transaction closed on April 1, 2020, and includes approximately $2 billion in loans and leases to small businesses. 

Regions&#8217; profitability, like that of many other financial institutions, is dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income as well as non-interest income sources. Net interest income is primarily the difference between the interest income Regions receives on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest expense Regions pays on interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Regions&#8217; net interest income is impacted by the size and mix of its balance sheet components and the interest rate spread between interest earned on its assets and interest paid on its liabilities. Non-interest income includes fees from service charges on deposit accounts, card and ATM fees, mortgage servicing and secondary marketing, investment management and trust activities, capital markets and other customer services which Regions provides. Results of operations are also affected by the provision for credit losses and non-interest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, professional, legal and regulatory expenses, FDIC insurance assessments, and other operating expenses, as well as income taxes. 

Economic conditions, competition, new legislation and related rules impacting regulation of the financial services industry and the monetary and fiscal policies of the Federal government significantly affect most, if not all, financial institutions, including Regions. Lending and deposit activities and fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and investment, consumer income, consumer spending and savings, capital market activities, and competition among financial institutions, as well as customer preferences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing products in Regions&#8217; market areas. 

Regions&#8217; business strategy is focused on providing a competitive mix of products and services, delivering quality customer service, and continuing to develop and optimize distribution channels that include a branch distribution network with offices in convenient locations, as well as electronic and mobile banking. 

FIRST QUARTER OVERVIEW 

Economic Environment in Regions&#8217; Banking Markets 

One of the primary factors influencing the credit performance of Regions&#8217; loan portfolio is the overall economic environment in the U.S. and the primary markets in which it operates. The COVID-19 pandemic and the efforts to stem its spread have led to a sudden, violent contraction in economic activity. As the second quarter of 2020 began, expectations regarding the economic environment continued to develop and change. As the second quarter of 2020 unfolds, Regions currently expects a significant contraction in real GDP over the first half of 2020 followed by a recovery beginning in the third quarter. For full-year 2020, real GDP is expected to contract by 5.4 percent and to grow by 2.6 percent in 2021. 

With shelter in place orders and mandated closings of &#8220;non-essential" businesses spreading across the U.S. during March and early April, there were sharp and rapid declines in consumer spending on services, including travel, tourism, lodging, restaurants, and cultural and sporting events, with firms in consumer facing services industries quickly placing workers on furlough. As spending on services accounts for roughly 70 percent of all consumer spending, the effects on the broader economy were both rapid and severe. The industrial sector of the economy followed, with manufacturing activity largely having shut down. 

Over the four week period covering the second half of March and the first half of April, over 20 million Americans filed claims for unemployment insurance, and the unemployment rate is expected to peak at over 15 percent. With shelter in place orders and shutdowns of &#8220;non-essential&#8221; businesses likely to extend into May or beyond, it is likely that economic activity will not normalize to a meaningful degree until the third quarter of 2020, though this is contingent on the degree of progress made in stemming the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. There has been an unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy response to the sharp and sudden economic downturn. The aim of policy is to preserve as much of the basic economic infrastructure as possible, but the longer the mandated shutdowns persist, the greater the likelihood additional policy measures will be needed. 

There is, however, a considerable degree of uncertainty regarding the economy, as the health outcomes cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. At present, the most likely outcome is that the normalization of economic activity will be gradual, with differences in timing across geographies and, by extension, across industries. While the rate of real GDP growth in the initial quarter of recovery may imply a rapid recovery, GDP growth is reported in annualized terms, exaggerating quarter-to-quarter changes. It is more instructive to look at the path of the level of real GDP when assessing the speed of the recovery. For instance, the April 2020 baseline forecast anticipates that it will be 10 to 12 quarters before the level of real GDP returns to the fourth quarter 2019 level (the last actual observation available). 

The effects within the Regions footprint will be broadly similar to those seen in the U.S. as a whole. Florida&#8217;s economy has an above-average exposure to leisure and hospitality services, while Texas and Louisiana have above-average exposure to energy, so these economies could be more prone to lasting effects if the recovery does prove to be more gradual. 

The continued economic downturn and uncertainty, as described above, differs from the R&#38;S forecast utilized to record the allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2020 and is expected to impact factors used in estimating the allowance in future periods, perhaps materially. See the "Allowance" section for further information. 

COVID-19 Pandemic 

Regions' business operations and financial results are influenced by the economic environment in which the Company operates. The adverse economic conditions and uncertainty in the economic outlook as of March 31, 2020 driven by the COVID-19 pandemic impacted first quarter 2020 financial results in the areas as described below. Regions expects that the pandemic will continue to influence economic conditions and the Company's financial results in future quarters. 

The initial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in mid-March 2020 were manifested in how Regions altered operations in the branches, such as limiting in-person branch activity to drive-through and converting in-office services to appointment only. As of April 30, 2020, Regions has been able keep approximately 98 percent of branches open. The safety of Regions' associates was also of utmost priority. As of April 30, 2020, approximately 90 percent of the Company's non-branch associates are working remotely. 

Late in the first quarter of 2020, the Company began offering special financial assistance to support customers who were experiencing financial hardships related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This assistance included offering customer payment deferrals for existing loans. As of May 4, 2020, Regions had processed approximately 16,000 consumer payment deferral requests totaling $1.7 billion, including approximately 5,300 related to residential mortgages totaling approximately $1.4 billion. In addition, payment deferral requests for approximately 17,200 mortgage loans serviced for others have been processed totaling approximately $2.9 billion. Regions has also processed approximately 14,400 requests for business customers totaling approximately $3.7 billion. As provided in the CARES Act passed into law on March 27, 2020, certain loan modifications related to COVID-19 beginning March 1, 2020 through the earlier of 60 days after the national emergency concerning the COVID-19 outbreak ends or December 31, 2020 are eligible for relief from TDR classification. Refer to Table 10 "Troubled Debt Restructurings" for further information. 

As mentioned above, the CARES Act was signed into law as a response to the economic uncertainty amid the COVID-19 pandemic. A focus of the Act is the establishment of federally guaranteed loans for small businesses under the PPP. As a certified SBA lender, Regions has experienced, and expects to continue to experience, an increase in lending activity as the Company assists customers through the loan process under the new PPP. As of May 4, 2020, Regions has received SBA authorization for over 37,200 applications totaling approximately $4.8 billion. Of the authorized SBA applications, Regions has funded over 19,600 applications from business customers totaling approximately $3.6 billion. 

Regions continues to have strong liquidity and capital levels, which have the Company well prepared to respond to the increase in customer borrowing needs. The Company has ample sources of liquidity that include a granular and stable deposit base, cash balances held at the Federal Reserve, borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank, unencumbered highly liquid securities, and borrowing availability at the Federal Reserve's discount window. Furthermore, additional liquidity is available through the Federal Reserve's Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility. From a capital perspective, the Company's estimated capital ratios remain well above current regulatory requirements under the Basel III capital rules. Further, Regions currently has no plans to reduce the level of or eliminate cash dividends in consideration of the COVID-19 pandemic. See the "Liquidity", Shareholders' Equity, and "Regulatory Capital" sections for further information. 

The Company did not repurchase shares in the first quarter of 2020, and given the uncertainty in the overall economic environment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, no share repurchases are currently anticipated for 2020. 

The COVID-19 pandemic affected the first quarter provision for credit losses, which was $373 million and $250 million in excess of net charge-offs (see below and the "Allowance for Credit Losses" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis for further detail). It also impacted ending loan and deposit levels as customers increased their line utilization in response to the current economic environment, while keeping the majority of the excess cash in their deposit accounts. See Table 2 "Loan Portfolio" and Table 14 "Deposits" for further information. 

The COVID-19 pandemic also affected non-interest income. At the end of the first quarter of 2020, consumer spending activity decreased in response to COVID-19, which negatively impacted non-interest income by approximately $12 million. If current spending levels persist, the Company estimates non-interest income will be negatively impacted by $20 million to $25 million per month from pre-March 2020 levels. See Table 23 "Non-Interest Income" for more detail. 

Regions assessed goodwill in light of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units was less than its carrying value. Refer to the "Goodwill" section for further detail. 

Regions has experienced a modest increase in cyber events as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, however the Company's layered control environment has effectively detected and prevented any material impact related to these events. Refer to the "Information Security" section for further detail. 

Subsequent to March 31, 2020, Moody's and Fitch ratings agencies changed the outlook for Regions' credit ratings to stable from positive due to concerns over the negative financial and economic impacts to the bank sector from COVID-19, as well as the direct negative impact on banks' asset quality and profitability from a contracting economy in 2020. See Table 17 "Credit Ratings" for further information. 

First Quarter Results 

Regions reported net income available to common shareholders of $139 million , or $0.14 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2020 compared to $378 million , or $0.37 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2019 . 

For the first quarter of 2020 , net interest income (taxable-equivalent basis) totaled $940 million , down $21 million compared to the first quarter of 2019 . The net interest margin (taxable-equivalent basis) was 3.44 percent for the first quarter of 2020 and 3.51 percent in the first quarter of 2019 . The decreases in net interest income and net interest margin were primarily driven by the impact of lower market interest rates on asset yields, partially offset by the impact of lower funding costs. 

The provision for credit losses totaled $373 million in the first quarter of 2020 , after the adoption of CECL at the beginning of the year, as compared to the provision for loan losses of $91 million during the first quarter of 2019 . The current quarter provision covered $123 million in net charge-offs, as well as $250 million of additional provision reflecting an increase in the expected losses over the contractual lives of the loan and credit commitment portfolios. The increase in the provision for credit losses during the first quarter was driven primarily by adverse economic conditions and uncertainty in the economic outlook resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Also contributing to the increase were higher specific reserves associated with downgrades primarily in the energy and restaurant portfolios. Refer to the "Allowance for Credit Losses" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis for further detail. 

Net charge-offs totaled $123 million , or an annualized 0.59 percent of average loans, in the first quarter of 2020 , compared to $78 million, or an annualized 0.38 percent for the first quarter of 2019 . See Note 3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

The allowance was 1.89 percent of total loans, net of unearned income at March 31, 2020 compared to 1.10 percent at December 31, 2019 . The increase was a result of the adoption of CECL and the provision as discussed above. The allowance was 261 percent of total non-performing loans at March 31, 2020 compared to 180 percent at December 31, 2019 . Total non-performing loans increased to 0.72 percent of total loans, net of unearned income, at March 31, 2020 , compared to 0.61 percent at December 31, 2019 . The increase in non-performing loans was driven primarily by energy-related credits. Refer to the "Allowance for Credit Losses" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis for further detail. 

Non-interest income was $485 million for the first quarter of 2020 , a $17 million decrease from the first quarter of 2019 . The decrease was primarily driven by lower capital markets income and other non-interest income, partially offset by higher mortgage income. See Table 23 "Non-Interest Income" for more detail. 

Total non-interest expense was $836 million in the first quarter of 2020 , a $24 million decrease from the first quarter of 2019 . The decrease was primarily driven by lower salaries and employee benefits and other miscellaneous expenses, partially offset by an increase in furniture and equipment expense. See Table 24 "Non-Interest Expense" for more detail. 

Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was $42 million compared to $105 million for the same period in 2019 . See "Income Taxes" toward the end of the Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis section of this report for more detail. 

Expectations 

Due to the current economic uncertainty, the Company has rescinded previously issued financial targets for 2020, as well as the three-year targets previously announced in 2019. Regions' expectations will continue to evolve in response to the changing economic conditions presented amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, as the Company expects that the financial results of subsequent quarters will continue to be impacted. 

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 

The following sections provide expanded discussion of significant changes in certain line items in asset, liability, and equity categories. 

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 

Cash and cash equivalents increased approximately $1.1 billion from year-end 2019 to March 31, 2020 , due primarily to an increase in cash on deposit with the FRB. In response to the economic environment and as a part of Regions' liquidity management, the Company borrowed additional advances at the FHLB which were used to increase cash at the FRB. See the "Liquidity" section for more information.

Debt securities available for sale, which constitute the majority of the securities portfolio, are an important tool used to manage interest rate sensitivity and provide a primary source of liquidity for the Company. Regions maintains a highly rated securities portfolio consisting primarily of agency mortgage-backed securities. See Note 2 "Debt Securities" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Also see the "Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk" and "Liquidity" sections for more information. 

Debt securities increased $1.1 billion from December 31, 2019 to March 31, 2020 . Despite the interest rate volatility during the quarter, Regions' comprehensive securities repositioning executed in the second and third quarters of 2019 positioned the portfolio to react favorably to the current economic environment. The increase during the first quarter of 2020 was the result of improved market valuation and additional purchases of mortgage-backed securities. 

LOANS HELD FOR SALE 

Loans held for sale totaled $566 million at March 31, 2020 , consisting of $478 million of residential real estate mortgage loans, $85 million of commercial mortgage and other loans, and $3 million of non-performing loans. At December 31, 2019 , loans held for sale totaled $637 million , consisting of $436 million of residential real estate mortgage loans, $188 million of commercial mortgage and other loans, and $13 million of non-performing loans. The levels of residential real estate and commercial mortgage loans held for sale that are part of the Company's mortgage originations to be sold fluctuate depending on the timing of origination and sale to third parties. 

LOANS 

Loans, net of unearned income, represented approximately 74 percent of Regions&#8217; interest-earning assets at March 31, 2020 . The following table presents the distribution of Regions&#8217; loan portfolio by portfolio segment and class, net of unearned income:

PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS 

The following sections describe the composition of the portfolio segments and classes disclosed in Table 2 , explain changes in balances from 2019 year-end, and highlight the related risk characteristics. Regions believes that its loan portfolio is well diversified by product, client, and geography throughout its footprint. However, the loan portfolio may be exposed to certain concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers, certain types of collateral, certain types of industries, certain loan products, or certain regions of the country. See Note 3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion. 

Most classes within Regions' portfolio segments are experiencing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, Regions' energy and restaurant portfolios have experienced significant operational challenges as a result of COVID-19 and are at the highest risk. Energy credits have been stressed by the recent significant drop in oil prices. The restaurant portfolio, particularly credits in the casual dining space, have come under stress as shelter in place orders began and continue. Small business sectors of the portfolio, as well as consumer portfolios, are also impacted by shelter in place and social distancing rules created by the COVID-19 pandemic along with the fact that these types of borrowers tend to have limited liquidity or access to alternate liquidity sources. The extent to which Regions' borrowers are ultimately impacted will be a factor of the duration and severity of the economic impact as well as the effectiveness of the various government programs in place to support individuals and businesses. See Table 3 "Selected Industry Exposure" for more detail. 

Commercial 

The commercial portfolio segment includes commercial and industrial loans to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases and other expansion projects. Commercial and industrial loans increase d $5.4 billion since year-end 2019 . This expansion was due primarily to an increase in line utilization late in the first quarter as customers responded to the uncertain current economic environment (see the "First Quarter Overview" section for more 

information). The expansion was driven by increases in the real estate, retail trade, financial services, manufacturing, healthcare and utilities industry sectors. 

Commercial also includes owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans to operating businesses, which are loans for long-term financing of land and buildings, and are repaid by cash flows generated by business operations. Owner-occupied commercial real estate construction loans are made to commercial businesses for the development of land or construction of a building where the repayment is derived from revenues generated from the business of the borrower. 

On April 1, 2020, the Company closed a transaction to acquire Ascentium Capital LLC, an independent equipment finance leader. The acquisition included approximately $2 billion in loans and leases to small businesses. 

Over half of the Company&#8217;s total loans are included in the commercial portfolio segment. These balances are spread across numerous industries, as noted in the table below. The Company manages the related risks to this portfolio by setting certain lending limits for each significant industry. 

The following tables provide detail of Regions' commercial lending balances in selected industries.

"Other" contains balances related to non-classifiable and invalid business industry codes offset by payments in process and fee accounts that are not available at the loan level. 

(2) 

As customers' businesses evolve (e.g. up or down the vertical manufacturing chain), Regions may need to change the assigned business industry code used to define the customer relationship. When these changes occur, Regions does not recast the customer history for prior periods into the new classification because the business industry code used in the prior period was deemed appropriate. As a result, comparable period changes may be impacted. 

Investor Real Estate 

Loans for real estate development are repaid through cash flows related to the operation, sale or refinance of the property. This portfolio segment includes extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is dependent on the sale of real estate or income generated from the real estate collateral. A portion of Regions&#8217; investor real estate portfolio segment consists of loans secured by residential product types (land, single-family and condominium loans) within Regions&#8217; markets. Additionally, this category includes loans made to finance income-producing properties such as apartment buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers. Total investor real estate loans increased $ 306 million in comparison to 2019 year-end balances reflecting new fundings and draws on investor real estate construction lines. 

Residential First Mortgage 

Residential first mortgage loans represent loans to consumers to finance a residence. These loans are typically financed over a 15 to 30 year term and, in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence. These loans increased $ 50 million in comparison to 2019 year-end balances. Approximately $842 million in new loan originations were retained on the balance sheet through the first three months of 2020 . 

Home Equity Lines 

Home equity lines are secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower's residence and allow customers to borrow against the equity in their homes. Home equity lines decreased by $ 99 million in comparison to 2019 year-end balances. Substantially all of this portfolio was originated through Regions&#8217; branch network. 

Beginning in December 2016, new home equity lines of credit have a 10-year draw period and a 20-year repayment term. During the 10-year draw period customers do not have an interest-only payment option, except on a very limited basis. From May 2009 to December 2016, home equity lines of credit had a 10-year draw period and a 10-year repayment term. Prior to May 2009, home equity lines of credit had a 20-year repayment term with a balloon payment upon maturity or a 5-year draw period with a balloon payment upon maturity. The term &#8220;balloon payment&#8221; means there are no principal payments required until the balloon payment is due for interest-only lines of credit. 

The following table presents information regarding the future principal payment reset dates for the Company's home equity lines of credit as of March 31, 2020 . The balances presented are based on maturity date for lines with a balloon payment and draw period expiration date for lines that convert to a repayment period.

Home Equity Loans 

Home equity loans are also secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower's residence, are primarily originated as amortizing loans, and allow customers to borrow against the equity in their homes. Home equity loans decreased by $ 84 million in comparison to 2019 year-end balances. Substantially all of this portfolio was originated through Regions&#8217; branch network. 

Other Consumer Credit Quality Data 

The Company calculates an estimate of the current value of property secured as collateral for both residential first mortgage and home equity lending products (&#8220;current LTV&#8221;). The estimate is based on home price indices compiled by a third party. The third party data indicates trends for MSAs. Regions uses the third party valuation trends from the MSAs in the Company's footprint in its estimate. The trend data is applied to the loan portfolios taking into account the age of the most recent valuation and geographic area. 

The following table presents current LTV data for components of the residential first mortgage, home equity lines and home equity loans classes of the consumer portfolio segment. Current LTV data for some loans in the portfolio is not available due to mergers and systems integrations. The amounts in the table represent the entire loan balance. For purposes of the table below, if the loan balance exceeds the current estimated collateral, the entire balance is included in the &#8220;Above 100%&#8221; category, regardless of the amount of collateral available to partially offset the shortfall.

Indirect&#8212;Vehicles 

Indirect-vehicles lending, which is lending initiated through third-party business partners, largely consists of loans made through automotive dealerships. This portfolio class decreased $255 million from year-end 2019 . The decrease is due to the termination of a third-party arrangement during the fourth quarter of 2016 and Regions' decision in January 2019 to discontinue its indirect auto lending business. Regions ceased originating new indirect auto loans in the first quarter of 2019 and completed any in-process indirect auto loan closings at the end of the second quarter of 2019. The Company will remain in the direct auto lending business. 

Indirect&#8212;Other Consumer 

Indirect-other consumer lending represents other lending initiatives through third parties, including point of sale lending. This portfolio class decreased $ 47 million from year-end 2019 due to exiting a third party relationship during the fourth quarter of 2019. 

Consumer Credit Card 

Consumer credit card lending represents primarily open-ended variable interest rate consumer credit card loans. These balances decreased $84 million from year-end 2019 reflecting seasonality. 

Other Consumer 

Other consumer loans primarily include direct consumer loans, overdrafts and other revolving loans. Other consumer loans decreased $60 million from year-end 2019 . 

Regions considers factors such as periodic updates of FICO scores, unemployment, home prices, and geography as credit quality indicators for consumer loans. FICO scores are obtained at origination and refreshed FICO scores are obtained by the Company quarterly for all consumer loans. For more information on credit quality indicators refer to Note 3 "Loans" . 

ALLOWANCE 

In preparing financial information, management is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses for the periods shown. The accounting principles followed by Regions and the methods of applying these principles conform with GAAP, regulatory guidances, where applicable, and general banking practices. The allowance is one of the most significant estimates and assumptions to Regions. The allowance consists of two components: the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. Unfunded credit commitments include items such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and binding unfunded loan commitments. 

On January 1, 2020, Regions adopted CECL, which replaced the incurred loss allowance methodology with an expected loss allowance methodology. See Note 1 "Basis of Presentation" , Note 3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" and Note 12 "Recent Accounting Pronouncements" for information about CECL adoption, areas of judgment and methodologies used in establishing the allowance. 

The allowance is sensitive to a number of internal factors, such as modifications in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding, portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings. The allowance is also sensitive to external factors such as the general health of the economy, as evidenced by changes in interest rates, GDP, unemployment rates, changes in real estate demand and values, volatility in commodity prices, bankruptcy filings, health pandemics, government stimulus, and the effects of weather and natural disasters such as droughts, floods and hurricanes. 

Management considers these variables and all other available information when establishing the final level of the allowance. These variables and others have the ability to result in actual credit losses that differ from the originally estimated amounts. 

Since January 1, 2020, Regions increased the allowance by $250 million to $1.7 billion, which represents management's best estimate of expected losses over the life of the loan and credit commitment portfolios. Key drivers of the change in the allowance for credit losses are presented below:

Regions adopted the CECL accounting guidance on January 1, 2020 and recorded the cumulative effect of the change in accounting guidance as a reduction to retained earnings and an increase to deferred tax assets. See Note 1 for additional details. 

Changes in the macroeconomic environment can be extremely impactful to the allowance estimate under CECL. When compared to January 1, 2020, which was based on a benign economic environment, Regions' economic forecast utilized in the March 31, 2020 allowance models had deteriorated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Regions benchmarked its internal forecast with external forecasts and external data available. While various data points and alternative viewpoints were considered, the risks to the economic forecast utilized in the allowance were weighted to the downside through the qualitative framework, given the high degree of uncertainty around how widely the COVID-19 pandemic could spread and how long it could persist. The effectiveness of government relief programs and debt payment relief being provided by the Company as well as the potential for any future stimulus was also considered, which the Company believes could be significant mitigating factors. 

Regions' quantitative allowance methodologies strive to reflect all risk factors; however, any estimate involves assumptions and uncertainties resulting in some level of imprecision. The qualitative framework has a general imprecision component which is meant to acknowledge that model and forecast errors are inherent in any modeling estimate. Given that credit deterioration from COVID-19 had not fully materialized at March 31, 2020 and that the models are not calibrated for such a pandemic, the impact of COVID-19 on the allowance was primarily captured through the economic uncertainty component of the qualitative framework. 

As part of the qualitative framework, Regions ran an Updated/More Severe forecast through the allowance models for sensitivity purposes. The Updated/More Severe forecast reflects an abrupt halt to the economy. Management also benchmarked the Updated/More Severe forecast to external forecasts, noting overall alignment and comparability of results. 

The tables below reflect a range of macroeconomic factors utilized in the Base (utilized in the allowance models) and Updated/More Severe (utilized in the qualitative framework) forecasts over the R&#38;S forecast period, with unemployment being the most significant macroeconomic factor among the CECL models. First quarter 2020 forecast information is also included.

As noted above, the March 31, 2020 allowance includes additional qualitative amounts in addition to the modeled Base forecast to capture economic uncertainties. As such, the Base forecast factors (listed in the table above) do not specifically align with Regions' allowance. 

There were several points of analysis used to inform an appropriate qualitative overlay for economic uncertainty. In addition to running the Updated/More Severe forecast, industry-level stress analyses were also performed on industries most acutely impacted by COVID-19. Refer to the "Portfolio Characteristics" section for more information about COVID-19 impacted industries. The overall range from these collective, alternative analyses resulted in potential increases of approximately $100 million to $500 million as compared to the January 1, 2020 allowance. These analytically-derived ranges however, are not able to fully take into consideration the specifics of the CARES Act and other policy accommodations, which could materially impact loss expectations. Based on the overall analysis performed, management deemed an increase in the allowance of $250 million as compared to January 1, 2020 to be appropriate to absorb expected credit losses in the loan and credit commitment portfolios as of March 31, 2020. 

Subsequent to March 31, 2020, additional economic forecasts indicated continued rapid deterioration in certain macroeconomic factors, primarily real GDP and unemployment rates. The level of uncertainty related to how these forecasts will impact expected credit losses and future credit loss provisions remains high due to uncertainty concerning the length and depth of the COVID-19 pandemic and related shelter in place orders, as well as, the offsetting impacts of current and future government stimulus and lending programs. Due to the unprecedented nature of the uncertainties discussed above, an estimate of the expected increase in the allowance cannot be made at this time. However, if the current trends continue, it is likely that increases in the allowance, which could be material, will be required in future periods. As a point of reference, in 2018 the Federal Reserve disclosed their estimation of modeled credit losses for Regions as part of DFAST. This included two scenarios, an adverse and a severely adverse economic environment. Modeled losses in the scenarios were $3.0 billion in the adverse and $5.3 billion in the severely adverse scenarios. Whereas these stress tests assumed a different macroeconomic outlook, they may represent a possible range of potential credit losses assuming a longer-term, widespread pandemic with no offsetting benefits from government stimulus or lending programs, which as noted above the Company believes could be significant mitigating factors. See the "First Quarter Overview" section for further information regarding the Company's economic outlook as the second quarter of 2020 began to unfold. 

As noted above, changes in the factors used by management to determine the appropriateness of the allowance or the availability of new information could cause the allowance to be increased or decreased in future periods. In addition, bank regulatory agencies, as part of their examination process, may require changes in the level of allowance based on their judgments and estimates. Volatility in certain credit metrics is to be expected. Additionally, changes in circumstances related to individually large credits, commodity prices, or certain macroeconomic forecast assumptions may result in volatility. The scenarios discussed above, or other scenarios, have the ability to result in actual credit losses that differ, perhaps materially, from the originally estimated amounts. In addition, it is difficult to predict how changes in economic conditions, the impact of government stimulus, or other relief programs could affect borrower behavior. This analysis is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled loss estimates to reflect uncertainty and imprecision based on then-current circumstances and conditions. 

Details regarding the allowance and net charge-offs, including an analysis of activity from the previous year&#8217;s totals, are included in Table 8 "Allowance for Credit Losses." As noted above, economic trends such as interest rates, unemployment, 

volatility in commodity prices and collateral valuations as well as the length and depth of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of the CARES Act and other policy accommodations will impact the future levels of net charge-offs and may result in volatility of certain credit metrics during the remainder of 2020 .

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs) 

TDRs are modified loans in which a concession is provided to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. As provided in the CARES Act passed into law on March 27, 2020, certain loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic beginning March 1, 2020 are eligible for relief from TDR classification. Regions elected this provision of the CARES Act; therefore, modified loans that met the required guidelines for relief are not considered TDRs and are excluded from the disclosures below. 

Residential first mortgage, home equity, consumer credit card and other consumer TDRs are consumer loans modified under the CAP. Commercial and investor real estate loan modifications are not the result of a formal program, but represent situations where modifications were offered as a workout alternative. Renewals of classified commercial and investor real estate loans are considered to be TDRs, even if no reduction in interest rate is offered, if the existing terms are considered to be below market. Insignificant modifications are not considered TDRs. More detailed information is included in Note 3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements. The following table summarizes the loan balance and related allowance for accruing and non-accruing TDRs for the periods presented:

The following table provides an analysis of the changes in commercial and investor real estate TDRs. TDRs with subsequent restructurings that meet the definition of a TDR are only reported as TDR additions in the period they were first modified. Other than resolutions such as charge-offs, foreclosures, payments, sales and transfers to held for sale, Regions may remove loans from TDR classification if the following conditions are met: the borrower's financial condition improves such that the borrower is no longer in financial difficulty, the loan has not had any forgiveness of principal or interest, the loan has not been restructured as an "A" note/"B" note, the loan has been reported as a TDR over one fiscal year-end and the loan is subsequently refinanced or restructured at market terms such that it qualifies as a new loan. 

For the consumer portfolio, changes in TDRs are primarily due to additions from CAP modifications and outflows from payments and charge-offs. Given the types of concessions currently being granted under the CAP as detailed in Note 3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements, Regions does not expect that the market interest rate condition will be widely achieved. Therefore, Regions expects consumer loans modified through CAP to continue to be identified as TDRs for the remaining term of the loan.

Excludes accruing loans 90 days past due. 

(2) 

Excludes residential first mortgage loans that are 100% guaranteed by the FHA and all guaranteed loans sold to the GNMA where Regions has the right but not the obligation to repurchase. Total 90 days or more past due guaranteed loans excluded were $59 million at March 31, 2020 and $66 million at December 31, 2019 . 

Non-performing loans at March 31, 2020 have increased compared to year-end levels, primarily driven by energy credits that have experienced stress due to recent declines in oil prices. 

Economic trends such as interest rates, unemployment, volatility in commodity prices, and collateral valuations will impact the future level of non-performing assets. Circumstances related to individually large credits could also result in volatility. 

At March 31, 2020 , Regions estimates that the amount of commercial and investor real estate loans that have the potential to migrate to non-accrual status in the next quarter is within the range of $225 million to $350 million . 

In order to arrive at the estimated range of potential problem loans for the next quarter, credit personnel forecast certain larger dollar loans that may potentially be downgraded to non-accrual at a future time, depending upon the occurrence of future events. A variety of factors are included in the assessment of potential problem loans, including a borrower&#8217;s capacity and willingness to meet contractual repayment terms, make principal curtailments or provide additional collateral when necessary and provide current and complete financial information, including global cash flows, contingent liabilities and sources of liquidity. For other loans (for example, smaller dollar loans), a trend analysis is also incorporated to determine an estimate of potential future downgrades. In addition, the economic environment and industry trends are evaluated in the establishment of the estimated range of potential problem loans for the next quarter. Current trends will additionally influence the size of the estimated range. Because of the inherent uncertainty in forecasting future events, the estimated range of potential problem loans ultimately represents the estimated aggregate dollar amounts of loans, as opposed to an individual listing of loans. 

Many of the loans on which the potential problem loan estimate is based are considered criticized and classified. Detailed disclosures for substandard accrual loans (as well as other credit quality metrics) are included in Note 3 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements.

GOODWILL 

Goodwill totaled $ 4.8 billion at both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 and is allocated to each of Regions&#8217; reportable segments (each a reporting unit), at which level goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more often if events and circumstances indicate the fair value of the reporting unit may have declined below the carrying value (refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for further discussion of when Regions tests goodwill for impairment and the Company's methodology and valuation approaches used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit). 

During the first quarter of 2020, Regions assessed events and circumstances for all three reporting units as of March 31, 2020, and through the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q that could potentially indicate goodwill impairment including analyzing the impacts from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The indicators assessed included: 

&#8226; Recent operating performance, 

&#8226; Changes in market capitalization, 

&#8226; Regulatory actions and assessments, 

&#8226; Changes in the business climate (including legislation, legal factors, competition and impacts from COVID-19), 

&#8226; Company-specific factors (including changes in key personnel, asset impairments, and business dispositions), and 

&#8226; Trends in the banking industry. 

After assessing the indicators noted above, Regions determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units (Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank and Wealth Management) had declined below their carrying value as of March 31, 2020. Therefore, Regions determined that a test of goodwill impairment was not required for each of Regions&#8217; reporting units for the March 31, 2020 interim period. Regions will continue to monitor for indicators of impairment throughout 2020. 

DEPOSITS 

Regions competes with other banking and financial services companies for a share of the deposit market. Regions&#8217; ability to compete in the deposit market depends heavily on the pricing of its deposits and how effectively the Company meets customers&#8217; needs. Regions employs various means to meet those needs and enhance competitiveness, such as providing a high level of customer service, competitive pricing and convenient branch locations for its customers. Regions also serves customers through providing centralized, high-quality banking services and alternative product delivery channels such as mobile and internet banking.

Total deposits at March 31, 2020 increased approximately $2.6 billion compared to year-end 2019 levels, due to increases in non-interest-bearing demand, domestic money market and savings accounts. These increases were offset by decreases in corporate treasury other deposits and customer time deposits. Non-interest-bearing demand deposits increased as customers reacted to the uncertainly in the economic environment, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, by increasing line of credit draws and keeping excess cash in deposit accounts. Domestic money market and savings accounts also increased as customers seek the safety of a regulated and insured financial institution in times of economic uncertainty. Corporate treasury other deposits decreased as these deposits were used to supplement incremental balance sheet funding at year-end 2019, but were no longer being utilized at the end of the first quarter of 2020. 

SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS 

Short-term borrowings, which consist of FHLB advances, totaled $3.2 billion at March 31, 2020 as compared to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2019 . The levels of these borrowings can fluctuate depending on the Company's funding needs and the sources utilized. FHLB borrowings increased from December 31, 2019 to March 31, 2020 as additional FHLB advances were used to increase cash held at the FRB, in response to the current economic environment. 

Short-term secured borrowings, such as securities sold under agreements to repurchase and FHLB advances, are a core portion of Regions funding strategy. The securities financing market and specifically short-term FHLB advances continue to provide reliable funding at attractive rates. See the "Liquidity" section for further detail of Regions' borrowing capacity with the FHLB.

Long-term borrowings increased by approximately $2.2 billion since year-end 2019, due primarily to an increase in FHLB advances of $2.2 billion. The increase in long-term FHLB advances was due to an anticipated increase in customer borrowing needs due to the current economic environment. As mentioned above, FHLB advances were also used to increase the balance of cash held at the FRB. See the "Liquidity" section for further detail of Regions' borrowing capacity with the FHLB. 

Long-term FHLB advances have a weighted-average interest rate of 1.0 percent at March 31, 2020 and 1.9 percent at December 31, 2019 , with remaining maturities ranging from less than one year to eight years and a weighted-average of approximately 1 year. 

SHAREHOLDERS&#8217; EQUITY 

Shareholders&#8217; equity was $17.3 billion at March 31, 2020 as compared to $16.3 billion at December 31, 2019 . During the first three months of 2020 , net income increased shareholders&#8217; equity by $162 million , while cash dividends on common stock reduced shareholders' equity by $149 million and cash dividends on preferred stock reduced shareholder's equity by $23 million . The cumulative effect from the adoption of CECL decreased shareholders' equity by $377 million . See Note 1 "Basis of Presentation" for information about the CECL adoption. Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income increased shareholders' equity by $1.4 billion , primarily due to the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on securities available for sale and derivative instruments as a result of changes in market interest rates during the first quarter 2020 . 

During the second quarter of 2019, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $1.370 billion of the Company's common stock, permitting repurchases from the beginning of the third quarter of 2019 through the end of the second quarter of 2020. The Company did not repurchase shares in the first quarter of 2020, and given the uncertainty in the overall economic environment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, no share repurchases are currently anticipated for 2020. 

Regions' dividend policy is set to withstand adverse conditions and as such, the Company currently has no plans to reduce the level of or eliminate cash dividends in consideration of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Regions will continue to exercise prudent capital management and closely monitor the implications from the evolving economic environment. Under U.S. capital rules, the Company would be subject to constraints on dividend payout restrictions if it failed to meet the effective minimum ratio requirements, which are comprised of regulatory minimum capital levels of 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets, 6.0% tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and 8.0% total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets, plus a static 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer. As such, effective minimum requirements are currently 7% CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets, 8.5% tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and 10.5% total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets. 

In the first quarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve finalized the Stress Capital Buffer framework that will replace the Capital Conservation Buffer when implemented in October 2020. See "Regulatory Requirements" section for further information. 

See Note 5 "Stockholders&#8217; Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)" for additional information. 

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS 

Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies. These regulatory capital requirements involve quantitative measures of the Company's assets, liabilities and selected off-balance sheet items, and also qualitative judgments by the regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can subject the Company to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory actions. 

Under the Basel III Rules, Regions is designated as a standardized approach bank. Additional discussion of the Basel III Rules, their applicability to Regions, recent proposals and final rules issued by the federal banking agencies and recent laws enacted that impact regulatory requirements is included in the "Regulatory Requirements" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis in the 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional discussion is also included in Note 13 "Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions" to the consolidated financial statements in the 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

In late March 2020, the federal banking agencies published an interim final rule related to revised transition of the impact of CECL on regulatory capital requirements. The rule allows an add-back to regulatory capital for the impacts of CECL for a two-year period. At the end of the two years, the impact is then phased-in over the following three years. The add-back is calculated as the impact of initial adoption, adjusted for 25 percent of subsequent changes in the allowance. At March 31, 2020, this amount was approximately $438 million. The impact on CET1 was approximately 40 basis points. The interim final rule has been published for comment, and has an immediate effective date. 

Additionally in late March 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law. This Act provides optional temporary relief from complying with CECL. While Regions is deferring the capital impact of CECL allowed by the interim final rule as discussed above, the Company did not elect the statutory relief related to CECL implementation provided by the CARES Act.

_______ 

(1) The current quarter Basel III CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, and Leverage capital ratios are estimated. 

In the first quarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve finalized the Stress Capital Buffer framework which, when implemented in October 2020, will create a firm-specific risk sensitive buffer to be applied to regulatory minimum capital levels in determining effective minimum ratio requirements. The Stress Capital Buffer will be floored at 2.5% to ensure effective minimum capital levels do not decline as a result of this rule change. When implemented, the Stress Capital Buffer will replace the current Capital Conservation Buffer, which is a static 2.5% in addition to the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios shown above. 

The Federal Reserve approved its rule for tailoring enhanced prudential standards for bank holding companies with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The framework outlines tailored standards for matters related to capital and liquidity. Regions is a "Category IV" institution under these rules. See the &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; subsection of the &#8220;Business&#8221; section in the 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. 

&#160; 

LIQUIDITY 

The federal banking agencies have adopted rules implementing Basel III&#8217;s LCR, which is designed to ensure that a covered bank or BHC maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets under an acute 30-day liquidity stress scenario. Under the tailoring rules, Regions has been designated as a Category IV institution and is no longer subject to any LCR requirement. Category IV institutions, including Regions, remain subject to liquidity risk management requirements, but these requirements are now tailored such that collateral positions are calculated only monthly, a more limited set of liquidity risk limits exists, and fewer elements of intraday liquidity risk exposures are monitored. Also, liquidity stress testing is required quarterly rather than monthly, and liquidity data on the FR 2052a is reported on a monthly basis. Regions remains subject to the liquidity buffer requirements. 

Regions maintains a robust liquidity management framework designed to effectively manage liquidity risk in accordance with sound risk management principals. The framework establishes sustainable processes and tools to effectively identify, measure, mitigate, monitor, and report liquidity risks beginning with Regions&#8217; Liquidity Management Policy and the Liquidity Risk Appetite Statements approved by the Board. Processes within the liquidity management framework include, but are not limited to, liquidity risk governance, cash management, liquidity stress testing, liquidity risk limits, contingency funding plans, and collateral management. While the framework is designed to comply with liquidity regulations, the processes often go beyond minimum regulatory requirements and are commensurate with Regions&#8217; operating model and risk profile. 

See the "Liquidity" section for more information. Also, see the &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8212;Liquidity Regulation&#8221; subsection of the &#8220;Business&#8221; section, the "Risk Factors" section and the "Liquidity" section in the 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

N/A - Not applicable. 

On April 3, 2020 Moody's revised outlooks for Regions Bank and Regions Financial Corporation to stable from positive citing expectations for a contracting economy in 2020 which is expected to have a direct negative impact on U.S. banks' asset quality and profitability. 

On April 9, 2020 Fitch revised the outlook for Regions Financial Corporation to stable from positive as part of an overall revision of its U.S. bank sector and rating outlook. Revision to the overall outlook was driven by concerns over the negative financial and economic impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. 

In general, ratings agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, probability of government support, and level and quality of earnings. Any downgrade in credit ratings by one or more ratings agencies may impact Regions in several ways, including, but not limited to, Regions&#8217; access to the capital markets or short-term funding, borrowing cost and capacity, collateral requirements, and acceptability of its letters of credit, thereby potentially adversely impacting Regions&#8217; financial condition and liquidity. See the &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for more information. 

A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and the ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 

NON-GAAP MEASURES 

The table below presents computations of earnings and certain other financial measures, which exclude certain significant items that are included in the financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include &#8220;adjusted average total loans&#8221;, "adjusted ending total loans", &#8220;adjusted efficiency ratio&#8221;, &#8220;adjusted fee income ratio&#8221;, &#8220;return on average tangible common shareholders' equity&#8221;, and end of period &#8220;tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity&#8221;, and related ratios. Regions believes that expressing earnings and certain other financial measures excluding these significant items provides a meaningful base for period-to-period comparisons, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the Company and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of Regions&#8217; business because management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations. Regions believes that presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as that applied by management. Management and the Board utilize these non-GAAP financial measures as follows: 

&#8226; 

Preparation of Regions&#8217; operating budgets 

&#8226; 

Monthly financial performance reporting 

&#8226; 

Monthly close-out reporting of consolidated results (management only) 

&#8226; 

Presentations to investors of Company performance 

Total average and ending loans are presented excluding the indirect vehicles exit portfolio to arrive at adjusted average and ending total loans (non-GAAP). Regions believes adjusting average and ending total loans provides a meaningful calculation of loan growth rates and presents them on the same basis as that applied by management. 

The adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP), which is a measure of productivity, is generally calculated as adjusted non-interest expense divided by adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. The adjusted fee income ratio (non-GAAP) is generally calculated as adjusted non-interest income divided by adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Management uses these ratios to monitor performance and believes these measures provide meaningful information to investors. Non-interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the adjusted efficiency ratio. Non-interest income (GAAP) is presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the adjusted fee income ratio. Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis and non-interest income are added together to arrive at total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Adjustments are made to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP), which is the denominator for the adjusted efficiency and adjusted fee income ratios. 

Tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity ratios have become a focus of some investors in analyzing the capital position of the Company absent the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Traditionally, the Federal Reserve and other banking regulatory bodies have assessed a bank&#8217;s capital adequacy based on CET1, the calculation of which is codified in federal banking regulations. Analysts and banking regulators have assessed Regions&#8217; capital adequacy using the tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity measure. Because tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity is not formally defined by GAAP, this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure and other entities may calculate it differently than Regions&#8217; disclosed calculations. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess Regions&#8217; capital adequacy using tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity, Regions believes that it is useful to provide investors the ability to assess Regions&#8217; capital adequacy on this same basis. 

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. In particular, a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to shareholders. 

The following tables provide: 1) a reconciliation of average total loans to adjusted average total loans (non-GAAP), 2) a reconciliation of ending total loans to adjusted ending total loans (non-GAAP), 3) a reconciliation of net income (GAAP) to net income available to common shareholders (GAAP), 4) a reconciliation of non-interest expense (GAAP) to adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), 5) a reconciliation of net interest income/margin, taxable equivalent basis (GAAP) to adjusted net interest income/margin, taxable equivalent basis (non-GAAP), 6) a reconciliation of non-interest income (GAAP) to adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP), 7) a computation of adjusted total revenue (non-GAAP), 8) a computation of the adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP), 9) a computation of the adjusted fee income ratio (non-GAAP), and 10) a reconciliation of average and ending shareholders&#8217; equity (GAAP) to average and ending tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity (non-GAAP) and calculations of related ratios (non-GAAP).

_____ 

(1) 

Debt securities are included on an amortized cost basis with yield, net interest spread, and net interest margin calculated accordingly. 

(2) 

Loans, net of unearned income include non-accrual loans for all periods presented. 

(3) 

Interest income includes net loan fees of $2 million and $1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. 

(4) 

Total deposit costs may be calculated by dividing total interest expense on deposits by the sum of interest-bearing deposits and non-interest-bearing deposits. The rates for total deposit costs equal 0.35% and 0.46% for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. 

(5) 

The computation of taxable-equivalent net interest income is based on the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% for both March 31, 2020 and 2019 adjusted for applicable state income taxes net of the related federal tax benefit. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

For the first quarter of 2020 , net interest income (taxable-equivalent basis) totaled $940 million compared to $961 million in the first quarter of 2019 . The net interest margin (taxable-equivalent basis) was 3.44 percent for the first quarter of 2020 and 3.51 percent for the first quarter of 2019 . The decreases in net interest income and net interest margin for the first quarter 2020 , compared to the same period in 2019 , were primarily attributable to lower market interest rates. The decreases were partially offset by lower funding costs, the positive impact of loan hedges becoming active during the first quarter of 2020, and favorable loan remixing into higher yielding consumer loans. Furthermore, one additional day in the current quarter increased net interest income but reduced net interest margin, and lower average loan balances negatively impacted net interest income but positively impacted net interest margin. 

MARKET RISK&#8212;INTEREST RATE RISK 

Regions&#8217; primary market risk is interest rate risk. This includes uncertainty with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as relative interest rate levels, which are impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the Company offers. To quantify this risk, Regions measures the change in its net interest income in various interest rate scenarios compared to a base case scenario. Net interest income sensitivity to market rate movements is a useful short-term indicator of Regions&#8217; interest rate risk. 

Sensitivity Measurement &#8212;Financial simulation models are Regions&#8217; primary tools used to measure interest rate exposure. Using a wide range of sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates. Models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of Regions&#8217; balance sheet. Assumptions are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve, and the changing composition of the balance sheet that results from both strategic plans and from customer behavior. Among the assumptions are expectations of balance sheet growth and composition, the pricing and maturity characteristics of existing business and the characteristics of future business. Interest rate-related risks are expressly considered, such as pricing spreads, the pricing of deposit accounts, prepayments and other option risks. Regions considers these factors, as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty surrounding their future behavior. 

The primary objective of asset/liability management at Regions is to coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to sustain reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest rate cycles. In computing interest rate sensitivity for measurement, Regions compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using &#8220;market forward rates.&#8221; The standard set of interest rate scenarios includes the traditional instantaneous parallel rate shifts of plus 100 and 200 basis points. Given low market rates by historical standards, the Company focuses on a falling rate shock scenario with most yield curve tenors floored near zero and a reduction in mortgage indices based on historical minimums as explained in the following section. In addition to parallel curve shifts, multiple curve steepening and flattening scenarios are contemplated. Regions includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements phased in over a six-month period that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate movements. 

Exposure to Interest Rate Movements &#8212;As of March 31, 2020 , Regions was modestly asset sensitive to both gradual and instantaneous parallel yield curve shifts as compared to the base case for the measurement horizon ending March 2021 . The estimated exposure associated with falling rate scenarios in the table below reflects the combined impacts of movements in short-term and long-term interest rates. The decline in short-term interest rates (such as the Fed Funds rate, the rate of Interest on Excess Reserves and 1 month LIBOR) will lead to a reduction of yield on assets and liabilities contractually tied to such rates. Deposit and other funding costs are currently low when compared to historical levels. Therefore, it is expected that declines in funding costs will only partially offset the decline in asset yields. Yet, the combination of deposit cost reductions and increased balance sheet hedging income serves to mostly offset net interest income sensitivity to short-term rates. Net interest income remains exposed to longer yield curve tenors. A reduction in intermediate and long-term interest rates (such as intermediate to longer-term U.S. Treasuries, swap and mortgage rates) will drive yields lower on certain fixed rate, newly originated or renewed loans, reduce prospective yields on certain investment portfolio purchases, and increase amortization of premium expense on existing securities in the investment portfolio. 

The table below summarizes Regions' positioning in various parallel yield curve shifts (i.e., including all yield curve tenors). The scenarios are inclusive of all interest rate risk hedging activities. Forward starting hedges that have been transacted are contemplated to the extent they start within the measurement horizon. Twelve-month horizon asset sensitivity levels are expected to continue to decline through 2020 as forward starting hedges move completely into the measurement window. More information regarding forward starting hedges is disclosed in Table 21 and its accompanying description.

_________ 

(1) 

Disclosed interest rate sensitivity levels represent the 12 month forward looking net interest income changes as compared to market forward rate cases and include expected balance sheet growth and remixing. 

(2) 

Forward starting cash flow hedges already transacted will reduce sensitivity levels through 2020 as they continue to move into the measurement horizon. See Table 22 for additional information regarding hedge start dates. 

(3) 

The -100 basis point (floored) scenario represents a 12 month average rate shock of -21 basis points and -80 basis points to zero for 1 month LIBOR and the 10 year U.S. Treasury yield, respectively. Mortgage yield shocks are floored at their historical minimums minus 35 basis points. 

As market interest rates increased in recent years, Regions had established scenarios by which yield curve tenors will fall to a consistent level. The shock magnitude for each tenor, when compared to market forward rates, equated to the lesser of the shock scenario amount, or a rate 35 basis points lower than the historical all-time minimum. Recent market volatility and new historic lows established for longer yield curve tenors have resulted in a shock scenario where the majority of rates now fall to approximately zero. Mortgage rates, which have retained somewhat elevated levels, are still being shocked in the manner previously described. Further, the scenarios presented do not allow for negative rates. The falling rate scenarios in Table 20 above quantify the expected impact for both gradual and instantaneous shocks under this environment. 

As discussed above, the interest rate sensitivity analysis presented in Table 20 is informed by a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding the progression of the balance sheet in both the baseline scenario as well as the scenarios of instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve. Though there are many assumptions which affect the estimates for net interest income, those pertaining to deposit pricing, deposit mix and overall balance sheet composition are particularly impactful. Given the uncertainties associated with the prolonged period of low interest rates, management evaluates the impact to its sensitivity analysis of these key assumptions. Sensitivity calculations are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future results. 

The Company&#8217;s baseline balance sheet assumptions include loan and deposit growth reflecting management's best estimate. The behavior of deposits in response to changes in interest rate levels is largely informed by analyses of prior rate cycles, but with suitable adjustments based on management&#8217;s expectations in the current rate environment. In the base case scenario and falling rate scenarios in Table 20 , interest-bearing deposit rates achieve historical lows. In rising rate scenarios only, management assumes that the mix of deposits will change versus the base case balance sheet growth assumptions as informed by analyses of prior rate cycles. Management assumes that in rising rate scenarios, some shift from non-interest bearing to interest-bearing products will occur. The magnitude of the shift is rate dependent and equates to approximately $2.0 billion over 12 months in the gradual +100 basis point scenario in Table 20 . While estimates should be used as a guide, differences may result driven by the pace of rate changes, and other market competitive factors. 

Interest rate movements may also have an impact on the value of Regions&#8217; securities portfolio, which can directly impact the carrying value of shareholders&#8217; equity. Regions from time to time may hedge these price movements with derivatives (as discussed below). 

Derivatives &#8212;Regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of interest rate sensitivity. ALCO, which consists of members of Regions&#8217; senior management team, in its oversight role for the management of interest rate sensitivity, approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging strategies. Derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with customer derivatives, which include interest rate, credit and foreign exchange risks. The most common derivatives Regions employs are forward rate contracts, Eurodollar futures contracts, interest rate swaps, options on interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and forward sale commitments. 

Forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at a future date at a specified price or yield. A Eurodollar futures contract is a future on a Eurodollar deposit. Eurodollar futures contracts subject Regions to market risk associated 

with changes in interest rates. Because futures contracts are cash settled daily, there is minimal credit risk associated with Eurodollar futures. Interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically entered into to exchange fixed for variable (or vice versa) streams of interest payments. The notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a reference for the size of interest settlements. Interest rate options are contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a predetermined price and time. Forward sale commitments are contractual obligations to sell market instruments at a future date for an already agreed-upon price. Foreign currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency for another on a specified date and at a specified rate. These contracts are executed on behalf of the Company's customers and are used by customers to manage fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The Company is subject to the credit risk that another party will fail to perform. 

Regions has made use of interest rate swaps and floors in balance sheet hedging strategies to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-rate funding position to a variable-rate position and to effectively convert a portion of its variable-rate loan portfolios to fixed-rate. Regions also uses derivatives to economically manage interest rate and pricing risk associated with its mortgage origination business. In the period of time that elapses between the origination and sale of mortgage loans, changes in interest rates have the potential to cause a decline in the value of the loans in this held-for-sale portfolio. Futures contracts and forward sale commitments are used to protect the value of the loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in interest rates and pricing.

Variable rate indexes on swap and floor contracts reference a combination of short-term LIBOR benchmarks, primarily 1 month LIBOR. 

A portion of the cash flow hedging relationships designated in Table 21 above are forward starting, including $5.25 billion notional of the outstanding cash flow swaps and $2.0 billion notional of the outstanding cash flow floors. Interest rate swaps and floors of $5.3 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, became active during the first quarter of 2020. Forward starting swaps and floors have maturities of approximately five years from their respective start dates. 

The following table presents cash flow hedge notional amounts with start dates prior to the year-end periods shown through 2026. All cash flow hedge notional amounts mature prior to the end of 2027.

As forward starting cash flow hedges are transacted within the 12 month measurement horizon, they will reduce 12 month net interest income sensitivity levels as disclosed in Table 20 . 

(2) 

As of March 31, 2020, $10.75 billion of the $16.0 billion notional of the cash flow swaps and $4.75 billion of the $6.75 billion notional of the interest rate floors are active. During the second quarter of 2020, an additional $3.0 billion notional of interest rate swaps and $1.75 billion notional of interest rate floors will become active. During the third quarter of 2020 $250 million notional of interest rate swaps become active; and during the fourth quarter of 2020 $1.25 billion notional of interest rate swaps become active. The remaining $750 million notional of interest rate swaps and $250 million notional of interest rate floors become active in the first quarter of 2021. 

Regions manages the credit risk of these instruments in much the same way as it manages credit risk of the loan portfolios by establishing credit limits for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer transactions. For non-dealer transactions, the need for collateral is evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the financial strength of the counterparty. Credit risk is also reduced significantly by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements. When there is more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a legally enforceable master netting agreement in place, the exposure represents the net of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from and/or posted to that counterparty. All hedging interest rate swap derivatives traded by Regions are subject to mandatory clearing. The counterparty risk for cleared trades effectively moves from the executing broker to the clearinghouse allowing Regions to benefit from the risk mitigation controls in place at the respective clearinghouse. The &#8220;Credit Risk&#8221; section in Regions&#8217; Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 contains more information on the management of credit risk. 

Regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers. Interest rate swaps, interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most common derivatives sold to customers. Other derivative instruments with similar characteristics are used to hedge market risk and minimize volatility associated with this portfolio. Instruments used to service customers are held in the trading account, with changes in value recorded in the consolidated statements of income. 

The primary objective of Regions&#8217; hedging strategies is to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes, from an economic perspective, on net interest income and the net present value of its balance sheet. The overall effectiveness of these hedging strategies is subject to market conditions, the quality of Regions&#8217; execution, the accuracy of its valuation assumptions, counterparty credit risk and changes in interest rates. See Note 8 "Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities" to the consolidated financial statements for a tabular summary of Regions&#8217; quarter-end derivatives positions and further discussion. 

Regions accounts for residential MSRs at fair market value with any changes to fair value being recorded within mortgage income. Regions enters into derivative transactions to economically mitigate the impact of market value fluctuations related to residential MSRs. Derivative instruments entered into in the future could be materially different from the current risk profile of Regions&#8217; current portfolio. 

LIBOR Transition - In 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that by the end of 2021 panel banks will no longer be required to submit estimates that are used to construct LIBOR, confirming that the continuation of LIBOR will not be guaranteed beyond that date. Regions holds instruments that may be impacted by the likely discontinuance of LIBOR, including loans, investments, hedging products, floating-rate obligations and other financial instruments that use LIBOR as a benchmark rate. The Company cannot currently predict the full impact of the LIBOR discontinuation on net interest income or the related processes. However, Regions is coordinating with regulators and industry groups to identify appropriate alternative rates for contracts expiring after 2021, and preparing for this transition as it relates to both new and existing exposures. The Company has established a LIBOR Transition Program, which includes dedicated leadership and staff with all relevant business lines and support groups engaged. A LIBOR impact and risk assessment has been performed, which identified the associated risks across products, systems, models, and processes. Updated fallback language was incorporated into LIBOR-relevant contracts and customer facing communication which commenced with the launch of the regions.com/libor page. Steps to mitigate risks associated with the transition are being overseen by Regions&#8217; Executive LIBOR Steering Committee as part of the LIBOR Transition Program. Continuing activities of the LIBOR Transition Program include facilitating the transition of all financial and strategic processes, systems and models; performing assessments of the transition impact to contracts and products; evaluating necessary operational and infrastructure enhancements upon implementation of alternative benchmark rates; and coordinating communications with customers. 

MARKET RISK&#8212;PREPAYMENT RISK 

Regions, like most financial institutions, is subject to changing prepayment speeds on mortgage-related assets under different interest rate environments. Prepayment risk is a significant risk to earnings and specifically to net interest income . For example, mortgage loans and other financial assets may be prepaid by a debtor, so that the debtor may refinance its obligations at lower rates. As loans and other financial assets prepay in a falling rate environment, Regions must reinvest these funds in lower-yielding assets. Prepayments of assets carrying higher rates reduce Regions&#8217; interest income and overall asset yields. Conversely, in a rising rate environment, these assets will prepay at a slower rate, resulting in opportunity cost by not having the cash flow to reinvest at higher rates. Prepayment risk can also impact the value of securities and the carrying value of equity. Regions&#8217; greatest exposures to prepayment risks primarily rest in its mortgage-backed securities portfolio, the mortgage fixed-rate loan portfolio and the residential MSR, all of which tend to be sensitive to interest rate movements. Each of these assets is also exposed to prepayment risk due to factors which are not necessarily the result of interest rates, but rather due to changes in policies or programs related, either directly or indirectly, to the U.S. Government's governance over certain lending and financing within the mortgage market. Such policies can work to either encourage or discourage financing dynamics and represent a risk that is extremely difficult to forecast and may be the result of non-economic factors. The Company attempts to monitor and manage such exposures within reasonable expectations while acknowledging all such risks cannot be foreseen or avoided. Further, Regions has prepayment risk that would be reflected in non-interest income in the form of servicing income on the residential MSRs. Regions actively monitors prepayment exposure as part of its overall net interest income forecasting and interest rate risk management. 

LIQUIDITY 

Liquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of Regions and affects Regions&#8217; ability to meet the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of its customers. Regions maintains strong liquidity levels that position the Company to respond to stressed environments. As discussed below, Regions has a variety of liquidity sources, which it continues to utilize to fund customer needs. 

On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law as a response to the economic uncertainty amid the COVID-19 pandemic. A focus of the Act is the establishment of federally guaranteed loans for small businesses under the PPP. Regions, a certified SBA lender, has and will continue to assist its customers through the process of utilizing this program. As a lending institution in this program, additional liquidity is available to the Company through the Federal Reserve's Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility. Regions' use of this funding source will depend on how economic conditions develop and also on the continuing demand for PPP loans and other sources of liquidity. 

Regions intends to fund its obligations primarily through cash generated from normal operations. Regions also has obligations related to potential litigation contingencies. See Note 11 "Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees" to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the Company&#8217;s funding requirements. 

Assets, consisting principally of loans and securities, are funded by customer deposits, borrowed funds and shareholders&#8217; equity. Regions&#8217; goal in liquidity management is to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, while at the same time meeting the Company&#8217;s cash flow needs in normal and stressed conditions. Having and using various sources of liquidity to satisfy the Company&#8217;s funding requirements is important. 

In order to ensure an appropriate level of liquidity is maintained, Regions performs specific procedures including scenario analyses and stress testing at the bank, holding company, and affiliate levels. Regions' liquidity policy requires the holding company to maintain cash sufficient to cover the greater of (1) 18 months of debt service and other cash needs or (2) a minimum cash balance of $500 million. Cash and cash equivalents at the holding company totaled $1.6 billion at March 31, 2020 . Compliance with the holding company cash requirements is reported to the Risk Committee of the Board on a quarterly basis. Regions also has minimum liquidity requirements for the Bank and subsidiaries. These minimum requirements are informed by internal stress testing measures which are reflective of Regions' portfolio and business mix. The Bank's funding and contingency planning does not currently assume any reliance on short-term unsecured sources. Risk limits are established by the Board through its Risk Appetite Statement and Liquidity Policy. The Company's Board, LROC and ALCO regularly review compliance with the established limits. 

The securities portfolio is one of Regions&#8217; primary sources of liquidity. Proceeds from maturities and principal and interest payments of securities provide a constant flow of funds available for cash needs (see Note 2 "Debt Securities" to the consolidated financial statements). The agency guaranteed mortgage-backed securities portfolio is another source of liquidity in various secured borrowing capacities. 

Maturities in the loan portfolio also provide a steady flow of funds. Regions&#8217; liquidity is further enhanced by its relatively stable customer deposit base. Liquidity needs can also be met by borrowing funds in state and national money markets, although Regions does not assume reliance on short-term unsecured sources of funding. 

The balance with the FRB is the primary component of the balance sheet line item, &#8220;interest-bearing deposits in other banks.&#8221; At March 31, 2020 , Regions had approximately $3.2 billion in cash on deposit with the FRB, an increase from approximately $2.5 billion at December 31, 2019 . Refer to the "Cash and Cash Equivalents" section for more information. 

Regions&#8217; borrowing availability with the FRB as of March 31, 2020 , based on assets pledged as collateral on that date, was $15.3 billion. 

Regions&#8217; financing arrangement with the FHLB adds additional flexibility in managing the Company's liquidity position. As of March 31, 2020 , Regions&#8217; outstanding balance of FHLB borrowings was $7.8 billion and its total borrowing capacity from the FHLB totaled approximately $17.6 billion. FHLB borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral pledged to the FHLB. Regions Bank pledged certain securities, commercial and real estate mortgage loans, residential first mortgage loans on one-to-four family dwellings and home equity lines of credit as collateral for the outstanding FHLB advances. Additionally, investment in FHLB stock is required in relation to the level of outstanding borrowings. The FHLB has been and is expected to continue to be a reliable and economical source of funding. 

Regions maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC that can be utilized by Regions to issue various debt and/or equity securities. Additionally, Regions' Board has authorized Regions Bank to issue up to $10 billion in aggregate principal amount of bank notes outstanding at any one time. Refer to Note 12 "Borrowings" to the consolidated financial statements in the 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 

Regions may, from time to time, consider opportunistically retiring outstanding issued securities, including subordinated debt in privately negotiated or open market transactions for cash or common shares. Regulatory approval would be required for retirement of some instruments. 

CREDIT RISK 

Regions&#8217; objective regarding credit risk is to maintain a credit portfolio that provides for stable credit costs with acceptable volatility through an economic cycle. Regions has various processes to manage credit risk as described below. In order to assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio, Regions considers risk factors within the loan portfolio segments and classes, the current U.S. economic environment and that of its primary banking markets, as well as counterparty risk. See the &#8220;Portfolio Characteristics&#8221; section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for a discussion of risk characteristics of each loan type. 

INFORMATION SECURITY RISK 

Regions faces a variety of operational risks, including information security risks. Information security risks, such as evolving and adaptive cyber attacks that are conducted regularly against Regions and other large financial institutions to compromise or disable information systems, have generally increased in recent years. This trend is expected to continue for a number of reasons, including the proliferation of new technologies, including technology-based products and services used by us and our customers, the increasing use of mobile devices and cloud technologies, the ability to conduct more financial transactions online, and the increasing sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external parties or fraud on the part of employees. 

Regions devotes significant financial and non-financial resources to identify and mitigate threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of its information systems. Regions regularly assesses the threats and vulnerabilities to its environment so it can update and maintain its systems and controls to effectively mitigate these risks. Layered security controls are designed to complement each other to protect customer information and transactions. Regions regularly tests its control environment utilizing practices such as penetration testing and more targeted assessments to ensure its controls are working as expected. Regions will continue to commit the resources necessary to mitigate these growing cyber risks, as well as continue to develop and enhance controls, processes and technology to respond to evolving disruptive technology and to protect its systems from attacks or unauthorized access. In addition, Regions maintains a strong commitment to a comprehensive risk management program that includes due diligence and oversight of third-party relationships with vendors. 

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Regions has experienced a modest increase in cyber events, such as phishing attacks and malicious traffic from outside the United States. However, the Company's layered control environment has effectively detected and prevented any material impact related to these events. 

Regions&#8217; system of internal controls also incorporates an organization-wide protocol for the appropriate reporting and escalation of information security matters to management and the Board, to ensure effective and efficient resolution and, if necessary, disclosure of any matters. The Board is actively engaged in the oversight of Regions&#8217; continuous efforts to reinforce and enhance its operational resilience and receives education to ensure that their oversight efforts accommodate for the ever-evolving information security threat landscape. The Board monitors Regions&#8217; information management risk policies and practices primarily through its Risk Committee, which oversees areas of operational risk such as information technology activities; risks associated with development, infrastructure, and cybersecurity; approval and oversight of internal and third-party information security risk assessments, strategies, policies and programs; and disaster recovery, business continuity, and incident response plans. Additionally, the Board&#8217;s Audit Committee regularly reviews Regions&#8217; cybersecurity practices, mainly by receiving reports on the cybersecurity management program prepared by the Chief Information Security Officer, risk management, and Internal Audit. The Board annually reviews the information security program and, through its various committees, is briefed at least quarterly on information security matters. 

Regions participates in information sharing organizations such as FS-ISAC, to gather and share information with peer banks and other financial institutions to better prepare and protect its information systems from attack. FS-ISAC is a nonprofit organization whose objective is to protect the financial services sector against cyber and physical threats and risk. It acts as a trusted third party that provides anonymity to allow members to submit threat, vulnerability and incident information in a non-attributable and trusted manner so information that would normally not be shared is instead made available to other members for the greater good of the membership. In addition to FS-ISAC, Regions is a member of BITS. BITS serves the financial community and its members by providing industry best practices on a variety of security and fraud topics. 

Regions has contracts with vendors to provide denial of service mitigation. These vendors have also committed the necessary resources to support Regions in the event of a cyber event. Even though Regions devotes significant resources to combat cyber security risks, there is no guarantee that these measures will provide absolute security. As an additional security measure, Regions has engaged a computer forensics firm and an industry-leading consulting firm on retainer in case of a cyber event. Regions has also developed and maintains robust business continuity and disaster recovery plans that it could implement in the event of a cyber event so as to mitigate the effects of any such event and minimize necessary recovery time. Some of Regions' financial risk exposure with respect to data breaches may be offset by applicable insurance. 

Even if Regions successfully prevents cyber attacks to its own network, the Company may still incur losses that result from customers' account information being obtained through breaches of retailers' networks where customers have transacted business. The fraud losses, as well as the costs of investigations and re-issuing new customer cards, may impact Regions' financial results. In addition, Regions also relies on some vendors to provide certain components of its business infrastructure, and although Regions actively assesses and monitors the information security capabilities of these vendors, Regions' reliance on them may also increase exposure to information security risk. 

In the event of a cyber-attack or other data breach, Regions may be required to incur significant expenses, including with respect to remediation costs, costs of implementing additional preventative measures, addressing any reputational harm and addressing any related regulatory inquiries or civil litigation arising from the event. 

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES 

The provision for credit losses is used to maintain the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit losses at a level that in management&#8217;s judgment is appropriate to absorb expected credit losses over the contractual life of the loan and credit commitment portfolio at the balance sheet date. Regions adopted CECL on January 1, 2020. Upon adoption, Regions classified the provision for unfunded credit losses as provision for credit losses. Prior to 2020, the provision for unfunded credit losses was included in non-interest expense. The provision for credit losses totaled $373 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the provision for loan losses of $ 91 million during the first quarter of 2019 . Refer to the "Allowance for Credit Losses" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis for further detail.

Service charges on deposit accounts&#8212; Service charges on deposit accounts include non-sufficient fund and overdraft fees, corporate analysis service charges, overdraft protection fees and other customer transaction-related service charges. The increase during the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period of 2019 was primarily due to an increase in corporate analysis service charges, which were partially offset by a decrease in consumer service charges. However, service charges were negatively impacted during the first quarter of 2020 by a general decrease in spending late in the quarter associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. If recent spend levels persist, service charges on deposit accounts will continue to be negatively impacted. See the "First Quarter Overview" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis for further detail. 

Card and ATM fees&#8212; Card and ATM fees include the combined amounts of credit card/bank card income and debit card and ATM related revenue. The decrease in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period of 2019 was driven primarily by decreases in consumer credit card income as a result of decreased debit and credit card spend and transaction volumes associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. If recent spend levels persist, card and ATM fees will continue to be negatively impacted. See the "First Quarter Overview" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis for further detail. 

Capital markets income&#8212; Capital markets income primarily relates to capital raising activities that include securities underwriting and placement, loan syndication and placement, as well as foreign exchange, derivatives, merger and acquisition and other advisory services. The decrease in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period of 2019 was primarily driven by market-related credit valuation adjustments tied to customer derivatives, as well as a decline in merger and acquisition advisory fees reflecting the economic environment in the first quarter of 2020. The decreases were partially offset by increases in customer interest rate swap income and fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers. 

Mortgage income&#8212; Mortgage income is generated through the origination and servicing of residential mortgage loans for long-term investors and sales of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. The increase in mortgage income in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period of 2019 was due primarily to increases in loan production and sales income as lower interest rates during the current quarter increased loan applications and production. Additionally, MSR valuation adjustments and related hedge activity positively impacted mortgage income. 

Bank-owned life insurance&#8212; Bank-owned life insurance decrease d in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due primarily to a decrease in claims benefits in the first quarter of 2020 and favorable market adjustments in the first quarter of 2019. 

Securities gains (losses), net&#8212; Net securities gains (losses) primarily result from the Company's asset/liability management process. See Table 1 "Debt Securities" section for additional information. 

Market value adjustments on employee benefit assets&#8212; Market value adjustments on employee benefit assets, both defined benefit and other, are the reflection of market value variations related to assets held for certain employee benefits. The adjustments reported as employee benefit assets - other are offset in salaries and benefits. The decrease in market valuation adjustments for the other employee benefits assets during the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period of 2019 was due primarily to the decline in the equity markets. Furthermore, the Company repositioned its defined benefit employee benefits assets portfolio during the second quarter of 2019 into investments that are no longer subject to the volatility of the equity markets. 

Other miscellaneous income&#8212; Other miscellaneous income includes net revenue from affordable housing, valuation adjustments to equity investments, fees from safe deposit boxes, check fees and other miscellaneous income. Net revenue from affordable housing includes actual gains and losses resulting from the sale of affordable housing investments, cash distributions from the investments and any related impairment charges. Other miscellaneous income decrease d in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to an $8 million gain associated with the sale of $167 million of affordable housing residential mortgage loans that was recognized in the first quarter of 2019. This decrease was partially offset by increases in leveraged lease termination gains and commercial leasing income. If current economic conditions persist, non-marketable equity investments may be negatively impacted resulting in valuation declines or impairment.

(1) Upon adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, the provision for credit losses presented within net interest income after provision for credit losses is the sum of the provision for loan losses and the provision for unfunded credit commitments. Prior to the adoption of CECL, the provision for unfunded commitments was included in other non-interest expense. 

Salaries and employee benefits&#8212; Salaries and employee benefits consist of salaries, incentive compensation, long-term incentives, payroll taxes, and other employee benefits such as 401(k), pension, and medical, life and disability insurance, as well as, expenses from liabilities held for employee benefit purposes. Salaries and employee benefits decrease d during the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 , driven primarily by negative market value adjustments on employee benefit assets.

INCOME TAXES 

The Company&#8217;s income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was $42 million and $105 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 , resulting in effective taxes rates of 20.6 percent and 21.0 percent, respectively. 

Many factors impact the effective tax rate including, but not limited to, the level of pre-tax income, the mix of income between various tax jurisdictions with differing tax rates, net tax benefits related to affordable housing investments, bank-owned life insurance, tax-exempt interest, and nondeductible expenses. In addition, the effective tax rate is affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period-to-period, such as the termination of certain leveraged leases, share-based payments, valuation allowance changes and changes to unrecognized tax benefits. Accordingly, the comparability of the effective tax rate between periods may be impacted.

The increase in the net deferred tax liability was primarily due to an increase in unrealized gains on derivative instruments and available for sale securities, partially offset by an increase in the deferred tax asset related to the allowance due to the adoption of CECL and the first quarter 2020 increase in the allowance.
