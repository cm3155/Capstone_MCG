 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Executive Summary 

The following financial review provides a discussion of Synovus' financial condition, changes in financial condition, and results of operations as well as a summary of Synovus' critical accounting policies. This section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Report. 

Overview of 2019 Financial Results 

Net income available to common shareholders for 2019 was $540.9 million , an increase of 31.8% compared to $410.5 million for 2018. Net income per diluted common share was $3.47 in both 2019 and 2018. Adjusted net income available to common shareholders (1) for 2019 was $608.5 million , or $3.90 per diluted common share, an increase of 41.4% and 7.3% , respectively, compared to $430.3 million , or $3.64 per diluted common share, for 2018 . Results for 2019 include the impact of the Merger with FCB, which closed on January 1, 2019. Synovus incurred $56.6 million in merger-related expense associated with the FCB acquisition in 2019. Return on average assets for 2019 was 1.20% , down 15 basis points from 2018, and the adjusted return on average assets (1) was 1.35% for 2019, down 5 basis points from 2018. 

Net interest income for 2019 was $1.60 billion , up $447.4 million, or 39.0% , from 2018 , driven by the FCB acquisition. The net interest margin was 3.70% for 2019 , a decrease of 16 basis points from 2018 , impacted primarily by the FCB acquisition and declines in market interest rates which outpaced the decline in deposit pricing. The yield on earning assets increased 23 basis points to 4.74 % while the total cost of funds increased 41 basis points to 1.10%. 

Non-interest income for 2019 was $355.9 million , up $75.8 million, or 27.1% , compared to 2018 . The increase was primarily driven by the FCB acquisition, led by strong growth in capital markets income and expansion in all other revenue categories as well as increases in the fair value of private equity investments. Additionally, mortgage banking income was up significantly compared to 2018 due to the interest rate environment as well as the addition of mortgage originators. 

Non-interest expense for 2019 was $1.10 billion , an increase of $269.5 million , or 32.5% , compared to 2018 . Comparisons to prior year are impacted by the FCB acquisition and merger-related expense. The efficiency ratio-FTE for 2019 was 56.22% , down 182 basis points compared to 58.04% in 2018 . The adjusted tangible efficiency ratio (1) for 2019 was 51.82% , down 451 basis points compared to 56.33% in 2018 . 

Total loans ended the year at $37.16 billion , an $11.22 billion or 43.2% increase from a year ago, driven by the $9.29 billion Acquisition Date fair value of acquired FCB loans as well as organic growth. Adjusting December 31, 2018 for the Acquisition Date acquired balances, loan growth for 2019 was $1.93 billion, or 5.5%, and was driven by an $822.1 million, or 9.0%, increase in consumer loans, a $744.1 million, or 4.6%, increase in C&#38;I loans and a $355.4 million, or 3.5%, increase in CRE loans. 

Credit quality remained solid in 2019 with the NPA and NPL ratios improving to 0.37% and 0.27%, respectively, and total past dues were at 0.33%. Net charge-offs for 2019 were 16 basis points compared to 20 basis points for 2018 . The provision for loan losses for 2019 was $87.7 million compared to $51.7 million in 2018. The increase from 2018 was primarily the result of higher gross organic loan growth including renewal of maturing FCB loans as well as an increased level of net charge-offs including lower recoveries. The ALL at December 31, 2019 was $281.4 million, or 0.76% of total loans, compared to $250.6 million , or 0.97% of total loans, at December 31, 2018 , reflecting a lower ratio due to the impact of acquisition date accounting for acquired loans. 

Total deposits were $38.41 billion at December 31, 2019 , an increase of $11.69 billion , or 43.7% , compared to year-end 2018 , driven by the acquisition of FCB which contributed $10.93 billion in total deposits on the Acquisition Date. Adjusting December 31, 2018 for the Acquisition Date acquired balances, total deposits increased $754.5 million, or 2.0%, from 2018. 

During 2019 , Synovus repurchased $725.0 million , or 19.9 million shares, of common stock through open market transactions under its authorized share repurchase program. On February 7, 2019, Synovus completed a public offering of $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated debt and on July 1, 2019, Synovus completed a $350.0 million public offering of Tier 1 qualifying Series E Preferred Stock. Proceeds from the offerings were largely used to repurchase common stock. At December 31, 2019 , Synovus' regulatory capital levels continue to be well above regulatory capital requirements. 

More detail on Synovus' financial results for 2019 and 2018 can be found in subsequent sections of "Part II Item 7. &#8211; Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Report and detailed information on Synovus' financial results for 2017 can be found in "Part II Item 7. &#8211; Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of Synovus' 2018 Form 10-K.

Critical Accounting Policies 

The accounting and financial reporting policies of Synovus are in accordance with GAAP and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. Synovus has identified certain of its accounting policies as &#8220;critical accounting policies,&#8221; consisting of those related to the accounting for the allowance for loan losses, fair value measurements, and income taxes. In determining which accounting policies are critical in nature, Synovus has identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates. It is management's practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the Board of Directors' Audit Committee on a periodic basis, including the development, selection, implementation, and disclosure of the critical accounting policies. The application of these policies has a significant impact on Synovus&#8217; consolidated financial statements. Synovus&#8217; financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are applied in the application of these policies. 

Allowance for Loan Losses 

The allowance for loan losses is a significant accounting estimate that represents management's best estimate of probable losses inherent in the funded loan portfolio. The economic and business climate in any given industry or market is difficult to gauge and can change rapidly, and the effects of those changes can vary by borrower. Significant judgments and estimates are necessary in the determination of the allowance for loan losses. Significant judgments include, among others, loan risk ratings and classifications, the determination and measurement of impaired loans, the timing of loan charge-offs, the probability of loan defaults, the net loss exposure in the event of loan defaults, the loss emergence period, qualitative loss factors, as well as other qualitative considerations. In determining the allowance for loan losses, management makes numerous assumptions, estimates, and assessments, which are inherently subjective. The use of different estimates or assumptions could have a significant impact on the provision for loan losses, allowance for loan losses, non-performing loans, loan charge-offs, financial condition, and results of operations. A detailed discussion of the methodology used in determining the ALL as well as information regarding recently issued accounting standards related to the allowance are included in "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of this Report. 

Fair Value Measurements 

Synovus evaluates assets, liabilities, and other financial instruments that are either required or elected to be recorded, reported, or disclosed at fair value. The fair value of these instruments is determined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an &#8220;exit price&#8221;) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Synovus updates the fair value measurements of each instrument on a periodic basis, but no less than quarterly. 

Synovus selects the most appropriate technique for determining the fair value of the asset or liability. The degree of management judgment involved in determining fair value is dependent upon the availability of quoted prices or observable market data. There is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring the fair value of financial instruments based on quoted market prices; however, when quoted prices and observable market data are not available, Synovus uses a valuation technique requiring significant judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 13 - Fair Value Accounting" of this Report for further discussion of fair value measurements and Synovus' use of various fair value methodologies and the types of assets and liabilities in which fair value accounting is applied. 

Synovus accounts for acquired assets and liabilities at their respective fair values using the acquisition method of accounting. Determination of the fair value often involves estimates based on third party valuations or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques, which are inherently subjective. Additionally, the amortization of identified intangible assets is based upon the estimated economic benefits to be received, which is also subjective. Typically, acquisitions result in the recognition of goodwill, which is subject to periodic impairment tests. Synovus applies ASC 350-20-35-3A, Goodwill Subsequent Measurement - Qualitative Assessment, for its determination of impairment . Refer to "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" in this Report for a description of the impairment testing process and key assumptions management utilizes to perform its qualitative assessment. 

Income taxes 

The calculation of Synovus&#8217; income tax provision is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments in its determination. As part of Synovus&#8217; overall business strategy, management must consider tax laws and regulations that apply to the specific facts and circumstances under consideration. As such, the Company is often required to exercise significant judgment regarding the interpretation of these tax laws and regulations, in which Synovus' anticipated and actual liability could significantly vary based upon the taxing authority&#8217;s interpretation. Specifically, significant estimates in accounting for income taxes relate to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, estimates of the realizability of income tax credits, utilization of NOLs, the determination of taxable income, and the determination of uncertain tax positions and temporary differences between book and 

tax bases. Adjustments to these items may occur due to modifications in tax rates, newly enacted laws, issuance of tax regulations, resolution of items with taxing authorities, alterations to interpretative statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance that affects the Company&#8217;s tax positions, methods or election s changes, or other facts and circumstances. Management closely monitors tax developments and the potential timing of these changes in order to evaluate the effect they may have on the Company&#8217;s overall tax position and the estimates and judgments used in determining the income tax provision and records adjustments as necessary. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 18 - Income Taxes" in this Report for additional details. 

DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Investment Securities Available for Sale 

The investment securities portfolio consists primarily of high-quality liquid debt securities classified as available for sale. The on-going investment philosophy for the securities portfolio focuses on maintaining a readily accessible source of liquidity while also supporting the income and interest rate risk management objectives of the Company. At the beginning of 2019, Synovus acquired $2.30 billion of investment securities related to the FCB merger. Certain securities from that portfolio were repositioned during the year to more closely align with Synovus' investment philosophy. Additionally, Synovus strategically repositioned certain securities in its legacy portfolio to improve liquidity and portfolio performance. 

The investment securities portfolio had a weighted average duration of 3.5 years at December 31, 2019 , which compared to 4.1 years at December 31, 2018 . The reduction in portfolio duration was primarily attributable to the increase in anticipated prepayment rates as a result of the decline in long-term interest rates. See Table 7 - Maturities and Weighted Average Yields of Investment Securities Available for Sale in this Report for maturity and average yield information of the investment securities available for sale portfolio. 

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the estimated fair value of investment securities available for sale as a percentage of their amortized cost was 102.0% and 97.7%, respectively. The investment securities available for sale portfolio had gross unrealized gains of $133.4 million and gross unrealized losses of $2.5 million , for a net unrealized gain of $130.9 million as of December 31, 2019 . The investment securities available for sale portfolio had gross unrealized gains of $6.3 million and gross unrealized losses of $100.6 million , for a net unrealized loss of $94.3 million as of December 31, 2018 . Shareholders&#8217; equity included net unrealized gains of $83.7 million and net unrealized losses of $83.2 million on the available for sale portfolio as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 

The average balance of investment securities available for sale increased to $ 6.76 billion in 2019 from $ 4.08 billion in 2018 , due primarily to the acquisition of FCB. The portfolio earned a taxable-equivalent rate of 3.09 % and 2.38 % for 2019 and 2018 , respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , average investment securities available for sale represented 15.6% and 13.7%, respectively, of average interest earning assets. 

The following table shows investment securities available for sale by type as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 .

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START * 

Loan balance in each category is before net deferred fees and costs and is expressed as a percentage of total loans, net of deferred fees and costs. 

##TABLE_END Total loans ended the year at $37.16 billion , an $11.22 billion , or 43.2% , increase from a year ago, driven by the $9.29 billion Acquisition Date fair value of acquired FCB loans as well as organic growth. Adjusting December 31, 2018 for the Acquisition Date acquired balances, loan growth for 2019 was $1.93 billion, or 5.5%, and was driven by an $822.1 million, or 9.0%, increase in consumer loans, a $744.1 million, or 4.6%, increase in C&#38;I loans and a $355.4 million, or 3.5%, increase in CRE loans. The mix remains in-line with Synovus' targeted portfolio mix. C&#38;I loans remain the largest component of our balance sheet representing 45.2% of total loans, while CRE and consumer loans represent 28.2% and 26.6%, respectively. 

Commercial Loans 

Total commercial loans (which are comprised of C&#38;I and CRE loans) at December 31, 2019 were $27.26 billion , or 73.4% of the total loan portfolio compared to $19.35 billion, or 74.5% at December 31, 2018 . 

At December 31, 2019 Synovus had six commercial loan relationships with total commitments of $100.0 million or more (including amounts funded) with no single relationship exceeding $150.0 million in commitments. 

Commercial and Industrial Loans 

The C&#38;I loan portfolio represents the largest category of Synovus' total loan portfolio and is primarily comprised of general middle market and commercial banking clients across a diverse set of industries. The following table shows the composition of the C&#38;I loan portfolio aggregated by NAICS code. In accordance with Synovus' lending policy, each loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process which incorporates uniform underwriting standards and oversight in proportion to the size and complexity of the lending relationship. As of December 31, 2019 , 92.6% of Synovus' C&#38;I loans are secured by collateral such as business equipment, inventory, and real estate. C&#38;I loans of $16.78 billion, or 45.2% of the total loan portfolio, were up $4.00 billion, or 31.3%, from December 31, 2018 including Acquisition Date fair value of acquired FCB loans of $3.26 billion. Organic growth was driven primarily by continued strong contributions from our middle market banking, healthcare, premium finance, and structured lending teams within our Wholesale Banking segment.

##TABLE_START * 

Loan balance in each category expressed as a percentage of total C&#38;I loans. 

##TABLE_END At December 31, 2019 , $10.25 billion , or 27.6% of the total loan portfolio, represented loans for the purpose of financing commercial, financial, and agricultural business activities. The primary source of repayment on these loans is revenue generated from products or services offered by the business or organization. The secondary source of repayment is the collateral, which consists primarily of equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, time deposits, cash surrender value of life insurance, and other business assets. 

At December 31, 2019 , $6.53 billion , or 17.6% , of the total loan portfolio, represented loans for the purpose of financing owner-occupied properties. The financing of owner-occupied facilities is considered a C&#38;I loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral. This treatment is a result of the credit decision process, which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt. The secondary source of repayment on these loans is the underlying real estate. These loans are predominately secured by owner-occupied and other real estate, and to a lesser extent, other types of collateral. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans 

CRE loans primarily consist of income-producing investment properties loans. Additionally, CRE loans include 1-4 family properties loans as well as land and development loans. Total CRE loans were $10.48 billion , or 28.2 % of the total loan portfolio, at December 31, 2019 , and increase d $3.92 billion , or 59.7% , from December 31, 2018 driven by the FCB acquisition, which included $3.56 billion of CRE on the Acquisition Date. Organic loan growth was led primarily by growth in income-producing investment properties. 

Investment Properties Loans 

Investment properties loans consist of construction and mortgage loans for income-producing properties and are primarily made to finance multi-family properties, hotels, office buildings, shopping centers, warehouses and other commercial development properties. Total investment properties loans as of December 31, 2019 were $9.04 billion , or 86.3% of the total CRE loan portfolio, and 24.3% of the total loan portfolio, compared to $5.56 billion , or 84.7% of the total CRE loan portfolio, and 21.4% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 . The increase in investment properties was driven by the FCB acquisition, which included $3.10 billion of acquired investment properties loans on the Acquisition Date. Organic loan growth was driven by increases in most sub-categories including shopping centers, hotels, and multi-family. 

The following table shows the principal categories of the investment properties loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 and 2018 .

##TABLE_END

* Loan balance in each category expressed as a percentage of total investment properties loans. 

1-4 Family Properties Loans 

1-4 family properties loans include construction loans to homebuilders and commercial mortgage loans related to 1-4 family rental properties and are almost always secured by the underlying property being financed by such loans. These properties are primarily located in the markets served by Synovus. At December 31, 2019 , 1-4 family properties loans totaled $ 780.0 million , or 7.4% of the total CRE loan portfolio, and 2.1 % of the total loan portfolio, compared to $ 679.9 million , or 10.4% of the total CRE loan portfolio, and 2.7 % of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 . Outside of $170.1 million loans acquired from FCB on the Acquisition Date, 1-4 family properties loans declined $70.0 million, compared to December 31, 2018 . 

Land and Development Loans 

Land and development loans include commercial and residential development as well as land acquisition loans and are secured by land held for future development, typically in excess of one year. Properties securing these loans are substantially within markets served by Synovus, and loan terms generally include personal guarantees from the principals. Loans in this portfolio are underwritten based on the LTV of the collateral and the capacity of the guarantor(s). Land and development loans were $ 657.8 million at December 31, 2019 , or 6.3% of the total CRE loan portfolio and 1.8% of the total loan portfolio compared to $323.7 million at December 31, 2018 , or 4.9% of the CRE loan portfolio and 1.2% of the total loan portfolio. The $ 334.1 million increase from December 31, 2018 was driven by $289.7 million of loans acquired from FCB on the Acquisition Date. Outside of the acquisition, land and development loans increased organically by $44.4 million, compared to December 31, 2018 . 

Consumer Loans 

The consumer loan portfolio consists of a wide variety of loan products offered through Synovus' banking network including first and second residential mortgages, HELOCs, and credit card loans, as well as growth in home improvement loans and student loans from third-party lending partnerships. The majority of Synovus' consumer loans are consumer mortgages and HELOCs secured by first and second liens on residential real estate primarily located in the markets served by Synovus. 

Consumer loans as of December 31, 2019 were $9.92 billion , or 26.6 % of the total loan portfolio compared to $6.63 billion , or 25.5% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 . Consumer loans increased by $3.30 billion , or 49.8% , from December 31, 2018 primarily driven by $2.48 billion of loans acquired from FCB on the Acquisition Date. 

Consumer mortgages increased $2.61 billion , or 89.0% from December 31, 2018 , driven by $2.40 billion in consumer mortgages acquired from FCB on the Acquisition Date. Organic growth was the result of solid production driven by disciplined talent acquisition and the interest rate environment. HELOCs increased $197.4 million , or 13.0% from December 31, 2018, driven by organic growth and FCB acquired loans of $65.9 million on the Acquisition Date. Credit card loans totaled $ 268.8 million at December 31, 2019 , including $67.0 million of commercial credit card loans, and increased $10.6 million, or 4.1%, through organic growth, compared to $258.2 million at December 31, 2018 . Other consumer loans increased $479.6 million , or 25.0% , to $2.40 billion at December 31, 2019 , primarily due to third-party lending partnerships. As of December 31, 2019 , these partnerships had combined balances of $1.98 billion , or 5.3% of the total loan portfolio, up from $1.57 billion, or 6.0% of the total loan portfolio, at December 31, 2018 . 

The following table shows the composition of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 , 2018 , 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 .

Total deposits were $38.41 billion at December 31, 2019 , an increase of $11.69 billion , or 43.7% , compared to year-end 2018 , driven by the acquisition of FCB which contributed $10.93 billion in total deposits on the Acquisition Date. Adjusting December 31, 2018 for the Acquisition Date acquired balances, total deposits increased $754.5 million, or 2.0%. During 2019, Synovus remixed the deposit base by allowing higher cost time deposits and public funds to run off with offsetting growth in money market accounts, non-interest-bearing deposits, and lower priced public funds. On an average basis, total deposits of $37.83 billion were up $11.49 billion, or 43.6%, in 2019, driven by the acquisition of FCB.

##TABLE_END

Net interest income (interest income less interest expense) is the largest component of total revenues, representing earnings from the primary business of gathering funds from customer deposits and other sources, and investing those funds primarily in loans and investment securities. Synovus&#8217; long-term objective is to manage those assets and liabilities to maximize net interest income while balancing interest rate, credit, liquidity, and capital risks. 

Net interest income for 2019 was $1.60 billion , up $447.4 million, or 39.0% , from $1.15 billion in 2018 . On a taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income increased $449.9 million, or 39.2%, from 2018 . During 2019 , average earning assets increased $13.49 billion, or 45.2%, primarily as a result of increases in net loans and investment securities driven by the FCB acquisition. 

Net Interest Margin 

Net interest margin is a measure of the spread between interest earning assets relative to the cost of funding and can be used to assess the efficiency of earnings from balance sheet activities. The net interest margin is affected by changes in interest earning asset yields, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, the percentage of interest earning assets funded by non-interest-bearing funding sources, and the mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 

The net interest margin was 3.70% for 2019 , a decrease of 16 basis points from 3.86% in 2018 , with the decline due, in part, to declines in market interest rates which outpaced the decline in deposit pricing. The yield on earning assets increased 23 basis points to 4.74 % from 4.51% in 2018, and the cost of funds increased 41 basis points from 0.69% in 2018 to 1.10% (the cost of funds includes non-interest-bearing demand deposits). Net interest income and net interest margin for 2019 were favorably impacted by $95.0 million, or 23 basis points, of purchase accounting adjustments primarily comprised of $48.2 million of loan accretion (excess over contractual interest), $2.3 million of investment securities accretion, and $43.8 million of deposit premium amortization. 

The primary components of the yield on interest earning assets are loan yields, yields on investment securities, and the yield on balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank. The factors positively impacting earning asset yields were an 18 basis points increase in loan yields as well as a 71 basis points increase in investment securities yields primarily driven by the FCB acquisition including purchase accounting income accretion. 

The primary factors impacting the cost of funds during 2019 were a 59 basis points increase in the cost of money market deposit accounts, a 26 basis points increase in the cost of time deposits, and a 54 basis points increase in the cost of long-term debt driven primarily by the FCB acquisition, a continued firming in deposit costs as a result of the lagged effect from the Federal Reserve's effort to increase policy rates and reduce the size of their balance sheet in 2018 and early 2019, and the issuance of $300.0 million of subordinated debt in February 2019.

##TABLE_END

Salaries and other personnel expense increase d $116.6 million , or 25.7% , compared to 2018 , including the impact of FCB, talent additions, higher production-based commission and incentive compensation expense, and annual merit increases. Regular base salaries were up $67.7 million, or 22.6%, and production-based commission and incentive compensation expense was up $27.8 million, or 47.5%, from 2018. Synovus employees totaled 5,389, up 738, or 15.9%, from December 31, 2018, due primarily to the FCB acquisition. 

Net occupancy and equipment expense increase d $31.4 million , or 24.1% , compared to 2018 , driven primarily by an additional 51 branches from the acquisition of FCB and additional investments in technology made during 2018 and 2019. Synovus Bank's branch network consisted of 298 and 249 branches at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 

Third-party processing and other services expense includes all third-party core operating system and processing charges as well as third-party servicing charges. Third-party processing expense increase d $17.1 million , or 29.1% , compared to 2018 driven by continued loan growth and contract updates from Synovus' consumer-based lending partnerships and the acquisition of FCB. 

FDIC insurance and other regulatory fees increase d $7.2 million compared to 2018 due primarily to the acquisition of FCB as well as a $3.0 million increase related to reclassification of certain loan categories over the past four years, somewhat offset by the FDIC's elimination of the surcharge assessment for all large banks in the fourth quarter of 2018. The FDIC removed the surcharge assessments when the deposit insurance fund reached the required level of 1.35% at September 30, 2018. 

In connection with the FCB acquisition, Synovus incurred merger-related expense of $56.6 million and $10.1 million, in 2019 and 2018, respectively, which primarily related to employment compensation agreements, severance, and professional services. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2 - Acquisitions" in this Report for more information on the acquisition of FCB. 

Amortization of intangibles increase d $10.4 million compared to 2018 , due to the amortization of the core deposit intangible asset created from the FCB acquisition, which will be amortized using an accelerated method over an estimated life of 10 years. 

Earnout liability fair value adjustments associated with the Global One acquisition are the result of higher than projected earnings and higher earnings estimates over the remaining contractual earnout period. 

During 2019, Synovus repositioned certain assets and liabilities to improve portfolio performance and lower funding costs and incurred a $4.6 million net loss on early extinguishment of debt from the termination of an assumed $150.0 million long-term FHLB obligation from the FCB acquisition. 

During 2019 and 2018, Synovus recorded $2.5 million and $2.3 million, respectively, in valuation adjustments to the Visa derivative following Visa's announcements to fund its litigation escrow account. Additionally, during 2019, Synovus recorded $1.1 million in valuation adjustments to the Visa derivative based on management's estimate of the timing of the Covered Litigation settlement and the resulting payments to the counterparty under the terms of the contract. 

Restructuring charges of $1.2 million recorded during 2019 consist primarily of severance charges for termination benefits incurred due to a reorganization in Synovus' technology and operations departments. The accrual balance for severance charges was $1.1 million at December 31, 2019. 

Fluctuations in other operating expenses in 2019 included increases of $6.4 million in travel expenses, $3.9 million in other loan expenses, $2.0 million in postage and freight expenses, and $1.0 million in training expenses, due primarily to the acquisition of FCB. 

Income Taxes 

Income tax expense was $201.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $118.9 million and $204.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was 26.3% , 21.7% and 42.6% , respectively. The Federal statutory rate was 21% in 2019 and 2018, and 35% in 2017. The increase in the effective tax rate from 2018 to 2019 was largely driven by FCB acquisition-related factors such as non-deductible merger-related expenses including limitation of the deductibility of certain performance-based compensation and further limitations on deductibility of FDIC insurance premiums, as well as $9.8 million in tax benefits in 2018 associated with 2017 Federal Tax Reform. 

Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. At December 31, 2019 , net deferred tax assets were $65.1 million compared to $141.1 million at December 31, 2018 . 

Synovus currently expects to realize the $65.1 million in net deferred tax assets well in advance of the statutory carryforward period. At December 31, 2019 , $20.5 million, or 31.5%, of the net deferred tax asset relates to federal and state net operating losses which have expiration dates beginning in 2023 through 2036. State tax credits at December 31, 2019 total $21.1 million and have expiration dates through the tax year 2029. Additionally, $23.4 million of the net deferred tax assets have no expiration date as of 

December 31, 2019 . See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 18 - Income Taxes" of this Report for additional discussion regarding deferred income taxes. 

Credit Quality 

Credit quality remained solid in 2019 with the NPA and NPL ratios improving to 0.37% and 0.27%, respectively, and total past dues were at 0.33%.

Non-accruing TDRs of $17.1 million at December 31, 2019 decreased $9.2 million from December 31, 2018 . Accruing TDRs were $133.1 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $115.6 million at December 31, 2018 , an increase of $17.6 million , or 15.2% . The primary driver of the increase in accruing TDRs and decline in non-accruing TDRs compared to December 31, 2018 is a result of a large TDR relationship being upgraded in the second quarter of 2019 from non-accruing to accruing status based on the extent of its payment performance and the expectation of the collectability of all contractual amounts. 

Accruing TDRs are considered performing because they are performing in accordance with the restructured terms. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , approximately 99% and 98%, respectively, of accruing TDRs were current . In addition, subsequent defaults on accruing TDRs (defaults defined as the earlier of the TDR being placed on non-accrual status or reaching 90 days past due with respect to principal and/or interest payments within twelve months of the TDR designation) have continued to remain at low levels. 

The table below shows accruing TDRs by risk grade at December 31, 2019 and 2018 .

Past Due Loans 

As a percentage of total loans outstanding, loans 30 or more days past due and still accruing interest were 0.33% and 0.22% at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. As a percentage of total loans outstanding, loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest were 0.04% and 0.01% at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively. These loans are in the process of collection, and management believes that sufficient collateral value securing these loans exists to cover contractual interest and principal payments. 

Potential Problem Loans 

Potential problem loans are defined by management as certain performing loans with a well-defined weakness where there is information about possible credit problems of borrowers which causes management to have doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present repayment terms of such loans. Potential problem commercial loans consist of substandard accruing loans but exclude both loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest and substandard accruing TDRs, which are reported separately. Management&#8217;s current expectation of probable losses from potential problem loans is included in the ALL, and management cannot predict at this time whether these potential problem loans ultimately will become NPLs or result in losses. For more information on potential problem loans not included in this section, see the loan portfolio credit exposure by risk grade tables and additional risk grade information in "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4 - Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses" in this Report. 

Net Charge-offs 

Total 2019 net charge-offs were $57.6 million , or 0.16% , of average loans, compared to total net charge-offs of $50.4 million , or 0.20% of average loans in 2018 . The following table shows net charge-offs (recoveries) by portfolio class for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 .

##TABLE_END Provision for Loan Losses and Allowance for Loan Losses 

See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4 - Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses" and "Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies" of this Report for further information. 

Provision for loan losses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $87.7 million and $51.7 million , respectively. The $36.0 million or 69.7% year-over-year increase from 2018 was primarily driven by higher gross organic loan growth including renewal of maturing FCB loans (i.e., provisioning for acquired loans subsequent to the acquisition date) as well as an increased level of net charge-offs including lower recoveries. The provision for loan losses covered 152% and 103% of net charge-offs for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 

The ALL at December 31, 2019 was $281.4 million , or 0.76% of total loans, compared to $250.6 million , or 0.97% of total loans, at December 31, 2018 , reflecting a lower ratio due to the impact of acquisition date accounting for acquired loans. The allowance to NPLs (excluding acquired NPLs with no reserve) at December 31, 2019 remained strong at 279% compared to 235% at December 31, 2018 , and the allowance to NPLs (excluding impaired loans with no reserve and acquired NPLs with no reserve) at December 31, 2019 was 361% compared to 298% at December 31, 2018 . 

A summary by loan category of loans charged off, recoveries of loans previously charged off, and additions to the allowance through provision for loan losses for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 is presented in the following table:

Capital Resources 

Synovus and Synovus Bank are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by their primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve. Synovus and Synovus Bank measure capital adequacy using the standardized approach to the Basel III Final Rule. At December 31, 2019 , Synovus and Synovus Bank's capital levels remained strong and exceeded well-capitalized requirements currently in effect. The following table presents certain ratios used to measure Synovus and Synovus Bank's capitalization.

##TABLE_START (1) &#160; 

See "Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measures" of this Report for applicable reconciliation to GAAP measure. 

##TABLE_END At December 31, 2019 , Synovus' CET1 ratio was 8.95% under the Basel III transitional provisions, and the estimated fully phased-in CET1 ratio was 8.93% (1) , consistent with Synovus' target of a 9% CET1 ratio, and both are well in excess of regulatory requirements including the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%. For additional information on regulatory capital requirements, see "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11 - Regulatory Capital" in this Report. Management currently believes, based on internal capital analyses and earnings projections, that Synovus' capital position is adequate to meet current and future regulatory minimum capital requirements inclusive of the capital conservation buffer. 

On February 7, 2019, Synovus completed a public offering of $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.900% Fixed-to-Fixed Rate Subordinated Notes due in 2029 and on July 1, 2019, Synovus completed a $350.0 million public offering of Tier 1 qualifying Series E Preferred Stock. Proceeds from the offerings were largely used to repurchase common stock under the share repurchase authorization. 

During 2019 , Synovus repurchased $725.0 million of common stock and during both 2018 and 2017 , Synovus repurchased $175.0 million of common stock. 

On June 21, 2018, Synovus completed a public offering of $200.0 million Tier 1 qualifying Series D Preferred Stock. The offering generated net proceeds of $195.1 million, which were largely used to fund the redemption of all of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock on August 1, 2018 for an aggregate redemption price of $130.0 million. 

In December 2018, the federal banking regulators adopted as final the transitional arrangements to permit banking organizations to phase-in the day-one impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13, referred to as CECL, on regulatory capital over a period of three 

years. Synovus expects to elect the phase-in option upon adoption of CECL. For additional information on CECL, see "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in this Report. 

On January 24, 2020, Synovus announced that its Board of Directors approved a 10% increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.33 per share, effective with the quarterly dividend payable in April 2020. Additionally, Synovus' Board of Directors authorized share repurchases in 2020 at a level that would be consistent with Synovus retaining a 9% CET1 ratio target. 

Parent Company 

The Parent Company&#8217;s net assets consist primarily of its investment in Synovus Bank. The Parent Company&#8217;s primary uses of cash are for the servicing of debt, payment of dividends to shareholders, and repurchases of common stock. The Parent Company also provides the necessary funds to strengthen the capital of its subsidiaries if needed. These uses of cash are primarily funded by dividends from Synovus Bank, borrowings from external sources, and equity offerings. 

During 2019, Synovus Bank paid upstream cash dividends to the Parent Company totaling $400.0 million. During 2018, Synovus Bank and non-bank subsidiaries made upstream cash distributions to the Parent Company totaling $260.0 million including cash dividends of $250.0 million. During 2017, Synovus Bank and non-bank subsidiaries made upstream cash distributions to the Parent Company totaling $451.0 million including cash dividends of $283.2 million. 

Effective January 1, 2019 (the "Acquisition Date"), Synovus completed its acquisition of all of the outstanding stock of FCB, a bank holding company based in Weston, Florida, for total consideration of $1.63 billion . Effective January 1, 2019, FCB's wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Florida Community Bank, National Association, merged into Synovus Bank. 

Liquidity 

Liquidity represents the extent to which Synovus has readily available sources of funding to meet the needs of depositors, borrowers and creditors, to support asset growth, and to otherwise sustain operations of Synovus and its subsidiaries, at a reasonable cost, on a timely basis, and without adverse consequences. ALCO monitors Synovus' economic, competitive, and regulatory environment and is responsible for measuring, monitoring, and reporting on liquidity and funding risk, interest rate risk, and market risk. ALCO, operating under liquidity and funding policies approved by the Board of Directors, actively analyzes contractual and anticipated cash flows in order to properly manage Synovus&#8217; liquidity position. 

Contractual and anticipated cash flows are analyzed under normal and stressed conditions to determine forward looking liquidity needs and sources. Synovus analyzes liquidity needs under various scenarios of market conditions and operating performance. This analysis includes stress testing and measures expected sources and uses of funds under each scenario. Emphasis is placed on maintaining numerous sources of current and potential liquidity to allow Synovus to meet its obligations to depositors, borrowers, and creditors on a timely basis. 

Liquidity is generated primarily through maturities and repayments of loans by customers, maturities and sales of investment securities, core deposit growth, and access to sources of funds other than deposits. Management continuously monitors and maintains appropriate levels of liquidity so as to provide adequate funding sources to manage customer deposit withdrawals, loan requests, and funding maturities. 

Synovus Bank also generates liquidity through the issuance of brokered certificates of deposit and money market accounts. Synovus Bank accesses these funds from a broad geographic base to diversify its sources of funding and liquidity. In addition, Synovus Bank has the capacity to access funding through its membership in the FHLB system. At December 31, 2019 , based on currently pledged collateral, Synovus Bank had access to incremental funding of $1.09 billion, subject to FHLB credit policies, through utilization of FHLB advances. 

In addition to bank level liquidity management, Synovus must manage liquidity at the parent company level for various operating needs including the servicing of debt, the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock, share repurchases, payment of general corporate expenses and potential capital infusions into subsidiaries. The primary source of liquidity for Synovus consists of dividends from Synovus Bank, which is governed by certain rules and regulations of the GA DBF and the Federal Reserve Bank. Synovus' ability to receive dividends from Synovus Bank in future periods will depend on a number of factors, including, without limitation, Synovus Bank's future profits, asset quality, liquidity, and overall condition. In addition, GA DBF rules and related statutes contain limitations on payments of dividends by Synovus without the approval of the GA DBF. 

During 2019, Synovus completed issuances of $300.0 million in subordinated debt and $350.0 million in preferred stock with proceeds from the offerings primarily used to repurchase 19.9 million shares of common stock. For additional information on these offerings, see "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9 - Long-term Debt and Short-term Borrowings" and "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10 - Shareholders' Equity and Other Comprehensive Income" in this Report. 

Synovus presently believes that the sources of liquidity discussed above, including existing liquid funds on hand, are sufficient to meet its anticipated funding needs. However, if economic conditions were to significantly deteriorate, regulatory capital requirements for Synovus or Synovus Bank increase as the result of regulatory directives or otherwise, or Synovus believes it is prudent to enhance current liquidity levels, then Synovus may seek additional liquidity from external sources. See "Part I &#8211; Item 1A. Risk Factors - Changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market may adversely affect our capital resources, liquidity and financial results ." Furthermore, Synovus may, from time to time, take advantage of attractive market opportunities to refinance its existing debt, redeem its preferred stock, or strengthen its liquidity or capital position. 

Contractual Cash Obligations 

The following table summarizes, by remaining maturity, Synovus&#8217; significant contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2019 . Excluded from the table below are certain liabilities with variable cash flows and/or no contractual maturity. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies" of this Report for information on Synovus' commitments to extend credit including loan commitments and letters of credit along with obligations related to Synovus' sponsorship of MPS businesses. Additionally, see "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 8 - Deposits" of this Report for information on contractual maturities of time deposits.

Earning Assets and Sources of Funds 

Average total assets for 2019 increased $15.12 billion, or 47.8%, to $46.79 billion as compared to average total assets of $31.67 billion for 2018 . Average earning assets increased $13.49 billion, or 45.2%, in 2019 as compared to the prior year and represented 92.6% of average total assets for 2019, as compared to 94.3% in 2018 . The increase in average earning assets resulted primarily from a $10.76 billion increase in average loans, net, and a $2.68 billion increase in average investment securities primarily attributable to the FCB acquisition. 

Average interest-bearing liabilities for 2019 of $31.97 billion increased $11.18 billion, or 53.8%, from $20.78 billion in 2018, and primarily related to the $10.93 billion in deposits acquired from FCB. Average time deposits, average money market deposits, and average interest-bearing demand deposits increased $5.23 billion, $3.01 billion, and $1.46 billion, respectively, from 2018. Average non-interest-bearing demand deposits also increased $1.70 billion, or 22.3%, to $9.36 billion compared to 2018 . Additionally, average other short-term borrowings for 2019 increased $960.4 million, and average long-term debt for 2019 increased $411.1 million, primarily due to the $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated debt issued in February 2019. 

For more detailed information on the average balance sheets for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , refer to Table 15 - Average Balances, Interest, and Yields/Rates . 

The table below shows the maturities of total commercial loans as of December 31, 2019 . Also provided are the amounts due after one year, classified according to the sensitivity in interest rates. Actual repayments of loans may differ from the contractual maturities reflected therein because borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with and without prepayment penalties. Additionally, the refinancing of such loans or the potential delinquency of such loans could create differences between the contractual maturities and the actual repayment of such loans.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The measures entitled adjusted non-interest income; adjusted non-interest expense; adjusted total revenues; adjusted tangible efficiency ratio; adjusted return on average assets; adjusted net income available to common shareholders; adjusted net income per common share, diluted; adjusted return on average common equity; return on average tangible common equity; adjusted return on average tangible common equity; tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio; and CET1 ratio (fully phased-in) are not measures recognized under GAAP and therefore are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The most comparable GAAP measures to these measures are total non-interest income, total non-interest expense, total revenues, efficiency ratio-FTE, return on average assets, net income available to common shareholders, net income per common share, diluted, return on average common equity, the ratio of total shareholders&#8217; equity to total assets, and the CET1 ratio, respectively. 

Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful additional information about Synovus to assist management and investors in evaluating Synovus&#8217; operating results, financial strength, the performance of its business, and the strength of its capital position. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of operating results or capital position as reported under GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as additional views of the way our financial measures are affected by significant items and other factors, and since they are not required to be uniformly applied, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures at other companies. Adjusted non-interest income and adjusted total revenues are measures used by management to evaluate non-interest income and total revenues exclusive of net investment securities losses as well as gains on sale and changes in fair value of private equity investments, net. Adjusted non-interest expense and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio are measures utilized by management to measure the success of expense management initiatives focused on reducing recurring controllable operating costs. Adjusted return on average assets, adjusted net income available to common shareholders, adjusted net income per common share, diluted, and adjusted return on average common equity are measurements used by management to evaluate operating results exclusive of items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact period-to-period comparisons. The return on average tangible common equity is a measure used by management to compare Synovus&#8217; performance with other financial institutions because it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization, thereby allowing management to evaluate the performance of the business consistently. The adjusted return on average tangible common equity is a measure used by management in the same manner as the return on average tangible common equity except it is exclusive of items that are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact period-to-period comparisons. The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio and the CET1 ratio (fully phased-in) are used by management and bank regulators to assess the strength of our capital position. The computations of these measures are set forth in the tables below.
