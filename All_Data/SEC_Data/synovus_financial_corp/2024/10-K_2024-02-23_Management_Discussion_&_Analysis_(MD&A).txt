 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Executive Summary 

The following financial review provides a discussion of Synovus' financial condition, changes in financial condition, and results of operations as well as a summary of Synovus' critical accounting policies. This section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Report. 

Economic Environment and Recent Events 

Many of the key economic drivers of 2022 &#8211; inflation, economic uncertainty, geopolitical pressures, and changes in monetary policy, among others &#8211; continued in 2023, with the added challenges resulting from the bank failures in the first half of the year and the resulting and pervasive pressures on and volatility in the banking industry as a whole. 

Inflation remained a key economic concern in 2023, prompting the Federal Reserve to continue to tighten monetary policy by continuing to raise market interest rates by 100 bps in 2023. While interest rate cuts are now expected in 2024 as indicated by market forward interest rates, the specific timing of these cuts is uncertain as FOMC policy rate decisions are highly dependent on the level of inflation and strength of the labor market. 

Outside of inflation, the economic uncertainty and market disruptions of 2023 remain in 2024, including geopolitical tensions from conflict in the Middle East, Russia&#8217;s prolonged war in Ukraine, and the strained relationship between the U.S. and China. Moreover, 2024 is an election year, and there are specific risks and uncertainties related to the election and any change in administration that could impact the economy and fiscal and regulatory policy by varying degrees. Multiple mixed signals make navigating the way ahead difficult as evidenced by the volatility in capital markets, variance in interpretation of the Fed's messaging, and wide ranges of multiple economic outlooks. 

U.S. fiscal policy has been expansionary in recent years, leaving a significant federal deficit which will most likely continue to grow, exacerbated in the near term by the election cycle. The Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law in August 2022, raised federal revenue by imposing an alternative corporate minimum tax if certain thresholds are met and a non-deductible excise tax on corporate share repurchases. 

The regional bank failures in March and May of 2023 and the subsequent response by both the banking industry and the Federal Reserve served to mitigate the risks of such failures becoming more systemic. However, the residual impacts on the banking industry and the broader economic environment remain uncertain and have generally presented a more challenging outlook for the banking industry and for Synovus. These bank failures resulted in a FDIC special assessment, increased regulatory scrutiny, expectations for future regulatory changes, and continued pressure on deposits and liquidity. 

Despite the headwinds discussed above, we believe our presence in strong Southeastern U.S. growth markets positions Synovus to execute on our 2024 guidance outlined below by making prudent decisions around business mix, balance sheet optimization, and operating expenses, all of which will support enhanced financial performance and a return to growth as we proceed through 2024. 

Overview of 2023 Financial Results 

Net income available to common shareholders for 2023 was $507.8 million, or $3.46 per diluted common share, compared to $724.7 million, or $4.95 per diluted common share, in 2022. The year-over-year comparison was impacted by the strategic repositioning of the investment securities portfolio which resulted in realized net losses of $77.7 million and increased non-interest expense from a $51.0 million accrual for the FDIC special assessment, a $50.1 million loss related to strategic loan sales of medical office buildings loans and third-party consumer loans, and $18.4 million in restructuring charges for one-time benefits associated with a voluntary early retirement program. Provision for credit losses was $189.1 million in 2023 compared to $84.6 million in 2022, with the increase primarily attributable to increased net charge-offs, downward risk grade migration, and continued economic uncertainty. 

Net interest income for 2023 was $1.82 billion, up $19.8 million, or 1%, from $1.80 billion in 2022. The net interest margin was 3.21% for 2023 compared to 3.32% in 2022, as the asset side of our consolidated balance sheets continued to benefit from higher interest rates, but the increase in funding costs, combined with remixing within core deposits, resulted in margin compression. 

Non-interest revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $404.0 million, down $5.3 million, or 1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 and was negatively impacted by losses of $77.7 million that resulted from the aforementioned strategic repositioning of the investment securities portfolio. Excluding the losses from sales of investment securities, the primary drivers of the increase in non-interest revenue included $16.4 million higher brokerage revenue, a $13.1 million one-time benefit from the recovery of a non-performing asset related to the Qualpay investment, $11.7 million in 

transaction fees related to a third-party lending relationship, and $10.5 million higher card fees. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies" for further discussion on Qualpay. 

Non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $1.34 billion, an increase of $177.9 million, or 15%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. Non-interest expense in 2023 was elevated due to an industry-wide increase in FDIC expense which impacted Synovus by $65.7 million, including a $51.0 million special assessment, and a $50.1 million loss related to strategic sales of medical office buildings loans and third-party consumer loans. In addition, restructuring charges of $18.4 million were recorded for one-time benefits associated with a voluntary early retirement program offered to certain qualified employees in 2023 while 2022 benefited from a $9.7 million reversal of restructuring charges. 

At December 31, 2023, total loans, net of deferred fees and costs of $43.40 billion, declined $311.9 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2022. Growth in C&#38;I loans has been diversified but somewhat offset by a strategic decline in non-relationship credits. The decline in CRE loans was impacted by the $1.17 billion medical office buildings loans sale; excluding that strategic sale, CRE growth was driven by draws on existing commitments and lower levels of paydown and payoff activity. The decline in consumer loans resulted primarily from continued strategic run-off of the third-party lending portfolio, including the sale of $421.7 million of third-party consumer loans. 

Credit quality metrics migrated from historically low levels with the NPA and NPL ratios both at 0.66% and total past dues at 0.14%, as a percentage of total loans at December 31, 2023. Net charge-offs for 2023 of $153.3 million, or 0.35%, of average loans, were largely impacted by $31.3 million in net charge-offs from strategic loan sales and exposure to a nationally syndicated C&#38;I credit that resulted in a $23.3 million net charge-off. Excluding the strategic loan sales, the net charge-off ratio for 2023 was 0.28% of average loans. The ACL of $536.6 million increased $35.7 million compared to December 31, 2022, primarily from downward risk grade migration, an increase in reserves on individually evaluated loans, and the continuation of an uncertain economic environment. The ACL to loans coverage ratio was 1.24% at December 31, 2023, 9 bps higher compared to December 31, 2022. 

Total period-end deposits were $50.74 billion at December 31, 2023, up $1.87 billion, or 4%, compared to year-end 2022, while core deposits also increased $1.12 billion, or 3%, in 2023. Fluctuations among core deposits categories were a function of the rate environment as well as declines driven by the diminishment of excess funds created from COVID-related stimulus and included an increase in time deposits offset by decreases in non-interest-bearing demand deposits and money market accounts. Brokered deposits increased $744.0 million, or 14%, in 2023 as a result of continued proactive management of our balance sheet position. Average deposit costs for 2023 were 206 bps, up 168 bps, compared to 38 bps for 2022, primarily due to the FOMC's rate hikes through the cycle. 

Our CET1 ratio of 10.22% at December 31, 2023 is well in excess of regulatory requirements and increased 59 bps compared to December 31, 2022 as our organic earnings and muted balance sheet growth supported capital accretion. On January 18, 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized share repurchases of up to $300 million of common stock and $50 million of preferred stock in 2024. Our 2024 capital plan anticipates a stable common dividend and management of our the CET1 ratio within our targeted range of 10.0% to 10.5%.

Critical Accounting Policies 

The accounting and financial reporting policies of Synovus are in accordance with GAAP and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. Synovus has identified certain of its accounting policies as &#8220;critical accounting policies,&#8221; consisting of those related to the accounting for the allowance for credit losses and income taxes. In determining which accounting policies are critical in nature, Synovus has identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates. It is management's practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the Board of Directors' Audit Committee on a periodic basis, including the development, selection, implementation, and disclosure of the critical accounting policies. The application of these policies has a significant impact on Synovus&#8217; consolidated financial statements. Synovus&#8217; financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are applied in the application of these policies. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The ACL is a critical accounting estimate that requires significant judgments and assumptions, which are inherently subjective. The use of different estimates or assumptions could have a significant impact on the provision for credit losses, ACL, financial condition, and results of operations. The economic and business climate in any given industry or market is difficult to gauge and can change rapidly, and the effects of those changes can vary by borrower. 

In accordance with CECL, the ACL, which includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments, represents management's best estimate of expected losses over the life of loans adjusted for prepayments, and over the life of loan commitments expected to fund. Synovus' loans and unfunded loan commitments are grouped based upon the nature of the loan type and the forecasted PD, adjusted for relevant forecasted macroeconomic factors comprising multiple weighted scenarios representing different plausible outcomes, and LGD, to determine the allowance for the majority of our portfolio. To the extent the estimated lives of the loans in the portfolio extend beyond the period for which a reasonable and supportable forecast can be made (which is two years for Synovus), the Company reverts, on a straight-line basis back to the historical rates over a one-year period. Life-of-loan loss percentages may also be adjusted, as necessary, for certain quantitative and qualitative factors that in management's judgment are necessary to reflect losses expected in the portfolio. These adjustments address inherent limitations in the quantitative model. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are individually evaluated on a loan-by-loan basis with specific reserves, if any, recorded as appropriate. Given the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables within an economic forecast, it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the ACL. As a result, when formulating the quantitative estimate management uses a probability-weighted approach that incorporates a baseline forecast, an upside scenario reflecting an accelerated recovery, a downside scenario that reflects adverse economic conditions, and a scenario that assumes consistent slow growth that is less optimistic than the baseline. 

To illustrate a hypothetical sensitivity analysis, management calculated an ACL using the upside and downside scenarios. Our quantitative CECL model is most sensitive to the unemployment rate, which peaks near 7.7% in the downside scenario and 3.9% in the upside scenario. This is compared to the multi-scenario forecast&#8217;s weighted average peak of around 4.7%. This downside scenario assumes a severe deterioration in economic conditions compared to our baseline forecast, including low consumer confidence, a recession starting in the first quarter of 2024, and persistent inflation pressures which cause the Fed to keep interest rates elevated. The upside scenario assumes a stronger economy compared to our baseline forecast, driven by favorable business sentiment, consumer confidence and spending, and higher GDP. 

Excluding the impact of qualitative considerations, using only the upside forecast scenario would result in an estimated $107.8 million decrease, while using only the downside forecast scenario would result in an estimated increase of $186.1 million, compared to the reported ACL of $536.6 million at December 31, 2023. Therefore, the resulting hypothetical range of estimates is between $428.8 million and $722.7 million. 

The sensitivity analysis result does not represent management&#8217;s view of expected credit losses nor is it intended to estimate future changes in ACL levels for reasons including, but not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; management uses a weighted approach applied to multiple economic scenarios for its ACL estimation process; 

&#8226; the impact of changes in economic variables are interrelated and nonlinear; therefore, the results of the analysis cannot be extrapolated to additional changes in economic variables; 

&#8226; subsequent changes in the mix of portfolio characteristics could materially impact results; 

&#8226; potential future government or regulatory intervention could cause results to differ materially from historical relationships between the economic variables and related credit metrics; and 

&#8226; the sensitivity analysis does not account for any quantitative or qualitative adjustments incorporated by management as part of its overall ACL framework to reflect losses expected in the portfolio. 

See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 3 - Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses" in this Report for additional details. 

Income Taxes 

The calculation of Synovus&#8217; income tax provision is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments in its determination. As part of Synovus&#8217; overall business strategy, management must consider tax laws and regulations that apply to the specific facts and circumstances under consideration. As such, the Company is often required to exercise significant judgment regarding the interpretation of these tax laws and regulations, in which Synovus' anticipated and actual liability could significantly vary based upon the taxing authority&#8217;s interpretation. Specifically, significant estimates in accounting for income taxes relate to the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, estimates of the realizability of deferred tax assets, including income tax credits and NOLs, and the need for a valuation allowance, the calculation of taxable income, the estimation of uncertain tax positions and the determination of temporary differences between book and tax bases. Adjustments to these items may occur due to modifications in tax rates, newly enacted laws, issuance of tax regulations, resolution of items with taxing authorities, alterations to interpretative statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance that affects the Company&#8217;s tax positions, changes in the Company's tax accounting methods or elections, or other facts and circumstances. Management closely monitors tax developments and the potential timing of these changes in order to evaluate the effect they may have on the Company&#8217;s overall tax position and the estimates and judgments used in determining the income tax provision and records adjustments as necessary. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16 - Income Taxes" in this Report for additional details. 

DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Investment Securities Available for Sale 

The investment securities portfolio consists primarily of high-quality liquid debt securities classified as available for sale. The on-going investment philosophy for the securities portfolio focuses on maintaining a readily accessible source of liquidity while also supporting the income and interest rate risk management objectives of the Company. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2 - Investment Securities Available for Sale" in this Report for additional information. 

During the fourth quarter of 2023, as part of an overall strategic repositioning of the investment securities portfolio, Synovus sold at amortized cost $1.30 billion of U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Government agency securities, MBS issued by U.S. Government agencies, MBS issued by U.S. Government sponsored enterprises, and Commercial MBS issued by U.S. Government agencies or sponsored enterprises, which resulted in realized net losses of $77.7 million. Additionally, Synovus purchased $1.28 billion in principal of U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Government agency securities, MBS issued by U.S. Government agencies, MBS issued by U.S. Government sponsored enterprises, and Commercial MBS issued by U.S. Government agencies or sponsored enterprises. 

The average amortized cost of investment securities available for sale remained flat at $11.21 billion in both 2023 and 2022, representing 19.8% and 20.7%, respectively, of average interest earning assets. The portfolio earned a taxable-equivalent yield of 2.21% and 1.87% for 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the estimated fair value of investment securities available for sale as a percentage of their amortized cost was 88.3% and 85.8%, respectively, with net unrealized losses decreasing to $1.30 billion from $1.60 billion, respectively. The investment securities portfolio had a weighted average duration of 5.2 years at December 31, 2023, compared to 5.3 years at December 31, 2022. 

The calculation of weighted average yields for investment securities available for sale displayed below is based on the amortized cost with effective yields also based upon contractual cash flows. Maturity information is presented based upon contractual maturity which may differ from actual maturity dates as issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

At December 31, 2023, total loans, net of deferred fees and costs, of $43.40 billion, declined $311.9 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2022. Growth in C&#38;I loans has been diversified but somewhat offset by a strategic decline in non-relationship credits. The decline in CRE loans was impacted by the $1.17 billion medical office buildings loans sale; excluding that strategic sale, CRE growth was driven by draws on existing commitments and lower levels of paydown and payoff activity. The decline in consumer loans resulted primarily from continued strategic run-off of the third-party lending portfolio, including the sale of $421.7 million of third-party consumer loans. 

C&#38;I loans remain the largest component of our loan portfolio, representing 52.0% of total loans, while CRE and consumer loans represent 28.4% and 19.6%, respectively. Our portfolio composition is guided by our strategic growth plan, in conjunction with a comprehensive concentration management policy which sets limits for C&#38;I, CRE, and consumer loan levels as well as sub-categories therein. 

Commercial Loans 

Total commercial loans (which are comprised of C&#38;I and CRE loans) at December 31, 2023 were $34.92 billion, or 80.4%, of the total loan portfolio, compared to $34.72 billion, or 79.4% at December 31, 2022. 

Commercial and Industrial Loans 

The C&#38;I loan portfolio represents the largest category of Synovus' loan portfolio and is primarily comprised of general middle market and commercial banking clients across a diverse set of industries as well as certain specialized lending verticals. The following table shows the composition of the C&#38;I loan portfolio aggregated by NAICS code. In accordance with Synovus' lending policy, each loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process which incorporates uniform underwriting standards and oversight in proportion to the size and complexity of the lending relationship. As of December 31, 2023, 94.8% of Synovus' C&#38;I loans are secured by real estate, business equipment, inventory, and other types of collateral compared to 94.4% as of December 31, 2022. C&#38;I loans grew $531.8 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2022, primarily from diverse growth across industries and business lines, led by CIB, middle market, and specialty finance, with growth also impacted by a strategic decline in non-relationship credits.

At December 31, 2023, $14.46 billion of C&#38;I loans, or 33.3% of the total loan portfolio, represented loans for the purpose of financing commercial, financial, and agricultural business activities. The primary source of repayment on these loans is revenue generated from products or services offered by the business or organization. The secondary source of repayment is the collateral, which consists primarily of equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, time deposits, cash surrender value of life insurance, and other business assets. 

At December 31, 2023, $8.14 billion of C&#38;I loans, or 18.7% of the total loan portfolio, represented loans originated for the purpose of financing owner-occupied properties. The financing of owner-occupied facilities is considered a C&#38;I loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral such as senior housing facilities. This treatment is a result of the credit decision process, which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt. The secondary source of repayment on these loans is the underlying real estate. These loans are predominately secured by owner-occupied and other real estate, and to a lesser extent, other types of collateral. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans 

CRE loans primarily consist of income-producing investment properties loans. Additionally, CRE loans include 1-4 family properties loans as well as land and development loans. In accordance with our lending policy, each loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process which incorporates uniform underwriting standards and oversight relative to the type of property, as well as the size and complexity of the deal. Total CRE loans of $12.32 billion decreased $333.6 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2022 primarily as a result of the $1.17 billion medical office buildings loans sale. Excluding that strategic sale, CRE growth was primarily a function of draws on existing commitments and lower levels of paydown and payoff activity. 

Investment Properties Loans 

Investment properties loans consist of construction and mortgage loans for income-producing properties and are primarily made to finance multi-family properties, office buildings, hotels, shopping centers, warehouses and other commercial development properties. Total investment properties loans as of December 31, 2023 were $11.36 billion, or 92.3% of the CRE loan portfolio, and 26.2% of the total loan portfolio, down $280.7 million, or 2%, compared to $11.64 billion, or 92.0% of the CRE loan portfolio, and 26.6% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2022, primarily due to the aforementioned medical 

office buildings loans sale. Excluding the strategic sale, growth was mostly in the multi-family category and arose largely from draws related to existing commitments. 

The following table shows the principal categories of the investment properties loan portfolio at December 31, 2023 and 2022.

(2) LTV calculated by dividing most recent appraisal (typically at origination) on non-construction component of portfolio by the respective December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 commitment amount and senior lien. 

(3) Office buildings included medical office buildings of $424.8 million, or 3.7% of total investment properties loans, at December 31, 2023 and $1.56 billion, or 13.4% of total investment properties loans, at December 31, 2022 . 

1-4 Family Properties Loans 

1-4 family properties loans include construction loans to home builders and commercial mortgage loans related to 1-4 family rental properties and are almost always secured by the underlying property being financed by such loans. These properties are primarily located in the markets served by Synovus. At December 31, 2023, 1-4 family properties loans totaled $598.5 million, or 4.9% of the CRE loan portfolio, and decreased slightly from December 31, 2022. 

Land and Development Loans 

Land and development loans include commercial and residential development as well as land acquisition loans and are secured by land held for future development, typically in excess of one year. Properties securing these loans are substantially within markets served by Synovus, and loan terms generally include personal guarantees from the principals. Loans in this portfolio are underwritten based on the LTV of the collateral and the capacity of the guarantor(s). Land and development loans of $355.0 million at December 31, 2023 declined marginally from December 31, 2022. 

Consumer Loans 

The consumer loan portfolio consists of a wide variety of loan products offered through Synovus' banking network including first and second residential mortgages, home equity, and consumer credit card loans, as well as both secured and unsecured loans from third-party lending. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, weighted average FICO scores within the residential real estate portfolio based on committed balances were 796 and 793 for home equity and 783 and 780 for consumer mortgages, respectively . 

Consumer loans at December 31, 2023 of $8.49 billion decreased $510.1 million, or 6%, compared to December 31, 2022. Mortgage loans increased $197.3 million from December 31, 2022 despite lower production, largely due to slower prepayments and refinances as a result of elevated mortgage interest rates. Other consumer loans decreased $748.3 million from December 31, 2022 largely due to the sale of $421.7 million of third-party consumer loans in addition to the continued strategic run-off of the third-party lending portfolio. 

The table below shows the maturities of loans, net of deferred fees and costs, as of December 31, 2023. Also provided are the amounts due after one year, classified according to the sensitivity in interest rates. Actual repayments of loans may differ from the contractual maturities reflected therein because borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with and without prepayment penalties. Additionally, the refinancing of such loans or the potential delinquency of such loans could create differences between the contractual maturities and the actual repayment of such loans.

Total period-end deposits were $50.74 billion at December 31, 2023, up $1.87 billion, or 4%, compared to December 31, 2022, while core deposits also increased $1.12 billion, or 3%, in 2023. Fluctuations among core deposits categories were a function of the rate environment and included an increase in time deposits offset by decreases in non-interest-bearing demand deposits and money market accounts. Deployment of excess cash created from COVID-related stimulus was also a factor in the decrease in non-interest-bearing demand deposits, but the pace of decline slowed in the second half of 2023 relative to outflows experienced in the first half of 2023. Brokered deposits increased $744.0 million, or 14%, in 2023 as a result of continued proactive management of our balance sheet position. 

Total deposits on an average basis were $49.87 billion, up $927.2 million, or 2%, compared to the prior year as average core deposits of $43.76 billion declined $1.53 billion, or 3%, in 2023, largely due to pressures from the rate environment and client deployment of excess funds. Average brokered deposits of $6.10 billion grew $2.46 billion, or 67%, from 2022, primarily due to the ongoing management of our liquidity position. 

Average deposit costs were 2.50% for the fourth quarter of 2023, which equate to a cycle-to-date total deposit beta of 45% through the fourth quarter of 2023. Average deposit costs for 2023 were 206 bps, up 168 bps, compared to 38 bps for 2022, primarily due to the FOMC's rate hikes through the cycle. Deposit costs and betas have been impacted by pricing lags on core interest-bearing deposits as well as the decrease in non-interest-bearing demand deposits. 

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, $23.77 billion and $23.96 billion, respectively, of our deposit portfolio was uninsured. The uninsured amounts are estimated based on the methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank's regulatory reporting requirements. At December 31, 2023, approximately 87% of our deposits are either insured (54%), collateralized (14%), or could be insured by switching to our insured cash sweep program, which has existing capacity (19%). 

The following table shows the portion of time deposits that are uninsured, by remaining time until maturity, at December 31, 2023.

Net Interest Income 

The following table summarizes the components of net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, including the tax-equivalent adjustment that is required in making yields on tax-exempt loans and investment securities comparable to taxable loans and investment securities. The taxable-equivalent adjustment is based on a 21% federal income tax rate for the three years shown.

Net interest income (interest income less interest expense) is the largest component of total revenue, representing earnings from the primary business of gathering funds from client deposits and other sources, and investing those funds primarily in loans and fixed-income securities. Synovus&#8217; long-term objective is to manage those assets and liabilities to maximize net interest income while balancing interest rate, credit, liquidity, and capital risks. 

Net Interest Margin 

Net interest margin is a measure of the spread between interest earning assets relative to the cost of funding and can be used to assess the efficiency of earnings from balance sheet activities. The net interest margin is affected by changes in interest earning asset yields, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, the percentage of interest earning assets funded by non-interest-bearing funding sources, and the mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 

The net interest margin was 3.21% for 2023 compared to 3.32% in 2022, as the asset side of our consolidated balance sheets continued to benefit from higher interest rates, but the increase in funding costs, combined with remixing within core deposits, resulted in margin compression. 

The primary components of the yield on interest earning assets are loan yields, yields on investment securities, and the yield on balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank. The yield on earning assets increased 155 bps to 5.39% from 3.84% in 2022, while the effective cost of funds increased 166 bps to 2.18% from 0.52% in 2022. Loan yields increased 177 bps as a result of the FOMC's continued rate hikes; the increase in average total loans, net of unearned income was primarily attributable to growth in commercial loans, largely in the latter half of 2022 and first part of 2023, in addition to increased line utilization. The increase in the effective cost of funds during 2023 was primarily driven by a decline in non-interest-bearing demand deposits and increases in market interest rates as funding costs continued to increase, albeit at a slower pace as the year progressed. 

Earning Assets and Sources of Funds 

Average total assets for 2023 increased $2.31 billion to $59.92 billion as compared to average total assets of $57.61 billion for 2022. Average interest earning assets increased $2.48 billion in 2023 as compared to the prior year and represented 94.6% of average total assets for 2023, as compared to 94.1% in 2022. The increase in average earning assets resulted primarily from a $2.52 billion increase in average total loans, net of deferred fees and costs. 

Average interest-bearing liabilities for 2023 of $39.86 billion increased $4.98 billion from $34.88 billion in 2022. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities resulted largely from a $2.81 billion increase in average time deposits, a $2.46 billion increase in brokered deposits, a $1.03 billion increase in long-term debt, and a $856.4 million increase in average interest-bearing demand deposits, partially offset by a $1.87 billion decrease in average money market accounts. The increase in time deposits and decrease in money market accounts are correlated, as fluctuations between these categories have been primarily driven by the rate environment. The increases in brokered deposits and long-term debt were largely due to the ongoing management of our liquidity position, which also included the February 2023 issuance of $500.0 million par value Synovus Bank Senior Notes. 

Average non-interest bearing demand deposits decreased $3.07 billion compared to 2022, primarily driven by continued pressures from the rate environment and client deployment of excess funds.

(1) Core banking fees consist of service charges on deposit accounts, card fees, and other non-interest revenue components including letter of credit fees, ATM fee income, line of credit non-usage fees, gains (losses) from sales of SBA loans, and miscellaneous other service charges. 

(2) Wealth revenue consists of fiduciary and asset management, brokerage, and insurance revenue. 

Non-interest revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $404.0 million, down $5.3 million, or 1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, and was negatively impacted by losses from sales of investment securities of $76.7 million. Excluding the losses from sales of investment securities, the primary drivers of the increase in non-interest revenue included higher wealth revenue, a $13.1 million one-time benefit from the recovery of a non-performing asset related to the Qualpay investment, $11.7 million in transaction fees related to a third-party lending relationship, higher card fees, and a $7.0 million write-down on a minority Fintech investment that impacted earnings on equity method investments in 2022. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies" for further discussion on Qualpay. 

Service charges on deposit accounts, consisting of account analysis fees, NSF fees, and all other service charges decreased during 2023 compared to 2022. The largest category of service charges, account analysis fees, was $43.2 million for 2023, up $3.1 million, or 8%, from 2022. NSF/overdraft fees of $23.0 million decreased $6.9 million, or 23.0%, from 2022 and included the impact of NSF/overdraft fee program changes implemented during 2023. All other service charges on deposit accounts, which consist primarily of monthly fees on consumer demand deposits and small business accounts, were $23.8 million for 2023, up $787 thousand, or 3%, compared to 2022. 

Fiduciary and asset management fees are derived from providing estate administration, personal trust, corporate trust, corporate bond, investment management, financial planning, and family office services. The slight decrease in fiduciary and asset management fees for 2023 was primarily driven by the sale of GLOBALT to its management team on September 30, 2023. 

Card fees consist primarily of credit card interchange fees, debit card interchange fees, and merchant revenue. Card fees are reported net of certain associated expense items including client loyalty program expenses and network expenses. Merchant revenue relates to the fees that are charged to merchant clients based on a percentage of their credit or debit card transaction volume amounts. The increase in 2023 from 2022 resulted from higher merchant fees primarily driven by our Qualpay investment, increased merchant revenue largely from higher sales transaction volumes, and higher credit card transaction volumes from elevated commercial/small business spend activity. 

Brokerage revenue consists primarily of brokerage commissions as well as advisory fees earned from the management of client assets. The increase in 2023 over 2022 largely benefited from client activity, including movement into short-term liquidity products such as repurchase agreements due to the rate environment. 

Mortgage banking income, consisting of net gains on loan origination/sales activities, was lower compared to 2022, driven largely by a $5.9 million decline in gains on sale as a result of a $220.1 million, or 28%, decline in loans sold, somewhat offset by a $3.5 million favorable change in the mark-to-market. Secondary market production was $548.2 million, a $181.1 million, or 25%, decrease compared to 2022. 

Capital markets income primarily includes fee income from client derivative transactions, debt capital market transactions, foreign exchange, as well as other miscellaneous income from capital market transactions. The increase for 2023 was primarily a result of a $6.9 million increase in loan syndication arranger fees and $1.5 million higher fee income from debt capital markets transactions partially offset by a $3.2 million decrease in fees on client derivative transactions. 

Income from BOLI includes increases in the cash surrender value of policies and proceeds from insurance benefits. The increase in 2023 was driven by a $1.1 million increase in proceeds from insurance benefits. 

During the fourth quarter of 2023, as part of an overall strategic repositioning of the investment securities portfolio, Synovus sold at amortized cost $1.30 billion of U.S. Treasury securities, agency securities and debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, which resulted in realized net losses of $77.7 million. 

Insurance revenue primarily includes fixed annuity revenue and income from life insurance commissions. The $550 thousand increase from 2022 included a $1.0 million increase in fixed annuity revenue driven by the rate environment partially offset by $320 thousand lower income from life insurance commissions. 

On September 30, 2023, Synovus further simplified its business mix and sold its asset management firm GLOBALT to its management team and recorded a $1.9 million gain, which included an earnout receivable valued at $1.8 million. The divestiture will be immaterial to future earnings and will allow us to reallocate capital to higher returning fee income lines of business while continuing to meet our wealth clients&#8217; needs. 

The main components of other non-interest revenue are fees for letters of credit and unused lines of credit, safe deposit box fees, access fees for ATM use, other service charges and loan servicing fees, earnings on equity method investments, gains (losses) from sales of SBA loans, and other miscellaneous items. In 2023, there were $11.7 million in transaction fees related to a third-party lending relationship, a $9.0 million increase in the fair value of non-qualified deferred compensation plan assets (offset in non-interest expense), a $5.3 million increase compared to 2022 related to favorable valuation adjustments on tax-related equity investment partnerships, and $4.2 million lower loan servicing fees on our third-party lending relationships. 2022 included a $7.0 million write-down on a minority Fintech investment and a $3.5 million gain on the sale of a real estate partnership.

$ 1,335,424 &#160; $ 1,157,506 $ 1,099,904 $ 177,918 15 % ##TABLE_END

Non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $1.34 billion, an increase of $177.9 million, or 15%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in non-interest expense during 2023 was impacted by a $51.0 million accrual for the FDIC special assessment and a $50.1 million loss related to strategic sales of medical office buildings loans and third-party consumer loans. In addition, restructuring charges of $18.4 million were recorded for one-time benefits 

associated with a voluntary early retirement program offered to certain qualified employees in 2023 while 2022 benefited from a $9.7 million reversal of restructuring charges. 

Salaries and other personnel expense increased compared to 2022, primarily due to the impacts of merit and inflationary wage increases, employee healthcare costs, unfavorable deferred loan origination costs due to lower loan production, and a $9.0 million unfavorable change from the fair value of the non-qualified deferred compensation liability (offset in non-interest revenue). The increases were somewhat offset by lower incentives and commissions largely due to decreased performance and production volumes. Synovus employees totaled 4,879, down 235, or 5%, from December 31, 2022 primarily as a result of the aforementioned voluntary early retirement program in addition to strategic reductions in areas primarily impacted by production volume declines, partially offset by additions in areas associated with revenue growth and certain critical support functions. 

Net occupancy, equipment, and software expense increased compared to 2022, due primarily to continued investments in technology and operations infrastructure. Synovus Bank operated 246 branches at both December 31, 2023 and 2022. 

Third-party processing and other services expense includes all third-party core operating system and processing charges as well as third-party loan servicing charges. Third-party processing expense decreased compared to 2022, mostly due to lower servicing fees associated with decreased third-party consumer loans somewhat offset by enhancements associated with technology and operations infrastructure investments and new business initiatives. 

Professional fees increased compared to 2022, primarily from increased legal fees from various transaction-related matters, including new business initiatives, and higher consulting fees largely related to strategic and infrastructure investments. 

FDIC insurance and other regulatory fees increased compared to 2022. On May 22, 2023, the FDIC published its proposed rule to charge certain banks a special assessment to cover losses incurred by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) due to bank failures in March and May of 2023. The final rule was approved by the FDIC Board on November 16, 2023 and imposed a special assessment at an annual rate of approximately 13.4 bps on a bank's uninsured deposits balance, in excess of $5 billion, as of December 31, 2022, payable in eight quarterly installments beginning in the first quarter of 2024. A $51.0 million expense was accrued in the fourth quarter of 2023, with the remaining increase largely due to the industry-wide 2 bps increase in the deposit insurance initial base assessment rate that went into effect in the first quarter of 2023. 

Amortization of intangibles increased during 2023 primarily due to Synovus' acquisition of Qualpay. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" for further discussion on Qualpay and "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" for further information on Qualpay's other intangible assets. 

During the year ended December 31, 2023, Synovus' restructuring charges of $17.7 million primarily consisted of $18.4 million in one-time termination benefits associated with a voluntary early retirement program offered to certain employees, $4.7 million in gains on the sale of branches previously closed, and $3.8 million of additional severance unrelated to the amount recorded for the voluntary early retirement program. During the year ended December 31, 2022, a net restructuring reversal of $9.7 million was recorded and primarily consisted of $15.4 million in gains on sales of certain building and branch locations and $4.8 million in lease termination charges and asset impairment charges related to branch closures and restructuring of corporate real estate as part of a large-scale property optimization program. 

For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, Synovus recorded $3.9 million and $6.0 million, respectively, in valuation adjustments to the Visa derivative associated with an indemnification agreement following Visa's announcements of funding into its litigation escrow account. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of this Report for additional information on the Visa derivative. 

In 2023, Synovus repurchased $97.0 million of its 5.90% Fixed-to-Fixed Rate Subordinated Notes through both a cash tender offer and open market purchases and recognized gains of $5.4 million on the early extinguishment of debt. On February 10, 2022, Synovus Bank redeemed its 2.289% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Bank Senior Notes of $400 million par value and incurred a $677 thousand loss on early extinguishment of debt. 

During 2023, Synovus recorded a loss of $50.1 million related to strategic sales of medical office buildings loans and third-party consumer loans. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 3 - Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses" for further information. 

Other operating expense includes advertising, travel, insurance, network and communication, other taxes, subscriptions and dues, other loan and ORE expense, postage and freight, training, business development, supplies, donations, and other miscellaneous expense. The decrease over prior year was primarily related to decreased loan expense from lower production and a $2.7 million reversal of an impairment charge related to the Qualpay investment. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies" for further discussion on Qualpay. 

Income Taxes 

Income tax expense was $154.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $206.3 million and $228.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was 22.1%, 21.4%, and 23.1%, respectively. The most significant factor of the increase in the effective tax rate in 2023 compared to the prior year related to a downward revaluation of state deferred tax assets associated with the anticipated expansion of a third-party lending relationship which would lower future taxes in certain states. 

Deferred tax assets generally represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. At December 31, 2023, the net deferred tax asset was $506.9 million compared to $595.3 million at December 31, 2022. 

Synovus regularly assesses the realizability of its net deferred tax assets based upon all available evidence, both positive and negative. Based upon the assessment, Synovus established a valuation allowance of $26.2 million at December 31, 2023 and $19.1 million at December 31, 2022, on the portion of its federal and state NOLs and tax credits that are not expected to be utilized prior to expiration in years 2024 through 2043. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16 - Income Taxes" of this Report for additional discussion regarding deferred income taxes. 

Credit Quality 

Synovus diligently monitors the quality of its loan portfolio by industry, property type, and geography through a thorough portfolio review process and our analytical risk management tools. Credit quality metrics migrated from historically low levels with the NPA and NPL ratios both at 0.66% and total past dues at 0.14%, as a percentage of total loans. Net charge-offs for 2023 at $153.3 million, or 0.35%, of average loans, were largely impacted by strategic loan sales and exposure to a nationally syndicated C&#38;I credit that resulted in a $23.3 million net charge-off.

(1 ) Synovus' adoption of ASU-2022-02 on January 1, 2023 on a prospective basis resulted in the elimination of accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs and added requirements for the disclosure of certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty called FDMs. As a result, the population of loans considered FDMs is larger than the population previously considered TDRs. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 - Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses" for additional information on FDMs and TDRs in prior periods. 

Non-performing Assets 

Total NPAs were $288.2 million at December 31, 2023, a $144.8 million increase from December 31, 2022 primarily due to the designation of several large commercial relationships as non-performing, which have undergone impairment testing and have been appropriately marked or reserved. Total NPAs as a percentage of total loans, other loans held for sale, ORE and specific other assets increased to 0.66% at December 31, 2023 compared to 0.33% at December 31, 2022. NPLs were $288.2 million at December 31, 2023, a $160.1 million increase from December 31, 2022 . 

The following table shows the components of NPAs by portfolio class at December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Past Due Loans 

As a percentage of loans outstanding, loans 30 or more days past due and still accruing interest were 0.14% at December 31, 2023 compared to 0.15% at December 31, 2022. As a percentage of loans outstanding, loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest were 0.01% at both December 31, 2023 and 2022. These loans are in the process of collection and carry reserves in accordance with our ACL methodology. 

Criticized and Classified Loans 

Our loan ratings are aligned to federal banking regulators' definitions of pass and criticized categories, which include special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss. Substandard accruing and non-accruing loans, doubtful, and loss loans are often collectively referred to as classified. Special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss loans are often collectively referred to as criticized and classified loans. The following table presents a summary of criticized and classified loans. Criticized and classified loans at December 31, 2023 increased $584.5 million compared to December 31, 2022, primarily due to pressures from the economic and interest rate environment.

Net Charge-offs 

Total 2023 net charge-offs were $153.3 million, or 0.35%, of average loans, compared to total net charge-offs of $53.2 million, or 0.13% of average loans in 2022. Net charge-offs increased in 2023 as compared to 2022 largely due to net charge-offs of $31.3 million related to strategic loan sales as well as a $23.3 million net charge-off that resulted from exposure to a 

nationally syndicated C&#38;I credit. Excluding the strategic loan sales, the net charge-off ratio for 2023 was 0.28% of average loans. The following table shows net charge-offs (recoveries) for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.

Provision for (reversal of) Credit Losses and Allowance for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses of $189.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 included net charge-offs of $153.3 million and compares to a provision for credit losses of $84.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 that included net charge-offs of $53.2 million. The increase in provision was driven by increased net charge-offs and downward risk grade migration, as well as continued economic uncertainty. The increase in 2023 net charge-offs included net charge-offs of $31.3 million related to strategic loan sales as well as exposure to a nationally syndicated C&#38;I credit. 

The ALL of $479.4 million and the reserve for unfunded commitments of $57.2 million, which is recorded in other liabilities, comprise the total ACL of $536.6 million at December 31, 2023. The ACL increased $35.7 million compared to the December 31, 2022 ACL of $500.9 million, which consisted of an ALL of $443.4 million and the reserve for unfunded commitments of $57.5 million. The ACL to loans coverage ratio of 1.24% at December 31, 2023 was 9 bps higher compared to December 31, 2022. The increase in the ACL from December 31, 2022 resulted primarily from downward risk grade migration, an increase in reserves on individually evaluated loans, and the continuation of an uncertain economic environment.

Capital Resources 

Synovus and Synovus Bank are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by our primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve. Synovus and Synovus Bank measure capital adequacy using the standardized approach under Basel III. At December 31, 2023, Synovus and Synovus Bank's capital levels remained strong and exceeded well-capitalized requirements currently in effect. The following table presents certain ratios used to measure Synovus and Synovus Bank's capitalization. 

##TABLE_START Table 21 - Capital Ratios (dollars in thousands) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 CET1 capital Synovus Financial Corp. $ 5,206,521 &#160; $ 4,926,194 Synovus Bank 5,559,624 &#160; 5,446,703 Tier 1 risk-based capital Synovus Financial Corp. 5,743,666 &#160; 5,463,339 Synovus Bank 5,559,624 &#160; 5,446,703 Total risk-based capital Synovus Financial Corp. 6,654,224 &#160; 6,415,681 Synovus Bank 6,249,947 &#160; 6,079,152 CET1 capital ratio Synovus Financial Corp. 10.22 &#160; % 9.63 % Synovus Bank 10.93 &#160; 10.66 Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio Synovus Financial Corp. 11.28 &#160; 10.68 Synovus Bank 10.93 &#160; 10.66 Total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets ratio Synovus Financial Corp. 13.07 &#160; 12.54 Synovus Bank 12.29 &#160; 11.89 Leverage ratio Synovus Financial Corp. 9.49 &#160; 9.07 Synovus Bank 9.21 &#160; 9.06 ##TABLE_END

At December 31, 2023, Synovus' CET1 ratio was 10.22%, well in excess of regulatory requirements including the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%. The December 31, 2023 CET1 ratio increased 59 bps compared to December 31, 2022 as our organic earnings and muted balance sheet growth supported capital accretion. For more information on regulatory capital requirements, see "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10 - Regulatory Capital" in this Report. In 2024, our capital plan anticipates a stable common stock dividend and management of our CET1 ratio within our targeted range of 10.0% to 10.5%. 

The Company announced on January 18, 2024 that its Board of Directors authorized share repurchases of up to $300 million of common stock and $50 million of preferred stock in 2024. Subsequent to year-end, through February 20, 2024, Synovus repurchased $29.9 million, or 800 thousand shares, of common stock via open market transactions. 

On January 18, 2023, Synovus announced that its Board of Directors approved a capital plan that included an anticipated quarterly common stock dividend of $0.38 per share, beginning with the quarterly dividend payable in April 2023, and authorized share repurchases of up to $300 million in 2023. During 2023, Synovus did not repurchase any common stock. 

On August 26, 2020, the federal banking regulators issued a final rule that allowed electing banking organizations that adopted CECL during 2020 to mitigate the estimated effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year phase-in transition period. Synovus adopted CECL on January 1, 2020, and the December 31, 2023 regulatory capital ratios reflect Synovus' election of the five-year transition provision. At December 31, 2023, $29.2 million, or a cumulative 6 bps benefit to CET1, was deferred. 

Parent Company 

The Parent Company&#8217;s net assets consist primarily of its investment in Synovus Bank. The Parent Company&#8217;s primary uses of cash are for the servicing of debt, payment of dividends to shareholders, and repurchases of common stock. The Parent 

Company also provides the necessary funds to strengthen the capital of its subsidiaries if needed. These uses of cash are primarily funded by dividends from Synovus Bank, borrowings from external sources, and equity offerings. 

During 2023, Synovus Bank and non-bank subsidiaries paid upstream cash dividends to the Parent Company totaling $435.0 million. During 2022, Synovus Bank paid upstream cash dividends to the Parent Company totaling $350.0 million, and during 2021, Synovus Bank paid upstream cash dividends to the Parent Company totaling $420.0 million. 

Liquidity 

Liquidity represents the extent to which Synovus has readily available sources of funding to meet the needs of depositors, borrowers, and creditors; to support asset growth; and to otherwise sustain operations of Synovus and its subsidiaries, at a reasonable cost, on a timely basis, and without adverse consequences. ALCO monitors Synovus' economic, competitive, and regulatory environment and is responsible for measuring, monitoring, and reporting on liquidity and funding risk as well as market risk. 

In accordance with Synovus policies and regulatory guidance, ALCO evaluates contractual and anticipated cash flows under normal and stressed conditions to properly manage the Company's liquidity profile. Synovus places an emphasis on maintaining numerous sources of current and contingent liquidity to meet its obligations to depositors, borrowers, and creditors on a timely basis. Liquidity is generated through various sources, including, but not limited to, maturities and repayments of loans by clients, maturities and sales of investment securities, and growth in core and wholesale deposits. 

Synovus Bank also generates liquidity through the issuance of brokered certificates of deposit and money market accounts. Synovus Bank accesses funds from a broad geographic base to diversify its sources of funding and liquidity. Synovus Bank also has the capacity to access funding through its membership in the FHLB system and the Federal Reserve. Management continuously monitors and maintains appropriate levels of liquidity so as to provide adequate funding sources to manage client deposit withdrawals, loan requests, and other funding demands. 

Core deposit balances have increased by $1.12 billion compared to December 31, 2022. Fluctuations among core deposit categories have been a function of the rate environment, as well as deployment of excess cash created from COVID-related stimulus in the case of non-interest-bearing deposits, and included a $3.13 billion decrease in non-interest-bearing demand deposits and a $1.93 billion decline in money market accounts, with an offsetting $4.57 billion increase in time deposits. Synovus continues to proactively manage its liquidity position, which has included increasing brokered deposits, and robust contingent liquidity is maintained across a diverse set of sources which include immediately available funds as well as funds we expect to be available within short notice. Contingent liquidity sources include primary sources such as FHLB borrowing capacity, FRB cash reserves, unencumbered securities, and third-party consumer loans, which includes our decision to sell loans from this portfolio and strategic runoff, while secondary sources consist of the Federal Reserve discount window, Fed Funds lines, and other sources. At December 31, 2023, contingent sources of liquidity totaled approximately $27.7 billion, and based on currently pledged collateral, Synovus Bank had access to FHLB funding of $7.56 billion, subject to FHLB credit policies. 

In addition to bank level liquidity management, Synovus must manage liquidity at the parent company level for various operating needs including the servicing of debt, the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock, payment of general corporate expense, and potential capital infusions into subsidiaries. The primary source of liquidity for Synovus consists of dividends from Synovus Bank, which is governed by certain rules and regulations of the GA DBF and the Federal Reserve Bank. Synovus' ability to receive dividends from Synovus Bank in future periods will depend on a number of factors, including, without limitation, Synovus Bank's future profits, asset quality, liquidity, and overall condition. In addition, both the GA DBF and Federal Reserve Bank may require approval to pay dividends, based on certain regulatory statutes and limitations. 

On February 15, 2023, Synovus Bank issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Bank Notes due 2028, and the Notes will mature on February 15, 2028. The Notes will bear interest at 5.625% per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on each February 15 and August 15, beginning on August 15, 2023. Synovus Bank may not redeem the Notes prior to August 15, 2023. The redemption price for any redemption in whole or in part, at our option, on or after August 15, 2023, and prior to January 15, 2028, is equal to the greater of: (1) (a) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the redemption date (assuming the Notes matured on January 15, 2028) on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 30 basis points less (b) interest accrued to the date of redemption, and (2) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. The redemption price for any redemption after January 15, 2028 is 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. The Notes are not redeemable at the option or election of holders. 

During 2023, Synovus repurchased $97.0 million of its 5.90% Fixed-to-Fixed Rate Subordinated Notes through both a cash tender offer and open market purchases and recognized gains of $5.4 million on the early extinguishment of debt. The 

Company may continue to redeem any outstanding debt as it deems appropriate and as permitted per regulatory approvals if so required and in compliance with laws. 

Synovus presently believes that the sources of liquidity discussed above, including existing liquid funds on hand, are sufficient to meet its anticipated funding needs. However, if economic conditions were to significantly deteriorate, regulatory capital requirements for Synovus or Synovus Bank were to increase as the result of regulatory directives or otherwise, or Synovus believes it is prudent to enhance current liquidity levels, then Synovus may seek additional liquidity from external sources. See "Part I - Item 1A. - Risk Factors - Market and Other General Risk - Recent negative developments affecting the banking industry, and resulting media coverage, have eroded client confidence in the banking system , and Credit and Liquidity Risk - Changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market may adversely affect our capital resources, liquidity and financial results ". Furthermore, Synovus may, from time to time, take advantage of attractive market opportunities to refinance, retire, or repurchase its existing debt, redeem its preferred stock, repurchase shares, or strengthen its liquidity or capital position. 

Contractual Cash Obligations 

The following table summarizes, by remaining maturity, Synovus&#8217; significant contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2023. Excluded from the table below are certain liabilities with variable cash flows and/or no contractual maturity. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies" of this Report for information on Synovus' commitments to extend credit including loan commitments and letters of credit along with obligations related to Synovus' sponsorship of MPS businesses.

See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of this Report for further information. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The measures entitled adjusted non-interest revenue; adjusted non-interest expense; adjusted revenue; adjusted tangible efficiency ratio; adjusted return on average assets; adjusted net income available to common shareholders; adjusted net income per common share, diluted; adjusted return on average common equity; return on average tangible common equity; adjusted return on average tangible common equity; the tangible common equity ratio; and adjusted PPNR are not measures recognized under GAAP and therefore are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The most comparable GAAP measures to these measures are total non-interest revenue, total non-interest expense, total TE revenue, efficiency ratio-TE, return on average assets, net income available to common shareholders, net income per common share, diluted, return on average common equity, the ratio of total Synovus Financial Corp. shareholders' equity to total assets, and PPNR, respectively. 

Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful additional information about Synovus to assist management and investors in evaluating Synovus&#8217; operating results, financial strength, the performance of its business, and the strength of its capital position. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of operating results or capital position as reported under GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as additional views of the way our financial measures are affected by significant items and other factors, and since they are not required to be uniformly applied, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures at other companies. Adjusted non-interest revenue and adjusted revenue are measures used by management to evaluate non-interest revenue and total revenue exclusive of net investment securities gains (losses), fair value adjustments on non-qualified deferred compensation, and other items not indicative of ongoing operations that could impact period-to-period comparisons. Adjusted non-interest expense and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio are measures utilized by management to measure the success of expense management initiatives focused on reducing recurring controllable operating costs. Adjusted return on average assets, adjusted net income available to common shareholders, adjusted net income per common share, diluted, and adjusted return on average common equity are measurements used by management to evaluate operating results exclusive of items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact period-to-period comparisons. Return on average tangible common equity and adjusted return on average tangible common equity are measures used by management to compare Synovus&#8217; performance with other financial institutions because it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization, thereby allowing management to evaluate the performance of the business consistently. The tangible common equity ratio is used by management to assess the strength of our capital position. Adjusted PPNR is used by management to evaluate PPNR exclusive of items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact period-to-period comparisons. The computations of these measures are set forth in the tables below. 

Management does not provide a reconciliation for forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the occurrence and the financial impact of various items that have not yet occurred, are out of Synovus&#8217; control, or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons, Synovus&#8217; management is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.
