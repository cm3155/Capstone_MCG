In this Report, the words &#8220;Synovus,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to Synovus Financial Corp. together with Synovus Bank and Synovus' other wholly-owned subsidiaries, except where the context requires otherwise.

Forward-looking statements include statements with respect to Synovus' beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, targets, expectations, anticipations, assumptions, estimates, intentions and future performance and involve known and unknown risks, many of which are beyond Synovus' control and which may cause Synovus' actual results, performance or achievements or the financial services industry or economy generally, to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. 

All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. You can identify these forward-looking statements through Synovus' use of words such as &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;assumes,&#8221; &#8220;predicts,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;targets,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;projects,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;potential&#8221; and other similar words and expressions of the future or otherwise regarding the outlook for Synovus' future business and financial performance and/or the performance of the financial services industry and economy in general. Forward-looking statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of Synovus' management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements in this document. Many of these factors are beyond Synovus' ability to control or predict. These factors include, but are not limited to: 

(1) the risks and uncertainties related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its variants, on our assets, business, capital and liquidity, financial condition, prospects and results of operations; 

(2) the risk that we may not realize the expected benefits from our efficiency and growth initiatives or that we may not be able to realize such cost savings or revenue benefits in the time period expected, which could negatively affect our future profitability; 

(3) the risk that any economic downturn and contraction could have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition, credit quality, results of operations and future growth, including the risk that the current economic contraction could last much longer and be more severe if efforts to contain the pandemic are unsuccessful; 

(4) the risk that competition in the financial services industry may adversely affect our future earnings and growth; 

(5) our ability to attract and retain employees and the impact of executive management transitions that are key to our growth and efficiency strategies; 

(6) &#160; risks that our asset quality may deteriorate, our allowance for credit losses may prove to be inadequate or may be negatively affected by credit risk exposures, and the risk that we may be unable to obtain full payment in respect of any loan or other receivables; 

(7) &#160; the impact of recent and proposed changes in governmental policy, laws and regulations, including recently enacted laws, regulations and guidance related to government stimulus programs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, proposed and recently enacted changes in monetary policy and in the regulation and taxation of banks and financial institutions, or the interpretation or application thereof and the uncertainty of future implementation and enforcement of these regulations - including the risk of any resulting inflation and interest rate increases; 

(8) &#160; changes in the interest rate environment, including changes to the federal funds rate to include a negative interest rate environment, and competition in our primary market area may result in increased funding costs or reduced earning assets yields, thus reducing margins and net interest income; 

(9) the risk that our current and future information technology system enhancements and operational initiatives may not be successfully implemented, which could negatively impact our operations; 

(10) &#160; risks related to our implementation of new lines of business, new products and services or new technologies; 

(11) &#160; risks related to our business relationships with, and reliance upon, third parties that have strategic partnerships with us or that provide key components of our business infrastructure, including the costs of services and products provided to us by third parties, and risks related to disruptions in service or financial difficulties with a third-party vendor or business relationship; 

(12) &#160; the risk that our enterprise risk management framework, our compliance program, or our corporate governance and supervisory oversight functions may not identify or address risks adequately, which may result in unexpected losses; 

(13) &#160; the risk that we may be required to make substantial expenditures to keep pace with regulatory initiatives and the rapid technological changes in the financial services market; 

(14) &#160; changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market; 

(15) &#160; risks related to the ability of our operational framework to identify and manage risks associated with our business such as credit risk, compliance risk, reputational risk, and operational risk, including by virtue of our relationships with third-party business partners, as well as our relationship with third-party vendors and other service providers; 

(16) &#160; our ability to identify and address cyber-security risks such as data security breaches, malware, "denial of service" attacks, "hacking" and identity theft, a failure of which could disrupt our business and result in the disclosure of and/or misuse or misappropriation of confidential or proprietary information, disruption or damage of our systems, increased costs, significant losses, or adverse effects to our reputation; 

(17) &#160; the risk that we may be exposed to potential losses in the event of fraud and/or theft, or in the event that a third-party vendor, obligor, or business partner fails to pay amounts due to us under that relationship or under any arrangement that we enter into with them; 

(18) the impact on our financial results, reputation, and business if we are unable to comply with all applicable federal and state regulations or other supervisory actions or directives and any necessary capital initiatives; 

(19) the risks that if economic conditions worsen further or regulatory capital rules are modified, we may be required to undertake initiatives to improve or conserve our capital position; 

(20) &#160; risks related to the continued use, availability and reliability of LIBOR and the risks related to the transition from LIBOR to SOFR or other variable alternative reference rates we may use; 

(21) &#160; restrictions or limitations on access to funds from historical and alternative sources of liquidity could adversely affect our overall liquidity, which could restrict our ability to make payments on our obligations and our ability to support asset growth and sustain our operations and the operations of Synovus Bank; 

(22) &#160; our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity, including our ability to pay dividends or take other capital actions; 

(23) &#160; the risk that we may not be able to identify suitable bank and non-bank acquisition opportunities as part of our growth strategy and even if we are able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to complete such transactions on favorable terms or realize the anticipated benefits from such acquisitions; 

(24) &#160; the risk that we could realize losses if we sell non-performing assets and the proceeds we receive are lower than the carrying value of such assets; 

(25) &#160; risks related to regulatory approval to take certain actions, including any dividends on our common stock or preferred stock, any repurchases of common stock or any other issuance or redemption of any other regulatory capital instruments; 

(26) &#160; the risk that our concentrated operations in the Southeastern U.S. make us vulnerable to local economic conditions, local weather catastrophes, public health issues, and other external events; 

(27) the costs and effects of litigation, investigations or similar matters, or adverse facts and developments related thereto; 

(28) &#160; risks related to the fluctuation in our stock price and general volatility in the stock market; 

(29) &#160; the effects of any damages to our reputation resulting from developments related to any of the items identified above; and 

(30) &#160; other factors and other information contained in this Report and in other reports and filings that we make with the SEC under the Exchange Act, including, without limitation, those found in "Part II - Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Report.

Executive Summary 

Net income available to common shareholders for the second quarter of 2021 was $177.9 million, or $1.19 per diluted common share ($1.20 on an adjusted basis (1) ) , compared to $84.9 million, or $0.57 per diluted common share ($0.23 adjusted (1) ), for the second quarter of 2020. Net income available to common shareholders for the first six months of 2021 was $356.7 million, or $2.38 per diluted common share ( $2.40 adjusted (1) ), co mpared to $115.1 million, or $0.78 per diluted common share ( $0.44 adjusted (1) ) , for the first six months of 2020. The year-over-year increases for all time periods were impacted by significant changes in the provision for credit losses as a reversal was recorded for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 due to continued improvement in the economic outlook, and significant provision was recorded for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 due to the onset of COVID-19 following the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020. 

Net interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was $755.7 million, up $5.9 million compared to the same period in 2020, including $45.2 million in PPP fees during 2021 and $9.2 million in 2020. Net interest margin was down 22 bps over the comparable six-month period to 3.03%, due primarily to the decline in market interest rates and average growth in investment securities available for sale and interest-bearing funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was up $8.0 million, or 2%, primarily due to continued asset growth, further declines in deposit costs, and a higher day count. Net interest margin for the second quarter was 3.02%, which was down 2 bps compared to the first quarter of 2021 and impacted by lower PPP fees. Based on current market conditions and our expectations for loan growth, we expect that quarterly net interest income excluding PPP fees will increase in the second half of the year, driven by loan growth, deployment of liquidity, a deceleration of prepayments, and further deposit cost reductions. 

Non-interest revenue for the second quarter of 2021 was $107.1 million, down $66.4 million, or 38%, and year-to-date was $218.0 million, down $59.3 million, or 21%, compared to the same periods in 2020 due to gains on sales of investment securities of $69.4 million and $78.1 million in the respective 2020 periods. Adjusted non-interest revenue (1) for the second quarter of 2021 was $106.0 million, up $12.7 million, or 14%, from the second quarter of 2020 primarily due to higher core banking fees, brokerage revenue, and fiduciary and asset management fees partially offset by lower mortgage banking income. Year-to-date adjusted non-interest revenue (1) was $218.1 million, up $23.1 million, or 12%, compared to the same period in 2020 largely due to higher core banking fees, fiduciary and asset management fees, and brokerage revenue partially offset by lower capital markets income. In the second half of 2021, we expect diversified growth across our non-interest revenue sources to mostly offset the continued normalization of mortgage banking income. 

Non-interest expense for the second quarter of 2021 was $270.5 million, down $13.6 million, or 5%, compared to the second quarter of 2020 and adjusted non-interest expense (1) of $268.2 million was down $6.0 million, or 2%. On a year-to-date basis, non-interest expense was down $22.8 million, or 4%, and adjusted non-interest expense (1) was down $13.8 million, or 3%, compared to the same period in 2020. The decline in adjusted non-interest expense during 2021 was primarily due to 2020 being impacted by higher expense associated with initiating Synovus Forward, and in 2021, benefits are being realized from Synovus Forward efficiencies. The efficiency ratio-FTE for the first six months of 2021 was 55.13%, compared to 54.47% for the first six months of 2020. The adjusted tangible efficiency ratio (1) for the first six months of 2021 was 54.26%, down 306 bps compared to the same period a year ago. We remain committed to prudent expense management, enabling us to continue investing in areas that position us for greater success, deliver a superior customer experience, and promote profitable growth. 

At June 30, 2021, loans, net of deferred fees and costs, of $38.24 billion, decreased $17.0 million from December 31, 2020. C&#38;I loans grew $223.3 million excluding a $593.3 million decline in PPP loans from forgiveness, and CRE was relatively flat. Growth in consumer loans of $317.7 million, led by purchases of third-party lending loans, offset declines in consumer mortgages and HELOCs that were primarily the result of accelerated prepayment activity and excess consumer liquidity. We expect loan growth for 2021 to be at the low end of our initial 2%-4% guidance primarily due to the higher than expected prepayment activity that has occurred so far this year, excluding balance changes in PPP and third-party lending loans. 

Credit metrics remained stable and near historical lows as of June 30, 2021 with NPAs at 46 bps, NPLs at 42 bps, and total past dues at 13 bps, as a percentage of total loans, and YTD net charge-offs at 24 bps annualized. We expect net charge-offs to remain relatively stable in the second half of 2021, assuming no material change in economic outlook. Criticized and classified loans have begun to decline, decreasing 14% sequentially, and further reductions are expected as we progress through the rest of 2021 with improving financial performance in the hotel industry and other industries negatively impacted by COVID-19 anticipated. The ACL at June 30, 2021 totaled $563.6 million, a decrease of $89.9 million from December 31, 2020, resulting from the continued improved overall economic outlook. The ACL to loans coverage ratio at June 30, 2021 was 1.47%, or 1.54% excluding PPP loans. 

Total period-end deposits at June 30, 2021 increased $480.4 million, or 1%, compared to December 31, 2020. Core transaction deposits increased $2.75 billion, or 8%, compared to December 31, 2020, largely due to government stimulus programs including deposits associated with PPP loans. Total deposit costs of 16 bps during the second quarter of 2021 declined 6 bps and 12 bps, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2021 and the fourth quarter of 2020, due to repricing and intentional, strategic remixing to reduce higher cost deposits. 

At June 30, 2021, Synovus' CET1 ratio was 9.75%, well in excess of regulatory requirements, and was up 9 bps compared to December 31, 2020, driven by earnings. We will continue to opportunistically deploy capital on our balance sheet and to our shareholders. Synovus announced on January 26, 2021 that its Board of Directors authorized share repurchases of up to $200 million in 2021. While Synovus did not have any share repurchases during the first quarter of 2021, the Company repurchased $92.5 million, or 1.9 million shares of its common stock, at an average price of $47.51 during the second quarter of 2021. Synovus has also repurchased $27.1 million, or 637 thousand shares of its common stock, at an average price of $42.53 per share, as of July 31, 2021. Based on current conditions and economic outlook, we expect to complete the full authorization in the second half of the year. 

More detail on Synovus' financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 may be found in subsequent sections of "Item 2. &#8211; Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Report. See also "Item 1A. &#8211; Risk Factors" of this Report.

Changes in Financial Condition 

During the six months ended June 30, 2021, total assets increased $544.5 million to $54.94 billion. We deployed excess liquidity as cash and cash equivalents decreased $990.2 million, investment securities available for sale increased $1.48 billion, and consumer loans grew with purchases of $1.04 billion of third-party lending loans. Total loans decreased $17.0 million as PPP loan forgiveness offset C&#38;I growth, and elevated pay-offs in consumer mortgages and HELOCs offset the third-party lending purchases. The loan to deposit ratio was 8 1.1% at June 30, 2021, lower as compared to 81.9% in December 31, 2020, and 90.3% at June 30, 2020, due to excess liquidity, primarily due to various stimulus efforts which have supported deposit growth while muting the demand for credit. 

Total shareholders' equity at June 30, 2021 increased $76.4 million as compared to December 31, 2020, and included net income of $373.3 million, proceeds from stock option exercises of $14.9 million, and share-based compensation expense of $14.5 million, partially offset by dividends declared on common and preferred stock of $97.7 million and $16.6 million, respectively, unrealized losses in investment securities available for sale and cash flow hedges of $86.4 million and $26.5 million, respectively, and share repurchases of $92.5 million.

At June 30, 2021, loans, net of deferred fees and costs, of $38.24 billion, decreased $17.0 million from December 31, 2020. C&#38;I loans grew $223.3 million excluding a $593.3 million decline in PPP loans from forgiveness, CRE was relatively flat, and consumer loans increased $317.7 million, led by other consumer growth of $805.5 million, primarily from purchases of third-party lending loans. Declines in consumer mortgages and HELOCs of $312.7 million and $179.5 million, respectively, which were primarily the result of accelerated prepayment activity and excess consumer liquidity partially offset the growth in other consumer loans. We expect loan growth for 2021 to be at the low end of our initial 2%-4% guidance primarily due to the higher than expected prepayment activity that has occurred so far this year, excluding balance changes in PPP and third-party lending loans. 

C&#38;I loans remain the largest component of our loan portfolio, representing 50.1% of total loans, while CRE and consumer loans represent 27.1% and 22.8%, respectively. Our portfolio composition is established through a comprehensive concentration management policy which sets limits for C&#38;I, CRE, and consumer loan levels as well as for sub-categories therein. 

U.S. Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) 

Synovus is participating in the PPP, which is a loan program that originated from the CARES Act and was subsequently expanded by the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, which was signed into law on April 24, 2020. The total balance of all PPP loans was $1.60 billion as of June 30, 2021, compared to $2.19 billion as of December 31, 2020. The table below provides additional information on PPP loans.

Commercial Loans 

Total commercial loans (which are comprised of C&#38;I and CRE loans) at June 30, 2021 were $29.51 billion, or 77.2%, of the total loan portfolio, compared to $29.85 billion, or 78.0%, at December 31, 2020. 

At June 30, 2021, Synovus had eight commercial loan relationships with total commitments of $100 million or more (including amounts funded), with one single relationship exceeding $150 million in commitments. 

Commercial and Industrial Loans 

The C&#38;I loan portfolio represents the largest category of Synovus' loan portfolio and is primarily comprised of general middle market and commercial banking clients across a wide range of industries. The following table shows the composition of the C&#38;I loan portfolio aggregated by NAICS code. In accordance with Synovus' lending policy, each loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process which incorporates uniform underwriting standards and oversight in proportion to the size and complexity of the lending relationship. As of June 30, 2021, 86.4% (94.3% excluding PPP loans) of Synovus' C&#38;I loans are secured by real estate, business equipment, inventory, and other types of collateral compared to 83.2% (93.8% excluding PPP loans) as of December 31, 2020. C&#38;I loans at June 30, 2021 decreased $370.0 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2020, primarily due to $593.3 million of PPP forgiveness, offset by net growth of $223.3 million.

At June 30, 2021, $12.09 billion of C&#38;I loans, or 31.6% of the total loan portfolio, represented loans originated for the purpose of financing commercial, financial, and agricultural business activities. The primary source of repayment on these loans is revenue generated from products or services offered by the business or organization. The secondary source of repayment is the collateral, which consists primarily of equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, time deposits, cash surrender value of life insurance, and other business assets. 

At June 30, 2021, $7.06 billion of C&#38;I loans, or 18.5% of the total loan portfolio, represented loans originated for the purpose of financing owner-occupied properties. The financing of owner-occupied facilities is considered a C&#38;I loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral. This treatment is a result of the credit decision process, which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt. The secondary source of repayment on these loans is the underlying real estate. These loans are predominately secured by owner-occupied and other real estate, and to a lesser extent, other types of collateral. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans 

CRE loans consist primarily of income-producing investment properties loans. Additionally, CRE loans include 1-4 family properties loans as well as land and development loans. Total CRE loans of $10.36 billion increased $35.3 million from December 31, 2020. 

Investment properties loans consist of construction and mortgage loans for income-producing properties and are primarily made to finance multi-family properties, hotels, office buildings, shopping centers, warehouses and other commercial development properties. Total investment properties loans as of June 30, 2021 were $9.22 billion, or 89.0% of the CRE loan portfolio, and increased $114.6 million from December 31, 2020, with increases in other investment property and office buildings sub-categories, partially offset by a decline in multi-family loans. 

1-4 Family Properties Loans 

1-4 family properties loans include construction loans to home builders and commercial mortgage loans related to 1-4 family rental properties and are almost always secured by the underlying property being financed by such loans. These properties are primarily located in the markets served by Synovus. At June 30, 2021, 1-4 family properties loans totaled $636.3 million, or 6.1% of the CRE loan portfolio, and increased by $7.6 million from December 31, 2020. 

Land and Development Loans 

Land and development loans include commercial and residential development as well as land acquisition loans and are secured by land held for future development, typically in excess of one year. Properties securing these loans are substantially within markets served by Synovus and loan terms generally include personal guarantees from the principals. Loans in this portfolio are underwritten based on the LTV of the collateral and the capacity of the guarantor(s). Land and development loans of $506.7 million at June 30, 2021 continued to decline $86.9 million, or 15%, from $593.6 million at December 31, 2020. 

Consumer Loans 

The consumer loan portfolio consists of a wide variety of loan products offered through Synovus' banking network including first and second residential mortgages, HELOCs, and credit card loans, as well as both secured and unsecured loans from third-party lending. As of June 30, 2021, weighted-average FICO scores within the residential real estate portfolio based on committed balances were 777 for consumer mortgages and 792 for HELOCs. 

Consumer loans at June 30, 2021 of $8.72 billion increased $317.7 million, or 4%, compared to December 31, 2020. Consumer mortgages decreased $312.7 million, or 6%, from December 31, 2020, and HELOCs decreased $179.5 million, or 12%, from December 31, 2020. The reductions in consumer mortgages and HELOCs were primarily a result of accelerated prepayment activity and excess consumer liquidity. Credit card loans of $285.5 million at June 30, 2021 increased $4.5 million, or 2% from $281.0 million at December 31, 2020. Other consumer loans, which primarily includes third-party lending, increased $805.5 million, or 75%, from December 31, 2020. As of June 30, 2021, third-party lending balances totaled $1.45 billion, or 3.8%, of the total loan portfolio, and increased $775.8 million, or 114.4%, compared to December 31, 2020, led by purchases of $1.04 billion of third-party lending loans, partially offset by payment activity. We expect continued growth in the third-party lending portfolio in the near-term as we opportunistically deploy our balance sheet and liquidity position. 

Deposits 

Deposits provide the most significant funding source for interest earning assets. The following table shows the composition of period-end deposits as of the dates indicated.

(3) Core deposits exclude brokered deposits. 

(4) Core transaction deposits consist of non-interest-bearing demand deposits, interest-bearing demand deposits, money market accounts, and savings deposits excluding public funds and brokered deposits. 

Total period-end deposits at June 30, 2021 increased $480.4 million, or 1%, compared to December 31, 2020. Core transaction deposits increased $2.75 billion, or 8%, compared to December 31, 2020. On a year-to-date average basis, the increase in total deposits was $3.87 billion, or 9%, compared to December 31, 2020. The increases in deposit balances on both a period-end and average basis compared to December 31, 2020 are due largely to government stimulus programs including deposits associated with the second phase of PPP loans. Total deposit costs of 16 bps during the second quarter of 2021 

declined 6 bps and 12 bps, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2021 and the fourth quarter of 2020, due to repricing and intentional, strategic remixing to reduce higher cost deposits. 

Non-interest Revenue 

Non-interest revenue for the second quarter of 2021 was $107.1 million, down $66.4 million, or 38%, and year-to-date was $218.0 million, down $59.3 million, or 21%, compared to the same periods in 2020. Gains on sales of investment securities of $69.4 million and $78.1 million, respectively, impacted the three and six months ended June 30, 2020. Adjusted non-interest revenue (1) for the second quarter of 2021 was $106.0 million, up $12.7 million, or 14%, from the second quarter of 2020 primarily due to higher core banking fees (2) , brokerage revenue, and fiduciary and asset management fees partially offset by lower mortgage banking income. Year-to-date adjusted non-interest revenue (1) was $218.1 million, up $23.1 million, or 12%, compared to the same period in 2020 largely due to higher core banking fees (2) , fiduciary and asset management fees, and brokerage revenue partially offset by lower capital markets income. In the second half of 2021, we expect diversified growth across our non-interest revenue sources to mostly offset the continued normalization of mortgage banking income.

Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 compared to June 30, 2020 

Service charges on deposit accounts, consisting of NSF fees, account analysis fees, and all other service charges, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 were up $5.8 million, or 38%, and $5.2 million, or 14%, respectively, due largely to higher account analysis fees, which were up $3.2 million , or 46%, and $5.4 million, or 39%, respectively, f ollowing our pricing for value Synovus Forward initiative implemented during the first quarter of 2021. NSF fees for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 comprised 29% and 37%, respectively, of service charges on deposit accounts. A ll other service charges on deposit accounts, which consist primarily of monthly fees on retail demand deposits, saving accounts, and small business accounts, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, were up $1.0 million , or 25%, and $1.2 million , or 13%, respectively. 

Fiduciary and asset management fees are derived from providing estate administration, personal trust, corporate trust, corporate bond, investment management, financial planning, and family office services. Fiduciary and asset management fees increased $3.9 million, or 26%, and $6.6 million, or 22%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively . The increases were driven by growth in total assets under management which increased by 28% from June 30, 2020 to $21.23 billion at June 30, 2021. 

Card fees for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 were up $4.1 million, or 45%, and $5.2 million, or 26%, respectively, with increased transaction volume in all card fee categories. Card fees consist primarily of credit card interchange fees, debit card interchange fees, and merchant discounts. Card fees are reported net of certain associated expense items including customer loyalty program expenses and network expenses. 

Brokerage revenue of $13.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 was up $3.9 million, or 40%, and for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was $26.9 million, up $4.5 million, or 20%. The year-over-year increase was driven by growth in 

assets under management and higher transaction revenue driven by favorable market conditions. Brokerage revenue consists primarily of brokerage commissions as well as advisory fees earned from the management of customer assets. 

Mortgage banking income was significantly lower for the second quarter of 2021, with a decrease of $9.7 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020. The decline in mortgage banking income was driven by lower gains on sale and refinance activities. Total secondary market mortgage loan production was $422.1 million, down $213.1 million, and $995.2 million, up $105.5 million, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. While second quarter 2021 mortgage production levels remained elevated, we expect continued normalization in the second half of 2021. 

Capital markets income primarily includes fee income from customer derivative transactions. Additionally, capital markets income includes fee income from capital raising investment banking transactions and foreign exchange as well as other miscellaneous income from capital market transactions. Capital markets income was down $2.7 million, or 45%, and $6.5 million, or 37%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, as commercial client activity to lock in lower rates was elevated in 2020. 

Income from BOLI, which includes increases in the cash surrender value of policies and proceeds from insurance benefits, decreased $568 thousand, or 7%, and increased $2.2 million, or 16%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021. The year-to-date increase was driven by proceeds from insurance benefits of $2.1 million received in the first quarter of 2021. 

Investment securities losses, net, of $2.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 reflected strategic sales of mortgage-backed securities. Investment securities gains, net, of $69.4 million and $78.1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, reflected strategic repositioning of the portfolio primarily during the latter part of the second quarter of 2020. The transactions were primarily focused on agency mortgage-backed securities, but also included the disposition of Synovus' remaining $155.0 million in asset-backed securities. 

The main components of other non-interest revenue are fees for letters of credit and unused lines of credit, safe deposit box fees, access fees for ATM use, other service charges and loan servicing fees, income from insurance commissions, gains from sales of GGL/SBA loans, and other miscellaneous items. The six months ended June 30, 2021 included a $2.4 million increase in income related to investments in solar energy tax credit partnerships and a $2.3 million increase in insurance revenue as compared to 2020. The six months ended June 30, 2020 included $4.5 million in realized gains from the sale of positions in two publicly-traded equity investments and a sale-leaseback gain of $2.4 million. 

Non-interest Expense 

Non-interest expense for the second quarter of 2021 was $270.5 million , down $13.6 million, or 5%, compared to the second quarter of 2020 and adjusted non-interest expense of $268.2 million was down $6.0 million, or 2%. On a year-to-date basis, non-interest expense was down $22.8 million, or 4%, and adjusted non-interest expense was down $13.8 million, or 3%. The decline in adjusted non-interest expense during 2021 was primarily due to 2020 being impacted by higher expense associated with Synovus Forward as well as a 6% reduction in headcount year-over-year, which primarily came from back-office support functions and offset other personnel expense increases. The adjusted tangible efficiency ratio for the first six months of 2021 was 54.26%, down 306 bps compared to the same period a year ago. We remain committed to prudent expense management, enabling us to continue investing in areas that position us for greater success, deliver a superior customer experience, and promote profitable growth. See "Table 14 - Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures&#8221; in this Report for applicable reconciliation to GAAP measures. 

The following table summarizes the components of non-interest expense.

Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 compared to June 30, 2020 

Salaries and other personnel expense increased $1.0 million, or 1%, and $12.8 million, or 4%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, due primarily to higher share-based compensation expense largely due to timing with a higher level of retirement eligible expense acceleration, an increase in bonus accrual due to higher than expected performance, and higher temporary help. Total headcount of 5,087 declined 160 from December 31, 2020 and 341, or 6%, from June 30, 2020 led by Synovus' voluntary early retirement program offered during the fourth quarter of 2020 and branch closures. 

Net occupancy, equipment, and software expense was flat on a quarter-over-quarter basis and decreased $1.0 million, or 1%, comparatively year-to-date. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was due primarily to a reduction of 8 branches as compared to June 30, 2020. 

Third-party processing and other services include all third-party core operating system and processing charges as well as third-party loan servicing charges. Third-party processing expense increased $1.8 million, or 8%, and decreased $915 thousand, or 2%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. The increase for the three months ended June 30, 2021 is primarily due to additional expenses associated with PPP loan forgiveness. The decline for the six months ended June 30, 2021 is primarily associated with Synovus' restructure of certain of its third-party consumer-based lending partnership arrangements during the second quarter of 2020 with a shift of new originations to held for sale mostly offset by expenses associated with PPP loan forgiveness. 

Professional fees decreased $7.4 million, or 48%, and $8.9 million, or 34%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, from decreases in consulting fees related to Synovus Forward. 

FDIC insurance and other regulatory fees decreased $1.3 million, or 19%, and $1.0 million, or 8%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, reflecting lower assessment rate due to higher cash balances and subordinated debt issued by Synovus Bank in the fourth quarter of 2020. 

Earnout liability fair value adjustments associated with the Global One acquisition were the result of higher than projected earnings and higher earnings estimates over the remaining contractual earnout period, reflecting the continued success of the Global One enterprise. Significant adjustments are not expected as the earnout period ended on June 30, 2021. 

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, Synovus recorded restructuring charges of $415 thousand and $946 thousand, respectively. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, Synovus recorded restructuring charges of $2.8 million and $6.0 million, respectively, related to branch closures and restructuring of corporate real estate as part of Synovus Forward as 9 branches were closed in 2020, and 4 branches have been closed year-to-date in 2021. 

Other operating expenses includes advertising, travel, insurance, network and communication, other taxes, subscriptions and dues, other loan and ORE expense, postage and freight, training, business development, supplies, donations, and other miscellaneous expenses. Other operating expenses were down $943 thousand and $12.0 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, driven by decreases in advertising expense of $802 thousand and $3.8 million, respectively. Other operating expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2020 also included a $2.7 million valuation adjustment on a MPS receivable and a $2.5 million charge from termination of customer swaps. 

Income Tax Expense 

Income tax expense was $106.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, representing an effective tax rate of 22.1%, compared to income tax expense of $34.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, representing an effective tax rate of 20.7%. The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2021 reflected a net discrete tax benefit of $2.2 million compared to a net discrete benefit of $5.3 million in the comparable period of 2020. The net discrete benefit year-to-date in 2021 includes discrete benefits of $4.5 million related to changes in amounts taxable by jurisdictions and $2.3 million related to share-based compensation, partly offset by discrete expense of $4.6 million related to other accrual adjustments. The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2020 reflected a one-time discrete benefit of $2.7 million for the carryback of net operating loss deductions as permitted by the CARES Act, and $2.6 million of other discrete benefit items. 

Synovus&#8217; effective tax rate considers many factors including, but not limited to, the level of pre-tax income, BOLI, tax-exempt interest, certain income tax credits, and nondeductible expenses. In addition, the effective tax rate is affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period-to-period, such as tax benefits related to share-based compensation, jurisdiction statutory tax rate changes, valuation allowance changes, and changes to unrecognized tax benefits. Accordingly, the comparability of the effective tax rate between periods may be impacted. 

On May 28, 2021, the Biden Administration released its Fiscal Year 2022 Revenue Proposals, which included an increase in the federal corporate income tax rate to 28%, up from the current 21%, consistent with the details of the Biden Administration&#8217;s previously released Made in America Tax Plan. We continue to monitor the legislative process and the potential impact to the Company and its customers. 

CREDIT QUALITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 

Credit Quality 

Synovus continuously monitors the quality of its loan portfolio by industry, property type, geography, as well as credit quality metrics. At June 30, 2021, credit metrics remained stable and near historical lows with NPAs at 46 bps, NPLs at 42 bps, and total past dues at 13 bps, as a percentage of total loans. Net charge-offs remained low at $26.5 million, or 28 bps annualized, and $46.8 million, or 24 bps annualized, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. We expect net charge-offs to remain relatively stable in the second half of 2021, assuming no material change in economic outlook. 

The table below includes selected credit quality metrics.

Total NPAs as a percentage of total loans, ORE, and specific other assets were 0.46% at June 30, 2021, compared to 0.50% at December 31, 2020. Total NPAs were $177.8 million at June 30, 2021 compared to $192.1 million at December 31, 2020 . 

Criticized and Classified Loans 

Our loan ratings are aligned to federal banking regulators' definitions of pass and criticized categories, which include special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss. Substandard accruing and non-accruing loans, doubtful, and loss loans are often collectively referred to as classified. Special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss loans are often collectively referred to as criticized and classified loans. The following table presents a summary of criticized and classified loans. Criticized and classified loans at June 30, 2021 declined $261.4 million, or 14%, sequentially primarily as a result of upgrades in the hotel industry. Further reductions are expected as we progress through the rest of 2021 with improving financial performance in the hotel industry and other industries negatively impacted by COVID-19 anticipated.

Reversal of Provision for Credit Losses and Allowance for Credit Losses 

Reversal of provision for credit losses of $24.6 million and $43.2 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, resulted from the continued improvement in the economic forecast for pooled loans and the reduction in the individually analyzed reserve as a result of charge-offs of pre-existing reserves that were not replaced. This was partially offset by $10.6 million and $25.8 million in reserves added as a result of purchases of $434.6 million and $1.04 billion of third-party lending loans, including $304.5 million and $780.7 million in prime auto purchases for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. 

The ACL, consisting of an ALL of $516.7 million and reserve for unfunded commitments of $46.9 million, totaled $563.6 million at June 30, 2021 and declined $89.9 million from December 31, 2020, resulting in an ACL to loans coverage ratio of 1.47% and an ACL to NPLs ratio of 350%. Excluding PPP loans, the ACL to loans coverage ratio was 1.54%. The ACL at June 30, 2021 incorporates an outlook of an accelerated recovery including the unemployment rate improving to 4.5% by the end of 2021, compared to 5.7% in the first quarter of 2021 estimate.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

Accruing TDRs were $124.5 million at June 30, 2021, compared to $135.0 million at December 31, 2020. Non-accruing TDRs were $21.0 million at June 30, 2021, compared to $39.0 million at December 31, 2020. 

Accruing TDRs are considered performing because they are performing in accordance with the re structured terms. At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, approximately 97% and 99%, respectively, of accruing TDRs were current. In addition, subsequent defaults on accruing TDRs (defaults defined as the earlier of the TDR being placed on non-accrual status or reaching 90 days past due with respect to principal and/or interest payments within twelve months of the TDR designation) have continued to remain at low levels. 

Non-TDR Modifications due to COVID-19 

Regulatory agencies have encouraged financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of COVID-19. In the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (initially issued on March 22, 2020 and revised on April 7, 2020), for example, the regulatory agencies expressed their view of loan modification programs as positive actions that may mitigate adverse effects on borrowers due to COVID-19 and their unwillingness to criticize institutions for working with borrowers in a safe and sound manner. Moreover, the Interagency Statement provided that eligible loan modifications related to COVID-19 may be accounted for under section 4013 of the CARES Act or in accordance with ASC 310-40. On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 extended the applicable period of Section 4013 of the CARES Act. This allows banks to elect to not consider loan modifications related to COVID-19 that are made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of January 1, 2022, or 60 days after the national emergency ends to borrowers that are current (i.e., less than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019) as TDRs. The regulatory agencies further stated that performing loans granted payment deferrals due to COVID-19 are not considered past due or non-accrual. FASB confirmed the foregoing regulatory agencies' view that such short-term modifications (e.g., six months) made on a good-faith basis in response 

to COVID-19 for borrowers who are current are not TDRs. 

During 2020, Synovus provided relief programs consisting primarily of 90-day payment deferral relief to borrowers negatively impacted by COVID-19, and as of June 30, 2021, no loans were in a P&#38;I deferral status as compared to 0.3% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. In addition to our P&#38;I deferment program, under the CARES Act, we have also provided borrowers who have been impacted by COVID-19 with other modifications such as interest-only relief or amortization extensions on approximately 2% of total loans, at both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Capital Resources 

Synovus and Synovus Bank are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by our primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve. Synovus and Synovus Bank measure capital adequacy using the standardized approach under Basel III. At June 30, 2021, Synovus and Synovus Bank's capital levels remained strong and exceeded well-capitalized requirements currently in effect. The following table presents certain ratios used to measure Synovus and Synovus Bank's capitalization.

(1) See "Table 14 - Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures&#8221; in this Report for the applicable reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure. 

At June 30, 2021, Synovus' CET1 ratio increased to 9.75%, well in excess of regulatory requirements including the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%. The June 30, 2021 CET1 ratio improved 9 bps compared to December 31, 2020, driven by earnings. For additional information on regulatory capital requirements, see "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 12 - Regulatory Capital" to the consolidated financial statements of Synovus' 2020 Form 10-K. Management reviews the Company's capital position on an on-going basis and believes, based on internal capital analyses and earnings projections, that Synovus is well positioned to meet relevant regulatory capital standards. 

Synovus announced on January 26, 2021 that its Board of Directors authorized share repurchases of up to $200 million in 2021. As of June 30, 2021, Synovus had repurchased $92.5 million, or 1.9 million shares of its common stock, at an average price of $47.51 per share. As of July 31, 2021, the remaining authorization under this program was $80.4 million. Based on current conditions and economic outlook, we expect to complete the full authorization in the second half of the year. 

On August 26, 2020, the federal banking regulators issued a final rule (following an interim final rule issued on March 27, 

2020) that allowed electing banking organizations that adopt CECL during 2020 to mitigate the estimated effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year phase-in transition period. Synovus adopted CECL on January 1, 2020 and the June 30, 2021 regulatory capital ratios reflect Synovus' election of the five-year transition provision. At June 30, 2021, $74.9 million, or a cumulative 17 bps benefit to CET1, was deferred. 

Dividends 

Synovus has historically paid a quarterly cash dividend to the holders of its common stock. Management and the Board of Directors closely monitor current and projected capital levels, liquidity (including dividends from subsidiaries), financial markets and other economic trends, as well as regulatory requirements regarding the payment of dividends. 

Synovus' ability to pay dividends on its common stock and preferred stock is primarily dependent upon dividends and distributions that it receives from its bank and non-banking subsidiaries, which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities. 

Synovus declared common stock dividends of $97.7 million, or $0.66 per common share, for the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to $97.2 million, or $0.66 per common share, for the six months ended June 30, 2020. In addition, Synovus declared dividends on its preferred stock of $16.6 million during both six month periods ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. 

Liquidity 

Liquidity represents the extent to which Synovus has readily available sources of funding to meet the needs of depositors, borrowers and creditors, to support asset growth, and to otherwise sustain operations of Synovus and its subsidiaries, at a reasonable cost, on a timely basis, and without adverse consequences. ALCO monitors Synovus' economic, competitive, and regulatory environment and is responsible for measuring, monitoring, and reporting on liquidity and funding risk as well as market risk. 

In accordance with Synovus policies and regulatory guidance, ALCO evaluates contractual and anticipated cash flows under normal and stressed conditions to properly manage the Company&#8217;s liquidity profile. Synovus places an emphasis on maintaining numerous sources of current and contingent liquidity to meet its obligations to depositors, borrowers, and creditors on a timely basis. Liquidity is generated through various sources, including, but not limited to, maturities and repayments of loans by customers, maturities and sales of investment securities, and growth in core or wholesale deposits. Management continuously monitors and maintains appropriate levels of liquidity so as to provide adequate funding sources to manage customer deposit withdrawals, loan requests, and other funding demands. 

Synovus Bank also generates liquidity through the issuance of brokered certificates of deposit and money market accounts. Synovus Bank accesses these funds from a broad geographic base to diversify its sources of funding and liquidity. Synovus Bank also has the capacity to access funding through its membership in the FHLB system and through the Federal Reserve discount window. At June 30, 2021, based on currently pledged collateral, Synovus Bank had access to incremental FHLB funding of $6.53 billion, subject to FHLB credit policies. 

In addition to bank level liquidity management, Synovus must manage liquidity at the parent company level for various operating needs including the servicing of debt, the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock, share repurchases, payment of general corporate expenses and potential capital infusions into subsidiaries. The primary source of liquidity for Synovus consists of dividends from Synovus Bank, which is governed by certain rules and regulations of the GA DBF and the Federal Reserve Bank. Synovus' ability to receive dividends from Synovus Bank in future periods will depend on a number of factors, including, without limitation, Synovus Bank's future profits, asset quality, liquidity, and overall condition. In addition, both the GA DBF and Federal Reserve Bank may require approval to pay dividends, based on certain regulatory statutes and limitations. 

Synovus presently believes that the sources of liquidity discussed above, including existing liquid funds on hand, are sufficient to meet its anticipated funding needs. However, if economic conditions were to significantly deteriorate, regulatory capital requirements for Synovus or Synovus Bank were to increase as the result of regulatory directives or otherwise, or Synovus believes it is prudent to enhance current liquidity levels, then Synovus may seek additional liquidity from external sources. See "Part I &#8211; Item 1A. Risk Factors - Changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market may adversely affect our capital resources, liquidity and financial results " of Synovus' 2020 Form 10-K. Furthermore, Synovus may, from time to time, take advantage of attractive market opportunities to refinance its existing debt, redeem its preferred stock, or strengthen its liquidity or capital position. 

Earning Assets and Sources of Funds 

Average total assets for the six months ended June 30, 2021 increased $3.83 billion, or 8%, to $54.61 billion as compared to $50.78 billion for the first six months of 2020. Average earning assets increased $3.71 billion, or 8%, in the first six months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. The increase in average earning assets primarily resulted from a $2.16 billion, or 33%, increase in average investment securities available for sale, a $1.60 billion, or 153%, increase in average interest-bearing funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank, and a $719.4 million increase in loans held for sale, partially offset by a $509.4 million decrease in average total loans, net of unearned. 

Average interest-bearing liabilities decreased $286.9 million, or 1%, to $33.87 billion for the first six months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. The decrease in average interest-bearing liabilities resulted from a $3.55 billion, or 40%, decrease in average time deposits, a $1.55 billion, or 56%, decrease in average long-term debt, and a $967.2 million decrease in other short-term borrowings. These decreases were mostly offset by a $3.76 billion, or 28%, increase in average money market deposits and a $1.73 billion, or 25%, increase in average interest-bearing demand deposits. Average non-interest-bearing deposits increased $3.78 billion, or 35%, to $14.44 billion for the first six months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, due largely to liquidity associated with various government stimulus efforts. 

Net interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was $755.7 million, up $5.9 million compared to the same period in 2020, including $45.2 million in PPP fees during 2021 and $9.2 million in 2020. Net interest margin was down 22 bps over the comparable six - month period to 3.03%, due primarily to the decline in market interest rates and average growth in investment securities available for sale and interest-bearing funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank. For the six months ended June 30, 2021, the yield on earning assets was 3.29%, a decrease of 74 bps compared to the six months ended June 30, 2020, while the effective cost of funds decreased 52 bps to 0.26%. The yield on loans decreased 37 bps to 3.97%, due primarily to the decline in market interest rates, while the yield on investment securities decreased 149 bps to 1.42%, due primarily to an acceleration in prepayments and increase in premium amortization, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2020. 

On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was up $8.0 million, or 2%, primarily due to continued asset growth, further declines in deposit costs, and a higher day count. Net interest margin for the second quarter was 3.02%, which was down 2 bps compared to the first quarter of 2021 and impacted by lower PPP fees. The second quarter of 2021 included $20.4 million recognized for associated PPP fees versus $24.9 million in the first quarter of 2021 and average PPP loan balances of $2.14 billion versus $2.24 billion in the first quarter of 2021. For the second quarter of 2021, the yield on earning assets decreased 6 bps, while the effective cost of funds decreased 4 bps compared to the first quarter of 2021. 

Based on current market conditions and our expectations for loan growth, we expect that quarterly net interest income excluding PPP fees will increase in the second half of the year, driven by loan growth, deployment of liquidity, a deceleration of prepayments, and further deposit cost reductions. 

Quarterly yields earned on average interest-earning assets and rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities for the five most recent quarters are presented below.

Market Risk Analysis 

Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Synovus is potentially exposed. Synovus measures its sensitivity to changes in market interest rates through the use of a simulation model which incorporates all of Synovus&#8217; earning assets and liabilities. These simulations are used to determine a baseline net interest income projection and the sensitivity of the income profile based on changes in interest rates. These simulations incorporate assumptions and factors, including, but not limited to, changes in market rates, in the size or composition of the balance sheet, and in repricing characteristics as well as customer behaviors. This process is reviewed and updated on an on-going basis in a manner consistent with Synovus&#8217; ALCO governance framework. 

Synovus has modeled its baseline net interest income projection assuming a flat interest rate environment with the federal funds rate at the Federal Reserve&#8217;s current targeted range of 0% to 0.25% and the current prime rate of 3.25%. Synovus has modeled the impact of a gradual increase in market interest rates across the yield curve of 100 and 200 bps and a gradual decline of 25 bps to determine the sensitivity of net interest income for the next twelve months. The lesser decline of the downrate scenario presented was selected in light of the low absolute level of monetary policy rates and generally incorporates an assumption that rates are floored at the zero-lower-bound. Synovus' current rate risk position is considered asset-sensitive and would be expected to benefit net interest income in a rising interest rate environment and reduce net interest income in a declining interest rate environment. A modest decline in sensitivity relative to the prior period-end is the result of a host of factors, including increased securities portfolio and the higher absolute level of long-term interest rates. The following table represents the estimated sensitivity of net interest income at June 30, 2021, with comparable information for December 31, 2020. 

Table 13 - Twelve Month Net Interest Income Sensitivity Estimated % Change in Net Interest Income as Compared to Unchanged Rates (for the next twelve months) Change in Short-term Interest Rates (in bps) June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 +200 6.3% 6.8% +100 3.2% 3.5% -25 (0.5)% (0.5)% 

The net interest income simulation model is the primary tool utilized to evaluate potential interest rate risks over a shorter-term time horizon. Synovus also evaluates potential longer-term interest rate risk through modeling and evaluation of the sensitivity of the Company's Economic Value of Equity (EVE). The EVE measurement process estimates the net fair value of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet financial instruments under various interest rate scenarios. Management uses EVE sensitivity analyses as an additional means of measuring interest rate risk and incorporates this form of analysis within its governance and limits framework. 

LIBOR Transition 

In July 2017, the FCA, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR at the end of 2021. On March 5, 2021, the FCA confirmed that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021 for the 1-week and 2-month US dollar settings and immediately after June 30, 2023 for all remaining US dollar settings. 

The ARRC has proposed SOFR as its preferred rate as an alternative to LIBOR and has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR. Organizations are currently working on industry-wide and company-specific transition plans related to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. As noted within "Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors" of Synovus' 2020 Form 10-K, Synovus holds instruments that may be impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR, which include floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives and hedges, and other financial instruments. Synovus has established a cross-functional LIBOR transition working group with representation from all business lines, support and control functions, and legal counsel that has 1) assessed the Company's current exposure to LIBOR indexed instruments and the data, systems and processes that will be impacted; 2) established a detailed implementation plan; 3) formulated communications and learning activities to support customers and colleagues; and 4) developed a formal governance structure for the transition. Loan agreement provisions for new and renewed loans include LIBOR fallback language to ensure transition from LIBOR to the new benchmark when such transition occurs. All direct exposures resulting from existing financial contracts that mature after 2021 have been inventoried and are monitored on an ongoing basis. Based on regulatory guidance, the Company currently expects to cease originating loans indexed to LIBOR no later than December 31, 2021. Synovus is expanding its product offerings, and there are currently several viable alternative reference rates being evaluated for use as potential replacements of LIBOR. We do 

not currently expect there to be a material financial impact to the Company or our customers regardless of which index or indices the Company selects to offer as alternatives to LIBOR. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The accounting and financial reporting policies of Synovus are in accordance with GAAP and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. Synovus has identified certain of its accounting policies as &#8220;critical accounting policies,&#8221; consisting of those related to the allowance for credit losses and income taxes. In determining which accounting policies are critical in nature, Synovus has identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates. It is management's practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the Board of Directors' Audit Committee on a periodic basis, including the development, selection, implementation and disclosure of the critical accounting policies. The application of these policies has a significant impact on Synovus&#8217; unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. Synovus&#8217; financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are used in the application of these policies. All accounting policies described in "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Synovus' 2020 Form 10-K should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance. There have been no significant changes to the accounting policies, estimates and assumptions, or the judgments affecting the application of these estimates and assumptions from those disclosed in Synovus' 2020 Form 10-K other than the exclusion of goodwill impairment as a critical accounting estimate due to lack of impairment indicators. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The measures entitled adjusted non-interest revenue; adjusted non-interest expense; adjusted total revenue; adjusted tangible efficiency ratio; adjusted net income per common share, diluted; adjusted return on average assets; adjusted return on average common equity; adjusted return on average tangible common equity; and tangible common equity ratio are not measures recognized under GAAP and therefore are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The most comparable GAAP measures to these measures are total non-interest revenue; total non-interest expense; total FTE revenue; efficiency ratio-FTE; net income per common share, diluted; return on average assets; return on average common equity; and the ratio of total shareholders' equity to total assets, respectively. 

Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful additional information about Synovus to assist management and investors in evaluating Synovus&#8217; operating results, financial strength, the performance of its business, and the strength of its capital position. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of operating results or capital position as reported under GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as additional views of the way our financial measures are affected by significant items and other factors, and since they are not required to be uniformly applied, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures at other companies. Adjusted total revenue and adjusted non-interest revenue are measures used by management to evaluate total FTE revenue and non-interest revenue exclusive of net investment securities gains (losses), changes in fair value of private equity investments, net, and fair value adjustment on non-qualified deferred compensation. Adjusted non-interest expense and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio are measures utilized by management to measure the success of expense management initiatives focused on reducing recurring controllable operating costs. Adjusted net income per common share, diluted, adjusted return on average assets, and adjusted return on average common equity are measurements used by management to evaluate operating results exclusive of items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact period-to-period comparisons. Adjusted return on average tangible common equity is a measure used by management to compare Synovus' performance with other financial institutions because it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization, thereby allowing management to evaluate the performance of the business consistently. The tangible common equity ratio is used by management to assess the strength of our capital position. The computations of these measures are set forth in the tables below.
