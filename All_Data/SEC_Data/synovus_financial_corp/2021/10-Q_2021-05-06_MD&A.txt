Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements in this document. Many of these factors are beyond Synovus' ability to control or predict. These factors include, but are not limited to: 

(1) the risks and uncertainties related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our assets, business, capital and liquidity, financial condition, prospects and results of operations; 

(2) the risk that we may not realize the expected benefits from our efficiency and growth initiatives or that we may not be able to realize such cost savings or revenue benefits in the time period expected, which could negatively affect our future profitability; 

(3) &#160; the risk that any economic downturn and contraction could have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition, credit quality, results of operations and future growth, including the risk that the current economic contraction could last much longer and be more severe if efforts to contain the pandemic are unsuccessful; 

(4) the risk that competition in the financial services industry may adversely affect our future earnings and growth; 

(5) our ability to attract and retain employees and the impact of executive management transitions that are key to our growth and efficiency strategies; 

(6) &#160; risks that our asset quality may deteriorate, our allowance for credit losses may prove to be inadequate or may be negatively affected by credit risk exposures, and the risk that we may be unable to obtain full payment in respect of any loan or other receivables; 

(7) &#160; the impact of recent and proposed changes in governmental policy, laws and regulations, including recently enacted laws, regulations and guidance related to government stimulus programs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, proposed and recently enacted changes in monetary policy and in the regulation and taxation of banks and financial institutions, or the interpretation or application thereof and the uncertainty of future implementation and enforcement of these regulations; 

(8) &#160; changes in the interest rate environment, including changes to the federal funds rate to include a negative interest rate environment, and competition in our primary market area may result in increased funding costs or reduced earning assets yields, thus reducing margins and net interest income; 

(9) the risk that our current and future information technology system enhancements and operational initiatives may not be successfully implemented, which could negatively impact our operations; 

(10) &#160; risks related to our implementation of new lines of business, new products and services or new technologies; 

(11) &#160; risks related to our business relationships with, and reliance upon, third parties that have strategic partnerships with us or that provide key components of our business infrastructure, including the costs of services and products provided to us by third parties, and risks related to disruptions in service or financial difficulties with a third-party vendor or business relationship; 

(12) &#160; the risk that our enterprise risk management framework, our compliance program, or our corporate governance and supervisory oversight functions may not identify or address risks adequately, which may result in unexpected losses; 

(13) &#160; the risk that we may be required to make substantial expenditures to keep pace with regulatory initiatives and the rapid technological changes in the financial services market; 

(14) &#160; changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market; 

(15) &#160; risks related to the ability of our operational framework to identify and manage risks associated with our business such as credit risk, compliance risk, reputational risk, and operational risk, including by virtue of our relationships with third-party business partners, as well as our relationship with third-party vendors and other service providers; 

(16) &#160; our ability to identify and address cyber-security risks such as data security breaches, malware, "denial of service" attacks, "hacking" and identity theft, a failure of which could disrupt our business and result in the disclosure of and/or misuse or misappropriation of confidential or proprietary information, disruption or damage of our systems, increased costs, significant losses, or adverse effects to our reputation; 

(17) &#160; the risk that we may be exposed to potential losses in the event of fraud and/or theft, or in the event that a third-party vendor, obligor, or business partner fails to pay amounts due to us under that relationship or under any arrangement that we enter into with them; 

(18) the impact on our financial results, reputation, and business if we are unable to comply with all applicable federal and state regulations or other supervisory actions or directives and any necessary capital initiatives; 

(19) the risks that if economic conditions worsen further or regulatory capital rules are modified, we may be required to undertake initiatives to improve or conserve our capital position; 

(20) &#160; risks related to the continued use, availability and reliability of LIBOR and the risks related to the transition from LIBOR to other benchmark rates; 

(21) &#160; restrictions or limitations on access to funds from historical and alternative sources of liquidity could adversely affect our overall liquidity, which could restrict our ability to make payments on our obligations and our ability to support asset growth and sustain our operations and the operations of Synovus Bank; 

(22) &#160; our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity, including our ability to pay dividends or take other capital actions; 

(23) &#160; the risk that we may not be able to identify suitable bank and non-bank acquisition opportunities as part of our growth strategy and even if we are able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to complete such transactions on favorable terms or realize the anticipated benefits from such acquisitions; 

(24) &#160; the risk that we could realize losses if we sell non-performing assets and the proceeds we receive are lower than the carrying value of such assets; 

(25) &#160; risks related to regulatory approval to take certain actions, including any dividends on our common stock or preferred stock, any repurchases of common stock or any other issuance or redemption of any other regulatory capital instruments; 

(26) &#160; the risk that our concentrated operations in the Southeastern U.S. make us vulnerable to local economic conditions, local weather catastrophes, public health issues, and other external events; 

(27) the costs and effects of litigation, investigations or similar matters, or adverse facts and developments related thereto, including the costs and effects of litigation related to our participation in government stimulus programs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic; 

(28) &#160; risks related to the fluctuation in our stock price and general volatility in the stock market; 

(29) &#160; the effects of any damages to our reputation resulting from developments related to any of the items identified above; and

Executive Summary 

Net income available to common shareholders for the first quarter of 2021 was $178.8 million, or $1.19 per diluted common share, a significant increase compared to $30.2 million, or $0.20 per diluted common share, in the first quarter of 2020. Adjusted net income per common share, diluted (1) was $1.21, compared to $0.21 for the first quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively. The year-over-year increase was impacted by a significant provision for credit losses recorded during the first quarter of 2020 due to the onset of COVID-19 following the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020. 

Net interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $373.9 million, up $597 thousand compared to the same period in 2020 including $24.9 million in PPP processing fees during the first quarter of 2021. Net interest margin was down 33 bps over the comparable three-month period to 3.04%, due primarily to the decline in market interest rates and accelerated prepayment activity. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was down $12.1 million and net interest margin was down 8 bps . The sequential quarter decline in net interest income was primarily due to a lower day count and a continuation of low-rate pressure, partially offset by further declines in deposit pricing and continued deployment of excess liquidity. As we progress through the year, we expect to see increases in net interest income, excluding PPP fees, driven by loan growth, deployment of liquidity, a deceleration of prepayments, and further deposit cost reductions. 

Non-interest revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was $111.0 million, up $7.1 million, or 7%, compared to the same period in 2020 . Adjusted non-interest revenue (1) , which excludes net investment securities gains/(losses) and increase/(decrease) in fair value of private equity investments, for the first quarter of 2021 was $112.9 million, up $13.6 million, or 14%, from the first quarter of 2020 . Net mortgage banking income of $22.3 million remained strong and drove the year-over-year increase in non-interest revenue. While first quarter 2021 mortgage production levels remained elevated, the recent increase in interest rates is likely to reduce production levels going forward. 

Non-interest expense for the first quarter of 2021 was $267.1 million , down $9.1 million, or 3%, compared to the first quarter of 2020 and adjusted non-interest expense (1) of $266.6 million was down $4.6 million, or 2%. The adjusted tangible efficiency ratio (1) for the first three months of 2021 was 54.19%, down 253 bps compared to the same period a year ago. We remain committed to prudent expense management, enabling us to continue investing in areas that position us for greater success, deliver a superior customer experience, and promote profitable growth. 

At March 31, 2021, loans, net of deferred fees and costs, of $38.81 billion, increased $552.1 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2020 led by CRE growth of $208.2 million as the recovery of commercial real estate markets continued, C&#38;I growth of $173.7 million driven by a $170.1 million increase in PPP loans, and consumer growth of $170.2 million primarily due to purchases of $607.0 million of third-party lending loans, including a $476.2 million prime auto portfolio purchase. These growth metrics were partially offset by declines in consumer mortgages and HELOCs of $214.3 million and $105.4 million, respectively, as consumers across the industry continued to use government stimulus to reduce revolving credit balances and deleverage. 

At March 31, 2021, credit metrics remained stable with NPAs, NPLs, and past dues all near historical lows at Synovus, and n et charge-offs remained low and declined $1.9 million on a sequential quarter basis to $20.2 million, or 21 basis points. Given elevated levels of liquidity and continued economic recovery, particularly in the Southeast, we are not expecting a significant change in net charge-offs in the near term. The ACL at March 31, 2021 totaled $614.7 million, a decrease of $38.8 million from December 31, 2020, resulting from the improved economic outlook and stable loan portfolio metrics that were partially offset by the increased size of the loan portfolio. The ACL to loans coverage ratio at March 31, 2021 was 1.58%, or 1.69% excluding PPP loans, and incorporates an outlook with moderate economic expansion and benefits from the recently approved government stimulus. 

Total period-end deposits at March 31, 2021 increased $677.4 million, or 1%, compared to December 31, 2020. Core transaction deposits (non-interest bearing, NOW/savings, and money market deposits excluding public and brokered funds) increased $2.05 billion, or 6%, compared to December 31, 2020. The increase in deposit balances compared to December 31, 2020 is due largely to government stimulus programs including deposits associated with PPP loans. 

At March 31, 2021, Synovus' CET1 ratio was 9.74%, well in excess of regulatory requirements including the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, and was up 8 bps compared to December 31, 2020, driven by earnings. Synovus announced on January 26, 2021 that its Board of Directors authorized share repurchases of up to $200 million in 2021 . During the first quarter of 2021, the Company did not complete any share repurchases. During the second quarter of 20 21, Synovus had repurchased $23.2 million, or 499 thousand shares of its common stock, at an average price of $46.52 per share, as of May 5, 2021. 

More detail on Synovus' financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2021 may be found in subseque nt sections of "Item 2. &#8211; Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Report. See also "Item 1A. - Risk Factors" of this Report.

Changes in Financial Condition 

During the three months ended March 31, 2021, total assets increased $764.9 million from $54.39 billion at December 31, 2020 to $55.16 billion. Loans increased $552.1 million, including increases of $170.1 million in PPP loans net of unearned fees and a $476.2 million indirect auto portfolio purchase. Lo ans held for sale increased $233.8 million. Investment securities available for sale increased $863.3 million while cash and cash equivalents decreased $924.7 million. 

The growth in assets was primarily funded by increases of $677.4 million in deposits. Securities sold under repurchase agreements increased $65.7 million. Total shareholders' equity at March 31, 2021 was flat, as compared to December 31, 2020, and included net income of $187.1 million and proceeds from stock option exercises of $12.6 million, offset by unrealized losses in investment securities available for sale and cash flow hedges of $121.0 million and $22.4 million, respectively, and dividends declared on common and preferred stock of $49.1 million and $8.3 million, respectively. 

The loan to deposit ratio was 81.9% at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, compared to 96.1% at March 31, 2020.

These growth metrics were partially offset by declines in consumer mortgages and HELOCs of $214.3 million and $105.4 million, respectively, as consumers across the industry continued to use government stimulus to reduce revolving credit balances and deleverage. C&#38;I lo ans remain the largest component of our loan portfolio, representing 50.7% of total loans, while CRE and consumer loans represent 27.1% and 22.2%, respectively. Our portfolio composition is established through a comprehensive concentration management policy which sets limits for C&#38;I, CRE, and consumer loan levels as well as for sub-categories therein. 

U.S. Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) 

Synovus is participating in the PPP, which is a loan program that originated from the CARES Act and was subsequently expanded by the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, which was signed into law on April 24, 2020. Under the initial program, PPP loans are forgivable, in whole or in part, if the proceeds are used for payroll and other permitted purposes in accordance with the requirements of the PPP. These loans carry a fixed rate of 1.00% and a term of two years, if not forgiven, in whole or in part. The loans are guaranteed by the SBA. The SBA pays the originating bank a processing fee ranging from 1% to 5%, based on the size of the loan. Synovus began accepting applications from qualified customers on April 3, 2020 and provided nearly $2.9 billion in funding to close to 19,000 customers through the initial PPP, at 

an average loan size of approximately $150 thousand. In the fourth quarter of 2020, Synovus began receiving first draw PPP loan forgiveness that totals $1.25 billion, or $1.20 billion net of unearned fees, life-to-date through March 31, 2021, including PPP loan forgiveness of $711 million, or $687 million net of unearned fees, during the first quarter of 2021. 

On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act was signed into law, and authorized the SBA to reopen the PPP for first draw loans, as well as guarantee second draw PPP loans of up to $2 million for certain eligible borrowers that previously received a PPP loan. These loans carry a fixed rate of 1.00% and a term of five years, if not forgiven, in whole or in part . The loans are guaranteed by the SBA. The SBA pays the originating bank a processing fee based on the size of the loan. 

On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 was enacted which primarily expanded and clarified eligibility for first and second draw PPP loans and revised the exclusions from payroll costs for purposes of loan forgiveness. 

Synovus began participating in the second phase of the PPP on January 19, 2021 with almost 10,000 applications submitted totaling $1.09 billion and total fundings of $894 million, or $857 million net of unearned fees, as of March 31, 2021. The total balance of PPP loans was $2.36 billion as of March 31, 2021, compared to $2.19 billion as of December 31, 2020. 

Commercial Loans 

Total commercial loans (which are comprised of C&#38;I and CRE loans) at March 31, 2021 were $30.23 billion, or 77.9%, of the total loan portfolio, compared to $29.85 billion, or 78.0%, at December 31, 2020 and $28.29 billion, or 73.9%, at March 31, 2020. 

At March 31, 2021, Synovus had eight commercial loan relationships with total commitments of $100 million or more (including amounts funded), with one single relationship exceeding $150 million in commitments. 

Commercial and Industrial Loans 

The C&#38;I loan portfolio represents the largest category of Synovus' loan portfolio and is primarily comprised of general middle market and commercial banking clients across a wide range of industries. The following table shows the composition of the C&#38;I loan portfolio aggregated by NAICS code. In accordance with Synovus' lending policy, each loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process which incorporates uniform underwriting standards and oversight in proportion to the size and complexity of the lending relationship. As of March 31, 2021, 82.5% (93.7% excluding PPP loans) of Synovus' C&#38;I loans are secured by real estate, business equipment, inventory, and other types of collateral compared to 83.2% (93.8% excluding PPP loans) as of December 31, 2020. C&#38;I loans grew $173.7 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2020, driven primarily by a $170.1 million increase in PPP loans at March 31, 2021.

(1) Loan balance in each category expressed as a percentage of total C&#38;I loans. 

At March 31, 2021, $12.66 billion of C&#38;I loans, or 32.6% of the total loan portfolio (including PPP loans of $2.36 billion), represented loans originated for the purpose of financing commercial, financial, and agricultural business activities. The primary source of repayment on these loans is revenue generated from products or services offered by the business or organization. The secondary source of repayment is the collateral, which consists primarily of equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, time deposits, cash surrender value of life insurance, and other business assets. 

At March 31, 2021, $7.03 billion of C&#38;I loans, or 18.1% of the total loan portfolio, represented loans originated for the purpose of financing owner-occupied properties. The financing of owner-occupied facilities is considered a C&#38;I loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral. This treatment is a result of the credit decision process, which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt. The secondary source of repayment on these loans is the underlying real estate. These loans are predominately secured by owner-occupied and other real estate, and to a lesser extent, other types of collateral. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans 

CRE loans consist primarily of income-producing investment properties loans. Additionally, CRE loans include 1-4 family properties loans as well as land and development lo ans. Total CRE loans of $10.53 billion increased $208.2 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2020 , driven primarily by growth in income-producing investment properties as the recovery of commercial real estate markets continues. 

Investment properties loans consist of construction and mortgage loans for income- producing properties and are primarily made to finance multi-family properties, hotels, office buildings, shopping centers, warehouses and other commercial development properties. Total investment properties loans as of March 31, 2021 were $9.34 billion, or 88.6%, of the CRE loan portfolio, and increased $232.3 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2020 with most sub-categories experiencing growth other than warehouses, which were down $7.8 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2020. 

1-4 Family Properties Loans 

1-4 family properties loans include construction loans to home builders and commercial mortgage loans related to 1-4 family rental properties and are almost always secured by the underlying property being financed by such loans. These properties are primarily located in the markets served by Synovus. At March 31, 2021, 1-4 family properties loans totaled $639.0 million, or 6.1% of the CRE loan portfolio, and increased by $10.3 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2020. 

Land and Development Loans 

Land and development loans include commercial and residential development as well as land acquisition loans and are secured by land held for future development, typically in excess of one year. Properties securing these loans are substantially within markets served by Synovus and loan terms generally include personal guarantees from the principals. Loans in this portfolio are underwritten based on the LTV of the collateral and the capacity of the guarantor(s). Land and development loans of $559.2 million at March 31, 2021 decreased $34.4 million, or 6%, from $593.6 million at December 31, 2020. 

Consumer Loans 

The consumer loan portfolio consists of a wide variety of loan products offered through Synovus' banking network including first and second residential mortgages, HELOCs, and credit card loans, as well as home impro vement, student, personal, and auto loan s from third-party lending. The majority of Synovus' consumer loans are consumer mortgages and HELOCs secured by first and second liens on residential real estate primarily located in the markets served by Synovus. As of March 31, 2021, weighted-average FICO scores within the residential real estate portfolio based on committed balances were 790 for HELOCs and 773 for Consumer Mortgages. 

Consumer loans at March 31, 2021 of $8.58 billion increased $170.2 million, or 2%, compared to December 31, 2020. Consumer mortgages decreased $214.3 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2020, and HELOCs decreased $105.4 million, or 7%, from December 31, 2020. Credit card loans of $267.4 million at March 31, 2021 decreased $13.6 million, or 5% from $281.0 million at December 31, 2020. The reductions in consumer mortgages, HELOCs, and credit card loans are primarily a result of consumers continuing to use government stimulus to reduce revolving credit balances and deleverage as well as the competitive low rate environment. Other consumer loans, which primarily includes third-party lending, increased $503.6 million, or 47%, from December 31, 2020. As of March 31, 2021, third-party lending balances totaled $1.18 billion, or 3.0%, of the total loan portfolio, and increased $503.2 million, or 74%, compared to December 31, 2020, led by purchases of $607.0 million of third-party lending loans, including a $476.2 million prime auto loans purchase. We believe that the risk-return profile, the 2-year average life, and the liquidity of the asset class is a good fit under current market conditions. We will continue to use third-party lending to manage the balance sheet, which could lead to increases in this portfolio. 

Deposits 

Deposits provide the most significant funding source for interest earning assets. The following table shows the composition of period-end deposits as of the dates indicated.

(4) Core transaction deposits consist of non-interest-bearing demand deposits, interest-bearing demand deposits, money market accounts, and savings deposits excluding public funds and brokered deposits. 

Total period-end deposits at March 31, 2021 increased $677.4 million, or 1%, compared to December 31, 2020. Core transaction deposits increased $2.05 billion, or 6%, compared to December 31, 2020, due largely to government stimulus programs including deposits associated with the second phase of PPP loans. The sequential quarter growth in lower cost core transaction accounts of $2.05 billion included growth in non-interest-bearing demand deposits of $1.36 billion, money market accounts of $402.5 million, NOW accounts of $167.3 million, and savings balances of $120.8 million, and more than offset decreases of $391.2 million and $375.7 million in time deposits and brokered deposits, respectively, as well as declines of $605.7 million in public funds. Total deposit costs declined 6 bps during the first quarter of 2021, compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, due to repricing and remixing within the deposit portfolio. 

On an average basis, the increase in total deposits was $480.9 million, or 1%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. 

Non-interest Revenue 

Non-interest revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was $111.0 million, up $7.1 million, or 7%, compared to the same period in 2020 . Adjusted non-interest revenue, which excludes net investment securities gains/(losses) and increase/(decrease) in fair value of private equity investments, for the first quarter of 2021 was $112.9 million, up $13.6 million, or 14%, from the first quarter of 2020 . Net mortgage banking income of $22.3 million remained strong and drove the year-over-year increase in non-interest revenue. While first quarter 2021 mortgage production levels remained elevated, the recent increase in interest rates is likely to reduce production levels going forward. See "Table 14 - Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures&#8221; in this Report for applicable reconciliation to GAAP measures. 

The following table shows the principal components of non-interest revenue.

Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 compared to March 31, 2020 

Service charges on deposit accounts for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were down $656 thousand, or 3%, due largely to the impact of higher average balances as a result of stimulus funds. Service charges on deposit accounts consist of NSF fees, account analysis fees, and all other service charges. NSF fees were do wn $3.0 million, or 34%, for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Account analysis fees were up $2.2 million, or 32%, for the three months ended March 31, 2021, f ollowing our pricing for value initiative implemented during the first quarter of 2021 as part of Synovus Forward. All other service charges on deposit accounts, which consist primarily of monthly fees on retail demand deposits, saving accounts, and small business accounts, for the three months ended March 31, 2021, were up $132 thousand, or 3%. 

Fiduciary and asset management fees are derived from providing estate administration, personal trust, corporate trust, corporate bond, investment management, financial planning, and family office services. Fiduciary and asset management fees increased $2.8 million, or 18%, for the three months ended March 31, 2021 . The increases were driven by growth in total assets under management which increased by 35% year-over-year to $20.59 billion. 

Card fees for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were up $1.0 million, or 10%, with increased transaction volume in all card fee categories. Card fees consist primarily of credit card interchange fees, debit card interchange fees, and merchant discounts. Card fees are reported net of certain associated expense items including customer loyalty program expenses and network expenses. 

Brokerage revenue of $13.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was up $576 thousand, or 5%. The year-over-year increase was driven by growth in assets under management and higher transaction revenue driven by favorable 

market conditions. Brokerage revenue consists primarily of brokerage commissions as well as advisory fees earned from the management of customer assets. 

Mortgage banking income was significantly higher in the first three months of 2021, with an increase of $10.1 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. Mortgage banking income was driven by higher production and sales, including an increase in refinance volume. Total secondary market mortgage loan production was $573.1 million, up $318.6 million, for the three months ended March 31, 2021. While first quarter 2021 mortgage production levels remained elevated, the recent increase in interest rates is likely to reduce production levels going forward. 

Capital markets income primarily includes fee income from customer deri vative transactions. Additionally, capital markets income includes fee income from capital raising investment banking transactions and foreign exchange as well as other miscellaneous income from capital market transactions. Capital markets income was $3.7 million lower for the three months ended March 31, 2021 , as commercial client activity to lock in lower rates was elevated in 2020. 

Income from BOLI, which includes increases in the cash surrender value of policies and proceeds from insurance benefits, increased $2.8 million, or 47%, for the three months ended March 31, 2021, due primarily to income on proceeds from insurance benefits. The first three months of 2021 included income on proceeds from insurance benefits of $2.1 million compared to $118 thousand in 2020. 

Investment securities losses, net, of $2.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 reflected strategic sales of mortgage-backed securities. 

The main components of other non-interest revenue are fees for letters of credit and unused lines of credit, safe deposit box fees, access fees for ATM use, other service charges and loan servicing fees, income from insurance commissions, gains from sales of GGL/SBA loans, and other miscellaneous ite ms. The three months ended March 31, 2021 included unrealized valuation gains of $3.5 million associated with deferred compensation and the three months ended March 31, 2020 included a sale-leaseback gain of $2.4 million. 

Non-interest Expense 

Non-interest expense for the first quarter of 2021 was $267.1 million , down $9.1 million, or 3%, compared to the first quarter of 2020 and adjusted non-interest expense of $266.6 million was down $4.6 million, or 2%. The adjusted tangible efficiency ratio for the first three months of 2021 was 54.19%, down 253 bps compared to the same period a year ago. We remain committed to prudent expense management, enabling us to continue investing in areas that position us for greater success, deliver a superior customer experience, and promote profitable growth. See "Table 14 - Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures&#8221; in this Report for applicable reconciliation to GAAP measures. 

The following table summarizes the components of non-interest expense. 

Table 6 - Non-interest Expense Three Months Ended March 31, (dollars in thousands) 2021 2020 % Change Salaries and other personnel expense $ 161,477 &#160; $ 149,678 8 % Net occupancy, equipment, and software expense 41,134 &#160; 42,194 (3) Third-party processing and other services 20,032 &#160; 22,700 (12) Professional fees 9,084 &#160; 10,675 (15) FDIC insurance and other regulatory fees 5,579 &#160; 5,278 6 Amortization of intangibles 2,379 &#160; 2,640 (10) Restructuring charges 531 &#160; 3,220 nm Loss on early extinguishment of debt &#8212; &#160; 1,904 nm Other operating expenses 26,918 &#160; 37,990 (29) Total non-interest expense $ 267,134 &#160; $ 276,279 (3) % 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 compared to March 31, 2020 

Salaries and other personnel expense increased $11.8 million, or 8%, for the three months ended March 31, 2021, due primarily to higher mortgage production-based commissions with commission expense up $2.3 million, higher share-based compensation expense of $4.1 million largely due to timing with higher level of retirement eligible expense acceleration, and valuation expense of $3.5 million associated with deferred compensation from higher market valuations (offset with unrealized valuation gains in other non-interest revenue). Total headcount of 5,175 declined 72 from December 31, 2020 and 253 from 

March 31, 2020 led by Synovus' voluntary early retirement program offered during the fourth quarter of 2020 and branch closures. 

Net occupancy, equipment, and software expense decreased $1.1 million, or 3%, during the three months ended March 31, 2021, due primarily to a reduction of 10 branches, as compared to December 31, 2019. 

Third-party processing and other services includes all third-party core operating system and processing charges as well as third-party loan servicing charges. Third-party processing expense decreased $2.7 million, or 12%, for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The decline is primarily associated with Synovus' restructure of certain of its third-party consumer-based lending partnership arrangements during the second quarter of 2020 with a shift of new originations to held for sale and thereby reducing third-party loan servicing expense. 

Professional fees decreased $1.6 million, or 15%, for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from decreases in consulting fees related to Synovus Forward, our revenue growth and efficiency initiatives. 

FDIC insurance and other regulatory fees for the three months ended March 31, 2020 included the benefit of a $1.5 million reversal of estimated additional expense accrued during the fourth quarter of 2019. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2021, Synovus recorded $531 thousand in restructuring charges primarily associated with two branch closures that will occur in April 2021 as part of Synovus Forward. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, Synovus recorded restructuring charges of $3.2 million from asset impairments, lease terminations, and severance related to seven branches closed in the first quarter of 2020. 

Other operating expenses includes advertising, travel, insurance, network and communication, other taxes, subscriptions and dues, other loan and ORE expense, postage and freight, training, business development, supplies, donations, and other miscellaneous expenses. Other operating expenses were down $11.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 driven by declines in most all expense categories including declines of $3.0 million in advertising and $1.3 million in travel. 

Income Tax Expense 

Income tax expense was $49.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 , representing an effective tax rate of 20.8%, compared to income tax expense of $3.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, representing an effective tax rate of 8.5 %. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2021 is lower than the statutory tax rate primarily due to discrete benefits of $6.2 million related to changes in amounts taxable by jurisdictions and $1.8 million related to share-based compensation, partly offset by discrete expense of $4.1 million related to other accrual adjustments. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was lower than the statutory tax rate primarily due to a one-time discrete benefit of $2.7 million for the carryback of net operating loss deductions as permitted by the CARES Act, and $3.4 million of other discrete benefit items. 

Synovus&#8217; effective tax rate considers many factors including, but not limited to, the level of pre-tax income, BOLI, tax-exempt interest, certain income tax credits, and nondeductible expenses. In addition, the effective tax rate is affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period-to-period, such as tax benefits related to share-based compensation, jurisdiction statutory tax rate changes, valuation allowance changes, and changes to unrecognized tax benefits. Accordingly, the comparability of the effective tax rate between periods may be impacted. 

On March 31, 2021, the Biden Administration released the details of the Made in America Tax Plan which proposes an increase in the federal corporate income tax rate to 28%, up from the current 21%, among numerous other proposals. We continue to monitor the legislative process and the potential impact to the Company and its customers. 

CREDIT QUALITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 

Credit Quality 

Synovus continuously monitors the quality of its loan portfolio by industry, property type, geography, as well as credit quality metrics. At March 31, 2021, credit metrics remained stable with NPAs, NPLs, and past dues all near historical lows, and net charge-offs remained low and declined $1.9 million on a sequential quarter basis to $20.2 million, or 21 basis points. Given elevated levels of liquidity and continued economic recovery, particularly in the Southeast, we are not currently expecting a significant change in net charge-offs in the near term. 

The table below includes selected credit quality metrics.

Non-performing Assets 

Total NPAs as a percentage of total loans, ORE, and specific other assets were 0.50% at March 31, 2021, unchanged from both December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2020. Total NPAs were $195.6 million at March 31, 2021 compared to $192.1 million at December 31, 2020 and $190.0 million at March 31, 2020. 

Criticized and Classified Loans 

Our loan ratings are aligned to federal banking regulators' definitions of pass and criticized categories, which include special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss. Substandard accruing and non-accruing loans, doubtful, and loss loans are often collectively referred to as classified. Special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss loans are often collectively referred to as criticized and classified loans. The following table presents a summary of criticized and classified loans. The increase in criticized and classified loans at March 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 was primarily hospitality-related with increases in special mention and substandard accruing loans in the hotel and full-service restaurant industry as a result of COVID-19. We expect the levels of criticized and classified loans to decline as borrowers' reported financial statements begin to reflect the current monthly improvement we are seeing in borrowers' cash flows.

Provision for Credit Losses and Allowance for Credit Losses 

Provision for credit losses includes the provisions for loan losses and unfunded commitments. The reversal of provision for credit losses of $18.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 included net charge-offs of $20.2 million and resulted from the improved economic outlook and stable loan portfolio metrics that were partially offset by the increased size of the loan portfolio including $15.2 million in reserves added as result of purchases of $607.0 million of third-party lending loans, including a $476.2 million prime auto purchase. The ACL at March 31, 2021 totaled $614.7 million consisting of an ALL of $563.2 million and reserve for unfunded commitments of $51.5 million, resulting in an ACL to loans coverage ratio of 1.58% and an ACL to NPLs ratio of 396%. Excluding PPP loans, the ACL to loans coverage ratio was 1.69%. The ACL at March 31, 2021 incorporates an outlook with moderate economic expansion and benefits from the estimated impact of government stimulus.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

Accruing TDRs were $129.8 million at March 31, 2021, compared to $135.0 million at December 31, 2020 and $160.1 million at March 31, 2020. Accruing TDRs decreased $5.2 million from December 31, 2020 and $30.4 million from March 31, 2020. Non-accruing TDRs were $36.1 million at March 31, 2021, compared to $39.0 million at December 31, 2020 and $12.8 million at March 31, 2020. 

Accruing TDRs are considered performing because they are performing in accordance with the re structured terms. At March 31, 2021, December 31, 2020, and March 31, 2020, approximately 99%, 99%, and 98%, respectively, of accruing TDRs were current. In addition, subsequent defaults on accruing TDRs (defaults defined as the earlier of the TDR being placed on non-accrual status or reaching 90 days past due with respect to principal and/or interest payments within twelve months of the TDR designation) have continued to remain at low levels. 

Non-TDR Modifications due to COVID-19 

Regulatory agencies have encouraged financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of COVID-19. In the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (initially issued on March 22, 2020 and revised on April 7, 2020), for example, the regulatory agencies expressed their view of loan modification programs as positive actions that may mitigate adverse effects on borrowers due to COVID-19 and their unwillingness to criticize institutions for working with borrowers in a safe and sound manner. Moreover, the Interagency Statement provided that eligible loan modifications related to COVID-19 may be accounted for under section 4013 of the CARES Act or in accordance with ASC 310-40. On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 extended the applicable period of Section 4013 of the CARES Act. This allows banks to elect to not consider loan modifications related to COVID-19 that are made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of January 1, 2022, or 60 days after the national emergency ends to borrowers that are current (i.e., less than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019) as TDRs. The regulatory agencies further stated that performing loans granted payment deferrals due to COVID-19 are not considered past due or non-accrual. FASB confirmed the foregoing regulatory agencies' view that such short-term modifications (e.g., six months) made on a good-faith basis in response to COVID-19 for borrowers who are current are not TDRs. 

During 2020, Synovus provided relief programs consisting primarily of 90-day payment deferral relief to borrowers negatively impacted by COVID-19, and as of March 31, 2021, 0.2% of the total loan portfolio was in a P&#38;I deferral status as compared to 0.3% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. In addition to our P&#38;I deferment program, under the CARES Act, we have also provided borrowers who have been impacted by COVID-19 with other modifications such as interest only relief or amortization extensions on approximately 2% of total loan s, at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Capital Resources 

Synovus and Synovus Bank are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by our primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve. Synovus and Synovus Bank measure capital adequacy using the standardized approach under Basel III. At March 31, 2021, Synovus and Synovus Bank's capital levels remained strong and exceeded well-capitalized requirements currently in effect. The following table presents certain ratios used to measure Synovus and Synovus Bank's capitalization.

(1) See "Table 14 - Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures&#8221; in this Report for the applicable reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure. 

At March 31, 2021, Synovus' CET1 ratio increased to 9.74%, well in excess of regulatory requirements including the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%. The March 31, 2021 CET1 ratio improved 8 bps compared to December 31, 2020 driven by earnings. For additional information on regulatory capital requirements, see "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 12 - Regulatory Capital" to the consolidated financial statements of Synovus' 2020 Form 10-K. Management reviews the Company's capital position on an on-going basis and believes, based on internal capital analyses and earnings projections, that Synovus is well positioned to meet relevant regulatory capital standards. 

Synovus announced on January 26, 2021 that its Board of Directors authorized share repurchases of up to $200 million in 2021. During the first quarter of 2021, the Company did not complete any share repurchases. During the second quarter of 20 21, Synovus had repurchased $23.2 million, or 499 thousand shares of its common stock, at an average price of $46.52 per share, as of May 5, 2021. 

On August 26, 2020, the federal banking regulators issued a final rule (followin g an interim final rule issued on March 27, 2020) that allowed electing banking organizations that adopt CECL during 2020 to mitigate the estimated effects of CECL on 

regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year phase-in transition period. Synovus adopted CECL on January 1, 2020 and the March 31, 2021 regulatory capital ratios reflect Synovus' election of the five-year transition provision. At March 31, 2021, $84 million, or a cumulative 20 basis points benefit to CET1, was deferred. 

Dividends 

Synovus has historically paid a quarterly cash dividend to the holders of its common stock. Management and the Board of Directors closely monitor current and projected capital levels, liquidity (including dividends from subsidiaries), financial markets and other economic trends, as well as regulatory requirements regarding the payment of dividends. 

Synovus' ability to pay dividends on its common stock and preferred stock is primarily dependent upon dividends and distributions that it receives from its bank and non-banking subsidiaries, which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities. 

Synovus declared common stock dividends of $49.1 million, or $0.33 per common share, for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to $48.6 million, or $0.33 per common share, for the three months ended March 31, 2020. In addition, Synovus declared dividends on its preferred stock of $8.3 million during both the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. 

Liquidity 

Liquidity represents the extent to which Synovus has readily available sources of funding to meet the needs of depositors, borrowers and creditors, to support asset growth, and to otherwise sustain operations of Synovus and its subsidiaries, at a reasonable cost, on a timely basis, and without adverse consequences. ALCO monitors Synovus' economic, competitive, and regulatory environment and is responsible for measuring, monitoring, and reporting on liquidity and funding risk as well as market risk. 

In accordance with Synovus policies and regulatory guidance, ALCO evaluates contractual and anticipated cash flows under normal and stressed conditions to properly manage the Company&#8217;s liquidity profile. Synovus places an emphasis on maintaining numerous sources of current and contingent liquidity to meet its obligations to depositors, borrowers, and creditors on a timely basis. Liquidity is generated through various sources, including, but not limited to, maturities and repayments of loans by customers, maturities and sales of investment securities, and growth in core or wholesale deposits. Management continuously monitors and maintains appropriate levels of liquidity so as to provide adequate funding sources to manage customer deposit withdrawals, loan requests, and other funding demands. 

Synovus Bank also generates liquidity through the issuance of brokered certificates of deposit and money market accounts. Synovus Bank accesses these funds from a broad geographic base to diversify its sources of fu nding and liquidity. Synovus Bank also has t he capacity to access funding through its membership in the FHLB system and through the Federal Reserve discount window. At March 31, 2021, based on currently pledged collateral, Synovus Bank had access to incremental FHLB funding of $6.38 billion, subject to FHLB credit policies. 

In addition to bank level liquidity management, Synovus must manage liquidity at the parent company level for various operating needs including the servicing of debt, the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock, share repurchases, payment of general corporate expenses and potential capital infusions into subsidiaries. The primary source of liquidity for Synovus consists of dividends from Synovus Bank, which is governed by certain rules and regulations of the GA DBF and the Federal Reserve Bank. Synovus' ability to receive dividends from Synovus Bank in future periods will depend on a number of factors, including, without limitation, Synovus Bank's future profits, asset quality, liquidit y, and overall condition. I n addition, both the GA DBF and Federal Reserve Bank may require approval to pay dividends, based on certain regulatory statutes and limitations. 

Synovus presently believes that the sources of liquidity discussed above, including existing liquid funds on hand, are sufficient to meet its anticipated funding needs. However, if economic conditions were to significantly deteriorate, regulatory capital requirements for Synovus or Synovus Bank were to increase as the result of regulatory directives or otherwise, or Synovus believes it is prudent to enhance current liquidity levels, then Synovus may seek additional liquidity from external sources. See "Part I &#8211; Item 1A. Risk Factors - Changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market may adversely affect our capital resources, liquidity and financial results " of Synovus' 2020 Form 10-K. Furthermore, Synovus may, from time to time, take advantage of attractive market opportunities to refinance its existing debt, redeem its preferred stock, or strengthen its liquidity or capital position. 

Earning Assets and Sources of Funds 

Average total assets for the three months ended March 31, 2021 increased $5.49 billion, or 11%, to $54.19 billion as compared to $48.70 billion for the first three months of 2020. Average earning assets increased $5.02 billion, or 11%, in the first three months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 and represented 92.2% of average total assets at March 31, 2021, as compared to 92.3% at March 31, 2020. The increase in average earning assets primarily resulted from a $2.16 billion increase in average interest-bearing funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank, a $1.76 billion increase in average investment securities available for sale, an $821.3 million increase in loans held for sale, and a $619.2 million, or 2%, increase in average total loans, net of unearned, which included average PPP loans of $2.24 bill ion . 

Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $567.9 million, or 2%, to $34.08 billion for the first three months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities resulted from a $4.37 billion, or 34%, increase in average money market deposits (includes an increase of $573.9 million in average other brokered deposits) and a $2.12 billion, or 33%, increase in average interest-bearing demand deposits. These increases were partially offset by a $3.41 billion, or 38%, decrease in average time deposits (includes a decrease of $747.7 million in brokered time deposits) a $1.48 billion decrease in average long-term debt, including redemption of $250.0 million in subordinated debt in the fourth quarter of 2020, and a $1.38 billion decrease in other short-term borrowings. Average non-interest-bearing demand deposits increased $4.38 billion, or 47%, to $13.79 billion for the first three months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, due largely to liquidity associated with PPP lending. 

Net interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $373.9 million, up $597 thousand compared to the same period in 2020 including $24.9 million in PPP processing fees during the first quarter of 2021. Net interest margin was down 33 bps over the comparable three-month period to 3.04%, due primarily to the decline in market interest rates and accelerated prepayment activity. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the yield on earning assets was 3.32%, a decrease of 101 bps compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020, while the effective cost of funds decreased 68 bps to 0.28%. The yield on loans decreased 60 bps to 4.02% while the yield on investment securities decreased 169 bps to 1.40% over the three months ended March 31, 2020. 

On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was down $12.1 million and net interest margin for the first quarter was 3.04%, which was down 8 bps compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 . The sequential quarter decline in net interest income was primarily due to a lower day count and a continuation of low-rate pressure, partially offset by further declines in deposit pricing and continued deployment of excess liquidity. The first quarter of 2021 included average PPP loan balances of $2.24 billion versus $2.55 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 and $24.9 million recognized for associated PPP processing fees versus $24.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. For the first quarter of 2021, the yield on earning assets decreased 17 bps, while the effective cost of funds decreased 9 bps compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. 

As we progress through the year, we expect to see increases in net interest income, excluding PPP fees, driven by loan growth, deployment of liquidity, a deceleration of prepayments, and further deposit cost reductions. 

Quarterly yields earned on average interest-earning assets and rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities for the five most recent quarters are presented below.

Market Risk Analysis 

Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Synovus is potentially exposed. Synovus measures its sensitivity to changes in market interest rates through the use of a simulation model which incorporates all of Synovus&#8217; earning assets and liabilities. These simulations are used to determine a baseline net interest income projection and the sensitivity of the income profile based on changes in interest rates. These simula tions incorporate assumptions and factors, including, but not limited to, changes in market rates, in the size or composition of the balance sheet, and in repricing characteris tics as well as customer behaviors. This process is reviewed and updated on an on-going basis in a manner consistent with Synovus&#8217; ALCO governance framework. 

Synovus has modeled its baseline net interest income projection assuming a flat interest rate environment with the federal funds rate at the Federal Reserve&#8217;s current targeted range of 0% to 0.25% and the current prime rate of 3.25%. Synovus has modeled the impact of a gradual increase in market interest rates across the yield curve of 100 and 200 bps and a gradual decline of 25 bps to determine the sensitivity of net interest income for the next twelve months. The lesser decline of the downrate scenario presented was selected in light of the low absolute level of monetary policy rates and generally incorporates an assumption that rates are floored at the zero-lower-bound. Synovus' current rate risk position is considered asset-sensitive and would be expected to benefit net interest income in a rising interest rate environment and reduce net interest income in a declining interest rate environment. The decline in sensitivity relative to the prior period-end is the result of a host of factors, including a reduction in reserve balances held with the Federal Reserve and the higher absolute level of long-term interest rates. The following table represents the estimated sensitivity of net interest income at March 31, 2021, with comparable information for December 31, 2020. 

Table 13 - Twelve Month Net Interest Income Sensitivity Estimated % Change in Net Interest Income as Compared to Unchanged Rates (for the next twelve months) Change in Short-term Interest Rates (in bps) March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 +200 4.9% 6.8% +100 2.4% 3.5% Flat &#8212;% &#8212;% -25 (0.3)% (0.5)% 

The net interest income simulation model is the primary tool utilized to evaluate potential interest rate risks over a shorter-term time horizon. Synovus also evaluates potential longer-term interest rate risk through modeling and evaluation of the sensitivity of the Company's Economic Value of Equity (EVE). The EVE measurement process estimates the net fair value of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet financial instruments under various interest rate scenarios. Management uses EVE sensitivity analyses as an additional means of measuring interest rate risk and incorporates this form of analysis within its governance and limits framework. 

LIBOR Transition 

In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR at the end of 2021. On March 5, 2021, the FCA confirmed that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021 for the 1-week and 2-month US dollar settings and immediately after June 30, 2023 for all remaining US dollar settings. 

The ARRC has proposed SOFR as its preferred rate as an alternative to LIBOR and has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR. Organizations are currently working on industry-wide and company-specific transition plans related to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. As noted within "Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors" of Synovus' 2020 Form 10-K, Synovus holds instruments that may be impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR including floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives and hedges, and other financial instruments but is not able to currently predict the associated financial impact of the transition to an alternative reference rate. Synovus has established a cross-functional LIBOR transition working group that has 1) assessed the Company's current exposure to LIBOR indexed instruments and the data, systems and processes that will be impacted; 2) established a detailed implementation plan; and 3) developed a formal governance structure for the transition. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The accounting and financial reporting policies of Synovus are in accordance with GAAP and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. Synovus has identified certain of its accounting policies as &#8220;critical accounting policies,&#8221; consisting of those related to the allowance for credit losses and income taxes. In determining which accounting policies are critical in nature, Synovus has identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates. It is management's practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the Board of Directors' Audit Committee on a periodic basis, including the development, selection, implementation and disclosure of the critical accounting policies. The application of these policies has a significant impact on Synovus&#8217; unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. Synovus&#8217; financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are used in the application of these policies. All accounting policies described in "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Synovus' 2020 Form 10-K should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial perform ance. There have been no significant changes to the accounting policies, estimates and assumptions, or the judgments affecting the application of these estimates and assumptions from those disclosed in Synovus' 2020 Form 10-K other than the exclusion of goodwill impairment as a critical accounting estimate due to lack of impairment indicators. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The measures entitled adjusted non-interest revenue; adjusted non-interest expense; adjusted total revenue; adjusted tangible efficiency ratio; adjusted net income per common share, diluted; adjusted return on average assets; adjusted return on average common equity; adjusted return on average tangible common equity; and tangible common equity ratio are not measures recognized under GAAP and therefore are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The most comparable GAAP measures to these measures are total non-interest revenue; total non-interest expense; total FTE revenue; efficiency ratio-FTE; net income per common share, diluted; return on average assets; return on average common equity; and the ratio of total shareholders' equity to total assets, respectively. 

Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful additional information about Synovus to assist management and investors in evaluating Synovus&#8217; operating results, financial strength, the performance of its business, and the strength of its capital position. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of operating results or capital position as reported under GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as additional views of the way our financial measures are affected by significant items and other factors, and since they are not required to be uniformly applied, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures at other companies. Adjusted total revenue and adjusted non-interest revenue are measures used by management to evaluate total FTE revenue and non-interest revenue exclusive of net investment securities gains (losses) and changes in fair value of private equity investments, net. Adjusted non-interest expense and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio are measures utilized by management to measure the success of expense management initiatives focused on reducing recurring controllable operating costs. Adjusted net income per common share, diluted, adjusted return on average assets, and adjusted return on average common equity are measurements used by management to evaluate operating results exclusive of items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact period-to-period comparisons. Adjusted return on average tangible common equity is a measure used by management to compare Synovus' performance with other financial institutions because it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization, thereby allowing management to evaluate the performance of the business consistently. The tangible common equity ratio is used by management to assess the strength of our capital position. The computations of these measures are set forth in the tables below.
