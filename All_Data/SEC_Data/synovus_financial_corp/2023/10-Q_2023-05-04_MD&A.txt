In this Report, the words &#8220;Synovus,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to Synovus Financial Corp. together with Synovus Bank and Synovus' other wholly-owned subsidiaries, except where the context requires otherwise. 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Certain statements made or incorporated by reference in this Report which are not statements of historical fact, including those under &#8220;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; and elsewhere in this Report, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of, and subject to the protections of, Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Forward-looking statements include statements with respect to Synovus' beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, targets, expectations, anticipations, assumptions, estimates, intentions and future performance and involve known and unknown risks, many of which are beyond Synovus' control and which may cause Synovus' actual results, performance or achievements or the financial services industry or economy generally, to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. 

All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. You can identify these forward-looking statements through Synovus' use of words such as &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;assumes,&#8221; &#8220;predicts,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;targets,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;projects,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;potential&#8221; and other similar words and expressions of the future or otherwise regarding the outlook for Synovus' future business and financial performance and/or the performance of the financial services industry and economy in general. Forward-looking statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of Synovus' management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements in this document. Many of these factors are beyond Synovus' ability to control or predict. These factors include, but are not limited to: 

(1) competition in the financial services industry, including competition from nontraditional banking institutions such as Fintechs; (2) our ability to realize the expected benefits from our strategic initiatives or other operational and execution goals in the time period expected, which could negatively affect our future profitability; (3) an economic downturn and contraction, including a recession, and the resulting effects on our capital, financial condition, credit quality, results of operations and future growth, including that the strength of the current economic environment could be further weakened by prolonged periods of inflation; (4) potential impacts of the recent adverse developments in the banking industry highlighted by high-profile bank failures, including impacts on client confidence, deposit outflows, liquidity, and the regulatory response thereto; (5) changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market; (6) restrictions or limitations on access to funds from historical and alternative sources of liquidity could adversely affect our overall liquidity, which could restrict our ability to make payments on our obligations and our ability to support asset growth and sustain our operations and the operations of Synovus Bank; (7) our ability to attract and retain employees and the impact of senior leadership transitions that are key to our strategic initiatives; (8) our strategic implementation of new lines of business, new products and services, and new technologies and the expansion of our existing business opportunities with a renewed focus on innovation; (9) prolonged periods of high inflation and their effects on our business, profitability, and our stock price; (10) changes in the interest rate environment, including changes to the federal funds rate, and competition in our primary market area may result in increased funding costs or reduced earning assets yields, thus reducing margins and net interest income; (11) the impact of recent, proposed, and potential changes in governmental policy, laws and regulations, potential, proposed, and recently enacted changes in monetary policy and in the regulation and taxation of banks and financial institutions, or the interpretation or application thereof and the uncertainty of future implementation and enforcement of these regulations, including rising inflationary pressures and interest rate increases and the possibility that the U.S. could default on its debt obligations; (12) we may be required to make substantial expenditures to keep pace with regulatory initiatives and the rapid technological changes in the financial services industry; (13) our current and future information technology system enhancements and operational initiatives may not be successfully implemented, which could negatively impact our operations; 

(14) our business relationships with, and reliance upon, third parties that have strategic partnerships with us or that provide key components of our business infrastructure, including the costs of services and products provided to us by third parties, and disruptions in service or financial difficulties with a third-party vendor or business relationship; (15) our enterprise risk management framework, our compliance program, or our corporate governance and supervisory oversight functions may not identify or address risks adequately, which may result in unexpected losses; (16) our asset quality may deteriorate or that our allowance for credit losses may prove to be inadequate or may be negatively affected by credit risk exposures; (17) the ability of our operational framework to identify and manage risks associated with our business, such as credit risk, compliance risk, reputational risk, and operational risk, including by virtue of our relationships with third-party business partners, as well as our relationships with third-party vendors and other service providers; (18) we may be exposed to potential losses in the event of fraud and/or theft, or in the event that a third-party vendor, obligor, or business partner fails to pay amounts due to us under that relationship or under any arrangement that we enter into with them; (19) if economic conditions worsen further or regulatory capital rules are modified, we may be required to undertake initiatives to improve or conserve our capital position; (20) our ability to identify and address cyber-security risks such as data security breaches, malware, "denial of service" attacks, "hacking", and identity theft, a failure of which could disrupt our business and result in the disclosure of and/or misuse or misappropriation of confidential or proprietary information, disruption, or damage of our systems, increased costs, significant losses, or adverse effects to our reputation; (21) the impact on our financial results, reputation, and business if we are unable to comply with all applicable federal and state regulations or other supervisory actions or directives and any necessary capital initiatives; (22) our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity, including our ability to pay dividends or take other capital actions; (23) our ESG strategies and initiatives, the scope and pace of which could alter our reputation and shareholder, employee, client, and third-party relationships; (24) the continued use, availability, and reliability of LIBOR and the risks related to the transition from LIBOR to any alternate reference rate we may use; (25) we could realize losses if we sell assets and the proceeds we receive are lower than the carrying value of such assets and such losses could negatively impact market perceptions of us and could lead to deposit withdrawals; (26) our ability to obtain regulatory approval to take certain actions, including any dividends on our common stock or preferred stock, any repurchases of common stock, or any other issuance or redemption of any other regulatory capital instruments, as well as any applications in respect to strategic initiatives; (27) we may not be able to identify suitable bank and non-bank acquisition opportunities as part of our growth strategy and even if we are able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to complete such transactions on favorable terms or realize the anticipated benefits from such acquisitions; (28) our concentrated operations in the Southeastern U.S. make us vulnerable to local economic conditions, local weather catastrophes, public health issues, and other external events; (29) the costs and effects of litigation, investigations, or similar matters, or adverse facts and developments related thereto; (30) the fluctuation in our stock price and general volatility in the stock market; (31) the effects of any damages to our reputation resulting from developments related to any of the items identified above; and (32) other factors and other information contained in this Report and in other reports and filings that we make with the SEC under the Exchange Act, including, without limitation, those found in "Part II - Item 1A.

Economic Environment and Recent Events 

In an effort to achieve their inflation objectives, the Federal Reserve aggressively tightened monetary policy with the FOMC raising market interest rates 425 bps during 2022, and rates have increased another 50 bps through the end of the first quarter of 2023. The extent of interest rate increases and the period of time that higher rates will remain in effect depends greatly on the level of inflation and strength of the labor market. 

Economic uncertainty and market disruptions outside of inflation remain, including geopolitical tensions primarily from Russia&#8217;s prolonged war in Ukraine, the relationship between the U.S. and China, and to a lesser extent, the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global supply chains, tourism, business travel, immigration, and labor participation. 

U.S. fiscal policy has been expansionary since 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving a significant federal deficit and a looming Congressional debt ceiling debate in 2023. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signed into law in August 2022, raises federal revenue by imposing an alternative corporate minimum tax if certain thresholds are met and a non-deductible excise tax on corporate share repurchases. The IRA does not have a significant immediate impact on Synovus. 

On March 8, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank announced its intent to issue common equity as part of a strategic balance sheet repositioning effort aimed primarily at improving its financial performance. This announcement sparked concerns among certain segments of deposits, including technology, venture capital, and cryptocurrency, which ultimately led to closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, both of which had exceedingly high levels of uninsured deposits. The subsequent response to these events by both the banking industry and the Federal Reserve served to mitigate the risks of these failures becoming more systemic. However, the residual impacts on the broader economic environment remain uncertain and have generally presented a more challenging outlook for the banking industry as was reflected in recently updated earnings guidance for many banks, including Synovus, for the remainder of 2023. 

Despite the headwinds discussed above, with an asset-sensitive balance sheet and our position in Southeast U.S. markets, Synovus believes it is well-positioned to execute on our revised 2023 outlook outlined below by focusing on productivity gains within our core businesses, continuing to benefit from contributions generated through our new growth initiatives and key talent additions, while maintaining a resilient and conservative liquidity profile, a strong capital position, diverse deposit generation across all business lines, and overall credit vigilance. 

Executive Summary 

Net income available to common shareholders for the first quarter of 2023 was $193.9 million, or $1.32 per diluted common share, compared to $162.7 million, or $1.11 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2022. The year-over-year change resulted in an improved efficiency ratio-TE and was largely impacted by higher net interest income from increased interest rates and strong loan growth as well as higher non-interest expense primarily resulting from investments in our workforce and new business initiatives. 

Net interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $480.8 million, up $88.5 million, or 23%, compared to the same period in 2022. Net interest margin was up 42 bps over the comparable three - month period to 3.43%, due primarily to the benefits of our asset sensitive balance sheet and substantial loan growth partially offset by continued increases in deposit costs. Net interest margin for the first quarter was 3.43%, down 13 bps sequentially, as the asset side of our balance sheet continued to benefit from higher balances and rates, but cyclical lags in deposit pricing combined with re-mixing within our non-interest bearing deposits served as a notable headwind for the current quarter. In addition, we proactively added FHLB advances and brokered deposits amid the uncertain economic environment and issued $500.0 million par value 2028 Synovus Bank Senior Notes in February 2023. 

Non-interest revenue for the first quarter of 2023 was $133.1 million, up $27.8 million, or 26%, compared to the first quarter of 2022 and was favorably impacted by a $13.1 million one-time benefit from the recovery of a non-performing asset related to the regulatory approval of our Qualpay investment. See Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion. The primary drivers of the increase, excluding the recovery of the NPA, were strong growth in capital markets income and brokerage revenue. 

Non-interest expense for the first quarter of 2023 was $321.9 million, up $49.4 million, or 18%, compared to the same period in 2022 and was negatively impacted by a $16.8 million loss associated with $424.1 million of third-party consumer loans moved to held for sale, while the comparative period benefited from a $6.4 million reversal of restructuring charges. The remaining increase in non-interest expense during 2023 was primarily due to investments in and expansion of our workforce, investments in new businesses initiatives, and an industry-wide increase in the FDIC base assessment rate. 

At March 31, 2023, loans, net of deferred fees and costs, of $44.04 billion, increased $328.6 million, from December 31, 2022. Loan growth excluding the impact of the aforementioned $424.1 million move of third-party consumer loans to held for sale was $752.7 million, or 2%, sequentially. Growth in C&#38;I loans was diversified and supported by low levels of pay-offs while CRE loan growth was a function of draws related to existing commitments and low levels of pay-offs. 

At March 31, 2023, credit metrics continue to remain at strong levels with NPAs and NPLs both at 41 bps and total past dues at 12 bps, as a percentage of total loans. Net charge-offs remained low at $18.6 million, or 17 bps annualized, for the three months ended March 31, 2023, and included $6.6 million related to third-party consumer loans moved to held for sale. The ACL at March 31, 2023 totaled $514.5 million, an increase of $13.6 million from December 31, 2022, and resulted primarily from a deterioration in economic factors, including an increase in the downside weighting of the multiple scenario model. The ACL to loans coverage ratio at March 31, 2023 of 1.17% modestly increased 2 bps compared to December 31, 2022. 

Total period-end deposits at March 31, 2023 increased $1.08 billion, or 2%, compared to December 31, 2022 and resulted from increased time deposits partially offset by a decline in money market accounts as consumers shifted excess liquidity between these two account types. Brokered deposits also increased as a result of proactive management of our liquidity position. The decrease in non-interest bearing demand deposits was primarily impacted by commercial seasonality, normal cash deployment, and to a lesser extent, continued pressures from the FOMC's efforts to tighten monetary policy. Average deposit costs of 1.44% increased 133 bps from the prior year comparable period primarily due to the impact of the FOMC's rate hikes 

of 450 bps from March 31, 2022 to March 31, 2023. Deposit costs were impacted by the decline in non-interest bearing demand deposits in addition to anticipated pricing lags on core interest-bearing deposit costs. 

At March 31, 2023, Synovus' CET1 ratio of 9.77% improved 14 bps compared to December 31, 2022, driven by robust organic capital generation from earnings, which was more than sufficient to meet what continued to be solid, core balance sheet growth. 

More detail on Synovus' financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2023 may be found in subsequent sections of "Item 2. &#8211; Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Report. See also "Part 1 &#8211; Item 1A. &#8211; Risk Factors" of Synovus' 2022 Form 10-K. 

2023 Updated Guidance 

Updated guidance (1) for the full year 2023, compared to 2022, utilizes wider ranges and incorporates the ongoing volatility in the economic environment, includes: 

&#8226; Loan growth (2) of 4%-8% 

&#8226; Adjusted revenue (2)(3) growth of 4% to 7% 

&#8226; Adjusted non-interest expense (3) growth of 4% to 6% 

&#8226; Adjusted PPNR (2)(3) growth of 4% to 8% 

&#8226; Ending CET1 ratio of ~10% 

&#8226; Effective income tax rate of 21% to 23% 

(1) Excludes the impact of Qualpay investment which is expected to have an immaterial impact to adjusted PPNR (3) for 2023, nor does it reflect potential incremental costs associated with FDIC assessments resulting from recent bank failures. It also assumes a federal funds rate of 5.25% in the second quarter of 2023 and holding at that rate throughout the remainder of 2023. 

(2) Not adjusting for PPP loans or revenue given relatively immaterial impact to 2022 and 2023 forecasted results; assumes no incremental material loan sales outside of the current planned third-party consumer sale. 

(3) See "Table 13 - Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures&#8221; in this Report for applicable reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure. 

Changes in Financial Condition 

During the three months ended March 31, 2023, total assets increased $2.11 billion to $61.84 billion. Cash and cash equivalents increased $1.39 billion primarily through the use of brokered deposits and long-term FHLB advances to proactively manage our liquidity position, and total loans increased $328.6 million, with commercial loan growth more than offsetting the $424.1 million move of third-party consumer loans to held for sale. Deposits increased $1.08 billion and resulted from both increased brokered deposits and higher core deposit balances as relationship-based deposit production contributed to the growth. The loan to deposit ratio was 88.2% at March 31, 2023 as compared to 89.5% at December 31, 2022. Long-term debt increased $1.04 billion from December 31, 2022, largely due to $525.0 million higher long-term FHLB advances and $500.0 million par value 2028 Synovus Bank Senior Notes issued in February 2023. 

Total shareholders' equity at March 31, 2023 increased $294.3 million compared to December 31, 2022, driven by a decrease in after-tax net unrealized losses on investment securities available for sale and cash flow hedges of $115.0 million and $37.7 million, respectively. The increase was also driven by growth in retained earnings, which included net income of $202.2 million partially offset by common and preferred stock dividends of $55.5 million and $8.3 million, respectively.

Growth in C&#38;I loans was diversified and supported by low levels of pay-offs while CRE loan growth was a function of draws related to existing commitments and low levels of pay-offs. 

C&#38;I loans remain the largest component of our loan portfolio, representing 51.3% of total loans, while CRE and consumer loans represent 29.5% and 19.2%, respectively. Our portfolio composition is guided by our strategic growth plan, in conjunction with a comprehensive concentration management policy which sets limits for C&#38;I, CRE, and consumer loan levels as well as sub-categories therein. 

Commercial Loans 

Total commercial loans (which are comprised of C&#38;I and CRE loans) at March 31, 2023 were $35.60 billion, or 80.8% of the total loan portfolio, compared to $34.72 billion, or 79.4%, at December 31, 2022. 

Commercial and Industrial Loans 

The C&#38;I loan portfolio represents the largest category of Synovus' loan portfolio and is primarily comprised of general middle market and commercial banking clients across a diverse set of industries as well as certain specialized lending verticals. The following table shows the composition of the C&#38;I loan portfolio aggregated by NAICS code. In accordance with Synovus' lending policy, each loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process, which incorporates uniform underwriting standards and 

oversight in proportion to the size and complexity of the lending relationship. As of March 31, 2023, 94.5% of Synovus' C&#38;I loans are secured by real estate, business equipment, inventory, and other types of collateral compared to 94.4% as of December 31, 2022. C&#38;I loans at March 31, 2023 grew $533.5 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2022 and resulted from diverse growth across business lines and industries, led by the finance and insurance, healthcare and social assistance, and construction industries. C&#38;I utilization also increased and was a function of higher utilization associated with new origination as our lending mix has shifted to larger clients.

At March 31, 2023, $14.20 billion of C&#38;I loans, or 32.2% of the total loan portfolio, represented loans originated for the purpose of financing commercial, financial and agricultural business activities. The primary source of repayment on these loans is revenue generated from products or services offered by the business or organization. The secondary source of repayment is the collateral, which consists primarily of equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, time deposits, cash surrender value of life insurance, and other business assets. 

At March 31, 2023, $8.40 billion of C&#38;I loans, or 19.1% of the total loan portfolio, represented loans originated for the purpose of financing owner-occupied properties. The financing of owner-occupied facilities is considered a C&#38;I loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral. This treatment is a result of the credit decision process, which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt. The secondary source of repayment on these loans is the underlying real estate. These loans are predominantly secured by owner-occupied and other real estate and, to a lesser extent, other types of collateral. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans 

CRE loans consist primarily of income-producing investment properties loans. Additionally, CRE loans include 1-4 family properties loans as well as land and development loans. Total CRE loans of $13.00 billion increased $346.4 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2022, particularly in the multi-family category, with growth arising from draws related to existing commitments and low levels of pay-off activity. 

Investment properties loans consist of construction and mortgage loans for income-producing properties and are primarily made to finance multi-family properties, hotels, office buildings (medical and non-medical), shopping centers, warehouses and other commercial development properties. Total investment properties loans as of March 31, 2023 were $11.98 billion, or 92.2% of the CRE loan portfolio, and increased $332.8 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2022, primarily due to growth in most sub-categories, with the exception of shopping centers and warehouses, which were down $71.9 million, or 5%, and $14.2 million, or 1%, respectively, from December 31, 2022. 

The following table shows the principal categories of the investment properties loan portfolio at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

(1) Loan balance in each category expressed as a percentage of total investment properties loans. 

1-4 Family Properties Loans 

1-4 family properties loans include construction loans to home builders and commercial mortgage loans related to 1-4 family rental properties and are almost always secured by the underlying property being financed by such loans. These properties are primarily located in the markets served by Synovus. At March 31, 2023, 1-4 family properties loans totaled $596.7 million, or 4.6% of the CRE loan portfolio, and decreased slightly from December 31, 2022. 

Land and Development Loans 

Land and development loans include commercial and residential development as well as land acquisition loans and are secured by land held for future development, typically in excess of one year. Properties securing these loans are substantially within markets served by Synovus, and loan terms generally include personal guarantees from the principals. Loans in this portfolio are underwritten based on the LTV of the collateral and the capacity of the guarantor(s). Land and development loans of $423.3 million at March 31, 2023 increased marginally from December 31, 2022. 

Consumer Loans 

The consumer loan portfolio consists of a wide variety of loan products offered through Synovus' banking network, including first and second residential mortgages, home equity and consumer credit card loans, as well as both secured and unsecured loans from third-party lending. As of March 31, 2023, weighted-average FICO scores within the residential real estate portfolio based on committed balances were 778 for consumer mortgages and 792 for home equity, consistent with year-end 2022 scores. 

Consumer loans at March 31, 2023 of $8.45 billion decreased $551.4 million, or 6%, compared to December 31, 2022. Mortgage loans increased $32.2 million from December 31, 2022, largely due to slower prepayments and refinances as a result of continued increases in mortgage rates. Other consumer loans decreased $564.8 million from December 31, 2022, primarily due to $424.1 million of third-party consumer loans that moved to held for sale in addition to runoff. 

Deposits 

Deposits provide the most significant funding source for interest earning assets. The following table shows the composition of period-end deposits as of the dates indicated. See Table 11 - Quarter-to-Date Net Interest Income and Rate/Volume Analysis in this Report for information on average deposits including average rates.

(3) Core deposits exclude brokered deposits. 

Total period-end deposits at March 31, 2023 increased $1.08 billion, or 2%, compared to December 31, 2022 and resulted from increased time deposits partially offset by a decline in money market accounts as consumers shifted excess liquidity between these two account types. Brokered deposits also increased as a result of proactive management of our liquidity position. The decrease in non-interest bearing demand deposits was primarily impacted by commercial seasonality, normal cash deployment, and to a lesser extent, continued pressures from the FOMC's efforts to tighten monetary policy. 

Average deposit costs of 1.44%, which equates to a cycle-to-date total deposit beta of ~30% through the first quarter of 2023, increased 56 bps and 133 bps, from the prior quarter and prior year comparable period, respectively, primarily due to the impact of the FOMC's rate hikes of 50 bps during the first quarter of 2023 and 450 bps from March 31, 2022 to March 31, 2023. Deposit costs were impacted by the decline in non-interest bearing demand deposits in addition to anticipated pricing lags on core interest-bearing deposit costs. We continue to expect some upward pressure on deposit costs given recent remixing trends along with an FOMC that appears it will hold the federal funds rate at or above 5%, and therefore, we expect cumulative deposit betas to trend upwards and end in the low 40's range. 

As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, $24.48 billion and $25.08 billion, respectively, of our deposit portfolio was uninsured, which represents approximately 48% and 51%, respectively, of total deposits. The uninsured amounts are estimated based on the methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank's regulatory reporting requirements. At March 31, 2023, over 70% of our deposits are either insured (52%), collateralized (13%), or could be insured by switching to our insured cash sweep program, which has existing capacity (8%). 

Non-interest Revenue 

Non-interest revenue for the first quarter of 2023 was $133.1 million, up $27.8 million, or 26%, compared to the same period in 2022, and was favorably impacted by a $13.1 million one-time benefit from the recovery of a non-performing asset related to the regulatory approval of our Qualpay investment. See Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion. The primary drivers of the increase, excluding the recovery of the NPA, were strong growth in capital markets income and brokerage revenue. 

The following table shows the principal components of non-interest revenue.

(2) Consists of fiduciary and asset management, brokerage, and insurance revenue. 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 compared to March 31, 2022 

Service charges on deposit accounts, consisting of account analysis fees, NSF fees, and all other service charges, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were up slightly compared to the same period in 2022. The largest category of service charges, account analysis fees, was up $609 thousand, or 6%, compared to the first quarter of 2022. NSF/overdraft fees for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were down $443 thousand and comprised 29% and 32% of service charges on deposit accounts at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We expect this downward trend in NSF/overdraft fees to continue. All other service charges on deposit accounts, which consist primarily of monthly fees on consumer demand deposits and small business accounts, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were up $268 thousand, or 5%. 

Fiduciary and asset management fees are derived from providing estate administration, personal trust, corporate trust, corporate bond, investment management, financial planning, and family office services. The decline compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 primarily resulted from volatility in the equity markets which also resulted in lower assets under management. 

Card fees consist primarily of credit card interchange fees, debit card interchange fees, and merchant revenue. Card fees are reported net of certain associated expense items, including client loyalty program expenses and network expenses. Merchant revenue relates to the fees that are charged to merchant clients based on a percentage of their credit or debit card transaction volume amounts. Card fees for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were up primarily due to higher credit card transaction volumes from elevated commercial and consumer spend activity and commercial account growth in addition to increased merchant revenue resulting from higher transaction volumes and new merchants being added. 

Brokerage revenue consists primarily of brokerage commissions as well as advisory fees earned from the management of client assets. Brokerage revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased significantly over the prior year comparable period, benefiting largely from client activity, including movement into short-term liquidity products such as repurchase agreements due to the rate environment. 

Mortgage banking income, consisting of net gains on loan origination/sales activities, was lower for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, due to the continued depressed residential mortgage environment, with increases in mortgage rates reducing refinancing and new-purchase volumes. Mortgage banking income declined $2.1 million primarily as a result of a $96.6 million, or 45%, decrease in loan sales and a $115.2 million, or 52%, decline in secondary market mortgage production compared to the prior year. 

Capital markets income primarily includes fee income from client derivative transactions. Additionally, capital markets income includes fee income from debt capital market transactions and foreign exchange as well as other miscellaneous income from capital market transactions. The substantial increase for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same 

period in 2022 primarily resulted from a $4.6 million increase in loan syndication arranger fees and a $2.6 million increase in fees on client derivative transactions. 

The main components of other non-interest revenue are fees for letters of credit and unused lines of credit, safe deposit box fees, access fees for ATM use, other service charges and loan servicing fees, gains (losses) from sales of SBA loans, and other miscellaneous items. The comparative period decline is primarily due to a gain of $3.5 million recognized on the sale of a certain real estate partnership recorded during the first quarter of 2022. 

Non-interest Expense 

Non-interest expense for the first quarter of 2023 was $321.9 million, up $49.4 million, or 18%, compared to the same period in 2022 and was negatively impacted by a $16.8 million loss associated with $424.1 million of third-party consumer loans moved to held for sale, while the comparative period benefited from a $6.4 million reversal of restructuring charges. The remaining increase in non-interest expense during 2023 was primarily due to investments in and expansion of our workforce, investments in new businesses initiatives, and an industry-wide increase in the FDIC base assessment rate. 

The following table summarizes the components of non-interest expense. 

Table 7 - Non-interest Expense Three Months Ended March 31, (dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 $ Change % Change Salaries and other personnel expense $ 188,924 &#160; $ 164,684 $ 24,240 15 % Net occupancy, equipment, and software expense 42,860 &#160; 42,877 (17) &#8212; Third-party processing and other services 21,833 &#160; 20,996 837 4 Professional fees 8,963 &#160; 8,474 489 6 FDIC insurance and other regulatory fees 10,268 &#160; 6,250 4,018 64 Amortization of intangibles 1,857 &#160; 2,118 (261) (12) Restructuring charges (reversals) (733) (6,424) 5,691 (89) Loss on early extinguishment of debt &#8212; &#160; 677 (677) nm Loss on other loans held for sale 16,750 &#160; &#8212; 16,750 nm Other operating expense 31,130 &#160; 32,798 (1,668) (5) Total non-interest expense $ 321,852 &#160; $ 272,450 $ 49,402 18 % 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 compared to March 31, 2022 

Salaries and other personnel expense increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily due to the impacts of merit and inflationary wage increases, headcount additions, employee healthcare costs, and an increase in the fair value of the non-qualified deferred compensation liability (offset in non-interest revenue), partially offset by lower mortgage production-based commissions. Total headcount of 5,161 was up by 159, or 3%, compared to March 31, 2022 as a result of additions in areas associated with strategic revenue growth and certain critical support functions. 

Third-party processing and other services include all third-party core operating system and processing charges as well as third-party consumer loan servicing charges. Third-party processing expense increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023, largely resulting from enhancements associated with technology and operations infrastructure investments and new business initiatives somewhat offset by lower servicing fees associated with third-party consumer loans. 

Professional fees were up modestly for the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily from higher consulting fees largely related to strategic and infrastructure investments partially offset by lower legal fees from credit-related items. 

FDIC insurance and other regulatory fees increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023, largely due to the industry-wide 2 bps increase in the deposit insurance initial base assessment rate that began in the first quarter of 2023. In addition, asset growth contributed to a higher assessment base compared to the first quarter of 2022. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2023, Synovus recorded restructuring charges (reversals) including $1.4 million in gains on the sale of three branches previously closed partially offset by $354 thousand of severance and $282 thousand in common area maintenance and asset impairment/lease termination charges related to branches. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, Synovus recorded restructuring charges (reversals) that included $9.1 million in gains largely relating to the sale of real estate facilities in Columbus, Georgia, which were partially offset by restructuring charges related to branch closures. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2023, Synovus recorded a $16.8 million loss associated with a fair value adjustment on other loans held for sale due to the transfer of $424.1 million of third-party consumer loans to held for sale. See Note 3 - Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses for further discussion. 

Other operating expense includes advertising, travel, insurance, network and communication, other taxes, subscriptions and dues, other loan and ORE expense, postage and freight, training, business development, supplies, donations, and other miscellaneous expense. Other operating expense was down for the three months ended March 31, 2023 largely due to the reversal of a $2.7 million impairment charge related to the recovery of a non-performing asset upon the regulatory approval of our Qualpay investment. See Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion. 

Income Tax Expense 

Income tax expense was $57.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, representing an effective tax rate of 22.2%, compared to income tax expense of $42.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, representing an effective tax rate of 20.0%. The effective tax rate was higher for three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in net discrete tax benefits recognized during the current period, including share-based compensation and changes in amounts taxable by jurisdictions, compared to the prior period. 

CREDIT QUALITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 

Credit Quality 

Synovus diligently monitors the quality of its loan portfolio by industry, property type, and geography through a thorough portfolio review process and our analytical risk management tools. At March 31, 2023, credit metrics continue to remain at strong levels with NPAs and NPLs both at 41 bps and total past dues at 12 bps, as a percentage of total loans. Net charge-offs were $18.6 million, or 17 bps annualized, for the three months ended March 31, 2023, and included $6.6 million related to the third-party consumer loans moved to held for sale. While we do expect additional pressure on credit metrics due to the economic environment, we continue to have confidence in the strength and quality of our portfolio. We continue to be vigilant while monitoring the more recession-sensitive components of our loan portfolio, and we utilize rigorous underwriting standards and market and portfolio analysis for the entirety of the loan portfolio. 

The table below includes selected credit quality metrics.

Non-performing Assets 

Total NPAs were $182.5 million at March 31, 2023, a $39.1 million, or 27%, increase from December 31, 2022 primarily due to the designation of a few large commercial relationships as non-performing, which are reserved and collateralized, partially offset by the recovery of a non-performing asset related to the regulatory approval of our Qualpay investment. See Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion. 

Criticized and Classified Loans 

Our loan ratings are aligned to federal banking regulators' definitions of pass and criticized categories, which include special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss. Substandard accruing and non-accruing loans, doubtful, and loss loans are often collectively referred to as classified. Special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss loans are often collectively referred to as criticized and classified loans. The following table presents a summary of criticized and classified loans. Criticized and classified loans at March 31, 2023 were 2.5% of total loans, or $1.09 billion, up $143.9 million as compared to 2.2% of total loans, or $942.1 million, at December 31, 2022, primarily due to the migration of several commercial credits.

Provision for (Reversal of) Credit Losses and Allowance for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses was $32.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to a provision of $11.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, with both periods including net charge-offs of $18.6 million. The increase was predominantly driven by changes in forecasted economic factors, with the first quarter of 2023 showing indicators of a more recessionary environment and the first quarter of 2022 showing improving economics post-pandemic. These economic factors drove an increase in the ACL ratio of 2 bps during the first quarter of 2023, compared with a declining ratio of 4 bps during the first quarter of 2022. 

The ALL of $457.0 million and the reserve for unfunded commitments of $57.5 million, which is recorded in other liabilities, comprise the total ACL of $514.5 million at March 31, 2023. The ACL increased $13.6 million compared to the December 31, 2022 ACL of $500.9 million, which consisted of an ALL of $443.4 million and the reserve for unfunded commitments of $57.5 million. The ACL to loans coverage ratio of 1.17% at March 31, 2023 had a modest sequential increase of 2 bps. The increase in the ACL from December 31, 2022 resulted primarily from a deterioration in economic factors, including an increase in the downside weighting of the multiple scenario model. 

Capital Resources 

Synovus and Synovus Bank are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by our primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve. Synovus and Synovus Bank measure capital adequacy using the standardized approach under Basel III. At March 31, 2023, Synovus and Synovus Bank's capital levels remained strong and exceeded well-capitalized requirements currently in effect. The following table presents certain ratios used to measure Synovus and Synovus Bank's capitalization. 

Table 10 - Capital Ratios (dollars in thousands) March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 CET1 capital Synovus Financial Corp. $ 5,056,613 &#160; $ 4,926,194 Synovus Bank 5,564,496 &#160; 5,446,703 Tier 1 risk-based capital Synovus Financial Corp. 5,593,758 &#160; 5,463,339 Synovus Bank 5,564,496 &#160; 5,446,703 Total risk-based capital Synovus Financial Corp. 6,579,216 &#160; 6,415,681 Synovus Bank 6,231,923 &#160; 6,079,152 CET1 capital ratio Synovus Financial Corp. 9.77 &#160; % 9.63 % Synovus Bank 10.77 &#160; 10.66 Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio Synovus Financial Corp. 10.81 &#160; 10.68 Synovus Bank 10.77 &#160; 10.66 Total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets ratio Synovus Financial Corp. 12.72 &#160; 12.54 Synovus Bank 12.06 &#160; 11.89 Leverage ratio Synovus Financial Corp. 9.14 &#160; 9.07 Synovus Bank 9.11 &#160; 9.06 

At March 31, 2023, Synovus' CET1 ratio of 9.77% improved 14 bps compared to December 31, 2022, driven by robust organic capital generation from earnings, which was more than sufficient to meet what continued to be solid, core balance sheet growth. For additional information on regulatory capital requirements, see "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10 - Regulatory Capital" to the consolidated financial statements of Synovus' 2022 Form 10-K. Management reviews the Company's capital position on an on-going basis and believes, based on internal capital analyses and earnings projections, that Synovus is well positioned to meet relevant regulatory capital standards. 

On January 18, 2023, Synovus announced that its Board of Directors approved a capital plan that included a $0.04 increase 

in the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.38 per share, beginning with the quarterly dividend payable in April 2023, and authorized share repurchases of up to $300 million in 2023. Synovus did not repurchase any shares in the first quarter of 2023, and in light of the uncertain economic and regulatory environment, in the near-term, we will continue to focus on retaining and growing capital. 

On August 26, 2020, the federal banking regulators issued a final rule that allowed electing banking organizations that adopted CECL during 2020 to mitigate the estimated effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year phase-in transition period. Synovus adopted CECL on January 1, 2020 and the March 31, 2023 regulatory capital ratios reflect Synovus' election of the five-year transition provision. At March 31, 2023, $29.2 million, or a cumulative 6 bps benefit to CET1, was deferred. 

Dividends 

Synovus has historically paid a quarterly cash dividend to the holders of its common stock. Management and the Board of Directors closely monitor current and projected capital levels, liquidity (including dividends from subsidiaries), financial markets and other economic trends, as well as regulatory requirements regarding the payment of dividends. 

Synovus' ability to pay dividends on its common stock and preferred stock is primarily dependent upon dividends and distributions that it receives from its bank and non-banking subsidiaries, which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities. 

Synovus declared common stock dividends of $55.5 million, or $0.38 per common share, for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $49.4 million, or $0.34 per common share, for the three months ended March 31, 2022. In addition, Synovus declared dividends on its preferred stock of $8.3 million during both the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. 

Liquidity 

Liquidity represents the extent to which Synovus has readily available sources of funding to meet the needs of depositors, borrowers and creditors, to support asset growth, and to otherwise sustain operations of Synovus and its subsidiaries, at a reasonable cost, on a timely basis, and without adverse consequences. ALCO monitors Synovus' economic, competitive, and regulatory environment and is responsible for measuring, monitoring, and reporting on liquidity and funding risk as well as market risk. 

In accordance with Synovus policies and regulatory guidance, ALCO evaluates contractual and anticipated cash flows under normal and stressed conditions to properly manage the Company&#8217;s liquidity profile. Synovus places an emphasis on maintaining numerous sources of current and contingent liquidity to meet its obligations to depositors, borrowers, and creditors on a timely basis. Liquidity is generated through various sources, including, but not limited to, maturities and repayments of loans by clients, maturities and sales of investment securities, and growth in core and wholesale deposits. 

Synovus Bank also generates liquidity through the issuance of brokered certificates of deposit and money market accounts. Synovus Bank accesses funds from a broad geographic base to diversify its sources of funding and liquidity. Synovus Bank also has the capacity to access funding through its membership in the FHLB system and through the Federal Reserve discount window. Management continuously monitors and maintains appropriate levels of liquidity so as to provide adequate funding sources to manage client deposit withdrawals, loan requests, and other funding demands. 

Synovus maintained stable core deposit balances, growing by $133.1 million, during the first quarter of 2023. Time deposits increased $1.34 billion, partially offset by a $700.8 million decline in money market accounts as consumers shifted excess liquidity between these two account types. A $746.9 million decrease in non-interest bearing demand deposits was primarily impacted by commercial seasonality, normal cash deployment, and to a lesser extent, continued pressures from the FOMC's efforts to tighten monetary policy. Based on certain recent bank failures and negative media narrative around deposit outflows at regional banks, Synovus proactively added FHLB advances and brokered deposits as precautionary measures amid the uncertain environment. Synovus continues to proactively pledge additional collateral to the FHLB and Federal Reserve and maintains contingent liquidity across a diverse set of sources which include immediately available funds as well as funds we expect to be available within short notice. Contingent liquidity sources include primary sources such as FHLB borrowing capacity, FRB cash reserves, and third-party consumer loans, which includes our decision to sell loans from this portfolio and runoff, while secondary sources consist of the Federal Reserve discount window, Fed Funds lines, and other sources like the FRB's Bank Term Funding Program. At March 31, 2023, based on currently pledged collateral, Synovus Bank had access to FHLB funding of $3.62 billion, subject to FHLB credit policies. 

In addition to bank level liquidity management, Synovus must manage liquidity at the Parent Company level for various operating needs, including the servicing of debt, the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock, payment of general corporate expense, and potential capital infusions into subsidiaries. The primary source of liquidity for Synovus 

consists of dividends from Synovus Bank, which is governed by certain rules and regulations of the GA DBF and the Federal Reserve Bank. Synovus' ability to receive dividends from Synovus Bank in future periods will depend on a number of factors, including, without limitation, Synovus Bank's future profits, asset quality, liquidity, and overall condition. In addition, both the GA DBF and Federal Reserve Bank may require approval to pay dividends, based on certain regulatory statutes and limitations. 

On February 15, 2023, Synovus Bank issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Bank Notes due 2028, and the Notes will mature on February 15, 2028. The Notes will bear interest at 5.625% per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on each February 15 and August 15, beginning on August 15, 2023. Synovus Bank may not redeem the Notes prior to August 15, 2023. The redemption price for any redemption in whole or in part, at our option, on or after August 15, 2023, and prior to January 15, 2028, is equal to the greater of: (1) (a) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the redemption date (assuming the Notes matured on January 15, 2028) on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 30 basis points less (b) interest accrued to the date of redemption, and (2) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. The redemption price for any redemption after January 15, 2028 is 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. The Notes are not redeemable at the option or election of holders. 

Synovus presently believes that the sources of liquidity discussed above, including existing liquid funds on hand, are sufficient to meet its anticipated funding needs. See "Part II &#8211; Item 1A. Risk Factors - Recent negative developments in the banking industry could adversely affect our current and projected business operations and our financial condition and results of operation" of this Report and "Part I &#8211; Item 1A. Risk Factors - Changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market may adversely affect our capital resources, liquidity and financial results " of Synovus' 2022 Form 10-K. Furthermore, Synovus may, from time to time, take advantage of attractive market opportunities to refinance its existing debt, redeem its preferred stock, or strengthen its liquidity or capital position. 

Earning Assets and Sources of Funds 

Average total assets for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased $3.28 billion, or 6%, as compared to the first three months of 2022. Average earning assets increased $3.98 billion, or 8%, in the first three months of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The increase in average earning assets primarily resulted from a $4.44 billion, or 11%, increase in average total loans, net of unearned income, primarily attributable to growth in commercial loans from increased production and line utilization. 

Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $4.9 billion, or 15%, for the first three months of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities largely resulted from a $2.77 billion increase in brokered deposits, a $2.17 billion increase in long-term debt, a $1.67 billion increase in other short-term borrowings, and a $591.5 million increase in time deposits, partially offset by a $1.65 billion decrease in money market accounts. The increase in brokered deposits, long-term debt and other short-term borrowings, from FHLB advances, was largely due to the ongoing management of our liquidity position which also included the February 2023 issuance of $500.0 million par value 2028 Synovus Bank Senior Notes. The increase in time deposits and decreased money market accounts were correlated as consumers have shifted excess liquidity between these two account types. Average non-interest-bearing deposits decreased $1.48 billion, or 9%, for the first three months of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to the continued pressures from the FOMC's efforts to tighten monetary policy and normal client liquidity deployment. 

Net interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $480.8 million, up $88.5 million, or 23%, compared to the same period in 2022. Net interest margin was up 42 bps over the comparable three - month period to 3.43%, due primarily to the benefits of our asset sensitive balance sheet and substantial loan growth partially offset by continued increases in deposit costs. 

On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was down $20.6 million, or 4%, impacted by a lower day count and higher deposit costs. Net interest margin for the first quarter was 3.43%, down 13 bps compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, as the asset side of our balance sheet continued to benefit from higher balances and rates, but cyclical lags in deposit pricing combined with re-mixing within our non-interest bearing deposits served as a notable headwind for the current quarter. In addition, we proactively added FHLB advances and brokered deposits amid the uncertain economic environment and issued the aforementioned $500 million Bank Senior Notes. We expect net interest income to be pressured in the near term; specifically, we will see a full quarter impact of the deposit mix-shift that occurred during the first quarter of 2023 as well as the continued headwind resulting from deposit price lags. The combination of these headwinds is expected to lead to net interest income declines in the second quarter of 2023 followed by relative stability for the remainder of the year consistent with our full year 2023 guidance.

The following tables set forth the major components of net interest income and the related annualized yields and rates for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, as well as the variances between the periods caused by changes in interest rates versus changes in volume.

Market Risk Analysis 

Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Synovus is potentially exposed. Synovus measures the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates through the use of simulation modeling, which incorporates all of Synovus&#8217; earning assets and liabilities. These simulations are used to determine a baseline net interest income projection and the sensitivity of the income profile based on changes in interest rates. These simulations incorporate assumptions and factors, including, but not limited to, changes in market rates, in the size or composition of the balance sheet, and in repricing characteristics as well as client behaviors. This includes estimates for deposit repricing characteristics which, for purposes of the sensitivity estimates provided below, relies upon a constant, through-the-cycle total deposit cost beta of approximately 35%-40% as of the most recently reported period. This process is reviewed and updated on an on-going basis in a manner consistent with Synovus&#8217; ALCO governance framework. 

Synovus has modeled its baseline net interest income forecast assuming a relatively flat interest rate environment, with the federal funds rate at the Federal Reserve&#8217;s targeted range of 4.75% to 5.00% as of March 31, 2023 and the prime rate of 8.00% as of March 31, 2023. Synovus has modeled the impact of an immediate change in market interest rates across the yield curve of 100 and 200 bps to determine the sensitivity of net interest income for the next twelve months. As illustrated in the table below, the net interest income sensitivity derived from this simulation suggests that net interest income is projected to increase by 6.5% and 3.3% if interest rates increased by 200 and 100 bps, respectively. Net interest income is projected to decrease by 3.6% and 7.8% if interest rates decreased by 100 and 200 bps, respectively. 

The following table represents the estimated sensitivity of net interest income at March 31, 2023, with comparable information for December 31, 2022. 

Table 12 - Twelve Month Net Interest Income Sensitivity Estimated % Change in Net Interest Income as Compared to Unchanged Rates (for the next twelve months) Change in Interest Rates (in bps) March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 +200 6.5% 6.4% +100 3.3% 3.1% -100 (3.6)% (3.5)% -200 (7.8)% (7.5)% 

While all of the above estimates are reflective of the general interest rate sensitivity of Synovus, local market conditions, the realized growth and remixing of the balance sheet, as well as the broader macroeconomic environment could all have a significant impact on the both the sensitivity and realized level of net interest income. 

The net interest income simulation model is the primary tool utilized to evaluate potential interest rate risks over a shorter-term time horizon. Synovus also evaluates potential longer-term interest rate risk through modeling and evaluation of the sensitivity of the Company's EVE. The EVE measurement process estimates the net fair value of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet financial instruments under various interest rate scenarios. Management uses EVE sensitivity analyses as an additional means of measuring interest rate risk and incorporates this form of analysis within its governance and limits framework. The results of these analyses were consistent with the impact of the interest rate sensitivity analysis as shown in Table 12 - Twelve Month Net Interest Income Sensitivity above. 

Synovus is also subject to market risk in certain of its fee income business lines. Financial management services revenue, which include trust, brokerage, and asset management fees, can be affected by risk in the securities markets, primarily the equity securities market. A significant portion of the fees in this unit are determined based upon a percentage of asset values. Weaker securities markets and lower equity values have an adverse impact on the fees generated by these operations. Trading account assets, maintained to facilitate brokerage client activity, are also subject to market risk; however, trading activities are limited and subject to risk policy limits. Additionally, Synovus utilizes various tools to measure and manage price risk in its trading portfolio. 

Mortgage banking income is also subject to market risk. Mortgage loan originations are sensitive to levels of mortgage interest rates and therefore, mortgage banking income can be negatively impacted during a period of rising interest rates as we have experienced in the past year. The extension of commitments to clients to fund mortgage loans also subjects Synovus to market risk. This risk is primarily created by the time periods between making the commitment, closing, and delivering the loan. Synovus seeks to minimize its exposure by utilizing various risk management tools, including forward sales commitments and other hedges. 

Derivative Instruments for Interest Rate Risk Management 

Synovus utilizes derivative instruments to manage its exposure to various types of structural interest rate risks by 

executing end-user derivative transactions designated as hedges. Hedging relationships may be designated as either a cash flow hedge, which mitigates risk exposure to the variability of future cash flows or other forecasted transactions, or a fair value hedge, which mitigates risk exposure to adverse changes in the fair market value of a fixed rate asset or liability due to changes in market interest rates. 

As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Synovus had $6.00 billion and $5.25 billion, respectively, in notional amounts outstanding of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedging instruments to hedge its exposure to contractually specified interest rate risk associated with floating rate loans. 

As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Synovus had $3.34 billion and $2.23 billion, respectively, in notional amounts outstanding of receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedging instruments to hedge its exposure to the change in the fair value due to fluctuations in market interest rates for outstanding fixed-rate long-term debt and interest-bearing deposits. 

LIBOR Transition 

On March 5, 2021, the FCA confirmed that all LIBOR settings would either cease to be provided by any administrator or would no longer be representative immediately after June 30, 2023, for all remaining US dollar settings. 

The ARRC proposed SOFR as its preferred rate alternative to LIBOR and proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR. Organizations are currently working on industry-wide and company-specific transition plans related to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. As noted within "Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors" of Synovus' 2022 Form 10-K, Synovus holds instruments that may be impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR, which include floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives and hedges, and other financial instruments. Synovus established a cross-functional LIBOR transition working group with representation from all business lines, support and control functions, and legal counsel that has 1) assessed the Company's current exposure to LIBOR indexed instruments and the data, systems, and processes that were impacted and have been changed as a result; 2) established a detailed implementation plan; 3) formulated communications and learning activities to support clients and colleagues; and 4) developed a formal governance structure for the transition. For the last several years, loan agreement provisions for new and renewed loans included LIBOR fallback language to ensure transition from LIBOR when such transition occurs. All direct exposures resulting from existing financial contracts that mature after 2022 have been inventoried and are monitored on an ongoing basis. The Company discontinued the use of LIBOR as of December 31, 2021, with limited exceptions as permitted by regulatory guidance or internal policies. Synovus has expanded its product offerings and currently offers multiple alternative reference rates to clients including SOFR, BSBY, and Prime indices. As of March 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $6 billion in loans tied to LIBOR that mature after June 30, 2023. Remediation activities are underway to modify or transition existing exposures to the applicable Federal Reserve Board selected replacement rate or to convert the rate under existing fallback language, including the use of the Adjustable Interest (LIBOR) Act, enacted in March 2022, and other relevant legislation. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The accounting and financial reporting policies of Synovus are in accordance with GAAP and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. Synovus has identified certain of its accounting policies as &#8220;critical accounting policies,&#8221; consisting of those related to the allowance for credit losses and income taxes. In determining which accounting policies are critical in nature, Synovus has identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates. It is management's practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the Board of Directors' Audit Committee on a periodic basis, including the development, selection, implementation, and disclosure of the critical accounting policies. The application of these policies has a significant impact on Synovus&#8217; unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. Synovus&#8217; financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are used in the application of these policies. All accounting policies described in "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Synovus' 2022 Form 10-K should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance. There have been no significant changes to the accounting policies, estimates, and assumptions, or the judgments affecting the application of these estimates and assumptions from those disclosed in Synovus' 2022 Form 10-K. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The measures entitled adjusted non-interest revenue, adjusted non-interest expense, adjusted revenue, adjusted tangible efficiency ratio, adjusted net income available to common shareholders, adjusted net income per common share, diluted, adjusted return on average assets, adjusted return on average common equity, return on average tangible common equity, adjusted return on average tangible common equity, tangible common equity ratio, and adjusted PPNR are not measures recognized under GAAP and therefore are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The most comparable GAAP measures to these measures are total non-interest revenue, total non-interest expense, total TE revenue, efficiency ratio-TE, net income available to common shareholders, net income per common share, diluted, return on average assets, return on average common equity, the ratio of total shareholders' equity to total assets, and PPNR, respectively. 

Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful additional information about Synovus to assist management and investors in evaluating Synovus&#8217; operating results, financial strength, the performance of its business, and the strength of its capital position. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of operating results or capital position as reported under GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as additional views of the way our financial measures are affected by significant items and other factors, and since they are not required to be uniformly applied, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures at other companies. Adjusted revenue and adjusted non-interest revenue are measures used by management to evaluate total TE revenue and non-interest revenue exclusive of net investment securities gains (losses), and fair value adjustments on non-qualified deferred compensation, and other items not indicative of ongoing operations that could impact period-to-period comparisons. Adjusted non-interest expense and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio are measures utilized by management to measure the success of expense management initiatives focused on reducing recurring controllable operating costs. Adjusted net income available to common shareholders, adjusted net income per common share, diluted, adjusted return on average assets, and adjusted return on average common equity are measurements used by management to evaluate operating results exclusive of items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact period-to-period comparisons. Return on average tangible common equity and adjusted return on average tangible common equity is a measure used by management to compare Synovus' performance with other financial institutions because it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization, thereby allowing management to evaluate the performance of the business consistently. The tangible common equity ratio is used by management to assess the strength of our capital position. Adjusted PPNR is used by management to evaluate PPNR exclusive of items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact period-to-period comparisons. The computations of these measures are set forth in the tables below. 

Management does not provide a reconciliation for forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the occurrence and the financial impact of various items that have not yet occurred, are out of Synovus&#8217; control, or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons, Synovus&#8217; management is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.
