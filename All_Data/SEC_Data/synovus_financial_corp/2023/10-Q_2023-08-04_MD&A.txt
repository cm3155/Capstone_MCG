Economic Environment and Recent Events 

In an effort to achieve its inflation objectives, the Federal Reserve has aggressively tightened monetary policy by significantly raising market interest rates throughout 2022 and 2023, with estimates calling for a FOMC policy rate in the range of 5.25% to 6.00% by the end of 2023. The extent of interest rate increases and the period of time that these higher rates will remain in effect continues to depend on the level of inflation and strength of the labor market. 

Outside of inflation, economic uncertainty and market disruptions remain, including geopolitical tensions from Russia&#8217;s prolonged war in Ukraine, the strained relationship between the U.S. and China, and to a lesser extent, the lingering impact of 

the COVID-19 pandemic on global supply chains, tourism, business travel, immigration, and labor participation. Multiple mixed signals make parsing the way ahead difficult as evidenced by the volatility in capital markets and the wide range regarding economic outlook. 

U.S. fiscal policy has been expansionary in recent years, leaving a significant federal deficit. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signed into law in August 2022, raises federal revenue by imposing an alternative corporate minimum tax if certain thresholds are met and a non-deductible excise tax on corporate share repurchases. The IRA does not have a significant immediate impact on Synovus. 

The bank failures in March and May of 2023 and the subsequent response by both the banking industry and the Federal Reserve served to mitigate the risks of the failures becoming more systemic. However, the residual impacts on the broader economic environment remain uncertain and have generally presented a more challenging outlook for the banking industry. The impact of reactions to the bank failures include a proposed FDIC special assessment, increased regulatory scrutiny, continued pressure on deposits and liquidity, and a generally less sanguine outlook regarding bank profitability going forward. 

Despite the headwinds discussed above and our position in strong Southeastern U.S. growth markets, Synovus believes it is well-positioned to execute on our revised 2023 outlook outlined below by capitalizing on our intentional approach to expand our business, diversify our client base, and stay competitive, all while increasing our investments in innovative solutions to further enhance the client experience and sources of revenue and striking a balance between growth and risk management. 

Executive Summary 

Net income available to common shareholders for the second quarter of 2023 was $165.8 million, or $1.13 per diluted common share, compared to $169.8 million, or $1.16 per diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2022. Net income available to common shareholders for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $359.7 million, or $2.45 per diluted common share, compared to $332.5 million, or $2.27 per diluted common share, for the six months June 30, 2022. The year-over-year changes were largely impacted by higher net interest income from increased interest rates and strong loan growth and higher non-interest expense primarily resulting from investments in our workforce and new business initiatives. Provision for credit losses was also higher compared to the same periods in 2022, driven by changes in forecasted economic factors within the ACL model and increased net charge-offs. 

Net interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $936.3 million, up $118.6 million, or 15%, compared to the same period in 2022. Net interest margin was up 21 bps over the comparable six - month period to 3.32%, due primarily to the benefits of our asset sensitive balance sheet and substantial average loan growth partially offset by continued increases in funding costs. Net interest margin for the second quarter was 3.20%, down 23 bps sequentially, as the asset side of our balance sheet continued to benefit from higher balances and rates, but higher deposit pricing combined with remixing within our non-interest-bearing deposits resulted in margin compression. 

Non-interest revenue for the second quarter of 2023 was $112.3 million, up $15.0 million, or 15%, and year-to-date was $245.4 million, up $42.8 million, or 21%, compared to the same periods in 2022. The primary drivers of the increase in the quarter-to-date comparative periods included higher brokerage revenue and a $7.0 million write-down on a minority fintech investment that impacted earnings on equity method investments in the second quarter of 2022. The primary drivers of the year-to-date increase included higher brokerage revenue, a $13.1 million recovery of a non-performing asset related to Qualpay, higher capital markets income, and the aforementioned $7.0 million write-down on a minority fintech investment. See Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies and Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion on Qualpay. 

Non-interest expense for the second quarter of 2023 was $307.2 million, up $25.1 million, or 9%, and year-to-date was $629.0 million, up $74.5 million, or 13%, compared to the same periods in 2022. The increases were primarily due to investments in and expansion of our workforce and new businesses initiatives, as well as the industry-wide increase in FDIC expense. Year-to-date non-interest expense has also been negatively impacted by a $19.1 million loss associated with third-party consumer loans moved to held for sale, while the comparative period benefited from an $8.3 million reversal of restructuring charges. 

At June 30, 2023, loans, net of deferred fees and costs, of $44.35 billion, increased $637.2 million, from December 31, 2022. Growth in C&#38;I loans has been diversified but tempered by slowing utilization and a strategic decline in syndicated loan-only relationships while CRE loan growth was a function of draws related to existing commitments and low levels of pay-offs. The decline in consumer loans was impacted by a $427.9 million move of third-party consumer loans to held for sale. 

At June 30, 2023, credit metrics included NPAs and NPLs both at 59 bps and total past dues at 19 bps, as a percentage of total loans. Net charge-offs were $26.4 million, or 24 bps annualized, and $44.9 million, or 20 bps annualized, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. The ACL at June 30, 2023 totaled $527.0 million, an increase of $26.1 million from December 31, 2022, and resulted primarily from deterioration in economic factors and increased specific reserves. The ACL to loans coverage ratio at June 30, 2023 of 1.19% increased 4 bps compared to December 31, 2022. 

Total period-end deposits at June 30, 2023 increased $1.21 billion, or 2%, compared to December 31, 2022 and resulted from increased time deposits partially offset by a decline in money market accounts as consumers shifted between these two account types. Brokered deposits also increased as a result of continued proactive management of our balance sheet position. The decrease in non-interest bearing demand deposits was primarily impacted by seasonal cash deployment of excess funds and continued pressures from the rate environment. Average deposit costs of 1.95% for the second quarter of 2023 increased 180 bps from the prior year comparable period primarily due to the impact of the FOMC's rate hikes of 350 bps from June 30, 2022 to June 30, 2023. Deposit costs were impacted by anticipated pricing lags on core interest-bearing deposits as well as the decline in non-interest-bearing demand deposits. 

At June 30, 2023, Synovus' CET1 ratio of 9.86% improved 23 bps compared to December 31, 2022, as our organic earnings profile continues to support capital accretion, which along with a somewhat slower pace of loan growth, was more than sufficient to offset marginal headwinds from the Qualpay acquisition. See Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies for additional discussion on Qualpay. 

More detail on Synovus' financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 may be found in subsequent sections of "Item 2. &#8211; Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Report. See also "Part 1 &#8211; Item 1A. &#8211; Risk Factors" of Synovus' 2022 Form 10-K.

Changes in Financial Condition 

During the six months ended June 30, 2023, total assets increased $924.2 million to $60.66 billion. Total loans increased $637.2 million, with commercial loan growth more than offsetting the $427.9 million move of third-party consumer loans to held for sale. Deposits increased $1.21 billion and resulted from increased time deposits partially offset by a decline in money market accounts as consumers shifted between these two account types. Brokered deposits also increased as a result of continued proactive management of our balance sheet position. The loan to deposit ratio was 88.6% at June 30, 2023 as compared to 89.5% at December 31, 2022. Other short-term borrowings decreased $601.9 million primarily as a result of maturities of short-term FHLB Advances. 

Total Synovus Financial Corp. shareholders' equity at June 30, 2023 increased $306.7 million compared to December 31, 2022, driven by growth in retained earnings, which included net income attributable to Synovus Financial Corp. of $376.3 million partially offset by common and preferred stock dividends of $111.0 million and $16.6 million, respectively. The increase was also driven by a decrease in after-tax net unrealized losses on investment securities available for sale and cash flow hedges of $32.2 million and $14.8 million, respectively. 

Loans

At June 30, 2023, loans, net of deferred fees and costs of $44.35 billion, increased $637.2 million from December 31, 2022. Growth in C&#38;I loans has been diversified but tempered by slowing utilization and a strategic decline in syndicated loan-only relationships while CRE loan growth was a function of draws related to existing commitments and low levels of pay-offs. The decline in consumer loans was impacted by a $427.9 million move of third-party consumer loans to held for sale. 

C&#38;I loans remain the largest component of our loan portfolio, representing 50.8% of total loans, while CRE and consumer loans represent 30.0% and 19.2%, respectively. Our portfolio composition is guided by our strategic growth plan, in conjunction with a comprehensive concentration management policy which sets limits for C&#38;I, CRE, and consumer loan levels as well as sub-categories therein. 

Commercial Loans 

Total commercial loans (which are comprised of C&#38;I and CRE loans) at June 30, 2023 were $35.83 billion, or 80.8% of the total loan portfolio, compared to $34.72 billion, or 79.4%, at December 31, 2022. 

Commercial and Industrial Loans 

The C&#38;I loan portfolio represents the largest category of Synovus' loan portfolio and is primarily comprised of general middle market and commercial banking clients across a diverse set of industries as well as certain specialized lending verticals. The following table shows the composition of the C&#38;I loan portfolio aggregated by NAICS code. In accordance with Synovus' lending policy, each loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process, which incorporates uniform underwriting standards and 

oversight in proportion to the size and complexity of the lending relationship. As of June 30, 2023, 94.8% of Synovus' C&#38;I loans are secured by real estate, business equipment, inventory, and other types of collateral compared to 94.4% as of December 31, 2022. C&#38;I loans at June 30, 2023 grew $464.6 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2022, and resulted from diverse growth across business lines and industries, led by the finance and insurance and healthcare and social assistance industries. C&#38;I loan growth was also impacted by a reduction in same-line utilization as well as strategic decline from syndicated loan-only relationships.

At June 30, 2023, $14.17 billion of C&#38;I loans, or 31.9% of the total loan portfolio, represented loans originated for the purpose of financing commercial, financial and agricultural business activities. The primary source of repayment on these loans is revenue generated from products or services offered by the business or organization. The secondary source of repayment is the collateral, which consists primarily of equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, time deposits, cash surrender value of life insurance, and other business assets. 

At June 30, 2023, $8.36 billion of C&#38;I loans, or 18.9% of the total loan portfolio, represented loans originated for the purpose of financing owner-occupied properties. The financing of owner-occupied facilities is considered a C&#38;I loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral. This treatment is a result of the credit decision process, which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt. The secondary source of repayment on these loans is the underlying real estate. These loans are predominantly secured by owner-occupied and other real estate and, to a lesser extent, other types of collateral. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans 

CRE loans consist primarily of income-producing investment properties loans. Additionally, CRE loans include 1-4 family properties loans as well as land and development loans. Total CRE loans of $13.29 billion increased $643.6 million, or 5%, from December 31, 2022, particularly in the multi-family category, with growth arising from draws related to existing commitments and low levels of pay-off activity. CRE loan balances, specifically investment properties loans, will be impacted by the signing of a purchase and sale agreement in July 2023 to sell approximately $1.3 billion of medical office loans. See Note 11 - Subsequent Events for additional information. 

Investment properties loans consist of construction and mortgage loans for income-producing properties and are primarily made to finance multi-family properties, hotels, office buildings (medical and non-medical), shopping centers, warehouses and other commercial development properties. Total investment properties loans as of June 30, 2023 were $12.27 billion, or 92.3% of the CRE loan portfolio, and increased $626.2 million, or 5%, from December 31, 2022, primarily due to growth in most sub-categories. 

The following table shows the principal categories of the investment properties loan portfolio at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

(1) Loan balance in each category expressed as a percentage of total investment properties loans. 

1-4 Family Properties Loans 

1-4 family properties loans include construction loans to home builders and commercial mortgage loans related to 1-4 family rental properties and are almost always secured by the underlying property being financed by such loans. These properties are primarily located in the markets served by Synovus. At June 30, 2023, 1-4 family properties loans totaled $615.7 million, or 4.6% of the CRE loan portfolio, and decreased slightly from December 31, 2022. 

Land and Development Loans 

Land and development loans include commercial and residential development as well as land acquisition loans and are secured by land held for future development, typically in excess of one year. Properties securing these loans are substantially within markets served by Synovus, and loan terms generally include personal guarantees from the principals. Loans in this portfolio are underwritten based on the LTV of the collateral and the capacity of the guarantor(s). Land and development loans of $407.9 million at June 30, 2023 increased marginally from December 31, 2022. 

Consumer Loans 

The consumer loan portfolio consists of a wide variety of loan products offered through Synovus' banking network, including first and second residential mortgages, home equity and consumer credit card loans, as well as both secured and unsecured loans from third-party lending. As of June 30, 2023, weighted-average FICO scores within the residential real estate portfolio based on committed balances were 776 for consumer mortgages and 794 for home equity, consistent with year-end 2022 scores. 

Consumer loans at June 30, 2023 of $8.53 billion decreased $471.0 million, or 5%, compared to December 31, 2022. Mortgage loans increased $164.8 million from December 31, 2022 largely due to seasonally higher production including our physician product. Other consumer loans decreased $636.8 million from December 31, 2022, primarily due to $427.9 million of third-party consumer loans that moved to held for sale in addition to strategic runoff of the third-party lending portfolio. 

Deposits 

Deposits provide the most significant funding source for interest earning assets. The following table shows the composition of period-end deposits as of the dates indicated. See Table 11 - Quarter-to-Date Net Interest Income and Rate/Volume Analysis 

and Table 12 - Year-to-Date Net Interest Income and Rate/Volume Analysis in this Report for information on average deposits including average rates.

(1) Deposits balance in each category expressed as percentage of total deposits.

(3) Core deposits exclude brokered deposits. 

Total period-end deposits at June 30, 2023 increased $1.21 billion, or 2%, compared to December 31, 2022 and resulted from increased time deposits partially offset by a decline in money market accounts as consumers shifted between these two account types. Brokered deposits also increased as a result of continued proactive management of our balance sheet position. The decrease in non-interest bearing demand deposits was primarily impacted by seasonal cash deployment of excess funds and continued pressures from the rate environment. 

Average deposit costs of 1.95% for the second quarter of 2023, which equate to a cycle-to-date total deposit beta of 37% through the second quarter of 2023, increased 51 bps and 180 bps, from the prior quarter and prior year comparable period, respectively, primarily due to the impact of the FOMC's rate hikes of 25 bps during the second quarter of 2023 and 350 bps from June 30, 2022 to June 30, 2023. Deposit costs and betas were impacted by anticipated pricing lags on core interest-bearing deposits as well as the decline in non-interest-bearing demand deposits. We continue to expect further upward pressure on deposit costs and our expectations for through-the-cycle total deposit betas, which we now believe will end the year in the 46%-48% range. 

As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, $22.75 billion and $23.88 billion, respectively, of our deposit portfolio was uninsured, which represents approximately 45% and 49%, respectively, of total deposits. The uninsured amounts are estimated based on the methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank's regulatory reporting requirements. At June 30, 2023, approximately 87% of our deposits are either insured (55%), collateralized (14%), or could be insured by switching to our insured cash sweep program, which has existing capacity (18%). 

Non-interest Revenue 

Non-interest revenue for the second quarter of 2023 was $112.3 million, up $15.0 million, or 15%, and year-to-date was $245.4 million, up $42.8 million, or 21%, compared to the same periods in 2022. The primary drivers of the increase in the quarter-to-date comparative periods included higher brokerage revenue and a $7.0 million write-down on a minority fintech investment that impacted earnings on equity method investments in the second quarter of 2022. The primary drivers of the year-to-date increase included higher brokerage revenue, a $13.1 million recovery of a non-performing asset related to Qualpay, higher capital markets income, and the aforementioned $7.0 million write-down on a minority fintech investment. See Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies and Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion on Qualpay. 

The following table shows the principal components of non-interest revenue.

(1) Core banking fees consist of service charges on deposit accounts, card fees, and several other non-interest revenue components including letter of credit fees, ATM fee income, line of credit non-usage fees, gains (losses) from sales of SBA loans, and miscellaneous other service charges. 

(2) Consists of fiduciary and asset management, brokerage, and insurance revenue. 

Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 compared to June 30, 2022 

Service charges on deposit accounts, consisting of account analysis fees, NSF fees, and all other service charges remained relatively flat. The largest category of service charges, account analysis fees, increased $720 thousand, or 7%, compared to the second quarter of 2022 and increased $1.3 million, or 7%, on a comparable year-to-date basis. NSF/overdraft fees were down $1.4 million, or 18%, and $1.8 million, or 12%, on a quarter-to-date and year-to-date basis, respectively, compared to the prior year. We expect this downward trend in NSF/overdraft fees to continue. All other service charges on deposit accounts, which consist primarily of monthly fees on consumer demand deposits and small business accounts, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 were up $650 thousand, or 11%, and $920 thousand, or 8%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. 

Fiduciary and asset management fees are derived from providing estate administration, personal trust, corporate trust, corporate bond, investment management, financial planning, and family office services. Fiduciary and asset management fees remained steady despite volatility in the equity markets. 

Card fees consist primarily of credit card interchange fees, debit card interchange fees, and merchant revenue. Card fees are reported net of certain associated expense items, including client loyalty program expenses and network expenses. Merchant revenue relates to the fees that are charged to merchant clients based on a percentage of their credit or debit card transaction volume amounts. Card fees for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 were up primarily due to increased merchant revenue resulting from higher sales transaction volumes and new merchants being added in addition to higher credit card transaction volumes from elevated commercial/small business spend activity and account growth. 

Brokerage revenue consists primarily of brokerage commissions as well as advisory fees earned from the management of client assets. Brokerage revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 increased significantly over the prior year comparable periods, benefiting largely from client activity, including movement into short-term liquidity products such as repurchase agreements due to the rate environment. 

Mortgage banking income, consisting of net gains on loan origination/sales activities, was higher for the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to a favorable change in the mark-to-market partially offset by a $84.2 million, or 37%, decline in loan sales. Mortgage banking income declined on a year-to-date basis primarily as a result of a $180.8 million, or 41%, decrease in loan sales compared to the same period in 2022. Secondary market production was $164.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, a decline of $36.0 million, or 18%, compared to the second quarter of 2022 while year-to-date, it was $269.9 million, a $151.2 million, or 36%, decline compared to the prior year. 

Capital markets income primarily includes fee income from client derivative transactions, as well as fee income from debt capital market transactions and foreign exchange. The decline in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022 primarily resulted from a $2.4 million decrease in fees on client derivative transactions somewhat offset by a $1.6 million increase in loan syndication arranger fees, while the year-to-date increase was driven by $6.2 million higher loan syndication arranger fees and $777 thousand higher fee income from debt capital market transactions. 

Income from BOLI includes increases in the cash surrender value of policies and proceeds from insurance contracts. The decrease for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 primarily related to $2.5 million in proceeds from insurance benefits in the second quarter of 2022. 

The main components of other non-interest revenue are fees for letters of credit and unused lines of credit, safe deposit box fees, access fees for ATM use, other service charges and loan servicing fees, gains (losses) from sales of SBA loans, and other miscellaneous items. The three and six months ended June 30, 2023 comparative period increase was primarily due to the $7.0 million write-down on a minority fintech investment recorded in the second quarter of 2022 and an increase in the fair value of non-qualified deferred compensation plan assets of $4.8 million and $7.5 million, respectively. 

Non-interest Expense 

Non-interest expense for the second quarter of 2023 was $307.2 million, up $25.1 million, or 9%, and year-to-date was $629.0 million, up $74.5 million, or 13%, compared to the same periods in 2022. The increases were primarily due to investments in and expansion of our workforce and new businesses initiatives, as well as the industry-wide increase in FDIC expense. Year-to-date non-interest expense has also been negatively impacted by a $19.1 million loss associated with third-party consumer loans moved to held for sale, while the comparative period benefited from an $8.3 million reversal of restructuring charges. 

The following table summarizes the components of non-interest expense.

Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 compared to June 30, 2022 

Salaries and other personnel expense increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to the impacts of merit and inflationary wage increases, headcount additions, employee healthcare costs, and an increase in the fair value of the non-qualified deferred compensation liability (offset in non-interest revenue). Total headcount of 5,179 was up by 88, or 2%, compared to June 30, 2022 primarily as a result of additions in areas associated with revenue growth and certain critical support functions partially offset by strategic reductions in areas primarily impacted by production volume declines. 

Professional fees were down for the three months ended June 30, 2023 mostly due to lower consulting fees largely related to strategic and infrastructure investments while for the six months ended June 30, 2023, the decrease was mostly due to lower legal fees from credit-related items compared to the same periods in 2022. 

FDIC insurance and other regulatory fees increased significantly for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, largely due to the industry-wide 2 bps increase in the deposit insurance initial base assessment rate that began in the first quarter of 2023. In addition, asset growth contributed to a higher assessment base compared to the prior year periods. On May 22, 2023, the FDIC published its proposed rule to charge certain banks a special assessment to cover losses incurred by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) due to bank failures in March 2023. The rule proposes a special assessment at an annual rate of 12.5 bps on a bank's uninsured deposits balance, in excess of $5 billion, as of December 31, 2022, payable in eight quarterly installments beginning in the first quarter of 2024. If the rule is finalized as proposed, we expect to record an expense and corresponding liability of approximately $47 million upon the enactment date, which is the date the final rule is published in the Federal Register. 

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, Synovus recorded restructuring charges (reversals) including $1.9 million and $3.3 million, respectively, in gains on the sale of branches previously closed, partially offset by $1.7 million and $2.1 million, respectively, of severance. During the three months ended June 30, 2022, Synovus recorded $3.0 million in gains on sales of five closed branches partially offset by restructuring charges associated with additional branch closures. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, Synovus recorded $12.1 million in gains largely relating to the sale of real estate facilities in Columbus, Georgia in addition to gains on sales of closed branches, partially offset by restructuring charges associated with additional branch closures. 

During the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, Synovus recorded valuation adjustments of $3.0 million and $3.5 million, respectively, to the Visa derivative following Visa's announcement to fund $500 million and $600 million, respectively, to its litigation escrow account. 

During the three months ended June 30, 2023, Synovus Bank repurchased $4.6 million of its 5.90% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes of $300 million par value on the open market and incurred a $377 thousand gain on this early extinguishment of debt. On February 10, 2022, Synovus Bank redeemed all of its 2.289% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Senior Bank Notes of $400 million par value and incurred a $677 thousand loss on early extinguishment of debt. 

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, Synovus recorded losses of $2.4 million and $19.1 million, respectively, associated with fair value adjustments on other loans held for sale due to the transfer of third-party consumer loans to held for sale. See Note 3 - Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses for further discussion. 

Other operating expense includes advertising, travel, insurance, network and communication, other taxes, subscriptions and dues, other loan and ORE expense, postage and freight, training, business development, supplies, donations, and other miscellaneous expense. Other operating expense was down for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 largely due to decreased loan expense from lower production. Year-to-date other operating expense was also impacted by the reversal of a $2.7 million impairment charge related to Qualpay recorded in the first quarter of 2023. 

Income Tax Expense 

Income tax expense was $47.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared to $49.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022, representing effective tax rates of 21.6% and 21.9%, respectively. Income tax expense was $105.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to income tax expense of $92.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, representing effective tax rates of 21.9% and 21.0%, respectively. The effective tax rate was higher for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in net discrete tax benefits, including share-based compensation and changes in other tax reserves, compared to the prior period, partly offset by an increase in benefits from tax credit investments. 

CREDIT QUALITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 

Credit Quality 

Synovus diligently monitors the quality of its loan portfolio by industry, property type, and geography through a thorough portfolio review process and our analytical risk management tools. At June 30, 2023, credit metrics included NPAs and NPLs both at 59 bps and total past dues at 19 bps, as a percentage of total loans. Net charge-offs were $26.4 million, or 24 bps annualized, and $44.9 million, or 20 bps annualized, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, and included $1.3 million and $7.9 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, related to the third-party consumer loans moved to held for sale. As we look to the second half of 2023, we expect a net charge-off ratio range of 30-40 bps, which would result in a 2023 net charge-off ratio range of 25-30 bps. 

The table below includes selected credit quality metrics.

Non-performing Assets 

Total NPAs were $261.5 million at June 30, 2023, a $118.1 million, or 82%, increase from December 31, 2022 primarily due to the designation of several large commercial relationships as non-performing, which are reserved and collateralized. Our analysis of these new non-performing relationships does not suggest a pattern of systemic risk within specific industries or geographies. 

Criticized and Classified Loans 

Our loan ratings are aligned to federal banking regulators' definitions of pass and criticized categories, which include special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss. Substandard accruing and non-accruing loans, doubtful, and loss loans are often collectively referred to as classified. Special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss loans are often collectively referred to as criticized and classified loans. The following table presents a summary of criticized and classified loans. Criticized and classified loans at June 30, 2023 were 3.0% of total loans, or $1.33 billion, up $390.6 million as compared to 2.2% of total loans, or $942.1 million, at December 31, 2022, primarily due to the migration of several commercial credits.

Provision for (Reversal of) Credit Losses and Allowance for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses was $38.9 million and $71.0 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to a provision of $12.7 million and $24.1 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022. The increases were predominantly driven by changes in forecasted economic factors within the ACL model and increased net charge-offs. Net charge offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 were $26.4 million and $44.9 million, respectively, as compared to $16.6 million and $35.2 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022. 

The ALL of $471.2 million and the reserve for unfunded commitments of $55.7 million, which is recorded in other liabilities, comprise the total ACL of $527.0 million at June 30, 2023. The ACL increased $26.1 million compared to the December 31, 2022 ACL of $500.9 million, which consisted of an ALL of $443.4 million and the reserve for unfunded commitments of $57.5 million. The ACL to loans coverage ratio of 1.19% at June 30, 2023 increased 4 bps as compared to December 31, 2022. The increase in the ACL from December 31, 2022 resulted primarily from deterioration in economic factors and increased specific reserves. 

Capital Resources 

Synovus and Synovus Bank are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by our primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve. Synovus and Synovus Bank measure capital adequacy using the standardized approach under Basel III. At June 30, 2023, Synovus and Synovus Bank's capital levels remained strong and exceeded well-capitalized 

requirements currently in effect. The following table presents certain ratios used to measure Synovus and Synovus Bank's capitalization. 

Table 10 - Capital Ratios (dollars in thousands) June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 CET1 capital Synovus Financial Corp. $ 5,133,546 &#160; $ 4,926,194 Synovus Bank 5,632,300 &#160; 5,446,703 Tier 1 risk-based capital Synovus Financial Corp. 5,670,691 &#160; 5,463,339 Synovus Bank 5,632,300 &#160; 5,446,703 Total risk-based capital Synovus Financial Corp. 6,664,033 &#160; 6,415,681 Synovus Bank 6,308,581 &#160; 6,079,152 CET1 capital ratio Synovus Financial Corp. 9.86 &#160; % 9.63 % Synovus Bank 10.83 &#160; 10.66 Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio Synovus Financial Corp. 10.89 &#160; 10.68 Synovus Bank 10.83 &#160; 10.66 Total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets ratio Synovus Financial Corp. 12.80 &#160; 12.54 Synovus Bank 12.13 &#160; 11.89 Leverage ratio Synovus Financial Corp. 9.23 &#160; 9.07 Synovus Bank 9.17 &#160; 9.06 

At June 30, 2023, Synovus' CET1 ratio of 9.86% improved 23 bps compared to December 31, 2022, as our organic earnings profile continues to support capital accretion, which along with a somewhat slower pace of loan growth, was more than sufficient to offset marginal headwinds from the Qualpay acquisition. See Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies for additional discussion on Qualpay. As we look ahead, we remain focused on eclipsing the 10% CET1 ratio threshold, at which time we intend to re-assess the broader macro-economic environment and consider what actions, if any, may be prudent as we diligently manage our capital position. For additional information on regulatory capital requirements, see "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10 - Regulatory Capital" to the consolidated financial statements of Synovus' 2022 Form 10-K. Management reviews the Company's capital position on an on-going basis and believes, based on internal capital analyses and earnings projections, that Synovus is well positioned to meet relevant regulatory capital standards. 

On January 18, 2023, Synovus announced that its Board of Directors approved a capital plan that included a $0.04 increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.38 per share, beginning with the quarterly dividend payable in April 2023, and authorized share repurchases of up to $300 million in 2023. Synovus has not repurchased any shares in the first or second quarters of 2023, and in light of the uncertain economic environment, in the near-term, we will continue to focus on retaining and growing capital. 

On August 26, 2020, the federal banking regulators issued a final rule that allowed electing banking organizations that adopted CECL during 2020 to mitigate the estimated effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year phase-in transition period. Synovus adopted CECL on January 1, 2020 and the June 30, 2023 regulatory capital ratios reflect Synovus' election of the five-year transition provision. At June 30, 2023, $29.2 million, or a cumulative 6 bps benefit to CET1, was deferred. 

Dividends 

Synovus has historically paid a quarterly cash dividend to the holders of its common stock. Management and the Board of Directors closely monitor current and projected capital levels, liquidity (including dividends from subsidiaries), financial markets and other economic trends, as well as regulatory requirements regarding the payment of dividends. 

Synovus' ability to pay dividends on its common stock and preferred stock is primarily dependent upon dividends and distributions that it receives from its bank and non-banking subsidiaries, which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities. 

Synovus declared common stock dividends of $111.0 million, or $0.76 per common share, for the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to $98.9 million, or $0.68 per common share, for the six months ended June 30, 2022. In addition, Synovus declared dividends on its preferred stock of $16.6 million during both the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. 

Liquidity 

Liquidity represents the extent to which Synovus has readily available sources of funding to meet the needs of depositors, borrowers and creditors, to support asset growth, and to otherwise sustain operations of Synovus and its subsidiaries, at a reasonable cost, on a timely basis, and without adverse consequences. ALCO monitors Synovus' economic, competitive, and regulatory environment and is responsible for measuring, monitoring, and reporting on liquidity and funding risk as well as market risk. 

In accordance with Synovus policies and regulatory guidance, ALCO evaluates contractual and anticipated cash flows under normal and stressed conditions to properly manage the Company&#8217;s liquidity profile. Synovus places an emphasis on maintaining numerous sources of current and contingent liquidity to meet its obligations to depositors, borrowers, and creditors on a timely basis. Liquidity is generated through various sources, including, but not limited to, maturities and repayments of loans by clients, maturities and sales of investment securities, and growth in core and wholesale deposits. 

Synovus Bank also generates liquidity through the issuance of brokered certificates of deposit and money market accounts. Synovus Bank accesses funds from a broad geographic base to diversify its sources of funding and liquidity. Synovus Bank also has the capacity to access funding through its membership in the FHLB system and through the Federal Reserve discount window. Management continuously monitors and maintains appropriate levels of liquidity so as to provide adequate funding sources to manage client deposit withdrawals, loan requests, and other funding demands. 

Synovus has maintained stable core deposit balances as compared to December 31, 2022. Time deposits increased $2.57 billion, partially offset by a $1.68 billion decline in money market accounts as consumers shifted between these two account types. A $1.63 billion decrease in non-interest bearing demand deposits was primarily impacted by seasonal cash deployment of excess funds and continued pressures from the rate environment. Synovus continues to proactively manage its liquidity position, which has included adding brokered deposits, and robust contingent liquidity is maintained across a diverse set of sources which include immediately available funds as well as funds we expect to be available within short notice. Contingent liquidity sources include primary sources such as FHLB borrowing capacity, FRB cash reserves, and third-party consumer loans, which includes our decision to sell loans from this portfolio and strategic runoff, while secondary sources consist of the Federal Reserve discount window, Fed Funds lines, and other sources like the FRB's Bank Term Funding Program. At June 30, 2023, contingent sources of liquidity totaled approximately $26 billion, and based on currently pledged collateral, Synovus Bank had access to FHLB funding of $5.93 billion, subject to FHLB credit policies. 

In addition to bank level liquidity management, Synovus must manage liquidity at the Parent Company level for various operating needs, including the servicing of debt, the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock, payment of general corporate expense, and potential capital infusions into subsidiaries. The primary source of liquidity for Synovus consists of dividends from Synovus Bank, which is governed by certain rules and regulations of the GA DBF and the Federal Reserve Bank. Synovus' ability to receive dividends from Synovus Bank in future periods will depend on a number of factors, including, without limitation, Synovus Bank's future profits, asset quality, liquidity, and overall condition. In addition, both the GA DBF and Federal Reserve Bank may require approval to pay dividends, based on certain regulatory statutes and limitations. 

On February 15, 2023, Synovus Bank issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Bank Notes due 2028, and the Notes will mature on February 15, 2028. The Notes will bear interest at 5.625% per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on each February 15 and August 15, beginning on August 15, 2023. Synovus Bank may not redeem the Notes prior to August 15, 2023. The redemption price for any redemption in whole or in part, at our option, on or after August 15, 2023, and prior to January 15, 2028, is equal to the greater of: (1) (a) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the redemption date (assuming the Notes matured on January 15, 2028) on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 30 basis points less (b) interest accrued to the date of redemption, and (2) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. The redemption price for any redemption after January 15, 2028 is 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. The Notes are not redeemable at the option or election of holders. 

During the second quarter of 2023, Synovus Bank repurchased $4.6 million of its 5.90% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes of $300 million par value on the open market and incurred a $377 thousand gain on early extinguishment of 

debt. The Company may continue to redeem debt as it deems appropriate and as permitted per regulatory approvals if so required and compliance with laws. 

Synovus presently believes that the sources of liquidity discussed above, including existing liquid funds on hand, are sufficient to meet its anticipated funding needs. See "Part II &#8211; Item 1A. Risk Factors - Recent negative developments in the banking industry could adversely affect our current and projected business operations and our financial condition and results of operations" of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 and "Part I &#8211; Item 1A. Risk Factors - Changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market may adversely affect our capital resources, liquidity and financial results " of Synovus' 2022 Form 10-K. Furthermore, Synovus may, from time to time, take advantage of attractive market opportunities to refinance, retire, or repurchase its existing debt, redeem its preferred stock, or strengthen its liquidity or capital position. 

Earning Assets and Sources of Funds 

Average total assets for the six months ended June 30, 2023 increased $3.63 billion, or 6%, as compared to the first six months of 2022. Average earning assets increased $4.01 billion, or 8%, in the first six months of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The increase in average earning assets primarily resulted from a $3.97 billion, or 10%, increase in average total loans, net of unearned income, primarily attributable to growth in commercial loans from draws on existing commitments, increased line utilization, and low levels of pay-offs. 

Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $5.75 billion, or 17%, for the first six months of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities largely resulted from a $3.12 billion increase in brokered deposits, a $2.56 billion increase in long-term debt, a $1.32 billion increase in time deposits, and a $818.7 million increase in other short-term borrowings, partially offset by a $1.76 billion decrease in money market accounts. The increase in brokered deposits, long-term debt and other short-term borrowings, from FHLB advances, was largely due to the ongoing management of our liquidity position which also included the February 2023 issuance of $500.0 million par value 2028 Synovus Bank Senior Notes. The increase in time deposits and decrease in money market accounts were correlated as consumers have shifted between these two account types. Average non-interest-bearing deposits decreased $2.29 billion, or 14%, for the first six months of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to the continued pressures from the rate environment and client deployment of excess funds. 

Net interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $936.3 million, up $118.6 million, or 15%, compared to the same period in 2022. Net interest margin was up 21 bps over the comparable six - month period to 3.32%, due primarily to the benefits of our asset sensitive balance sheet and substantial average loan growth partially offset by continued increases in funding costs. 

On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was down $25.2 million, or 5%, impacted by higher deposit costs. Net interest margin for the second quarter was 3.20%, down 23 bps compared to the first quarter of 2023, as the asset side of our balance sheet continued to benefit from higher balances and rates, but higher deposit pricing combined with remixing within our non-interest-bearing deposits resulted in margin compression. We expect net interest margin in the third quarter of 2023 to continue to contract at a pace similar to or less than that experienced in the second quarter of 2023, followed by some relative stabilization thereafter as deposit pricing lags and non-interest-bearing deposits remixing slows. Against those diminishing headwinds should be the gradual benefit which accrues to the net interest margin from fixed rate repricing, which has a compounding effect and should support the net interest margin through time assuming this higher rate environment remains. 

Net Interest Income and Rate/Volume Analysis 

The following tables set forth the major components of net interest income and the related annualized yields and rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, as well as the variances between the periods caused by changes in interest rates versus changes in volume.

Market Risk Analysis 

Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which Synovus is potentially exposed. Synovus measures the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates through the use of simulation modeling, which incorporates all of Synovus&#8217; earning assets and liabilities. These simulations are used to determine a baseline net interest income projection and the sensitivity of the income profile based on changes in interest rates. These simulations incorporate assumptions and factors, including, but not limited to, changes in market rates, in the size or composition of the balance sheet, and in repricing characteristics as well as client behaviors. This includes estimates for deposit repricing characteristics which, for purposes of the sensitivity estimates provided below, relies upon a constant, through-the-cycle total deposit cost beta of approximately 40% as of the most recently reported period. This process is reviewed and updated on an on-going basis in a manner consistent with Synovus&#8217; ALCO governance framework. 

Synovus has modeled its baseline net interest income forecast assuming a relatively flat interest rate environment, with the federal funds rate at the Federal Reserve&#8217;s targeted range of 5.00% to 5.25% as of June 30, 2023 and the prime rate of 8.25% as of June 30, 2023. Synovus has modeled the impact of an immediate change in market interest rates across the yield curve of 100 and 200 bps to determine the sensitivity of net interest income for the next twelve months. As illustrated in the table below, the net interest income sensitivity derived from this simulation suggests that net interest income is projected to increase by 5.2% and 2.6% if interest rates increased by 200 and 100 bps, respectively. Net interest income is projected to decrease by 2.9% and 6.3% if interest rates decreased by 100 and 200 bps, respectively. 

The following table represents the estimated sensitivity of net interest income at June 30, 2023, with comparable information for December 31, 2022. 

Table 13 - Twelve Month Net Interest Income Sensitivity Estimated % Change in Net Interest Income as Compared to Unchanged Rates (for the next twelve months) Change in Interest Rates (in bps) June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 +200 5.2% 6.4% +100 2.6 3.1 -100 (2.9) (3.5) -200 (6.3) (7.5) 

While all of the above estimates are reflective of the general interest rate sensitivity of Synovus, local market conditions, the realized growth and remixing of the balance sheet, as well as the broader macroeconomic environment could all have a significant impact on both the sensitivity and realized level of net interest income. Additionally, should there be differences between realized deposit betas for a given level of rates as compared to the Company's estimates for through-the-cycle betas, this may also have a significant impact on our reported sensitivity and the realized level of net interest income. 

The net interest income simulation model is the primary tool utilized to evaluate potential interest rate risks over a shorter-term time horizon. Synovus also evaluates potential longer-term interest rate risk through modeling and evaluation of the sensitivity of the Company's EVE. The EVE measurement process estimates the net fair value of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet financial instruments under various interest rate scenarios. Management uses EVE sensitivity analyses as an additional means of measuring interest rate risk and incorporates this form of analysis within its governance and limits framework. 

Synovus is also subject to market risk in certain of its fee income business lines. Financial management services revenue, which include trust, brokerage, and asset management fees, can be affected by risk in the securities markets, primarily the equity securities market. A significant portion of the fees in this unit are determined based upon a percentage of asset values. Weaker securities markets and lower equity values have an adverse impact on the fees generated by these operations. Trading account assets, maintained to facilitate brokerage client activity, are also subject to market risk; however, trading activities are limited and subject to risk policy limits. Additionally, Synovus utilizes various tools to measure and manage price risk in its trading portfolio. 

Mortgage banking income is also subject to market risk. Mortgage loan originations are sensitive to levels of mortgage interest rates and therefore, mortgage banking income can be negatively impacted during a period of rising interest rates as we have experienced in the past year. The extension of commitments to clients to fund mortgage loans also subjects Synovus to market risk. This risk is primarily created by the time periods between making the commitment, closing, and delivering the loan. Synovus seeks to minimize its exposure by utilizing various risk management tools, including forward sales commitments and other hedges. 

Derivative Instruments for Interest Rate Risk Management 

Synovus utilizes derivative instruments to manage its exposure to various types of structural interest rate risks by executing end-user derivative transactions designated as hedges. Hedging relationships may be designated as either a cash flow hedge, which mitigates risk exposure to the variability of future cash flows or other forecasted transactions, or a fair value hedge, which mitigates risk exposure to adverse changes in the fair market value of a fixed rate asset or liability due to changes in market interest rates. 

As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Synovus had $8.90 billion and $5.25 billion, respectively, in notional amounts outstanding of both effective and forward-starting interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedging instruments to hedge its exposure to contractually specified interest rate risk associated with floating rate loans. 

As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Synovus had $3.51 billion and $2.23 billion, respectively, in notional amounts outstanding of receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedging instruments to hedge its exposure to the change in the fair value due to fluctuations in market interest rates for outstanding fixed-rate long-term debt and fixed-rate interest-bearing deposits. 

LIBOR Transition 

On March 5, 2021, the FCA confirmed that all LIBOR settings would either cease to be provided by any administrator or would no longer be representative immediately after June 30, 2023 for all remaining US dollar settings. Consistent with this guidance and that of various U.S. regulatory bodies, Synovus has made a concerted effort to eliminate LIBOR-based exposures in accordance with the June 30, 2023 deadline. This was a multi-faceted effort that included, but was not limited to, discontinuing the use of LIBOR in new business, which Synovus did as of January 1, 2022, as well as amending LIBOR-based contracts for legacy exposures to transition to other acceptable indexes. Through these efforts, we believe that we have remediated our material exposures where possible and/or received guidance on an appropriate transition for those exposures which were at the discretion of third parties. As of June 30, 2023, there was approximately $2.9 billion of loan exposures which were still accruing on LIBOR but which will transition to SOFR upon their next index reset period. Additionally, there are various other exposures, most notably derivatives, which will transition to SOFR upon the next reset period in a manner that is consistent with industry practice. Synovus does not believe that significant further actions will be required as part of the effort to adhere to the industry LIBOR transition. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The accounting and financial reporting policies of Synovus are in accordance with GAAP and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. Synovus has identified certain of its accounting policies as &#8220;critical accounting policies,&#8221; consisting of those related to the allowance for credit losses and income taxes. In determining which accounting policies are critical in nature, Synovus has identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates. It is management's practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the Board of Directors' Audit Committee on a periodic basis, including the development, selection, implementation, and disclosure of the critical accounting policies. The application of these policies has a significant impact on Synovus&#8217; unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. Synovus&#8217; financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are used in the application of these policies. All accounting policies described in "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Synovus' 2022 Form 10-K should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance. There have been no significant changes to the accounting policies, estimates, and assumptions, or the judgments affecting the application of these estimates and assumptions from those disclosed in Synovus' 2022 Form 10-K. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The measures entitled adjusted non-interest revenue, adjusted non-interest expense, adjusted revenue, adjusted tangible efficiency ratio, adjusted net income available to common shareholders, adjusted net income per common share, diluted, adjusted return on average assets, adjusted return on average common equity, return on average tangible common equity, adjusted return on average tangible common equity, and tangible common equity ratio, are not measures recognized under GAAP and therefore are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The most comparable GAAP measures to these measures are total non-interest revenue, total non-interest expense, total revenue, efficiency ratio-TE, net income available to common shareholders, net income per common share, diluted, return on average assets, return on average common equity, and the ratio of total shareholders' equity to total assets, respectively. 

Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful additional information about Synovus to assist management and investors in evaluating Synovus&#8217; operating results, financial strength, the performance of its business, and the strength of its capital position. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations as analytical 

tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of operating results or capital position as reported under GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as additional views of the way our financial measures are affected by significant items and other factors, and since they are not required to be uniformly applied, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures at other companies. Adjusted revenue and adjusted non-interest revenue are measures used by management to evaluate total revenue and non-interest revenue exclusive of net investment securities gains (losses), and fair value adjustments on non-qualified deferred compensation, and other items not indicative of ongoing operations that could impact period-to-period comparisons. Adjusted non-interest expense and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio are measures utilized by management to measure the success of expense management initiatives focused on reducing recurring controllable operating costs. Adjusted net income available to common shareholders, adjusted net income per common share, diluted, adjusted return on average assets, and adjusted return on average common equity are measurements used by management to evaluate operating results exclusive of items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact period-to-period comparisons. Return on average tangible common equity and adjusted return on average tangible common equity is a measure used by management to compare Synovus' performance with other financial institutions because it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization, thereby allowing management to evaluate the performance of the business consistently. The tangible common equity ratio is used by management to assess the strength of our capital position. The computations of these measures are set forth in the tables below. 

Management does not provide a reconciliation for forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the occurrence and the financial impact of various items that have not yet occurred, are out of Synovus&#8217; control, or cannot be reasonably predicted.
