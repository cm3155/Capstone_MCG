 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Executive Summary 

The following financial review provides a discussion of Synovus' financial condition, changes in financial condition, and results of operations as well as a summary of Synovus' critical accounting policies. This section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Report. 

Economic Environment and Recent Events 

The U.S. economy contracted in the first half of 2020, ending the longest expansionary period in U.S. history, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During March 2020, in an effort to lessen the impact of COVID-19 on consumers and businesses, the Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate 1.5 percentage points to 0.00 to 0.25 percent and the U.S. government enacted the CARES Act, the largest economic stimulus package in the nation&#8217;s history. Synovus responded to the pandemic, beginning in March 2020, by supporting our clients, employees, and communities with such measures as remote work capabilities and branch service enhancements, loan payment deferrals, and accelerated investments in several technology initiatives that provided more convenience and a better digital experience as clients adapted to this highly virtual environment. Synovus participated in the PPP and funded approximately 28,000 loans totaling nearly $3.9 billion under the programs available in both 2020 and 2021. 

Additional government spending measures and the availability of vaccines improved consumer confidence and demand, and the economy largely reopened in 2021, leading to a reduction in the unemployment rate and accelerated GDP growth. While 2021 has seen a recovery in the U.S. economy compared to 2020, uncertainty and market disruptions such as additional coronavirus variants, pandemic-related supply chain issues and labor shortages persist. The economic expansion has been met with inflationary pressures that are expected to result in FOMC policy-tightening in 2022, likely including multiple interest rate hikes. With a strong asset-sensitive balance sheet and our position in Southeast markets that have generally avoided prolonged lockdowns, Synovus expects increases in loan demand and interest rates will improve returns going forward. 

Overview of 2021 Financial Results 

Net income available to common shareholders for 2021 was $727.3 million, or $4.90 per diluted common share ($4.95 on an adjusted basis (1) ), compared to $340.5 million, or $2.30 per diluted common share ($2.41 adjusted (1) ), in 2020. The year-over-year increase in adjusted net income per common share was driven by a significant improvement in the economic outlook impacting expected credit losses compared to 2020. 

Net interest income for 2021 was $1.53 billion, up $20.2 million, or 1%, from $1.51 billion in 2020, including $79.2 million in PPP fees during 2021 and $46.0 million in 2020. The net interest margin was 3.01% for 2021, a decrease of 17 bps from 3.18% in 2020, due primarily to the decline in market interest rates in addition to average growth in investment securities available for sale and interest-bearing funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank. 

Non-interest revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $450.1 million, down $56.4 million, or 11%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Gains on sales of investment securities of $78.9 million impacted the year ended December 31, 2020. Adjusted non-interest revenue (1) was $448.0 million, up $27.6 million, or 7%, compared to 2020, due primarily to strong growth in core banking fees, fiduciary and asset management fees, and brokerage revenue, partially offset by the normalization of mortgage banking income. 

Non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1.10 billion, a decrease of $79.7 million, or 7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Goodwill impairment expense of $44.9 million impacted 2020. Adjusted non-interest expense (1) for 2021 decreased $2.4 million, compared to 2020, as higher expense related to Synovus Forward in 2020 allowed us to make strategic and impactful investments in most areas while managing overall expense. The efficiency ratio-TE for 2021 was 55.38% compared to 58.32% in 2020, and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio (1) was 54.29% compared to 55.69% in 2020. 

At December 31, 2021, total loans, net of deferred fees and costs of $39.31 billion, increased $1.06 billion, or 3%, from December 31, 2020. C&#38;I loans grew slightly and were impacted by a $1.79 billion decline in PPP loans primarily from forgiveness. CRE and consumer loans increased $655.8 million and $362.2 million, respectively. CRE loans grew as higher funded production outpaced elevated pay-off activity. Consumer growth was primarily due to purchases of third-party lending loans and was mostly offset by declines in consumer mortgages and HELOCs, a result of excess consumer liquidity and accelerated prepayment activity. 

At December 31, 2021, credit quality metrics remained stable and near historical lows with NPA and NPL ratios of 0.40% and 0.33%, respectively, and total past dues of 0.15%. The ACL at December 31, 2021 totaled $469.5 million, a decrease of $184.0 million compared to December 31, 2020, resulting from an improving overall economic outlook. The ACL to loans coverage ratio was 1.19% at December 31, 2021, a 52 bps decline from December 31, 2020. 

Total period-end deposits were $49.43 billion at December 31, 2021, up $2.74 billion, or 6%, compared to year-end 2020. Core transaction deposits increased $5.13 billion, or 16%, compared to year-end 2020, largely due to various fiscal stimulus efforts including deposits associated with PPP loans. Total deposit costs for 2021 were 16 bps, down 35 bps from 2020, due to repricing and intentional, strategic remixing to reduce higher cost deposits. 

Our CET1 ratio of 9.50% at December 31, 2021 is well in excess of regulatory requirements. The Board recently approved an increase in the current common shareholder dividend by $0.01 to $0.34 per quarter, effective April 2022, and authorized share repurchases of up to $300 million for 2022. Our capital priorities are focused on supporting core client growth and managing the CET1 ratio around our target range of 9.25% to 9.75%.

Critical Accounting Policies 

The accounting and financial reporting policies of Synovus are in accordance with GAAP and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. Synovus has identified certain of its accounting policies as &#8220;critical accounting policies,&#8221; consisting of those related to the accounting for the allowance for credit losses and income taxes. In determining which accounting policies are critical in nature, Synovus has identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates. It is management's practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the Board of Directors' Audit Committee on a periodic basis, including the development, selection, implementation, and disclosure of the critical accounting policies. The application of these policies has a significant impact on Synovus&#8217; consolidated financial statements. Synovus&#8217; financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are applied in the application of these policies. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The ACL is a critical accounting estimate that requires significant judgments and assumptions, which are inherently subjective. The use of different estimates or assumptions could have a significant impact on the provision for credit losses, ACL, financial condition, and results of operations. The economic and business climate in any given industry or market is difficult to gauge and can change rapidly, and the effects of those changes can vary by borrower. 

In accordance with CECL, the ACL, which includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments, represents management's best estimate of expected losses over the life of loans adjusted for prepayments, and over the life of loan commitments expected to fund. Synovus' loans and unfunded loan commitments are grouped based upon the nature of the loan type and the forecasted PD, adjusted for relevant forecasted macroeconomic factors comprising multiple weighted scenarios representing different plausible outcomes, and LGD, to determine the allowance for the majority of our portfolio. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loan, adjusted for expected prepayments and curtailments when appropriate. To the extent the lives of the loans in the portfolio extend beyond the period for which a reasonable and supportable forecast can be made (which is two years for Synovus), the Company reverts, on a straight-line basis back to the historical rates over a one- year period. Life-of-loan loss percentages may also be adjusted, as necessary, for certain quantitative and qualitative factors that in management's judgment are necessary to reflect losses expected in the portfolio. These adjustments address inherent limitations in the quantitative model including uncertainty and limitations, among others. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are individually evaluated on a loan- by- loan basis with specific reserves, if any, recorded as appropriate. Given the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables within an economic forecast, it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the ACL. As a result, when formulating the quantitative estimate management uses a probability-weighted approach that incorporates a baseline forecast, an upside scenario reflecting an accelerated recovery, a downside scenario that reflects adverse economic conditions, and a scenario that assumes consistent slow growth that is less optimistic than the baseline. 

To illustrate a hypothetical sensitivity analysis, management calculated a quantitative allowance using only the downside scenario. This downside scenario includes a severe deterioration in economic conditions compared to our baseline forecast. The downside forecast assumes an increase in unemployment starting in the first quarter of 2022, a decline in consumer confidence, and a rise in bankruptcies as forbearance ends. Consumer spending drops significantly in the first quarter of 2022, and the economy falls into recession with the unemployment rate peaking at 9% compared to the baseline forecast that assumes full employment by the end of 2022. Excluding the impact of qualitative considerations, this sensitivity analysis would result in a hypothetical increase over our reported ACL of approximately $225 million at December 31, 2021. 

The sensitivity analysis result does not represent management&#8217;s view of expected credit losses nor is it intended to estimate future changes in allowance levels for reasons including, but not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; Management uses a weighted approach applied to multiple economic scenarios for its allowance estimation process; 

&#8226; The impact of changes in economic variables are interrelated and nonlinear, therefore the results of the analysis cannot be extrapolated to additional changes in economic variables; 

&#8226; Subsequent changes in the mix of portfolio characteristics could materially impact results; 

&#8226; Potential future government or regulatory intervention could cause results to differ materially from historical relationships between the economic variables and related credit metrics; and 

&#8226; The sensitivity analysis does not account for any quantitative or qualitative adjustments incorporated by management as part of its overall allowance framework to reflect losses expected in the portfolio.

Income taxes 

The calculation of Synovus&#8217; income tax provision is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments in its determination. As part of Synovus&#8217; overall business strategy, management must consider tax laws and regulations that apply to the specific facts and circumstances under consideration. As such, the Company is often required to exercise significant judgment regarding the interpretation of these tax laws and regulations, in which Synovus' anticipated and actual liability could significantly vary based upon the taxing authority&#8217;s interpretation. Specifically, significant estimates in accounting for income taxes relate to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, estimates of the realizability of income tax credits, utilization of NOLs, the determination of taxable income, and the determination of uncertain tax positions and temporary differences between book and tax bases. Adjustments to these items may occur due to modifications in tax rates, newly enacted laws, issuance of tax regulations, resolution of items with taxing authorities, alterations to interpretative statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance that affects the Company&#8217;s tax positions, methods or election s changes, or other facts and circumstances. Management closely monitors tax developments and the potential timing of these changes in order to evaluate the effect they may have on the Company&#8217;s overall tax position and the estimates and judgments used in determining the income tax provision and records adjustments as necessary. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16 - Income Taxes" in this Report for additional details. 

DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Investment Securities Available for Sale 

The investment securities portfolio consists primarily of high-quality liquid debt securities classified as available for sale. The on-going investment philosophy for the securities portfolio focuses on maintaining a readily accessible source of liquidity while also supporting the income and interest rate risk management objectives of the Company. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2 - Investment Securities Available for Sale" in this Report for additional information. 

The average balance of investment securities available for sale increased to $9.60 billion in 2021 from $7.01 billion in 2020, representing 18.8% and 14.6%, respectively, of average interest earning assets. The portfolio earned a taxable-equivalent yield of 1.46% and 2.55% for 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the estimated fair value of investment securities available for sale as a percentage of their amortized cost was 99.3% and 102.1%, respectively, with net unrealized losses of $73.2 million and net unrealized gains of $160.6 million, respectively. The investment securities portfolio had a weighted average duration of 3.7 years at December 31, 2021, compared to 2.5 years at December 31, 2020. 

The calculation of weighted average yields for investment securities available for sale displayed below is based on the amortized cost and effective yields of each security. Maturity information is presented based upon contractual maturity. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

At December 31, 2021, total loans, net of deferred fees and costs, of $39.31 billion, increased $1.06 billion, or 3%, from December 31, 2020. C&#38;I loans grew slightly but were impacted by a $1.79 billion decline in PPP loans primarily from loan forgiveness. CRE loans grew as higher funded production outpaced elevated pay-off activity. Consumer growth was largely due to purchases of third-party lending loans and was mostly offset by declines in consumer mortgages and HELOCs, which were impacted by accelerated prepayment activity due to excess consumer liquidity. We expect loan growth in 2022 to be 4% to 7%, which excludes PPP loans. 

C&#38;I loans remain the largest component of our loan portfolio, representing 49.7% of total loans, while CRE and consumer loans represent 27.9% and 22.4%, respectively. Our portfolio composition is established through a comprehensive concentration management policy which sets limits for C&#38;I, CRE, and consumer loan levels as well as sub-categories therein. 

U.S. Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) 

Synovus participated in the PPP, which is a loan program that originated from the CARES Act and was subsequently expanded by the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, which was signed into law on April 24, 2020. The total balance of all PPP loans, net of unearned fees and costs, was $399.6 million as of December 31, 2021 compared to $2.19 billion as of December 31, 2020. The decline of $1.79 billion, or 82%, from 2020 was largely the result of 2021 activity including $2.87 billion of forgiveness partially offset by $1.05 billion of Phase 2 fundings.

Commercial Loans 

Total commercial loans (which are comprised of C&#38;I and CRE loans) at December 31, 2021 were $30.54 billion, or 77.6%, of the total loan portfolio, compared to $29.85 billion, or 78.0% at December 31, 2020. 

Commercial and Industrial Loans 

The C&#38;I loan portfolio represents the largest category of Synovus' loan portfolio and is primarily comprised of general middle market and commercial banking clients across a diverse set of industries. The following table shows the composition of the C&#38;I loan portfolio aggregated by NAICS industry name and code. In accordance with Synovus' lending policy, each loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process which incorporates uniform underwriting standards and oversight in proportion to the size and complexity of the lending relationship. As of December 31, 2021, 92.7% (94.6% excluding PPP loans) of Synovus' C&#38;I loans are secured by real estate, business equipment, inventory, and other types of collateral compared to 83.2% (93.8% excluding PPP loans) as of December 31, 2020. C&#38;I loans grew $41.0 million from December 31, 2020, as growth from funded loan production, particularly in the finance and insurance and health care and social assistance industries, was mostly offset by a decline in PPP loans.

At December 31, 2021, $12.05 billion of C&#38;I loans, or 30.6% of the total loan portfolio (including PPP loans of $399.6 million net of unearned fees and costs), represented loans for the purpose of financing commercial, financial, and agricultural business activities. The primary source of repayment on these loans is revenue generated from products or services offered by the business or organization. The secondary source of repayment is the collateral, which consists primarily of equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, time deposits, cash surrender value of life insurance, and other business assets. 

At December 31, 2021, $7.51 billion of C&#38;I loans, or 19.1% of the total loan portfolio, represented loans originated for the purpose of financing owner-occupied properties. The financing of owner-occupied facilities is considered a C&#38;I loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral. This treatment is a result of the credit decision process, which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt. The secondary source of repayment on these loans is the underlying real estate. These loans are predominately secured by owner-occupied and other real estate, and to a lesser extent, other types of collateral. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans 

CRE loans primarily consist of income-producing investment properties loans. Additionally, CRE loans include 1-4 family properties loans as well as land and development loans. Total CRE loans of $10.98 billion increased $655.8 million, or 6%, from December 31, 2020 as higher funded loan production was partially offset by elevated pay-off activity. 

Investment Properties Loans 

Investment properties loans consist of construction and mortgage loans for income-producing properties and are primarily made to finance multi-family properties, hotels, office buildings, shopping centers, warehouses and other commercial development properties. Total investment properties loans as of December 31, 2021 were $9.87 billion, or 89.9% of the CRE loan portfolio, and 25.1% of the total loan portfolio, up $765.8 million, or 8%, compared to $9.10 billion, or 88.2% of the CRE loan portfolio, and 23.8% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. All sub-categories experienced growth with the exception of multi-family, which was down by $61.1 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2020. 

The following table shows the principal categories of the investment properties loan portfolio at December 31, 2021 and 2020.

* Loan balance in each category expressed as a percentage of total investment properties loans. 

1-4 Family Properties Loans 

1-4 family properties loans include construction loans to home builders and commercial mortgage loans related to 1-4 family rental properties and are almost always secured by the underlying property being financed by such loans. These properties are primarily located in the markets served by Synovus. At December 31, 2021, 1-4 family properties loans totaled $645.5 million, or 5.9% of the CRE loan portfolio, and increased slightly from December 31, 2020. 

Land and Development Loans 

Land and development loans include commercial and residential development as well as land acquisition loans and are secured by land held for future development, typically in excess of one year. Properties securing these loans are substantially within markets served by Synovus, and loan terms generally include personal guarantees from the principals. Loans in this portfolio are underwritten based on the LTV of the collateral and the capacity of the guarantor(s). Land and development loans of $466.9 million at December 31, 2021 continued to decline from December 31, 2020. 

Consumer Loans 

The consumer loan portfolio consists of a wide variety of loan products offered through Synovus' banking network including first and second residential mortgages, HELOCs, and credit card loans, as well as both secured and unsecured loans from third-party lending. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, weighted average FICO scores within the residential real estate portfolio based on committed balances were 792 and 791 for HELOCs and 777 and 776 for consumer mortgages, respectively . 

Consumer loans at December 31, 2021 increased $362.2 million, or 4%, compared to December 31, 2020. Consumer mortgages and HELOCs both decreased from December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of accelerated prepayment activity and excess consumer liquidity. 

Other consumer loans, which primarily includes third-party lending, increased $1.04 billion from December 31, 2020, led by purchases of $1.62 billion of third-party lending loans partially offset by payment activity. As of December 31, 2021, third-party lending loans had combined balances of $1.64 billion, or 4.2%, of the total loan portfolio, compared to $678.3 million, or 1.8%, of the total loan portfolio, at December 31, 2020. Growth in this portfolio is predicated on overall balance sheet dynamics including capital, liquidity, and client growth. 

The table below shows the maturities of loans, net of deferred fees and costs, as of December 31, 2021. Also provided are the amounts due after one year, classified according to the sensitivity in interest rates. Actual repayments of loans may differ from the contractual maturities reflected therein because borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with and without prepayment penalties. Additionally, the refinancing of such loans or the potential delinquency of such loans could create differences between the contractual maturities and the actual repayment of such loans.

Total period-end deposits were $49.43 billion at December 31, 2021, up $2.74 billion, or 6%, compared to year-end 2020, due largely to client preferences for maintaining liquidity during 2021 as well as various fiscal stimulus efforts which further supported deposit growth, partially offset by strategic declines in time deposits. Core tra nsaction deposits increased $5.13 billion, or 16%, compared to December 31, 2020, with growth in all categories. On an average basis, total deposits of $47.61 billion were up $4.57 billion, or 11%, compared to the prior year. 

As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, $25.91 billion and $23.39 billion, respectively, of our deposit portfolio was uninsured. The uninsured amounts are estimated based on the methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank's regulatory reporting requirements.

Net Interest Income 

The following table summarizes the components of net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, including the tax-equivalent adjustment that is required in making yields on tax-exempt loans and investment securities comparable to taxable loans and investment securities. The taxable-equivalent adjustment is based on a 21% federal income tax rate for the three years shown.

Net interest income (interest income less interest expense) is the largest component of total revenue, representing earnings from the primary business of gathering funds from client deposits and other sources, and investing those funds primarily in loans and fixed-income securities. Synovus&#8217; long-term objective is to manage those assets and liabilities to maximize net interest income while balancing interest rate, credit, liquidity, and capital risks. Net interest income for 2021 was $1.53 billion, up $20.2 million, or 1%, from $1.51 billion in 2020, including $79.2 million in PPP fees during 2021 and $46.0 million during 2020. 

Net Interest Margin 

Net interest margin is a measure of the spread between interest earning assets relative to the cost of funding and can be used to assess the efficiency of earnings from balance sheet activities. The net interest margin is affected by changes in interest earning asset yields, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, the percentage of interest earning assets funded by non-interest-bearing funding sources, and the mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 

The net interest margin was 3.01% for 2021, a decrease of 17 bps from 3.18% in 2020, due primarily to the decline in market interest rates in addition to average growth in investment securities available for sale and interest-bearing funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank. The yield on earning assets decreased 54 bps to 3.24% from 3.78% in 2020, while the effective cost of funds decreased 37 bps to 0.23% from 0.60% in 2020. 

The primary components of the yield on interest earning assets are loan yields, yields on investment securities, and the yield on balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank. Loan yields decreased 21 bps, due primarily to the decline in market interest rates, and yields on investment securities decreased 109 bps, due primarily to an acceleration in prepayments and related increase in premium amortization, compared to 2020. Earning asset yields were also negatively impacted by the increase in cash balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank as compared to the prior year. 

The decline in the effective cost of funds during 2021 was primarily driven by declines in market interest rates and liability remixing. 

Earning Assets and Sources of Funds 

Average total assets for 2021 increased $3.23 billion, or 6%, to $55.37 billion as compared to average total assets of $52.14 billion for 2020. Average interest earning assets increased $3.28 billion, or 7%, in 2021 as compared to the prior year and represented 92.4% of average total assets for 2021, as compared to 91.8% in 2020. The increase in average earning assets resulted primarily from a $2.60 billion increase in average investment securities available for sale, a $1.44 billion increase in average interest-bearing funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank, and a $302.5 million increase in average loans held for sale. The increases, which were largely due to excess liquidity from an influx of deposits, were partially offset by a $944.5 million, or 2%, decrease in average total loans, net of deferred fees and costs, which was impacted by reduced loan demand and also included a decrease of $338.8 million in PPP loans. 

Average interest-bearing liabilities for 2021 of $33.72 billion decreased $402.4 million, or 1%, from $34.12 billion in 2020. The decrease in average interest-bearing liabilities resulted from a $3.08 billion, or 39%, decrease in average time deposits as a result of continued strategic run-off of these higher cost deposits, a $1.12 billion, or 48%, decrease in average long-term debt, which includes redemption of $250.0 million in subordinated debt in the fourth quarter of 2020, and a $492.7 million decrease in other short-term borrowings. These decreases were mostly offset by a $2.81 billion, or 19%, increase in average money market deposits and a $1.19 billion, or 16%, increase in average interest-bearing demand deposits. These increases, along with an increase of $3.38 billion, or 28%, in average non-interest bearing demand deposits compared to 2020, were largely due to liquidity associated with various stimulus efforts and monetary policy.

Non-interest Revenue 

Non-interest revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $450.1 million, down $56.4 million, or 11%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Gains on sales of investment securities of $78.9 million impacted the year ended December 31, 2020. Adjusted non-interest revenue (1) was $448.0 million, up $27.6 million, or 7%, compared to 2020, due primarily to strong growth in core banking fees, fiduciary and asset management fees, and brokerage revenue, partially offset by the normalization of mortgage banking income. In 2022, we expect continued growth in strategic fee categories including core banking fees and wealth management, with an industry-wide reduction in secondary mortgage revenue muting overall fee income growth.

The following table shows the principal components of non-interest revenue.

(1) Service charges on deposit accounts, card fees, and other non-interest revenue components including letter of credit fees, ATM fees income, line of credit non-usage fees, gains from sales of government guaranteed loans, and miscellaneous other service charges. 

Service charges on deposit accounts for 2021 , which consist of account analysis fees, NSF fees, and all other service charges, increased primarily due to higher account analysis fees, which were up $9.9 million, or 34%, following our pricing for value Synovus Forward initiative implemented during the first quarter of 202 1. NSF fees for 2021 and 2020 comprised 31% and 36%, respectively, of service charges on deposit accounts and 6% and 5%, respectively, of total non-interest revenue. All other service charges on deposit accounts, which consist primarily of monthly fees on consumer demand deposits, savings accounts, and small business accounts, were $21.3 million for 2021, up $3.1 million, or 17%, compared to 2020. 

Fiduciary and asset management fees are derived from providing estate administration, personal trust, corporate trust, corporate bond, investment management, financial planning, and family office services. The increase in fiduciary and asset management fees for 2021 was driven by growth in total assets under management, which increased 9% from 2020 , to $22.00 billion at December 31, 2021. Assets under management consist of all assets where Synovus has investment authority. 

Card fees consist primarily of credit card interchange fees, debit card interchange fees, and merchant discounts. Card fees are reported net of certain associated expense items including client loyalty program expense and network expense. The increase in 2021 from 2020 resulted from increased transaction volume in all card fee categories. 

Brokerage revenue consists primarily of brokerage commissions as well as advisory fees earned from the management of client assets. The increase in 2021 over 2020 was largely driven by a 32% growth in assets under management and higher transaction revenue from favorable market conditions. 

Mortgage banking income, consisting of net gains on loan origination/sales activities, was significantly lower compared to 2020, driven largely by a decline in secondary market revenue in addition to lower secondary market mortgage loan production. Secondary market revenue decreased $24.6 million, or 37%, primarily due to a lower pipeline and margin compression. Loan sales of $1.69 billion declined $421.1 million, or 20%. Total secondary market mortgage loan production was $1.60 billion in 2021, a decrease of $622.8 million, or 28%, compared to 2020. 

Capital markets income primarily includes fee income from client derivative transactions. Additionally, capital markets income includes fee income from capital raising investment banking transactions and foreign exchange as well as other 

miscellaneous income from capital market transactions. The decrease for 2021 was primarily a result of a $4.0 million decrease in fees on client derivative transactions as commercial client activity to lock in lower rates was elevated in 2020, partially offset by a $2.4 million increase in loan syndication arranger fees. 

Income from BOLI, includes increases in the cash surrender value of policies and proceeds from insurance benefits. The increase in 2021 was driven by a $7.1 million increase in proceeds from insurance benefits. 

Investment securities losses, net, of $799 thousand, reflected strategic sales of mortgage-backed securities during 2021. Investment securities gains, net, of $78.9 million for 2020 reflected strategic repositioning of the portfolio primarily during the latter part of the second quarter of 2020 to respond to the impact of market rate declines. 

The main components of other non-interest revenue are fees for letters of credit and unused lines of credit, safe deposit box fees, access fees for ATM use, other service charges and loan servicing fees, income from insurance commissions, gains from sales of GGL/SBA loans, and other miscellaneous items. 2021 included a $6.3 million increase in income related to tax credit investments primarily due to a $6.1 million increase in favorable valuation adjustments for solar energy tax credit partnerships, a $3.5 million increase in other service charges primarily from higher unused line of credit fees, and a $2.1 million increase in insurance revenue. 2020 included $4.5 million in realized gains on the sale of positions in two publicly-traded equity investments, a gain of $2.5 million from the sale of non-relationship mortgage loans, and a sale-leaseback gain of $2.4 million associated with a bank office property. 

Non-interest Expense 

Non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1.10 billion, a decrease of $79.7 million, or 7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Goodwill impairment expense of $44.9 million impacted 2020. Adjusted non-interest expense (1) for 2021 decreased $2.4 million compared to 2020 as higher expense related to Synovus Forward in 2020 allowed us to make strategic and impactful investments in most areas while managing overall expense. The efficiency ratio-TE for 2021 was 55.38% compared to 58.32% in 2020, and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio (1) was 54.29% compared to 55.69% in 2020.

Salaries and other personnel expense increased compared to 2020, due primarily to an increase in incentive accruals due to higher than expected performance, higher employee insurance from increased claims, and higher share-based compensation expense largely due to timing with a higher level of retirement eligible expense acceleration, partially offset by lower mortgage production-based commissions and lower salary expense. Synovus employees totaled 4,988, down 259, or 5%, from December 31, 2020, led by Synovus' voluntary early retirement program offered during the latter part of 2020 and branch closures. 

Net occupancy, equipment, and software expense decreased compared to 2020, driven primarily by savings from branch closures, mostly offset by continued investments in technology, including enhanced online deposit account origination, an integrated receivable solution, and our commercial banking digital platforms. Synovus Bank's branch network consisted of 281 and 289 branches at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We expect to close an additional 15% of our branch locations with an estimated run rate savings of approximately $12 million by the end of 2022. 

Third-party processing and other services expense includes all third-party core operating system and processing charges as well as third-party loan servicing charges. Third-party processing expense decreased compared to 2020 primarily due to Synovus' restructure during the second quarter of 2020 of certain of its third-party consumer-based lending partnership arrangements with a shift of new originations to held for sale, mostly offset by expense associated with PPP loan forgiveness and higher information-technology related expense. 

Professional fees decreased compared to 2020, from decreases in consulting fees related to Synovus Forward. 

FDIC insurance and other regulatory fees decreased compared to 2020, reflecting lower assessment rate primarily due to overall elevated liquidity and subordinated debt issued by Synovus Bank in the fourth quarter of 2020. 

During the third quarter of 2020, Synovus recognized a $44.9 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge representing the goodwill allocated to the Consumer Mortgage reporting unit resulting from a combination of factors including the extended duration of lower market valuations, high volumes in refinance activity that have reduced mortgage yields, and the clarity around longer term policy actions designed to keep interest rates low. 

As part of its Synovus Forward initiative, during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, S ynovus recorded restructuring charges of $7.2 million and $27.0 million, respectively, which included $2.3 million and $15.6 million, respectively, of severance charges. In 2020, severance charges included $13.7 million in one-time termination benefits associated with the aforementioned voluntary early retirement program. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Synovus also recorded $4.6 million and $10.5 million, respectively, in lease termination charges and asset impairment charges related to branch closures and restructuring of corporate real estate. Asset impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2021 were net of $5.4 million in gains on sales of certain building and branch locations. Synovus Bank operated 281 branches at December 31, 2021, compared to 289 branches at December 31, 2020, following the closing of 11 branches and opening of 3 new branches during 2021. 

During 2020, Synovus utilized excess liquidity and debt proceeds from debt issued by Synovus Bank in 2020 and terminated $1.13 billion in long-term FHLB obligations and redeemed $250.0 million in subordinated notes, incurring $10.5 million in losses on early extinguishment of debt. 

Earnout liability fair value adjustments in 2020 associated with the Global One acquisition were the result of higher than projected earnings and higher earnings estimates over the remaining contractual earnout period, reflecting the continued success of the Global One enterprise. The earnout period ended on June 30, 2021, and the final earnout payment occurred during the third quarter of 2021. 

Other operating expense includes advertising, travel, insurance, network and communication, other taxes, subscriptions and dues, other loan and ORE expense, postage and freight, training, business development, supplies, donations, and other miscellaneous expense. Period over period fluctuations are primarily related to certain expenses or losses not expected to recur rather than changes in trends. Other operating expense for 2021 included a $4.0 million seed gift into a newly established donor advised fund. Other operating expense for 2020 included a $2.7 million valuation adjustment on a MPS receivable and a $2.5 million charge from termination of client swaps. 

Income Taxes 

Income tax expense was $228.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $111.0 million and $201.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was 23.1%, 22.9% and 26.3%, respectively. 

Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. At December 31, 2021, net deferred tax assets were $169.1 million compared to $130.8 million at December 31, 2020. 

Synovus regularly assesses the realizability of its net deferred tax assets based upon all available evidence, both positive and negative. Based upon the assessment, Synovus has established a valuation allowance of $19.0 million at December 31, 2021 and $19.2 million at December 31, 2020, on the portion of its $23.9 million at December 31, 2021 and $29.7 million at December 31, 2020 of federal and state NOLs that are not expected to be utilized prior to expiration in years 2023 through 2034. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16 - Income Taxes" of this Report for additional discussion regarding deferred income taxes. 

Credit Quality 

Synovus continuously monitors the quality of its loan portfolio by industry, property type, geography, as well as credit quality metrics. At December 31, 2021, credit quality metrics remained stable and near historical lows with NPA and NPL ratios of 0.40% and 0.33%, respectively, and total past dues of 0.15%, as a percentage of loans. Net charge-offs for 2021 remained low at $77.8 million, or 0.20%, of average loans.

Non-performing Assets 

Total NPAs were $158.2 million at December 31, 2021, a $33.9 million, or 18%, decrease from December 31, 2020. Total NPAs as a percentage of total loans, other loans held for sale, ORE and specific other assets declined 10 bps to 0.40% at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020. NPLs were $131.0 million at December 31, 2021, a $20.0 million, or 13%, decrease from December 31, 2020 primarily due to a 35% reduction in NPL inflows and a 57% increase in disposition volume compared to 2020.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

At December 31, 2021, TDRs (accruing and non-accruing) were $142.1 million, a decrease of $31.9 million, or 18%, compared to December 31, 2020. Accruing TDRs were $119.8 million at December 31, 2021, a decrease of $15.2 million, or 11%, compared to December 31, 2020. Non-accruing TDRs of $22.3 million at December 31, 2021 decreased $16.7 million, or 43%, from December 31, 2020. 

Accruing TDRs are considered performing because they are performing in accordance with the restructured terms. At December 31, 2021 approximately 98% of accruing TDRs were current compared to 99% at December 31, 2020 . In addition, subsequent defaults on accruing TDRs (defaults defined as the earlier of the TDR being placed on non-accrual status or reaching 90 days past due with respect to principal and/or interest payments within twelve months of the TDR designation) have continued to remain at lower levels with eight defaults with a recorded investment of $978 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to seven defaults with a recorded investment of $21.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Non-TDR Modifications due to COVID-19 

Regulatory agencies have encouraged financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of COVID-19. In the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (initially issued on March 22, 2020 and revised on April 7, 2020), for example, the regulatory agencies expressed their view of loan modification programs as positive actions that may mitigate adverse effects on borrowers due to COVID-19 and their unwillingness to criticize institutions for working with borrowers in a safe and sound manner. Moreover, the Interagency Statement provided that eligible loan modifications related to COVID-19 may be accounted for under section 4013 of the CARES Act or in accordance with ASC 310-40. On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 extended the applicable period of Section 4013 of the CARES Act. This extension allows banks to elect to not consider loan modifications related to COVID-19 that are made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of January 1, 2022, or 60 days after the national emergency ends to borrowers that are current (i.e. less than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019) as TDRs. The regulatory agencies further stated that performing loans granted payment deferrals due to COVID-19 are not considered past due or non-accrual. FASB confirmed the foregoing regulatory agencies' view, that such short-term modifications (e.g., six months) made on a good-faith basis in response to COVID-19 for borrowers who are current are not TDRs. 

During 2020, Synovus provided relief programs consisting primarily of 90-day payment deferral relief to borrowers negatively impacted by COVID-19, and as of December 31, 2021, no loans were in a P&#38;I deferral status as compared to 0.3% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. In addition to our P&#38;I deferment program, under the CARES Act, we have also provided borrowers who have been impacted by COVID-19 with other modifications such as interest-only relief or amortization extensions on approximately 2% of total loans at both December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Past Due Loans 

As a percentage of loans outstanding, loans 30 or more days past due and still accruing interest were 0.15% and 0.12% at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As a percentage of loans outstanding, loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest were 0.02% and 0.01% at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. These loans are in the process of collection, and management believes that sufficient collateral value securing these loans exists to cover contractual interest and principal payments. 

Criticized and Classified Loans 

Our loan ratings are aligned to federal banking regulators' definitions of pass and criticized categories, which include special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss. Substandard accruing and non-accruing loans, doubtful, and loss loans are often collectively referred to as classified. Special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss loans are often collectively referred to as criticized and classified loans. The following table presents a summary of criticized and classified loans. Criticized and classified loans at December 31, 2021 declined $539.0 million, or 34%, compared to December 31, 2020 primarily due to upgrades in the hotel industry as a result of improved financial performance after being negatively impacted by COVID-19.

Potential Problem Loans 

Potential problem loans are defined by management as certain performing loans with a well-defined weakness where there is information about possible credit problems of borrowers which causes management to have doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present repayment terms of such loans. Potential problem commercial loans were $323.9 million and $374.2 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and consist of substandard accruing loans (included in criticized and classified loans) but exclude both loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest and substandard accruing TDRs, which are reported separately. Management&#8217;s current expectation of losses from potential problem loans is included in the ACL, and management cannot predict at this time whether these potential problem loans ultimately will become NPLs or result in losses.

Net Charge-offs 

Total 2021 net charge-offs were $77.8 million, or 0.20%, of average loans, compared to total net charge-offs of $94.7 million, or 0.24% of average loans in 2020. The following table shows net charge-offs (recoveries) for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Provision for (reversal of) Credit Losses and Allowance for Credit Losses 

The reversal of provision for credit losses of $106.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, included net charge-offs of $77.8 million and resulted primarily from the continued improvement in the credit outlook for the loan portfolio. The reversal of provision for credit losses is due to the reduction in the overall ACL as well as a reduction of $16.9 million in net charge offs compared to 2020. The change in reserves is due to the notable improvement in the economic environment compared to December 31, 2020 as evidenced by the improvement in the unemployment rate from 6.7% at the end of 2020 to 3.9% at December 31, 2021. Likewise, our economic and credit outlook have progressed substantially compared to 2020. The factors reducing the ACL were partially offset by purchases of $1.62 billion of third-party lending loans as well as net organic loan growth in 2021, requiring additional reserves of $38.6 million. 

The ALL of $427.6 million and the reserve for unfunded commitments of $41.9 million, which is recorded in other liabilities, comprise the total ACL of $469.5 million at December 31, 2021. The ACL decreased $184.0 million compared to the December 31, 2020 ACL of $653.5 million, which consisted of an ALL of $605.7 million and the reserve for unfunded commitments of $47.8 million. The ACL to loans coverage ratio of 1.19% at December 31, 2021 was 52 bps lower compared to December 31, 2020. The reduction in the overall ACL is due to the notable improvement in the economic environment compared to December 31, 2020.

Capital Resources 

Synovus and Synovus Bank are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by our primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve. Synovus and Synovus Bank measure capital adequacy using the standardized approach under Basel III. At December 31, 2021, Synovus and Synovus Bank's capital levels remained strong and exceeded well-capitalized requirements currently in effect. The following table presents certain ratios used to measure Synovus and Synovus Bank's capitalization.

(1) See "Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measures" of this Report for applicable reconciliation to GAAP measure. 

At December 31, 2021, Synovus' CET1 ratio was 9.50%, well in excess of regulatory requirements including the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%. The December 31, 2021 CET1 ratio declined 16 bps compared to December 31, 2020, driven by growth in risk-weighted assets and the return of capital through share repurchases and common stock shareholder dividends as a result of strong financial performance. For more information on regulatory capital requirements, see "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10 - Regulatory Capital" in this Report. Management reviews the Company's capital position on an on-going basis and believes, based on internal capital analyses and earnings projections, that Synovus is well positioned to meet relevant regulatory capital standards. 

On January 20, 2022, Synovus announced that its Board of Directors approved a $0.01 increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.34 per share, effective with the quarterly dividend payable in April 2022. Additionally, Synovus' Board of Directors authorized share repurchases of up to $300 million in 2022. 

On August 26, 2020, the federal banking regulators issued a final rule (following an interim final rule issued on March 27, 2020) that allowed electing banking organizations that adopted CECL during 2020 to mitigate the estimated effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year phase-in transition period. Synovus adopted CECL on January 1, 2020 and the December 31, 2021 regulatory capital ratios reflect Synovus' election of the five-year transition provision. At December 31, 2021, $58.3 million, or a cumulative 13 bps benefit to CET1, was deferred. For additional information on CECL, see "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in this Report. 

Parent Company 

The Parent Company&#8217;s net assets consist primarily of its investment in Synovus Bank. The P arent Company&#8217;s primary uses of cash are for the servicing of debt, payment of dividends to shareholders, and repurchases of common stock. The Parent Company also provides the necessary funds to strengthen the capital of its subsidiaries if needed. These uses of cash are primarily funded by dividends from Synovus Bank, borrowings from external sources, and equity offerings. 

During 2021, Synovus Bank and non-bank subsidiaries paid upstream cash dividends to th e Parent Company totaling $420.0 million. D uring 2020, Synovus Bank paid upstream cash dividends to the Parent Company totaling $547.5 million and during 2019, Synovus Bank and non-bank subsidiaries paid upstream cash dividends to the Parent Company totaling $400.0 million. 

Liquidity 

Liquidity represents the extent to which Synovus has readily available sources of funding to meet the needs of depositors, borrowers and creditors, to support asset growth, and to otherwise sustain operations of Synovus and its subsidiaries, at a reasonable cost, on a timely basis, and without adverse consequences. ALCO monitors Synovus' economic, competitive, and regulatory environment and is responsible for measuring, monitoring, and reporting on liquidity and funding risk as well as market risk. 

In accordance with Synovus policies and regulatory guidance, ALCO evaluates contractual and anticipated cash flows under normal and stressed conditions to properly manage the Company's liquidity profile. Synovus places an emphasis on maintaining numerous sources of current and contingent liquidity to meet its obligations to depositors, borrowers, and creditors on a timely basis. Liquidity is generated through various sources, including, but not limited to, maturities and repayments of loans by clients, maturities and sales of investment securities, and growth in core and wholesale deposits. 

Synovus Bank also generates liquidity through the issuance of brokered certificates of deposit and money market accounts. Synovus Bank accesses these funds from a broad geographic base to diversify its sources of funding and liquidity. Synovus Bank also has the capacity to access funding through its membership in the FHLB system and through the Federal Reserve discount window. At December 31, 2021, based on currently pledged collateral, Synovus Bank had access to FHLB funding of $5.96 billion, subject to FHLB credit policies. Management continuously monitors and maintains appropriate levels of liquidity so as to provide adequate funding sources to manage client deposit withdrawals, loan requests, and other funding demands. 

In addition to bank level liquidity management, Synovus must manage liquidity at the parent company level for various operating needs including the servicing of debt, the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock, share repurchases, payment of general corporate expense, and potential capital infusions into subsidiaries. The primary source of liquidity for Synovus consists of dividends from Synovus Bank, which is governed by certain rules and regulations of the GA DBF and the Federal Reserve Bank. Synovus' ability to receive dividends from Synovus Bank in future periods will depend on a number of factors, including, without limitation, Synovus Bank's future profits, asset quality, liquidity, and overall condition. In addition, both the GA DBF and Federal Reserve Bank may require approval to pay dividends, based on certain regulatory statutes and limitations. 

Synovus presently believes that the sources of liquidity discussed above, including existing liquid funds on hand, are sufficient to meet its anticipated funding needs. However, if economic conditions were to significantly deteriorate, regulatory capital requirements for Synovus or Synovus Bank were to increase as the result of regulatory directives or otherwise, or Synovus believes it is prudent to enhance current liquidity levels, then Synovus may seek additional liquidity from external sources. See "Part I &#8211; Item 1A. Risk Factors - Credit and Liquidity - Changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market may adversely affect our capital resources, liquidity and financial results." Furthermore, Synovus may, from time to time, take advantage of attractive market opportunities to refinance its existing debt, redeem its preferred stock, or strengthen its liquidity or capital position. 

Contractual Cash Obligations 

The following table summarizes, by remaining maturity, Synovus&#8217; significant contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2021. Excluded from the table below are certain liabilities with variable cash flows and/or no contractual maturity. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies" of this Report for information on Synovus' commitments to extend credit including loan commitments and letters of credit along with obligations related to Synovus' sponsorship of MPS businesses.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The measures entitled adjusted non-interest revenue; adjusted non-interest expense; adjusted total revenue; adjusted tangible efficiency ratio; adjusted return on average assets; adjusted net income per common share, diluted; adjusted return on average common equity; adjusted return on average tangible common equity; and the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio are not measures recognized under GAAP and therefore are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The most comparable GAAP measures to these measures are total non-interest revenue, total non-interest expense, total TE revenue, efficiency ratio-TE, return on average assets, net income per common share, diluted, return on average common equity, and the ratio of total shareholders&#8217; equity to total assets, respectively. 

Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful additional information about Synovus to assist management and investors in evaluating Synovus&#8217; operating results, financial strength, the performance of its business, and the strength of its capital position. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of operating results or capital position as reported under GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as additional views of the way our financial measures are affected by significant items and other factors, and since they are not required to be uniformly applied, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures at other companies. Adjusted non-interest revenue and adjusted total revenue are measures used by management to evaluate non-interest revenue and total TE revenue exclusive of net investment securities gains (losses), gain on sale and changes in fair value of private equity investments, net, and fair value adjustments on non-qualified deferred compensation. Adjusted non-interest expense and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio are measures utilized by management to measure the success of expense management initiatives focused on reducing recurring controllable operating costs. Adjusted return on average assets, adjusted net income per common share, diluted, and adjusted return on average common equity are measurements used by management to evaluate operating results exclusive of items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact period-to-period comparisons. Adjusted return on average tangible common equity is a measure used by management to compare Synovus&#8217; performance with other financial institutions because it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization, thereby allowing management to evaluate the performance of the business consistently. The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio is used by management to assess the strength of our capital position. The computations of these measures are set forth in the tables below.
