Executive Overview 

We generated net earnings of $11.26 billion for 2022, compared with $21.64 billion for 2021. Diluted earnings per common share (EPS) was $30.06 for 2022, compared with $59.45 for 2021. Return on average common shareholders&#8217; equity (ROE) was 10.2% for 2022, compared with 23.0% for 2021. Book value per common share was $303.55 as of December 2022, 6.7% higher compared with December 2021. 

Net revenues were $47.37 billion for 2022, 20% lower than a strong 2021, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in Asset &#38; Wealth Management and lower net revenues in Global Banking &#38; Markets, partially offset by significantly higher net revenues in Platform Solutions. Net revenues in Asset &#38; Wealth Management primarily reflected significantly lower net revenues in Equity investments and Debt investments. Net revenues in Global Banking &#38; Markets primarily reflected significantly lower Investment banking fees compared with a strong prior year, partially offset by significantly higher net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency, and Commodities (FICC). Net revenues in Platform Solutions were significantly higher, primarily reflecting significantly higher net revenues in Consumer platforms. 

Provision for credit losses was $2.72 billion for 2022, compared with $357 million for 2021. Provisions for 2022 primarily reflected growth in the credit card portfolio, the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns and net charge-offs. Provisions for 2021 reflected growth in the credit card and wholesale portfolios, largely offset by reserve reductions as the broader economic environment continued to improve following the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Operating expenses were $31.16 billion for 2022, 2% lower than 2021, primarily due to lower compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting a decline in operating performance compared with a strong prior year). This decrease was partially offset by higher non-compensation expenses, reflecting the inclusion of NN Investment Partners (NNIP) and GreenSky, Inc. (GreenSky) and increases in transaction based expenses and technology expenses. Our efficiency ratio (total operating expenses divided by total net revenues) was 65.8% for 2022, compared with 53.8% for 2021. 

During 2022, we returned a total of $6.70 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $3.50 billion and common stock dividends of $3.20 billion. As of December 2022, our CET1 capital ratio was 15.1% under the Standardized Capital Rules and 14.4% under the Advanced Capital Rules. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our capital ratios.
