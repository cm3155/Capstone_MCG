Executive Overview 

We generated net earnings of $8.52 billion for 2023, compared with $11.26 billion for 2022. Diluted earnings per common share (EPS) was $22.87 for 2023, compared with $30.06 for 2022. ROE was 7.5% for 2023, compared with 10.2% for 2022. Book value per common share was $313.56 as of December 2023, 3.3% higher compared with December 2022. 

Net revenues were $46.25 billion for 2023, 2% lower than 2022, reflecting lower net revenues in Global Banking &#38; Markets, largely offset by higher net revenues in Platform Solutions and Asset &#38; Wealth Management. The decrease in net revenues in Global Banking &#38; Markets, compared with a strong prior year, reflected lower net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) and lower Investment banking fees. The increase in net revenues in Platform Solutions reflected significantly higher net revenues in Consumer platforms. The increase in net revenues in Asset &#38; Wealth Management primarily reflected higher Management and other fees. 

Provision for credit losses was $1.03 billion for 2023, compared with $2.72 billion for 2022. Provisions for 2023 reflected net provisions related to both the credit card portfolio (primarily driven by net charge-offs) and wholesale loans (primarily driven by impairments). These net provisions were partially offset by reserve reductions of $637 million related to the transfer of the GreenSky installment loan portfolio to held for sale and $442 million related to the sale of substantially all of the Marcus by Goldman Sachs (Marcus) loans portfolio. Provisions for 2022 primarily reflected growth in the credit card portfolio, the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns and net charge-offs. 

Operating expenses were $34.49 billion for 2023, 11% higher than 2022, primarily due to significantly higher impairments related to commercial real estate included in consolidated investment entities (CIEs) ($1.46 billion recognized in 2023), a write-down of identifiable intangible assets of $506 million related to GreenSky and an impairment of goodwill of $504 million related to Consumer platforms, as well as the FDIC special assessment fee of $529 million. Our efficiency ratio (total operating expenses divided by total net revenues) was 74.6% for 2023, compared with 65.8% for 2022. 

During 2023, we returned a total of $9.39 billion of capital to common shareholders, including $5.80 billion of common share repurchases and $3.59 billion of common stock dividends. As of December 2023, our CET1 capital ratio was 14.4% under the Standardized Capital Rules and 14.9% under the Advanced Capital Rules. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our capital ratios.
