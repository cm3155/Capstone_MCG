Introduction 

Goldman Sachs is a leading global financial institution that delivers a broad range of financial services across investment banking, securities, investment management and consumer banking to a large and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals. Our purpose is to advance sustainable economic growth and financial opportunity. Our goal, reflected in our One Goldman Sachs initiative, is to deliver the full range of our services and expertise to support our clients in a more accessible, comprehensive and efficient manner, across businesses and product areas. 

When we use the terms &#8220;Goldman Sachs,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our,&#8221; we mean The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Group Inc. or parent company), a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries. When we use the term &#8220;our subsidiaries,&#8221; we mean the consolidated subsidiaries of Group Inc.

Our Business Segments 

We report our activities in four business segments: Investment Banking, Global Markets, Asset Management, and Consumer &#38; Wealth Management. Investment Banking generates revenues from financial advisory, underwriting and corporate lending activities. Global Markets consists of Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) and Equities, and generates revenues from intermediation and financing activities. Asset Management generates revenues from management and other fees, incentive fees, equity investments, and lending and debt investments. Consumer &#38; Wealth Management consists of Wealth management and Consumer banking, and generates revenues from management and other fees, incentive fees, private banking and lending, and consumer-oriented activities. 

The chart below presents our four business segments and their revenue sources. 

&#160;

Investment Banking 

Investment Banking serves public and private sector clients around the world. We provide financial advisory services, help companies raise capital to strengthen and grow their businesses and provide financing to corporate clients. We seek to develop and maintain long-term relationships with a diverse global group of institutional clients, including corporations, governments, states and municipalities. Our goal is to deliver to our institutional clients all of our resources in a seamless fashion, with investment banking serving as the main initial point of contact. 

Investment Banking generates revenues from the following: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Financial advisory.

We are a leader in providing financial advisory services, including strategic advisory assignments with respect to mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, corporate defense activities, restructurings and spin-offs. In particular, we help clients execute large, complex transactions for which we provide multiple services, including cross-border structuring expertise. We also assist our clients in managing their asset and liability exposures and their capital. 

##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Underwriting.

We help companies raise capital to fund their businesses. As a financial intermediary, our job is to match the capital of our investing clients, who aim to grow the savings of millions of people, with the needs of our public and private sector clients, who need financing to generate growth, create jobs and deliver products and services. Our underwriting activities include public offerings and private placements, including local and cross-border transactions and acquisition financing, of a wide range of securities and other financial instruments, including loans. Underwriting consists of the following:

&#160;

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

&#160;

Equity underwriting.

We underwrite common and preferred stock and convertible and exchangeable securities. We regularly receive mandates for large, complex transactions and have held a leading position in worldwide public common stock offerings and worldwide initial public offerings for many years. 

Debt underwriting.

We underwrite and originate various types of debt instruments, including investment-grade and high-yield debt, bank and bridge loans, including in connection with acquisition financing, and emerging- and growth-market debt, which may be issued by, among others, corporate, sovereign, municipal and agency issuers. In addition, we underwrite and originate structured securities, which include mortgage-related securities and other asset-backed securities. 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Corporate lending.

We lend to corporate clients, including through relationship lending, middle-market lending and acquisition financing. The hedges related to this lending and financing activity are reported as part of our corporate lending activity. We also provide transaction banking services to certain of our corporate clients. 

##TABLE_END 

Global Markets 

Global Markets serves our clients who buy and sell financial products, raise funding and manage risk. We do this by acting as a market maker and offering market expertise on a global basis. Global Markets makes markets and facilitates client transactions in fixed income, equity, currency and commodity products. In addition, we make markets in, and clear client transactions on, major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide. 

As a market maker, we provide prices to clients globally across thousands of products in all major asset classes and markets. At times, we take the other side of transactions ourselves if a buyer or seller is not readily available, and at other times we connect our clients to other parties who want to transact. Our willingness to make markets, commit capital and take risk in a broad range of products is crucial to our client relationships. Market makers provide liquidity and play a critical role in price discovery, which contributes to the overall efficiency of the capital markets. In connection with our market-making activities, we maintain (i) market-making positions, typically for a short period of time, in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand, and (ii) positions to actively manage our risk exposures that arise from these market-making activities (collectively, inventory). 

Our clients are institutions that are primarily professional market participants, including investment entities whose ultimate clients include individual investors investing for their retirement, buying insurance or saving surplus cash. 

We execute a high volume of transactions for our clients in large, highly liquid markets (such as markets for U.S. Treasury securities, stocks and certain agency mortgage pass-through securities). We also execute transactions for our clients in less liquid markets (such as mid-cap

corporate bonds, emerging market currencies and certain non-agency

mortgage-backed securities) for spreads and fees that are generally somewhat larger than those charged in more liquid markets. Additionally, we structure and execute transactions involving customized or tailor-made products that address our clients&#8217; risk exposures, investment objectives or other complex needs (such as a jet fuel hedge for an airline), as well as derivative transactions related to client advisory and underwriting activities. 

Through our global sales force, we maintain relationships with our clients, receiving orders and distributing investment research, trading ideas, market information and analysis. Much of this connectivity between us and our clients is maintained on technology platforms, including Marquee

, and operates globally where markets are open for trading. Marquee

provides institutional investors with market intelligence, risk analytics, proprietary datasets and trade execution across multiple asset classes. 

Global Markets and our other businesses are supported by our Global Investment Research division, which, as of December 2020, provided fundamental research on approximately 3,000 companies worldwide and approximately 50 national economies, as well as on industries, currencies and commodities. 

Global Markets activities are organized by asset class and include both &#8220;cash&#8221; and &#8220;derivative&#8221; instruments. &#8220;Cash&#8221; refers to trading the underlying instrument (such as a stock, bond or barrel of oil). &#8220;Derivative&#8221; refers to instruments that derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates and other inputs, or a combination of these factors (such as an option, which is the right or obligation to buy or sell a certain bond, stock or other asset on a specified date in the future at a certain price, or an interest rate swap, which is the agreement to convert a fixed rate of interest into a floating rate or vice versa).

We provide services that principally involve borrowing and lending securities to cover institutional clients&#8217; short sales and borrowing securities to cover our short sales and to make deliveries into the market. In addition, we are an active participant in broker-to-broker

securities lending and third-party agency lending activities. 

We provide financing to our clients for their securities trading activities through margin loans that are collateralized by securities, cash or other acceptable collateral. We earn a spread equal to the difference between the amount we pay for funds and the amount we receive from our client. 

We execute swap transactions to provide our clients with exposure to securities and indices.

Asset Management 

Asset Management provides investment services to help clients preserve and grow their financial assets. We provide these services to our institutional clients, as well as investors who primarily access our products through a network of third-party distributors around the world. 

We manage client assets across a broad range of investment strategies and asset classes, including equity, fixed income and alternative investments. Alternative investments primarily includes hedge funds, credit funds, private equity, real estate, currencies, commodities and asset allocation strategies. Our investment offerings include those managed on a fiduciary basis by our portfolio managers, as well as strategies managed by third-party managers. We offer our investments in a variety of structures, including separately managed accounts, mutual funds, private partnerships and other commingled vehicles. 

We also provide customized investment advisory solutions designed to address our clients&#8217; investment needs. These solutions begin with identifying clients&#8217; objectives and continue through portfolio construction, ongoing asset allocation and risk management and investment realization. We draw from a variety of third-party managers, as well as our proprietary offerings, to implement solutions for clients. 

Asset Management generates revenues from the following: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Management and other fees.

The majority of revenues in management and other fees consists of asset-based fees on client assets that we manage.

##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Incentive fees.

In certain circumstances, we also receive incentive fees based on a percentage of a fund&#8217;s or a separately managed account&#8217;s return, or when the return exceeds a specified benchmark or other performance targets. Such fees include overrides, which consist of the increased share of the income and gains derived primarily from our private equity and credit funds when the return on a fund&#8217;s investments over the life of the fund exceeds certain threshold returns. 

##TABLE_END 

&#160;

Consumer Banking.

We engage in consumer-oriented businesses. We issue unsecured loans, through our digital platform, Marcus by Goldman Sachs 

(Marcus), and credit cards, to finance the purchases of goods or services. We also accept deposits through Marcus, in GS Bank USA and Goldman Sachs International Bank (GSIB). These deposits include savings and time deposits which provide us with a diversified source of funding. 

Consumer banking revenues consist of net interest income earned on unsecured loans issued to consumers through Marcus and credit card lending activities, and net interest income allocated to consumer deposits. 

Business Continuity and Information Security 

Business continuity and information security, including cyber security, are high priorities for us. Their importance has been highlighted by (i) the coronavirus (COVID-19)

pandemic and the work-from-home arrangements implemented by companies worldwide in response, including us, (ii) numerous highly publicized events in recent years, including cyber attacks against financial institutions, governmental agencies, large consumer-based companies and other organizations that resulted in the unauthorized disclosure of personal information and other sensitive or confidential information, the theft and destruction of corporate information and requests for ransom payments, and (iii) extreme weather events. 

Our Business Continuity &#38; Technology Resilience Program has been developed to provide reasonable assurance of business continuity in the event of disruptions at our critical facilities or of our systems, and to comply with regulatory requirements, including those of FINRA. Because we are a BHC, our Business Continuity &#38; Technology Resilience Program is also subject to review by the FRB. The key elements of the program are crisis management, business continuity, technology resilience, business recovery, assurance and verification, and process improvement. In the area of information security, we have developed and implemented a framework of principles, policies and technology designed to protect the information provided to us by our clients and our own information from cyber attacks and other misappropriation, corruption or loss. Safeguards are designed to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. For further information about the Business Continuity Planning strategy we have implemented in response to the COVID-19

pandemic, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Regulatory and Other Matters &#8212; Impact of COVID-19

Pandemic&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.

Human Capital Management 

Our people are our greatest asset. We believe that a major strength and principal reason for our success is the quality, dedication, determination and collaboration of our people, which enables us to serve our clients, generate long-term value for our shareholders and contribute to the broader community. We invest heavily in developing and supporting our people throughout their careers, and we strive to maintain a work environment that fosters professionalism, excellence, high standards of business ethics, diversity, teamwork and cooperation among our employees worldwide. 

Diversity and Inclusion 

The strength of our culture, our ability to execute our strategy, and our relationships with clients all depend on a diverse workforce and an inclusive work environment that encourages a wide range of perspectives. We believe that employee diversity at all levels of our businesses, from entry-level analysts to senior management, is essential to our sustainability. Our management team works closely with our Global Inclusion and Diversity Committee to continue to increase diversity of our global workforce at all levels. In addition, we also have regional Inclusion and Diversity Committees which promote an environment that values different perspectives, challenges conventional thinking and maximizes the potential of all our people. 

We believe that increased diversity, including diversity of experience, gender identity, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability and veteran status, in addition to being a social imperative, is vital to our commercial success through the creativity that it fosters. For this reason, we have established a comprehensive action plan with aspirational diversity hiring goals which are set forth below and are focused on cultivating an inclusive environment for all our colleagues. 

Diverse leadership is crucial to our long-term success and to driving innovation, and we have implemented and expanded outreach and career advancement programs for rising diverse executive talent. A prime example is our Managing Director Retention Initiative, which includes sponsorship and the creation of career development plans for newly promoted diverse managing directors. We are also focused on providing diverse vice presidents the necessary coaching, sponsorship and advocacy to support their career trajectories and strengthen their leadership platforms, including through programs such as our Asian Talent Initiative. Many other career development initiatives are aimed at fostering diverse talent at the analyst and associate level, including the Black Analyst and Associate Initiative, the Hispanic/Latinx Analysts Initiative and the Women&#8217;s Career Strategies Initiative. We have also established Inclusion Networks and Interest Forums that are open to all professionals at Goldman Sachs to promote and advance connectivity, understanding, inclusion and diversity. 

&#160;

##TABLE_START Goldman Sachs 2020 Form 10-K &#160; 5 ##TABLE_END 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

&#160;

Reflecting our efforts to increase diversity, the composition of our most recent partnership class was 27% women, 17% Asian, 7% Black and 5% Hispanic/Latinx, and our most recent managing director class was 29% women, 26% Asian, 4% Black and 2% Hispanic/Latinx. In addition, our 2020 campus analyst class in the Americas was 55% women, 31% Asian, 17% Hispanic/Latinx and 11% Black. These metrics are based on self-identification. 

Aspirational Goals.

We have set the following aspirational goals: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; We aim for analyst and associate hiring (which accounts for over 70% of our annual hiring) to achieve representation of 50% women, 11% Black professionals and 14% Hispanic/Latinx professionals in the Americas, and 9% Black professionals in the U.K.

##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; We aim for women to represent 40% of our vice presidents globally by 2025 and 50% of all our employees globally over time, while also endeavoring for women to comprise 30% of senior talent (vice presidents and above) in the U.K. by 2023. 

##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; We aim for Black professionals to represent 7% of our vice president population in the Americas and in the U.K., and for Hispanic/Latinx professionals to represent 9% of our vice president population in the Americas, both by 2025. 

##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; We aim to double the number of campus hires in the U.S. recruited from historically Black colleges and universities by 2025. 

##TABLE_END 

Talent Development and Retention 

We seek to help our people achieve their full potential by investing in them and supporting a culture of continuous development. Our goals are to maximize individual capabilities, increase commercial effectiveness and innovation, reinforce our culture, expand professional opportunities, and help our people contribute positively to their communities. 

Instilling our culture in all employees is a continuous process, in which training plays an important part. We offer our employees the opportunity to participate in ongoing educational offerings and periodic seminars through Goldman Sachs University (GSU). To accelerate their integration into the firm and our culture, new hires have the opportunity to receive training before they start working and orientation programs with an emphasis on culture and networking, and nearly all employees participate in at least one training event each year. For our more senior employees, we provide guidance and training on how to manage people and projects effectively, exhibit strong leadership and exemplify the firm&#8217;s culture. We are also focused on developing a high performing, diverse leadership pipeline and career planning for our next generation of leaders. 

Another important part of instilling our culture is our employee performance review process. Employees are reviewed by supervisors, co-workers

and employees whom they supervise in a 360-degree

review process that is integral to our team approach and includes an evaluation of an employee&#8217;s performance with respect to risk management, protecting our reputation, adherence to our code of conduct, compliance, and diversity and inclusion principles. Our approach to evaluating employee performance centers on providing robust, timely and actionable feedback that facilitates professional development. We have directed our managers, as leaders at the firm, to take an active coaching role with their teams. In 2021, we implemented &#8220;The Three Conversations at GS&#8221; through which managers establish goals with their team members at the start of the year, check in mid-year

on progress and then close out the year with a conversation on performance against goals. 

We believe that our people value opportunities to contribute to their communities and that these opportunities enhance their job satisfaction. We also believe that being able to volunteer together with colleagues and participate in community organizations working on local service projects strengthens our people&#8217;s bond with us. Community TeamWorks, our signature volunteering initiative, enables our people to participate in high-impact, team-based volunteer opportunities, including projects coordinated with hundreds of nonprofit partner organizations worldwide. During 2019, our people volunteered over 150,000 hours of service globally through Community TeamWorks, with more than 26,000 employees partnering with approximately 900 nonprofit organizations on over 1,800 community projects. To respond to the interest of our people in helping with the response to the COVID-19

pandemic, we developed a series of opportunities during 2020 to support vulnerable populations remotely, including small business owners, students and the elderly. 

Wellness 

We recognize that for our people to be successful in the workplace they need support in their personal, as well as their professional lives. We have created a strong support framework for wellness, which is intended to enable employees to better balance their roles at work and their responsibilities at home. We have recently made significant additions to this framework, including increasing parental leave to 20 weeks for all employees. We also continue to advance our resilience programs, offering our people a range of counseling, coaching, medical advisory and personal wellness services. We have increased the availability of these resources during the COVID-19

pandemic, and we have continued to evolve and strengthen virtual offerings with the aim of maintaining the physical and mental well-being of our employees, enhancing their effectiveness and cohesiveness and providing them with greater opportunities to access support. 

&#160;

##TABLE_START 6 &#160; Goldman Sachs 2020 Form 10-K ##TABLE_END 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

&#160;

We also introduced a COVID-19

10-day

family leave policy, available to our people globally to care for family members due to COVID-19

related illness or meet childcare needs, including homeschooling. 

Global Reach and Strategic Locations 

As a firm with a global client base, we take a strategic approach to attracting, developing and managing a global workforce. Our clients are located worldwide and we are an active participant in financial markets around the world. As of December 2020, we had headcount of 40,500, offices in over 35 countries and 53% of our headcount was based in the Americas, 19% in EMEA and 28% in Asia. Our employees come from over 160 countries and speak more than 110 languages as of December 2020. 

In addition to maintaining offices in major financial centers around the world, we have established key strategic locations, including in Bengaluru, Salt Lake City, Dallas, Singapore and Warsaw. We continue to evaluate the expanded use of strategic locations, including cities in which we do not currently have a presence. 

As of December 2020, 36% of our employees were working in one of these key strategic locations, and our goal is to increase this percentage to approximately 40% by the end of 2022. We believe our investment in these strategic locations enables us to build centers of excellence around specific capabilities that support our business initiatives. 

Competition 

The financial services industry and all of our businesses are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. Our competitors are other entities that provide investment banking (including transaction banking), market-making, investment management services, commercial and/or consumer lending, deposit-taking and other banking products and services, as well as those entities that make investments in securities, commodities, derivatives, real estate, loans and other financial assets. These entities include brokers and dealers, investment banking firms, commercial banks, credit card issuers, insurance companies, investment advisers, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, merchant banks, consumer finance companies and financial technology and other internet-based companies. We compete with some entities globally and with others on a regional, product or niche basis. We compete based on a number of factors, including transaction execution, client experience, products and services, innovation, reputation and price. 

We have faced, and expect to continue to face, pressure to retain market share by committing capital to businesses or transactions on terms that offer returns that may not be commensurate with their risks. In particular, corporate clients seek such commitments (such as agreements to participate in their loan facilities) from financial services firms in connection with investment banking and other assignments. 

Consolidation and convergence have significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of some of our competitors, and have also hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions. To capitalize on some of our most significant opportunities, we will have to compete successfully with financial institutions that are larger and have more capital and that may have a stronger local presence and longer operating history outside the U.S. 

We also compete with smaller institutions that offer more targeted services, such as independent advisory firms. Some clients may perceive these firms to be less susceptible to potential conflicts of interest than we are, and, as described below, our ability to effectively compete with them could be affected by regulations and limitations on activities that apply to us but may not apply to them. 

A number of our businesses are subject to intense price competition. Efforts by our competitors to gain market share have resulted in pricing pressure in our investment banking, market-making, lending and asset management businesses. For example, the increasing volume of trades executed electronically, through the internet and through alternative trading systems, has increased the pressure on trading commissions, in that commissions for electronic trading are generally lower than those for non-electronic

trading. It appears that this trend toward low-commission

trading will continue. Price competition has also led to compression in the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing to sell an instrument and the price at which another market participant is willing to buy it (i.e., bid/offer spread), which has affected our market-making businesses. The increasing prevalence of passive investment strategies that typically have lower fees than other strategies we offer has affected the competitive and pricing dynamics for our asset management products and services. In addition, we believe that we will continue to experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by further reducing prices, and as we enter into or expand our presence in markets that may rely more heavily on electronic trading and execution. 

&#160;

##TABLE_START Goldman Sachs 2020 Form 10-K &#160; 7 ##TABLE_END 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

&#160;

We also compete on the basis of the types of financial products and client experiences that we and our competitors offer. In some circumstances, our competitors may offer financial products that we do not offer and that our clients may prefer, or our competitors may develop technology platforms that provide a better client experience. 

The provisions of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), the requirements promulgated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and other financial regulations could affect our competitive position to the extent that limitations on activities, increased fees and compliance costs or other regulatory requirements do not apply, or do not apply equally, to all of our competitors or are not implemented uniformly across different jurisdictions. For example, the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that prohibit proprietary trading and restrict investments in certain hedge and private equity funds differentiate between U.S.-based and non-U.S.-based

banking organizations and give non-U.S.-based

banking organizations greater flexibility to trade outside of the U.S. and to form and invest in funds outside the U.S. Likewise, the obligations with respect to derivative transactions under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act depend, in part, on the location of the counterparties to the transaction. 

The impact of regulatory developments on our competitive position has depended and will continue to depend to a large extent on the manner in which the required rulemaking and regulatory guidance evolve, the extent of international convergence, and the development of market practice and structures under the evolving regulatory regimes, as described further in &#8220;Regulation&#8221; below. 

We also face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively has depended and will continue to depend upon our ability to attract new employees, retain and motivate our existing employees and to continue to compensate employees competitively amid intense public and regulatory scrutiny on the compensation practices of large financial institutions. Our pay practices and those of certain of our competitors are subject to review by, and the standards of, the FRB and other regulators inside and outside the U.S., including the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the U.K. We also compete for employees with institutions whose pay practices are not subject to regulatory oversight. See &#8220;Regulation &#8212; Compensation Practices&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Competition &#8212; Our businesses may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K

for further information about such regulation. 

Regulation 

As a participant in the global financial services industry, we are subject to extensive regulation and supervision worldwide. The regulatory regimes applicable to our operations worldwide have recently been, and continue to be, subject to significant changes. The Basel Committee is the primary global standard setter for prudential bank regulation; however, its standards do not become effective in a jurisdiction until the relevant regulators have adopted rules to implement its standards. The implications of these regulations for our businesses depend to a large extent on their implementation by the relevant regulators globally, and the market practices and structures that develop. 

New regulations have been adopted or are being considered by regulators and policy makers worldwide, as described below. The effects of any changes to the regulations affecting our businesses, including as a result of the proposals described below, are uncertain and will not be known until such changes are finalized and market practices and structures develop under the revised regulations. 

Our principal subsidiaries operating in Europe include Goldman Sachs International (GSI), GSIB and Goldman Sachs Asset Management International (GSAMI), which are incorporated and headquartered in the U.K., and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE (GSBE), which is incorporated and headquartered in Germany. As a result of the U.K.&#8217;s withdrawal from the E.U. (Brexit), the regulatory framework that governs transactions and business undertaken by our U.K. subsidiaries has changed, especially in connection with transactions and business relating to the E.U.

&#160;

The E.U. and the U.K. agreed to a withdrawal agreement (the Withdrawal Agreement), which became effective on January 31, 2020 when the U.K. ceased to be an E.U. member state. The transition period under the Withdrawal Agreement ended on December 31, 2020. During the transition period, the U.K. was treated as if it were a member state of the E.U. and therefore our U.K. subsidiaries benefitted from non-discriminatory

access to E.U. clients and infrastructure. Effective on December 31, 2020, and notwithstanding the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the E.U. and the U.K. reached at the end of 2020, firms established in the U.K., including our U.K. subsidiaries, have lost their pan-E.U.

&#8220;passports&#8221; and are generally treated as any other entities in countries outside the E.U., whose access to the E.U. is governed by E.U. and national law and depends on the making of E.U. equivalence decisions or on their obtaining licenses or exemptions under national regimes. The U.K. has adopted E.U. financial services legislation that was in effect at December 31, 2020. This means that the U.K. financial services regime will remain substantially the same as under E.U. financial services legislation, but in the future the U.K. may diverge from E.U. legislation and may decide not to adopt rules that correspond to E.U. legislation not already operative in the U.K. We have strengthened the capabilities of our operating subsidiaries in E.U. countries, particularly GSBE, and have moved certain activities there, including moving a number of relationships with clients of our Investment Banking, Global Markets and Wealth Management businesses from GSI and GSIB to GSBE, and clients of our Asset Management business from GSAMI to GSBE; establishing access for GSBE to exchanges, clearing houses and depositories and other market infrastructure in the E.U.; establishing branches of GSBE in nine E.U. member states and in the U.K.; and strengthening the capital, personnel and other resources at GSBE. 

Banking Supervision and Regulation 

Group Inc. is a BHC under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHC Act) and an FHC under amendments to the BHC Act effected by the U.S. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLB Act), and is subject to supervision and examination by the FRB, which is our primary regulator. 

The FRB has a rating system for large financial institutions that is intended to align with its supervisory program. It consists of component ratings for capital planning and positions, liquidity risk management and positions, and governance and controls. The FRB has proposed guidance for the governance and controls component. 

Under the system of &#8220;functional regulation&#8221; established under the BHC Act, the primary regulators of our U.S. non-bank

subsidiaries directly regulate the activities of those subsidiaries, with the FRB exercising a supervisory role. Such &#8220;functionally regulated&#8221; subsidiaries include broker-dealers registered with the SEC, such as our principal U.S. broker-dealer, Goldman Sachs &#38; Co. LLC (GS&#38;Co.), entities registered with or regulated by the CFTC with respect to futures-related and swaps-related activities and investment advisers registered with the SEC with respect to their investment advisory activities. 

Our principal U.S. bank subsidiary, GS Bank USA, is supervised and regulated by the FRB, the FDIC, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). GS Bank USA also has a branch in London, which is regulated by the FCA and PRA. A number of our activities are conducted partially or entirely through GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries, including: corporate loans (including leveraged lending); consumer loans (including installment and credit card loans) and wealth management loans (including mortgages); interest rate, credit, currency and other derivatives; deposit-taking; and agency lending. 

&#160;

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

&#160;

Certain of our subsidiaries are regulated by the banking and securities regulatory authorities of the countries in which they operate. GSI, our U.K. broker-dealer subsidiary and a designated investment firm, and GSIB, our U.K. bank subsidiary, are regulated by the PRA and the FCA. GSI provides broker-dealer services in and from the U.K., and GSIB acts as a primary dealer for U.K. government bonds and is involved in lending (including securities lending) and deposit-taking activities. As described below, our E.U. subsidiaries are subject to various E.U. regulations, as well as national laws, including those implementing European directives. GSI maintains branches as a non-E.U.

investment firm in Madrid, Paris and Stockholm and GSIB maintains a branch in Frankfurt. GSIB also maintains a branch in Johannesburg, South Africa, which is regulated by the Prudential Authority, the Financial Surveillance Department of the South African Reserve Bank and the Financial Sector Conduct Authority. GSBE is directly supervised by the European Central Bank (ECB) and additionally by BaFin and Deutsche Bundesbank in the context of the E.U. Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). Goldman Sachs Paris Inc. et Cie (GSPIC), an investment firm regulated by the French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority and Financial Markets Regulator, may, among other activities, conduct activities that GSBE is prevented from undertaking. Certain of our non-E.U.

subsidiaries also maintain cross-border licenses or exemptions as non-E.U.

institutions in E.U. jurisdictions where permitted by domestic legislation. 

Capital and Liquidity Requirements.

We and GS Bank USA are subject to regulatory risk-based capital and leverage requirements that are calculated in accordance with the regulations of the FRB (Capital Framework). The Capital Framework is largely based on the Basel Committee&#8217;s framework for strengthening the regulation, supervision and risk management of banks (Basel III) and also implements certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the tailoring rules adopted by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies in October 2019, we and GS Bank USA are subject to &#8220;Category I&#8221; standards because we have been designated as a global systemically important bank (G-SIB).

Accordingly, under the Capital Framework, we and GS Bank USA are &#8220;Advanced approach&#8221; banking organizations. Under the FRB&#8217;s capital adequacy requirements, we and GS Bank USA must meet specific regulatory capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance

sheet items. The sufficiency of our capital levels is also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. We and GS Bank USA are also subject to liquidity requirements established by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. 

GSBE is subject to capital requirements prescribed in the E.U. Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and the E.U. Fourth Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV), which are largely based on Basel III. GSBE is subject to liquidity requirements established by E.U. authorities, which are similar to those applicable to GS Bank USA and us. Following the end of the Brexit transition period, from December 31, 2020, GSI and GSIB have become subject to the U.K. capital framework, which is predominantly aligned with the E.U. capital framework. 

Amendments to the CRR and CRD IV (respectively, CRR II and CRD V) were finalized in June 2019. CRR II, which includes changes to the market risk, large exposures and leverage ratio frameworks will be applicable from June 2021 in the E.U., and from January 2022 in the U.K. GSI and GSAMI will be subject to a new prudential regime for U.K. investment firms which is expected to be introduced on January 1, 2022. 

Risk-Based Capital Ratios.

The Capital Framework provides for additional capital ratio requirements for Group Inc., consisting of the capital conservation buffer requirements, comprised of a 2.5% buffer (under the Advanced Capital Rules), a stress capital buffer (under the Standardized Capital Rules), and a countercyclical buffer and the G-SIB

surcharge (under both Capital Rules). For GS Bank USA, the capital conservation buffer requirements include a 2.5% buffer and the countercyclical capital buffer. These additional requirements must be satisfied entirely with capital that qualifies as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. 

The SCB is based on the results of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s supervisory stress tests, and our planned common stock dividends. The countercyclical capital buffer is designed to counteract systemic vulnerabilities and currently applies only to banking organizations subject to Category I, II or III standards, including us. Several other national supervisors also require countercyclical capital buffers. The G-SIB

surcharge and countercyclical capital buffer applicable to us could change in the future. As a result, the minimum capital ratios to which we are subject are likely to change over time. 

&#160;

##TABLE_START 10 &#160; Goldman Sachs 2020 Form 10-K ##TABLE_END 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

&#160;

During 2020, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies adopted a rule that allows banking organizations, including us and GS Bank USA, to elect to temporarily delay the estimated effects of adopting the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) accounting standard on regulatory capital until January 2022 and to subsequently phase-in

the effects through January 2025. The FRB has also stated that it will not incorporate CECL into the calculation of the allowance for credit losses in supervisory stress tests through the 2021 stress test cycle. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K

for further information about CECL. 

The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies adopted a rule in November 2019 that will implement the Basel Committee&#8217;s standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk exposures in connection with derivative contracts (SA-CCR).

Under the rule, beginning January 1, 2022, but with the option to adopt starting April 1, 2020, &#8220;Advanced approach&#8221; banking organizations will be required to use SA-CCR

for purposes of calculating their standardized risk-weighted assets (RWAs) and, with some adjustments, for purposes of determining their supplementary leverage ratios (SLRs) discussed below. 

The Basel Committee standards include guidelines for calculating incremental capital ratio requirements for banking institutions that are systemically significant from a domestic but not global perspective (D-SIBs).

When these guidelines are implemented by national regulators, they may apply, among others, to certain subsidiaries of G-SIBs.

These guidelines are in addition to the framework for G-SIBs,

but are more principles-based. CRD V and CRR II provide that institutions that are systemically important at the E.U. or member state level, known as other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs),

may be subject to additional capital ratio requirements of up to 3% of CET1, according to their degree of systemic importance (O-SII

buffers). The designated authority may impose an O-SII

buffer that is greater than 3% in certain cases. CRD IV and the CRR currently provide for an additional requirement of up to 2%. O-SIIs

are identified annually, along with their applicable buffers. The PRA has identified Goldman Sachs Group UK Limited (GSG UK), the parent company of GSI and GSIB, as an O-SII.

GSG UK&#8217;s O-SII

buffer is currently set at zero percent. 

In January 2019, the Basel Committee finalized revisions to the framework for calculating capital requirements for market risk, which is expected to increase market risk capital requirements for most banking organizations and large broker-dealers subject to bank capital requirements. The revised framework, among other things, revises the standardized and internal models approaches used to calculate market risk requirements and clarifies the scope of positions subject to market risk capital requirements. The Basel Committee framework contemplates that national regulators implement the revised framework by January 1, 2023. CRR II, which became effective in June 2019 and establishes a reporting standard, will become applicable in the third quarter of 2021. The U.K. has adopted the reporting standard set out in CRR II but has not stated when it will become applicable. E.U. financial institutions are to report their market risk calculations under the revised framework as early as January 1, 2021. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have not yet proposed rules implementing the 2019 version of the revised market risk framework. 

The Basel Committee published standards in December 2017 that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms. These standards set a floor on internally modeled capital requirements at a percentage of the capital requirements under the standardized approach. They also revise the Basel Committee&#8217;s standardized and internal model-based approaches for credit risk, provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital and revise the frameworks for credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk. The Basel Committee framework contemplates that national regulators implement these standards by January 1, 2023, and that the new floor be phased in through January 1, 2028. In July 2020, the Basel Committee finalized further revisions to the framework for CVA risk, which are intended to align that framework with the market risk framework. 

The Basel Committee has also published updated frameworks relating to Pillar 3 disclosure requirements and the regulatory capital treatment of securitization exposures and a revised G-SIB

assessment methodology. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have not yet proposed rules implementing these Basel Committee frameworks or the December 2017 standards for purposes of risk-based capital ratios. 

See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K

and Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K

for information about our capital ratios and those of GS Bank USA and GSI. 

As described in &#8220;Other Restrictions&#8221; below, in September 2016, the FRB issued a proposed rule that would, among other things, require FHCs to hold additional capital in connection with covered physical commodity activities. 

&#160;

&#160;

Leverage Ratios.

Under the Capital Framework, we and GS Bank USA are subject to Tier 1 leverage ratios and SLRs established by the FRB. In April 2018, the FRB and the OCC issued a proposed rule which would replace the current 2% SLR buffer for G-SIBs,

including us, with a buffer equal to 50% of their G-SIB

surcharge. This proposal, together with the adopted rule requiring use of SA-CCR

for purposes of calculating the SLR, would implement certain of the revisions to the leverage ratio framework published by the Basel Committee in December 2017. 

The Basel Committee standards provide for the public disclosure of average daily balances for certain components of leverage ratio calculations. 

The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies&#8217; rule implementing SA-CCR

allows for greater recognition of collateral in the calculation of total leverage exposure relating to client-cleared derivative contracts. 

CRR II establishes a 3% minimum leverage ratio requirement for certain E.U. financial institutions, including GSBE. This requirement will be applicable beginning in June 2021. Following Brexit, GSI and GSIB will become subject to a similar PRA-required

leverage ratio that is expected to become effective in January 2022. 

See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K

and Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K

for information about our and GS Bank USA&#8217;s Tier 1 leverage ratios and SLRs, and GSI&#8217;s leverage ratio. 

Liquidity Ratios.

The Basel Committee&#8217;s framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring requires banking organizations to measure their liquidity against two specific liquidity tests: the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). 

The LCR rule issued by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies and applicable to both us and GS Bank USA is generally consistent with the Basel Committee&#8217;s framework and is designed to ensure that a banking organization maintains an adequate level of unencumbered, high-quality liquid assets equal to or greater than the expected net cash outflows under an acute short-term liquidity stress scenario. We are required to maintain a minimum LCR of 100%. We disclose, on a quarterly basis, our average daily LCR. See &#8220;Available Information&#8221; below and &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K

for information about our average daily LCR. 

The LCR rule issued by the European Commission, which was incorporated into the U.K. prudential framework and is applicable to GSI, GSIB and GSBE, is also generally consistent with the Basel Committee&#8217;s framework. 

The NSFR is designed to promote medium- and long-term stable funding of the assets and off-balance

sheet activities of banking organizations over a one-year

time horizon. The Basel Committee&#8217;s NSFR framework requires banking organizations to maintain a minimum NSFR of 100%. 

In October 2020, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule implementing the NSFR for large U.S. banking organizations, including us and GS Bank USA. The final rule will become effective on July 1, 2021, and we will be required to publicly disclose our NSFR levels semiannually beginning in 2023. CRR II implements the NSFR for certain E.U. financial institutions, including GSBE. This requirement will be applicable beginning in June 2021. Following the U.K.&#8217;s withdrawal from the E.U. on December 31, 2020, GSI and GSIB have become subject to the NSFR requirement implemented in the U.K., which is expected to become effective in January 2022. 

The FRB&#8217;s enhanced prudential standards require BHCs with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk management standards, which include maintaining a level of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for 30 days, and increased involvement by boards of directors in liquidity and overall risk management. Although the liquidity requirement under these rules has some similarities to the LCR, it is a separate requirement. GSI and GSIB have their own liquidity planning process, which incorporates internally designed stress tests developed in accordance with the guidelines of the PRA&#8217;s Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP). GSBE also has its own liquidity planning process, which incorporates internally designed stress tests and those required under German regulatory requirements and the ECB Guide to ILAAP. 

See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Risk Management &#8212; Overview and Structure of Risk Management&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212; Liquidity Risk Management&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K

&#160;

Stress Tests.

As required by the FRB&#8217;s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) rules, we submit an annual capital plan for review by the FRB. In June 2020, all BHCs participating in CCAR 2020, including us, were required by the FRB to resubmit their capital plans in November 2020 in light of the ongoing economic effects of the COVID-19

pandemic. In addition, we are required to perform company-run

stress tests on an annual basis. As described in &#8220;Available Information&#8221; below, we publish summaries of our stress tests results on our website. 

Our annual stress test submission is incorporated into the annual capital plans that we submit to the FRB as part of the CCAR process for large BHCs, which is designed to ensure that capital planning processes will permit continued operations by such institutions during times of economic and financial stress. As part of CCAR, the FRB evaluates an institution&#8217;s plan to make capital distributions, such as by repurchasing or redeeming stock or making dividend payments, across a range of macroeconomic and company-specific assumptions based on the institution&#8217;s and the FRB&#8217;s stress tests. 

In March 2020, the FRB approved a final rule replacing the static 2.5% component of the capital conservation buffer, under the Standardized approach capital rules, with the SCB for BHCs with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The SCB reflects stressed losses in the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the FRB&#8217;s CCAR stress tests and includes four quarters of planned common stock dividends. The SCB is subject to a 2.5% floor and is generally effective on October 1 of each year and remains in effect until October 1 of the following year, unless the SCB is reset in connection with a resubmission of a capital plan. Our first SCB requirement of 6.6% took effect on October 1, 2020. 

Depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $250 billion or more that are subsidiaries of U.S. G-SIBs

are required to submit annual company-run

stress test results to the FRB. Based on growth in its balance sheet, GS Bank USA will be required to submit its annual stress test results in 2022. Depository institutions not subject to company-run

stress testing requirements are still required to have their own capital planning process. GSI and GSIB have their own capital planning and stress testing process, which incorporates internally designed stress tests developed in accordance with the guidelines of the PRA&#8217;s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). GSBE also has its own capital and stress testing process, which incorporates internally designed stress tests and those required under German regulatory requirements and the ECB Guide to ICAAP. 

Dividends and Stock Repurchases.

Dividend payments to our shareholders and our stock repurchases are subject to the oversight of the FRB. 

The final rule implementing the SCB provides that a BHC must receive prior approval for any dividend, stock repurchase or other capital distribution, other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument, if the BHC is required to resubmit its capital plan. In connection with the November 2020 resubmission described above under &#8220;Stress Tests,&#8221; the FRB required those BHCs to suspend stock repurchases during the third and fourth quarters of 2020 and not to increase common stock dividends or pay common stock dividends in excess of their average net income over the prior four quarters. In December 2020, the FRB announced that it would require BHCs not to increase common stock dividends and would permit common stock dividends and stock repurchases that, in the aggregate, do not exceed a BHC&#8217;s average net income over the prior four quarters, as well as stock repurchases equal to the amount of share issuances related to expensed employee compensation. We suspended stock repurchases during the first quarter of 2020 and, consistent with the FRB&#8217;s requirement for all large BHCs, extended the suspension of stock repurchases through the fourth quarter of 2020. We resumed stock repurchases in the first quarter of 2021. 

U.S. federal and state laws impose limitations on the payment of dividends by U.S. depository institutions, such as GS Bank USA. In general, the amount of dividends that may be paid by GS Bank USA is limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a recent earnings test and an undivided profits test. Under the recent earnings test, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by the entity in any calendar year is in excess of the current year&#8217;s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years, unless the entity obtains prior regulatory approval. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entity&#8217;s undivided profits (generally, accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus). In addition, as a result of GS Bank USA&#8217;s election to exclude holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at the Federal Reserve from its total leverage exposure, in calculating the supplementary leverage ratio, any dividend by GS Bank USA through March 31, 2021 is subject to the prior approval of the FRB. 

The applicable U.S. banking regulators have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends if, in the banking regulator&#8217;s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. 

&#160;

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

&#160;

Given the COVID-19

pandemic, significant banks established in the E.U., such as GSBE, are currently subject to an ECB recommendation not to distribute any cash dividends or to limit such distributions through September 2021, and in any event to limit dividends to 15% of their total profits for 2019-2020 and 20 basis points of their CET1 capital ratio, whichever is lower. According to this recommendation, banks that intend to pay dividends or buy back shares need to be profitable and have robust capital. 

Source of Strength.

The Dodd-Frank Act requires BHCs to act as a source of strength to their bank subsidiaries and to commit capital and financial resources to support those subsidiaries. This support may be required by the FRB at times when BHCs might otherwise determine not to provide it. Capital loans by a BHC to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. In addition, if a BHC commits to a U.S. federal banking agency that it will maintain the capital of its bank subsidiary, whether in response to the FRB&#8217;s invoking its source-of-strength

authority or in response to other regulatory measures, that commitment will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee for the BHC and the bank will be entitled to priority payment in respect of that commitment, ahead of other creditors of the BHC. 

Transactions between Affiliates.

Transactions between GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries and Group Inc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to restrictions under the Federal Reserve Act and regulations issued by the FRB. These laws and regulations generally limit the types and amounts of transactions (such as loans and other credit extensions, including credit exposure arising from resale agreements, securities borrowing and derivative transactions, from GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries to Group Inc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates and purchases of assets by GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries from Group Inc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates) that may take place and generally require those transactions to be on market terms or better to GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries. These laws and regulations generally do not apply to transactions between GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries. Similarly, PRA rules and German regulatory requirements provide that transactions between GSI, GSIB, GSBE and their respective affiliates, including Group Inc. and GS Bank USA, must be on market terms and are subject to special internal approval requirements. 

The BHC Act prohibits the FRB from requiring a payment by a BHC subsidiary to a depository institution if the functional regulator of that subsidiary objects to the payment. In that case, the FRB could instead require the divestiture of the depository institution and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture. 

Resolution and Recovery.

We are required by the FRB and the FDIC to submit a periodic plan for our rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure (resolution plan). If the regulators jointly determine that an institution has failed to remediate identified shortcomings in its resolution plan and that its resolution plan, after any permitted resubmission, is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the regulators may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth, activities or operations, or may jointly order the institution to divest assets or operations, in order to facilitate orderly resolution in the event of failure. We submitted our 2019 resolution plan in June 2019 and the FRB and FDIC did not identify deficiencies or shortcomings. In October 2019, the FRB and FDIC adopted a rule requiring U.S. G-SIBs

to submit resolution plans on a two-year

cycle (alternating between full and targeted submissions). Our next required submission is a targeted submission by July 1, 2021. See &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; The application of Group Inc.&#8217;s proposed resolution strategy could result in greater losses for Group Inc.&#8217;s security holders&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K

and &#8220;Available Information&#8221; in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K

for further information about our resolution plan. 

We are also required by the FRB to submit, on a periodic basis, a global recovery plan that outlines the steps that we could take to reduce risk, maintain sufficient liquidity, and conserve capital in times of prolonged stress. 

The FDIC has issued a rule requiring each insured depository institution (IDI) with $50 billion or more in assets, such as GS Bank USA, to provide a resolution plan. Our resolution plan for GS Bank USA must, among other things, demonstrate that it is adequately protected from risks arising from our other entities. GS Bank USA&#8217;s most recent resolution plan was submitted in June 2018. In April 2019, the FDIC released an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking about potential changes to its resolution planning requirements for IDIs, including GS Bank USA, and delayed the next round of IDI resolution plan submissions until the rulemaking process is complete. Although the rulemaking process is still pending, in January 2021, the FDIC announced its intention to resume requiring resolution plan submissions for IDIs with $100 billion or more in assets, including GS Bank USA.

&#160;

The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted rules imposing restrictions on qualified financial contracts (QFCs) entered into by G-SIBs,

which became fully effective in January 2020. The rules are intended to facilitate the orderly resolution of a failed G-SIB

by limiting the ability of the G-SIB

to enter into a QFC unless (i) the counterparty waives certain default rights in such contract arising upon the entry of the G-SIB

or one of its affiliates into resolution, (ii) the contract does not contain enumerated prohibitions on the transfer of such contract and/or any related credit enhancement, and (iii) the counterparty agrees that the contract will be subject to the special resolution regimes set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act orderly liquidation authority (OLA) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950 (FDIA), described below. Compliance can be achieved by adhering to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Universal Resolution Stay Protocol (ISDA Universal Protocol) or International Swaps and Derivatives Association 2018 U.S. Resolution Stay Protocol (U.S. ISDA Protocol) described below. 

Certain of our subsidiaries, along with those of a number of other major global banking organizations, adhere to the ISDA Universal Protocol, which was developed and updated in coordination with the Financial Stability Board (FSB), an international body that sets standards and coordinates the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies. The ISDA Universal Protocol imposes a stay on certain cross-default and early termination rights within standard ISDA derivative contracts and securities financing transactions between adhering parties in the event that one of them is subject to resolution in its home jurisdiction, including a resolution under the OLA or the FDIA in the U.S. In addition, certain Group Inc. subsidiaries adhere to the U.S. ISDA Protocol, which was based on the ISDA Universal Protocol and was created to allow market participants to comply with the final QFC rules adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies. 

The amended E.U. Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD II) establishes a framework for the recovery and resolution of financial institutions in the E.U., such as GSBE. The BRRD II provides national supervisory authorities with tools and powers to pre-emptively

address potential financial crises in order to promote financial stability and minimize taxpayers&#8217; exposure to losses. The BRRD II requires E.U. member states to grant certain resolution powers to national and, where relevant, E.U. resolution authorities, including the power to impose a temporary stay and to recapitalize a failing entity by writing down its unsecured debt or converting its unsecured debt into equity. Financial institutions in the E.U. must provide that contracts governed by non-E.U.

law recognize those temporary stay and bail-in

powers unless doing so would be impracticable. Regulatory authorities in the E.U. may require financial institutions in the E.U., including subsidiaries of non-E.U.

groups, to submit recovery plans and to assist the relevant resolution authority in constructing resolution plans for the E.U. entities. The U.K. Special Resolution Regime confers substantially the same powers on the Bank of England, as the U.K. resolution authority, and substantially the same requirements on U.K. financial institutions. Further, certain U.K. financial institutions, including GSI and GSIB, have been required by the PRA to submit solvent wind-down plans on how they could be wound down in a stressed environment. 

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC).

The FRB has issued a rule addressing U.S. implementation of the FSB&#8217;s TLAC principles and term sheet on minimum TLAC requirements for G-SIBs.

The rule (i) establishes minimum TLAC requirements, (ii) establishes minimum &#8220;eligible long-term debt&#8221; (i.e., debt that is unsecured, has a maturity of at least one year from issuance and satisfies certain additional criteria) requirements, (iii) prohibits certain parent company transactions and (iv) caps the amount of parent company liabilities that are not eligible long-term debt. 

The rule also prohibits a BHC that has been designated as a U.S. G-SIB

from (i) guaranteeing liabilities of subsidiaries that are subject to early termination provisions if the BHC enters into an insolvency or receivership proceeding, subject to an exception for guarantees permitted by rules of the U.S. federal banking agencies imposing restrictions on QFCs; (ii) incurring liabilities guaranteed by subsidiaries; (iii) issuing short-term debt; or (iv) entering into derivatives and certain other financial contracts with external counterparties. 

Additionally, the rule caps, at 5% of the value of the parent company&#8217;s eligible TLAC, the amount of unsecured non-contingent

third-party liabilities that are not eligible long-term debt that could rank equally with or junior to eligible long-term debt. 

&#160;

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

&#160;

In October 2020, the FRB, the OCC and the FDIC issued a final rule requiring &#8220;Advanced approach&#8221; banking organizations, such as us, to deduct from their own regulatory capital certain investments above thresholds in unsecured debt instruments issued by G-SIBs,

including those issued for purposes of satisfying TLAC requirements. The rule will become effective April 1, 2021. 

The BRRD II and the U.K. resolution regime subject institutions to a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL), which is generally consistent with the FSB&#8217;s TLAC standard. In June 2018, the Bank of England published a statement of policy on internal MREL, which requires a material U.K. subsidiary of an overseas banking group, such as GSI, to meet a minimum internal MREL requirement to facilitate the transfer of losses to its resolution entity, which for GSI is Group Inc. The transitional minimum internal MREL requirement began to phase in from January 1, 2019 and will become fully effective on January 1, 2022. In order to comply with the MREL statement of policy, bail-in

triggers have been provided to the Bank of England over certain intercompany regulatory capital and senior debt instruments issued by GSI. These triggers enable the Bank of England to write down such instruments or convert such instruments to equity. The triggers can be exercised by the Bank of England if it determines that GSI has reached the point of non-viability

and the FRB and the FDIC have not objected to the bail-in

or if Group Inc. enters bankruptcy or similar proceedings. 

CRR II and the BRRD II are designed to, among other things, implement the FSB&#8217;s minimum TLAC requirement for G-SIBs.

For example, CRR II requires E.U. subsidiaries of a non-E.U.

G-SIB

that account for more than 5% of its RWAs, operating income or leverage exposure, such as GSG UK, to meet 90% of the TLAC requirement applicable to E.U. G-SIBs.

CRD V requires a non-E.U.

group with more than &#8364;40 billion of assets in the E.U., such as us, to establish an E.U. intermediate holding company (E.U. IHC) by December 30, 2023 if it has, as in our case, two or more of certain types of E.U. financial institution subsidiaries, including broker-dealers and banks, and an E.U. group can request to have a second E.U. IHC. CRR II requires E.U. IHCs to satisfy capital, liquidity, MREL and certain other prudential requirements at a consolidated level. The U.K. has not implemented the requirement for an E.U. IHC. 

Insolvency of an IDI or a BHC.

Under the FDIA, if the FDIC is appointed as conservator or receiver for an IDI such as GS Bank USA, upon its insolvency or in certain other events, the FDIC has broad powers, including the power: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; To transfer any of the IDI&#8217;s assets and liabilities to a new obligor, including a newly formed &#8220;bridge&#8221; bank, without the approval of the depository institution&#8217;s creditors; 

##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; To enforce the IDI&#8217;s contracts pursuant to their terms without regard to any provisions triggered by the appointment of the FDIC in that capacity; or 

##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; To repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the IDI is a party, the performance of which is determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the repudiation or disaffirmance of which is determined by the FDIC to promote the orderly administration of the IDI. 

##TABLE_END 

In addition, the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses against an IDI would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims, including deposits at non-U.S.

branches and claims of debtholders of the IDI, in the &#8220;liquidation or other resolution&#8221; of such an institution by any receiver. As a result, whether or not the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of GS Bank USA, the debtholders (other than depositors at U.S. branches) would be treated differently from, and could receive, if anything, substantially less than, the depositors at U.S. branches of GS Bank USA. 

The Dodd-Frank Act created a resolution regime (known as OLA) for BHCs and their affiliates that are systemically important. Under OLA, the FDIC may be appointed as receiver for the systemically important institution and its failed non-bank

subsidiaries if, upon the recommendation of applicable regulators, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury determines, among other things, that the institution is in default or in danger of default, that the institution&#8217;s failure would have serious adverse effects on the U.S. financial system and that resolution under OLA would avoid or mitigate those effects. 

If the FDIC is appointed as receiver under OLA, then the powers of the receiver, and the rights and obligations of creditors and other parties who have dealt with the institution, would be determined under OLA, and not under the bankruptcy or insolvency law that would otherwise apply. The powers of the receiver under OLA were generally based on the powers of the FDIC as receiver for depository institutions under the FDIA. 

Substantial differences in the rights of creditors exist between OLA and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC under OLA to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances, the use of an administrative claims procedure to determine creditors&#8217; claims (as opposed to the judicial procedure utilized in bankruptcy proceedings), and the right of the FDIC to transfer claims to a &#8220;bridge&#8221; entity. In addition, OLA limits the ability of creditors to enforce certain contractual cross-defaults against affiliates of the institution in receivership. The FDIC has issued a notice that it would likely resolve a failed FHC by transferring its assets to a &#8220;bridge&#8221; holding company under its &#8220;single point of entry&#8221; or &#8220;SPOE&#8221; strategy pursuant to OLA.

&#160;

Deposit Insurance.

Deposits at GS Bank USA have the benefit of FDIC insurance up to the applicable limits. The FDIC&#8217;s Deposit Insurance Fund is funded by assessments on IDIs. GS Bank USA&#8217;s assessment (subject to adjustment by the FDIC) is currently based on its average total consolidated assets less its average tangible equity during the assessment period, its supervisory ratings and specified forward-looking financial measures used to calculate the assessment rate. In addition, deposits at GSIB are covered by the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme and deposits at GSBE are covered by the German statutory deposit protection scheme and a voluntary top-up

scheme, in each case up to the applicable limits. 

Prompt Corrective Action.

The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) requires the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies to take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; in respect of depository institutions that do not meet specified capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital categories for FDIC-insured banks, such as GS Bank USA: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. 

An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than is indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, as the capital category of an institution declines. Failure to meet the capital requirements could also require a depository institution to raise capital. Ultimately, critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator, as described in &#8220;Insolvency of an IDI or a BHC&#8221; above. 

The prompt corrective action regulations do not apply to BHCs. However, the FRB is authorized to take appropriate action at the BHC level, based upon the undercapitalized status of the BHC&#8217;s depository institution subsidiaries. In certain instances, relating to an undercapitalized depository institution subsidiary, the BHC would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary&#8217;s capital restoration plan and might be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitments on that guarantee. Furthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy of the BHC, the guarantee would take priority over the BHC&#8217;s general unsecured creditors, as described in &#8220;Source of Strength&#8221; above. 

Volcker Rule and Other Restrictions on Activities.

As a BHC, we are subject to limitations on the types of business activities we may engage in. 

Volcker Rule.

The Volcker Rule prohibits &#8220;proprietary trading,&#8221; but permits activities such as underwriting, market making and risk-mitigation hedging, requires an extensive compliance program and includes additional reporting and record-keeping requirements. 

In addition, the Volcker Rule limits the sponsorship of, and investment in, &#8220;covered funds&#8221; (as defined in the rule) by banking entities, including us. It also limits certain types of transactions between us and our sponsored and advised funds, similar to the limitations on transactions between depository institutions and their affiliates. Covered funds include our private equity funds, certain of our credit and real estate funds, our hedge funds and certain other investment structures. The limitation on investments in covered funds requires us to limit our investment in each such fund to 3% or less of the fund&#8217;s net asset value, and to limit our aggregate investment in all such funds to 3% or less of our Tier 1 capital. 

The FRB has extended the conformance period to July 2022 for our investments in, and relationships with, certain legacy &#8220;illiquid funds&#8221; (as defined in the Volcker Rule) that were in place prior to December 2013. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K

for further information about our investments in such funds. 

The FRB, OCC, FDIC, CFTC and SEC (Volcker Rule regulators) finalized amendments in October 2019 to their regulations implementing the Volcker Rule, tailoring compliance requirements based on the size and scope of a banking entity&#8217;s trading activities and clarifying and amending certain definitions, requirements and exemptions. Compliance with these amendments became effective in January 2021. In addition, in June 2020 the Volcker Rule regulators finalized their previously proposed amendments to the Volcker Rule&#8217;s regulations relating to covered funds. These amendments established new exclusions from the covered fund definition for certain types of investment vehicles, modified the eligibility criteria for certain existing exclusions, and clarified and modified other provisions governing banking entities&#8217; investments in and other transactions and relationships involving covered funds, including clarifying that investments alongside covered funds are not treated as investments in covered funds subject to the 3% limitation noted above if certain conditions are met. These amendments became effective in October 2020.

&#160;

Other Restrictions.

FHCs generally can engage in a broader range of financial and related activities than are otherwise permissible for BHCs as long as they continue to meet the eligibility requirements for FHCs. The broader range of permissible activities for FHCs includes underwriting, dealing and making markets in securities and making investments in non-FHCs

(merchant banking activities). In addition, certain FHCs, including us, are permitted to engage in certain commodities activities in the U.S. that may otherwise be impermissible for BHCs, so long as the assets held pursuant to these activities do not equal 5% or more of their consolidated assets. 

The FRB, however, has the authority to limit an FHC&#8217;s ability to conduct activities that would otherwise be permissible, and will likely do so if the FHC does not satisfactorily meet certain requirements of the FRB. For example, if an FHC or any of its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries ceases to maintain its status as well-capitalized or well-managed, the FRB may impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements, as well as additional limitations or conditions. If the deficiencies persist, the FHC may be required to divest its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries or to cease engaging in activities other than the business of banking and certain closely related activities. 

If any IDI subsidiary of an FHC fails to maintain at least a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; rating under the Community Reinvestment Act, the FHC would be subject to restrictions on certain new activities and acquisitions. 

In addition, we are required to obtain prior FRB approval before engaging in certain banking and other financial activities both within and outside the U.S. 

The FRB issued a proposed rule in September 2016 which, if adopted, would impose new requirements on the physical commodity activities and certain merchant banking activities of FHCs, including, among other things, additional capital requirements, stringent quantitative limits on permissible physical trading activity, and new public reporting requirements. In addition, in a September 2016 report, the FRB recommended that Congress repeal authorities for FHCs to engage in merchant banking activities and for certain FHCs to engage in certain otherwise impermissible commodities activities. 

Since January 2020, U.S. G-SIBs,

like us, have been required to comply with a rule regarding single counterparty credit limits, which imposes more stringent requirements for credit exposures among major financial institutions. In addition, in 2011, the FRB proposed early remediation requirements, which are modeled on the prompt corrective action regime, described in &#8220;Prompt Corrective Action&#8221; above, but are designed to require action to begin in earlier stages of a company&#8217;s financial distress, based on a range of triggers, including capital and leverage, stress test results, liquidity and risk management. 

The New York State banking law imposes lending limits (which take into account credit exposure from derivative transactions) and other requirements that could impact the manner and scope of GS Bank USA&#8217;s activities. 

The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have issued guidance that focuses on transaction structures and risk management frameworks and that outlines high-level principles for safe-and-sound

leveraged lending, including underwriting standards, valuation and stress testing. This guidance has, among other things, limited the percentage amount of debt that can be included in certain transactions. 

As a German credit institution, GSBE will become subject to Volcker Rule-type prohibitions in Germany on &#8220;proprietary trading&#8221; as well as lending and guarantee businesses with hedge funds and other highly-leveraged funds once its assets exceed certain thresholds. 

U.K. banks that have over &#163;25 billion of core retail deposits are required to separate their retail banking services from their investment and international banking activities, commonly known as &#8220;ring-fencing.&#8221; GSIB is not currently subject to the ring-fencing requirement and if it were to become subject to it, GSIB would need to make significant operational and structural changes. 

Broker-Dealer and Securities Regulation 

Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including sales methods, trade practices, use and safekeeping of clients&#8217; funds and securities, capital structure, record-keeping, the financing of clients&#8217; purchases, and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. In the U.S., the SEC is the federal agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws. GS&#38;Co. is registered as a broker-dealer, a municipal advisor and an investment adviser with the SEC and as a broker-dealer in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. U.S. self-regulatory organizations, such as FINRA and the NYSE, adopt rules that apply to, and examine, broker-dealers such as GS&#38;Co. 

&#160;

U.S. state securities and other U.S. regulators also have regulatory or oversight authority over GS&#38;Co. Similarly, our businesses are also subject to regulation by various non-U.S.

governmental and regulatory bodies and self-regulatory authorities in virtually all countries where we have offices, as described further below. For a description of net capital requirements applicable to GS&#38;Co., see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital &#8212; U.S. Regulated Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.

In Europe, we provide broker-dealer services, including through GSI, GSBE and GSPIC, that are subject to oversight by national regulators. These services are regulated in accordance with U.K., E.U. and national laws and regulations. These laws require, among other things, compliance with certain capital adequacy and liquidity standards, customer protection requirements and market conduct and trade reporting rules. Certain of our European subsidiaries are also regulated by the securities, derivatives and commodities exchanges of which they are members. 

Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL), our regulated Japanese broker-dealer, is subject to capital requirements imposed by Japan&#8217;s Financial Services Agency. GSJCL is also regulated by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Osaka Exchange, the Tokyo Financial Exchange, the Japan Securities Dealers Association, the Tokyo Commodity Exchange, the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance, among others. 

The Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Korean Financial Supervisory Service, the Reserve Bank of India, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, 

the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Securities Exchange, among others, regulate various of our subsidiaries and also have capital standards and other requirements comparable to the rules of the SEC. 

Our exchange-based market-making activities are subject to extensive regulation by a number of securities exchanges. As a market maker on exchanges, we are required to maintain orderly markets in the securities to which we are assigned. 

In the E.U. and the U.K., MiFID II includes extensive market structure reforms, such as the establishment of new trading venue categories for the purposes of discharging the obligation to trade OTC derivatives on a trading platform and enhanced pre-

and post-trade transparency covering a wider range of financial instruments. In equities, MiFID II introduced volume caps on non-transparent

liquidity trading for trading venues, limited the use of broker-dealer crossing networks and created a new regime for systematic internalizers, which are investment firms that execute client transactions outside a trading venue. Additional control requirements were introduced for algorithmic trading, high frequency trading and direct electronic access. Commodities trading firms are required to calculate their positions and adhere to specific position limits. Other reforms introduced enhanced transaction reporting, the publication of best execution data by investment firms and trading venues, transparency on costs and charges of service to investors, changes to the way investment managers can pay for the receipt of investment research, rules limiting the payment and receipt of soft commissions and other forms of inducements, and mandatory unbundling for broker-dealers between execution and other major services. 

The SEC requires broker-dealers to act in the best interest of their customers, and also issued an interpretation clarifying the SEC&#8217;s views of the existing fiduciary duty owed by investment advisers to their clients. Additionally, the SEC adopted a rule that requires broker-dealers and investment advisers to provide a standardized, short-form disclosure highlighting services offered, applicable standards of conduct, fees and costs, the differences between brokerage and advisory services, and any conflicts of interest. Requirements under these rules became effective in June 2020. Several states have adopted or proposed adopting uniform fiduciary duty standards applicable to broker-dealers and advisers. 

The SEC, FINRA and regulators in various non-U.S.

jurisdictions have imposed both conduct-based and disclosure-based requirements with respect to research reports and research analysts and may impose additional regulations. 

GS&#38;Co., GS Bank USA and other U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to rules adopted by U.S. federal agencies pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act that require any person who organizes or initiates certain asset-backed securities transactions to retain a portion (generally, at least five percent) of any credit risk that the person conveys to a third party. For certain securitization transactions, retention by third-party purchasers may satisfy this requirement. Certain of our non-U.S.

subsidiaries, including GSI, are subject to risk retention requirements in connection with securitization activities.

Swaps, Derivatives and Commodities Regulation 

The commodity futures, commodity options and swaps industry in the U.S. is subject to regulation under the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). The CFTC is the U.S. federal agency charged with the administration of the CEA. In addition, the SEC is the U.S. federal agency charged with the regulation of security-based swaps. The rules and regulations of various self-regulatory organizations, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, other futures exchanges and the National Futures Association, also govern commodity futures, commodity options and swaps activities. 

The terms &#8220;swaps&#8221; and &#8220;security-based swaps&#8221; include a wide variety of derivative instruments in addition to those conventionally referred to as swaps (including certain forward contracts and options), and relate to a wide variety of underlying assets or obligations, including currencies, commodities, interest or other monetary rates, yields, indices, securities, credit events, loans and other financial obligations. 

CFTC rules require registration of swap dealers, mandatory clearing and execution of interest rate and credit default swaps and real-time public reporting and adherence to business conduct standards for all in-scope

swaps. GS&#38;Co. and other subsidiaries, including GS Bank USA, GSI, GSBE and J. Aron &#38; Company LLC (J. Aron), are registered with the CFTC as swap dealers. In July 2020, the CFTC adopted final rules establishing capital requirements for swap dealers that are not subject to the capital rules of a prudential regulator, such as the FRB. The CFTC also adopted financial reporting requirements for covered swap entities and amended existing capital rules for CFTC-registered futures commission merchants to provide explicit capital requirements for proprietary positions in swaps and security-based swaps that are not cleared by a clearing organization. Compliance with the final rules is required by October 6, 2021. Certain of our registered swap dealers, including J. Aron, will be subject to the CFTC&#8217;s capital requirements. 

Our affiliates registered as swap dealers are subject to the margin rules issued by the CFTC (in the case of our non-bank

swap dealers) and the FRB (in the case of GS Bank USA and GSBE). The rules for variation margin have become effective, and those for initial margin will phase in through September 2022 depending on certain activity levels of the swap dealer and the relevant counterparty. Inter-affiliate transactions under the CFTC margin rules are generally exempt from initial margin requirements. In June 2020, the FRB adopted a final rule that exempts inter-affiliate swaps from its initial margin requirements subject to certain thresholds. 

The CFTC has adopted rules relating to cross-border regulation of swaps, business conduct and registration requirements. The CFTC has entered into agreements with certain non-U.S.

regulators, including in the E.U., regarding the cross-border regulation of derivatives and the mutual recognition of cross-border clearing houses, and has approved substituted compliance with certain non-U.S.

regulations, including E.U. regulations, related to certain business conduct requirements and margin rules. The U.S. prudential regulators have not yet made a determination with respect to substituted compliance for transactions subject to non-U.S.

margin rules. 

Similar types of swap regulation have been proposed or adopted in jurisdictions outside the U.S., including in the E.U. and Japan. For example, the E.U. and the U.K. have established regulatory requirements relating to portfolio reconciliation and reporting, clearing certain OTC derivatives and margining for uncleared derivatives activities under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR). 

SEC rules govern the registration and regulation of security-based swap dealers. The SEC adopted a number of rules and rule amendments for security-based swap dealers in 2019, including (i) capital, margin and segregation requirements, (ii) record-keeping, reporting and notification requirements, and (iii) the application of risk mitigation techniques to uncleared portfolios of security-based swaps and the cross-border application of certain security-based swap requirements. The compliance date for these SEC rules, as well as SEC rules addressing registration requirements and business conduct standards, is generally October 2021. We anticipate that certain of our subsidiaries will register with the SEC as security-based swap dealers and become subject to the SEC&#8217;s regulations regarding security-based swaps.

The CFTC has adopted position limit rules that will limit the size of positions in physical commodity derivatives that can be held by any entity, or any group of affiliates or other parties trading under common control, subject to certain exemptions, such as for bona fide hedging positions. However, effective in 2023, the new rules will eliminate the risk management exemption, which allowed swap dealers to claim an exemption for the hedging of swap-related risks. The new CFTC position limits will apply to certain positions in swaps, as well as futures and options on futures, on physical commodities, and limits will apply to both physically and cash settled positions. Currently, position limits on futures on physical commodities are administered by the relevant exchanges, with the exception of futures on certain agricultural commodities, which are administered by the CFTC. Under the CFTC&#8217;s position limit rules, all futures and options on futures on an enumerated list of physical commodities, including certain agricultural, energy and metals commodities, as well as related swaps, will be subject to the CFTC&#8217;s position limits. The new position limit rules impose limits in the spot month only (i.e., during the delivery period for the physical commodities, which is typically a period of several days), although the CFTC may in the future impose limits in non-spot

months as well. CFTC spot and non-spot

month limits will continue to apply to futures on certain legacy agricultural commodities. 

J. Aron is authorized by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to sell wholesale physical power at market-based rates. As a FERC-authorized power marketer, J.

Certain of our European subsidiaries, including GSAMI in the U.K. and GSBE in the E.U., are subject to MiFID II and/or related regulations (including the U.K. legislation making such regulations part of U.K. law), which govern the approval, organizational, marketing and reporting requirements of U.K. or E.U.-based investment managers and the ability of investment fund managers located outside the E.U. or the U.K. to access those markets.

Compensation Practices 

Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the FRB and, with respect to some of our subsidiaries and employees, by other regulatory bodies worldwide. 

The FSB has released standards for local regulators to implement certain compensation principles for banks and other financial companies designed to encourage sound compensation practices. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have provided guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at banking organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices. The guidance sets forth the following three key principles with respect to incentive compensation arrangements: (i) the arrangements should provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk; (ii) the arrangements should be compatible with effective controls and risk management; and (iii) the arrangements should be supported by strong corporate governance. The guidance provides that supervisory findings with respect to incentive compensation will be incorporated, as appropriate, into the organization&#8217;s supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The guidance also notes that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk management, control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization&#8217;s safety and soundness. 

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the U.S. financial regulators, including the FRB and SEC, to adopt rules on incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets. The U.S. financial regulators proposed revised rules in 2016, which have not been finalized. 

The NYDFS issued guidance in October 2016 emphasizing that its regulated banking institutions, including GS Bank USA, must ensure that any incentive compensation arrangements tied to employee performance indicators are subject to effective risk management, oversight and control. 

In the E.U., the CRR and CRD IV include compensation provisions designed to implement the FSB&#8217;s compensation standards. These rules have been implemented by E.U. member states and in the U.K. and, among other things, limit the ratio of variable to fixed compensation of all employees at GSBE and certain employees at our other operating subsidiaries in the E.U. and in the U.K., including those employees identified as having a material impact on the risk profile of regulated entities. CRR II and CRD V amend certain aspects of these rules, including, among other things, by increasing minimum variable compensation deferral periods. Substantially similar requirements apply in the U.K. in relation to GSI and GSIB. 

The E.U. has also introduced rules regulating compensation for certain persons providing services to certain investment funds. These requirements are in addition to the guidance issued by U.S. financial regulators and the Dodd-Frank Act provision, each as described above. 

Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Bribery Rules and Regulations 

The U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (PATRIOT Act), contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and mandates the implementation of various regulations applicable to all financial institutions, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and obligations to monitor client transactions and report suspicious activities. Through these and other provisions, the BSA and the PATRIOT Act seek to promote the identification of parties that may be involved in terrorism, money laundering or other suspicious activities. Anti-money laundering laws outside the U.S. contain some similar provisions. 

In January 2021, the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (AMLA), which amends the BSA, was enacted. The AMLA is intended to comprehensively reform and modernize U.S. anti-money laundering laws. Among other things, the AMLA codifies a risk-based approach to anti-money laundering compliance for financial institutions; requires the development of standards by the U.S. Department of the Treasury for evaluating technology and internal processes for BSA compliance; and expands enforcement- and investigation-related authority, including a significant expansion in the available sanctions for certain BSA violations and instituting BSA whistleblower incentives and protections. Many of the statutory provisions in the AMLA will require additional rulemakings, reports and other measures, and the impact of the AMLA will depend on, among other things, rulemaking and implementation guidance. 

In addition, we are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the U.K. Bribery Act, relating to corrupt and illegal payments to, and hiring practices with regard to, government officials and others. The scope of the types of payments or other benefits covered by these laws is very broad and regulators are frequently using enforcement proceedings to define the scope of these laws. The obligation of financial institutions to identify their clients, to monitor for and report suspicious transactions, to monitor direct and indirect payments to politically exposed persons, to respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, and to share information with other financial institutions, has required the implementation and maintenance of internal practices, procedures and controls.

Privacy and Cyber Security Regulation 

Our businesses are subject to laws and regulations enacted by U.S. federal and state governments, the E.U., the U.K. or other non-U.S.

jurisdictions and/or enacted by various regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees or others, including the GLB Act, the E.U.&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the U.K.&#8217;s Data Protection Act 2018, the Japanese Personal Information Protection Act, the Hong Kong Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, the Australian Privacy Act, the Brazilian Bank Secrecy Law, and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA). The GDPR has heightened our privacy compliance obligations, impacted certain of our businesses&#8217; collection, processing and retention of personal data and imposed strict standards for reporting data breaches. The GDPR also provides for significant penalties for non-compliance.

In addition, the CCPA imposes compliance obligations with regard to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. The substantive obligations under the 2020 amendments to the CCPA become effective on January 1, 2023. In addition, several other states and non-U.S.

jurisdictions have enacted, or are proposing, privacy and data protection laws similar to the GDPR and the CCPA. 

The NYDFS also requires financial institutions regulated by the NYDFS, including GS Bank USA, to, among other things, (i) establish and maintain a cyber security program designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their information systems; (ii) implement and maintain a written cyber security policy setting forth policies and procedures for the protection of their information systems and nonpublic information; and (iii) designate a Chief Information Security Officer. 

In December 2020, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies released a proposed rule regarding notification requirements for banking organizations related to significant computer security incidents. Under the proposal, a BHC or state member bank, such as Group Inc. or GS Bank USA, would be required to notify the FRB within 36 hours of incidents that could result in the banking organization&#8217;s inability to deliver services to a material portion of its customer base, jeopardize the viability of key operations of the banking organization, or impact the stability of the financial sector.

Cautionary Statement Pursuant to the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 

We have included in this Form 10-K,

Forward-looking statements are not historical facts or statements of current conditions, but instead represent only our beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside our control. 

By identifying these statements for you in this manner, we are alerting you to the possibility that our actual results, financial condition, liquidity and capital actions may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results, financial condition and liquidity in these forward-looking statements.

Statements about our target ROE, ROTE, efficiency ratio and expense savings, and how they can be achieved, are based on our current expectations regarding our business prospects and are subject to the risk that we may be unable to achieve our targets due to, among other things, changes in our business mix, lower profitability of new business initiatives, increases in technology and other costs to launch and bring new business initiatives to scale, and increases in liquidity requirements. 

Statements about our target ROE, ROTE and CET1 capital ratio, and how they can be achieved, are based on our current expectations regarding the capital requirements applicable to us and are subject to the risk that our actual capital requirements may be higher than currently anticipated because of, among other factors, changes in the regulatory capital requirements applicable to us resulting from changes in regulations or the interpretation or application of existing regulations or changes in the nature and composition of our activities. 

Statements about the timing, costs, profitability, benefits and other aspects of business and expense savings initiatives, the level and composition of more durable revenues and increases in market share are based on our current expectations regarding our ability to implement these initiatives and actual results may differ, possibly materially, from current expectations due to, among other things, a delay in the timing of these initiatives, increased competition and an inability to reduce expenses and grow businesses with durable revenues. 

Statements about the level of future compensation expense, including as a percentage of both operating expenses and revenues net of provision for credit losses, and our efficiency ratio as our platform business initiatives reach scale are subject to the risks that the compensation and other costs to operate our businesses, including platform initiatives, may be greater than currently expected. 

Statements about our investment banking transaction backlog are subject to the risk that such transactions may be modified or may not be completed at all and related net revenues may not be realized or may be materially less than expected. Important factors that could have such a result include, for underwriting transactions, a decline or weakness in general economic conditions, an outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities markets or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, for financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate financing, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For information about other important factors that could adversely affect our investment banking transactions, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

Statements about the projected growth of our deposits and other funding, asset liability management and funding strategies and related interest expense savings, and our installment loan and credit card businesses, are subject to the risk that actual growth and savings may differ, possibly materially, from that currently anticipated due to, among other things, changes in interest rates and competition from other similar products. 

Statements about planned 2021 parent vanilla debt issuances and the amount, composition and location of GCLA we expect to hold are subject to the risk that actual issuances and GCLA levels may differ, possibly materially, from that currently expected due to changes in market conditions, business opportunities or our funding and projected liquidity needs. 

Statements about our expected provisions for credit losses (including those related to our co-branded

credit card relationship with General Motors) are subject to the risk that actual credit losses may differ and our expectations may change, possibly materially, from that currently anticipated due to, among other things, changes to the composition of our loan portfolio and changes in the economic environment in future periods and our forecasts of future economic conditions, as well as changes in our models, policies and other management judgments. 

Statements about our NSFR and SCB are based on our current interpretation and expectations of the relevant rules, and reflect significant assumptions about how our NSFR and SCB are calculated. Our actual SCB will depend on the results of the applicable supervisory stress tests, and the methods used to calculate our NSFR and SCB may differ, possibly materially, from those used to calculate our NSFR and SCB for future disclosures. 

Statements about our future effective income tax rate are subject to the risk that it may differ from the anticipated rate indicated in such statements, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in the tax rates applicable to us, changes in our earnings mix, our profitability and entities in which we generate profits, the assumptions we have made in forecasting our expected tax rate, as well as any corporate tax legislation that may be enacted or any guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. 

Statements about the future state of our liquidity and regulatory capital ratios (including our SCB and G-SIB

surcharge), and our prospective capital distributions (including dividends and repurchases), are subject to the risk that our actual liquidity, regulatory capital ratios and capital distributions may differ, possibly materially, from what is currently expected due to, among other things, the need to use capital to support clients, increased regulatory requirements and changes to the composition of our balance sheet. 

Statements about the risk exposure related to the asset recovery guarantee provided to the Government of Malaysia are subject to the risk that the actual value of assets and proceeds from assets seized and returned to the Government of Malaysia may be less than currently anticipated. Statements about the application for and pursuit of exemptions and authorizations from regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Department of Labor, in connection with the settlements relating to 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) and the progress or the status of remediation activities relating to 1MDB are based on our expectations regarding the prospects for receiving the exemptions and authorizations and the current remediation plans. Accordingly, our ability to receive the exemptions and authorizations and complete the remediation activities may change, possibly materially, from what is currently expected. 

Statements about our objectives in management of our human capital, including our diversity goals, are based on our current expectations and are subject to the risk that we may not achieve these objectives and goals due to, among other things, competition in recruiting and attracting diverse candidates and unsuccessful efforts in retaining diverse employees. 

Statements about our plans for our people to return to our offices are based on our current expectations and that return may be delayed due to, among other factors, future events that are unpredictable, including the course of the COVID-19

pandemic, responses of governmental authorities and the availability, use and effectiveness of vaccines.
