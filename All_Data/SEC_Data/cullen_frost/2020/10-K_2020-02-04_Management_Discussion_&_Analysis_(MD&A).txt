Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Accounting Estimates 

We follow accounting and reporting policies that conform, in all material respects, to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and to general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. While we base estimates on historical experience, current information and other factors deemed to be relevant, actual results could differ from those estimates. 

We consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if (i) the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and (ii) different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial statements. 

Accounting policies related to the allowance for loan losses are considered to be critical, as these policies involve considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management. The allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, which represents management&#8217;s best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans. The allowance, in the judgment of management, is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. Our allowance for loan loss methodology includes allowance allocations calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 310, &#8220;Receivables&#8221; and allowance allocations calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 450, &#8220;Contingencies.&#8221; The level of the allowance reflects management&#8217;s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations, specific credit risks, loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, present economic, political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio, as well as trends in the foregoing. Portions of the allowance may be allocated for specific credits; however, the entire allowance is available for any credit that, in management&#8217;s judgment, should be charged off. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the performance of our loan portfolio, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward loan classifications. See the section captioned &#8220;Allowance for Loan Losses&#8221; elsewhere in this discussion and Note 3 - Loans in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data elsewhere in this report for further details of the risk factors considered by management in estimating the necessary level of the allowance for loan losses. 

Overview 

The following discussion and analysis presents the more significant factors that affected our financial condition as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and results of operations for each of the years then ended. Refer to Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 6, 2019 (the &#8220; 2018 Form 10-K &#8221;) for a discussion and analysis of the more significant factors that affected periods prior to 2018 . 

Certain reclassifications have been made to make prior periods comparable. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. From time to time, we have acquired various small businesses through our insurance subsidiary. None of these acquisitions had a significant impact on our financial statements. We account for acquisitions using the acquisition method, and as such, the results of operations of acquired companies are included from the date of acquisition. 

Taxable-equivalent adjustments are the result of increasing income from tax-free loans and investments by an amount equal to the taxes that would be paid if the income were fully taxable, thus making tax-exempt yields comparable to 

taxable asset yields. Taxable equivalent adjustments were based upon a 21% income tax in 2019 and 2018 and a 35% income tax rate for prior years. 

Dollar amounts in tables are stated in thousands, except for per share amounts. 

Results of Operations 

Net income available to common shareholders totaled $435.5 million , or $6.84 diluted per common share, in 2019 compared to $446.9 million , or $6.90 diluted per common share, in 2018 and $356.1 million , or $5.51 diluted per common share, in 2017 .

##TABLE_END

Net income available to common shareholders decreased $11.3 million for 2019 compared to 2018 . The decrease was primarily the result of a $55.8 million increase in non-interest expense, a $12.1 million increase in the provision for loan losses and a $2.1 million increase in income tax expense partly offset by a $46.1 million increase in net interest income and a $12.6 million increase in non-interest income. 

Details of the changes in the various components of net income are further discussed below. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, which are used to fund those assets. Net interest income is our largest source of revenue, representing 73.4% of total revenue during 2019 . Net interest margin is the ratio of taxable-equivalent net interest income to average earning assets for the period. The level of interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities impact net interest income and net interest margin. 

The Federal Reserve influences the general market rates of interest, including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions. Our loan portfolio is significantly affected by changes in the prime interest rate. The prime rate began 2017 at 3.75% and increased 75 basis points (25 basis points in each of March, June and December) to end the year at 4.50%. During 2018, the prime rate increased 100 basis points (25 basis points in each of March, June, September and December) to end the year at 5.50%. During 2019, the prime rate decreased 50 basis points during the third quarter of 2019 (25 basis points in each of August and September) and 25 basis points in October 2019 to end the year at 4.75%. Our loan portfolio is also significantly impacted, by changes in the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). At December 31, 2019 , the one-month and three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rates were 1.76% and 1.90%, respectively, while at December 31, 2018 , the one-month and three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rates were 2.50% and 2.81% respectively, and at December 31, 2017 , the one-month and three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rates were 1.56% 

and 1.69% respectively. The effective federal funds rate, which is the cost of immediately available overnight funds, started 2017 at 0.75% and increased 75 basis points (25 basis points in each of March, June and December) to end the year at 1.50%. During 2018, the effective federal funds rate increased 100 basis points (25 basis points in each of March, June, September and December) to end the year at 2.50%. During 2019, the effective federal funds rate decreased 50 basis points during the third quarter of 2019 (25 basis points in each of August and September) and 25 basis points in October 2019 to end the year at 1.75%. 

We are primarily funded by core deposits, with non-interest-bearing demand deposits historically being a significant source of funds. This lower-cost funding base is expected to have a positive impact on our net interest income and net interest margin in a rising interest rate environment. Federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits were repealed in 2011. Nonetheless, we have not experienced any significant additional costs as a result. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk elsewhere in this report for information about our sensitivity to interest rates. Further analysis of the components of our net interest margin is presented below. 

The following table presents the changes in taxable-equivalent net interest income and identifies the changes due to differences in the average volume of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the changes due to changes in the average interest rate on those assets and liabilities. The changes in net interest income due to changes in both average volume and average interest rate have been allocated to the average volume change or the average interest rate change in proportion to the absolute amounts of the change in each. The comparison between 2018 and 2017 includes an additional change factor detailing the effect of the reduction in the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted on December 22, 2017. See Note 13 - Income Taxes in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for information regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Our consolidated average balance sheets along with an analysis of taxable-equivalent net interest income are presented in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.

##TABLE_END

Taxable-equivalent net interest income for 2019 increased $48.0 million , or 4.6% , compared to 2018 .The increase was primarily related to increases in the average yields on loans, taxable securities and interest-bearing deposits combined with increases in the average volumes of loans and both taxable and tax-exempt securities. The impact of these items was partly offset by increases in the average rates paid on and average volumes of interest-bearing deposits and other borrowed funds, a decrease in the average volume of interest bearing deposits (primarily excess reserves held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) and a decrease in the average yield on tax-exempt securities. 

The average volume of interest-earning assets for 2019 increased $700.8 million , or 2.4% , compared to 2018 . The increase in earning assets included an $825.9 million increase in average taxable securities, an $822.6 million increase in average loans and a $406.1 million increase in average tax-exempt securities partly offset by a $1.4 billion decrease in average interest-bearing deposits, federal funds sold and resell agreements. 

The taxable-equivalent net interest margin increased 11 basis points from 3.64% during 2018 to 3.75% during 2019 . The average yield on interest-earning assets increased 24 basis points from 3.96% during 2018 to 4.20% during 2019 and average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased 19 basis points from 0.55% in 2018 to 0.74% in 2019 . The average yield on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities are primarily impacted by changes in market interest rates as well as changes in the volume and relative mix of the underlying assets and liabilities. The increase in the taxable-equivalent net interest margin was primarily related to increases in the average yields on loans; taxable securities; interest-bearing deposits; and federal funds sold and resell agreements partly offset by increases in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits and other borrowed funds and a decrease in the average yield on tax-exempt securities. The taxable-equivalent net interest margin was also positively impacted by a decrease in the relative proportion of interest-earning assets invested in lower-yielding interest-bearing deposits (primarily excess reserves held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve). 

The average taxable-equivalent yield on loans was 5.17% during 2019 compared to 4.95% during 2018 , increasing 22 basis points during 2019 compared to 2018 . The average taxable-equivalent yield on loans was positively impacted by higher average market interest rates in 2019 compared to 2018. The average volume of loans increased $822.6 million , or 6.0% , in 2019 compared to 2018 . Loans made up approximately 48.8% of average interest-earning assets during 2019 compared to 47.1% during 2018 . 

The average taxable-equivalent yield on securities was 3.40% during 2019 compared to 3.38% during 2018 . The average taxable-equivalent yield on securities was positively impacted by increases in the average volume of tax-exempt and taxable securities and an increase in the average yield on taxable securities but was negatively impacted by a decrease in the average yield on tax-exempt securities. The average yield on taxable securities was 2.33% during 2019 compared to 2.03% during 2018 while the average yield on tax exempt securities was 4.06% during 2019 compared to 4.11% during 2018 . The average taxable-equivalent yield on tax-exempt securities decreased 5 basis points during 2019 compared to 2018 , while the average yield on taxable securities increased 30 basis points during 2019 compared to 2018 . Tax exempt securities made up approximately 62.0% of total average securities during 2019 , compared to 65.0% during 2018 . The average volume of total securities increased $1.2 billion , or 10.2% , during 2019 compared to 2018 . Securities made up approximately 44.9% of average interest-earning assets in 2019 compared to 41.7% in 2018 . 

Average interest-bearing deposits, federal funds sold and resell agreements during 2019 decreased $1.4 billion , or 42.1% , compared to 2018 . Interest-bearing deposits, federal funds sold and resell agreements made up approximately 6.3% of average interest-earning assets during 2019 compared to approximately 11.1% in 2018 . The decrease in the average volume of interest-bearing deposits, federal funds sold and resell agreements was primarily due to a decrease in the average volume of our excess reserves held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve during 2019 compared to 2018 as such funds were invested in higher yielding loans and securities. The combined average yield on federal funds sold and resell agreements and interest-bearing deposits was 2.21% during 2019 and 1.94% during 2018 . 

The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 0.74% during 2019 , increasing 19 basis points from 0.55% during 2018 . Average deposits increased $124.2 million , or 0.5% , in 2019 compared to 2018 . Average interest-bearing deposits increased $522.6 million in 2019 compared to 2018 , while average non-interest-bearing deposits decreased $398.4 million in 2019 compared to 2018 . The ratio of average interest-bearing deposits to total average deposits was 60.8% in 2019 compared to 59.1% in 2018 . The average cost of deposits is primarily impacted by changes in market interest rates as well as changes in the volume and relative mix of interest-bearing deposits. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits and total deposits was 0.62% and 0.38% in 2019 compared to 0.49% and 0.29% in 2018 . The average cost of deposits during 2019 was impacted by higher average interest rates paid on most of our interest-bearing deposit products, particularly during the first half of 2019, as a result of higher average market interest rates and market competition. 

Our taxable-equivalent net interest spread, which represents the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, was 3.46% in 2019 compared to 3.41% in 2018 . The net interest spread, as well as the net interest margin, will be impacted by future changes in short-term and long-term interest rate levels, as well as the impact from the competitive environment. A discussion of the effects of changing 

interest rates on net interest income is set forth in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk elsewhere in this report. 

Our hedging policies permit the use of various derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, swaptions, caps and floors, to manage exposure to changes in interest rates. Details of our derivatives and hedging activities are set forth in Note 15 - Derivative Financial Instruments in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report. Information regarding the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on our derivative financial instruments is set forth in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk elsewhere in this report. 

Provision for Loan Losses 

The provision for loan losses is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for loan losses after net charge-offs have been deducted to bring the allowance to a level which, in management&#8217;s best estimate, is necessary to absorb inherent losses within the existing loan portfolio. The provision for loan losses totaled $33.8 million in 2019 compared to $21.6 million in 2018 . See the section captioned &#8220;Allowance for Loan Losses&#8221; elsewhere in this discussion for further analysis of the provision for loan losses.

Total non-interest income for 2019 increased $12.6 million , or 3.6% , compared to 2018 . Changes in the various components of non-interest income are discussed in more detail below. 

Trust and Investment Management Fees. Trust and investment management fee income for 2019 increased $7.3 million , or 6.1% , compared to 2018 . Investment fees are the most significant component of trust and investment management fees, making up approximately 82% and 83% of total trust and investment management fees in 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Investment and other custodial account fees are generally based on the market value of assets within a trust account. Volatility in the equity and bond markets impacts the market value of trust assets and the related investment fees. The increase in trust and investment management fees during 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily the result of an increase in trust investment fees (up $5.7 million) due to higher average equity valuations and an increase in the number of accounts. The increase was also partly related to increases in estate fees (up $740 thousand) and oil and gas fees (up $711 thousand). 

At December 31, 2019 , trust assets, including both managed assets and custody assets, were primarily composed of equity securities ( 50.7% of trust assets), fixed income securities ( 35.0% of trust assets) and cash equivalents ( 8.9% of trust assets). The estimated fair value of trust assets was $37.8 billion (including managed assets of $16.4 billion and custody assets of $21.4 billion ) at December 31, 2019 compared to $33.3 billion (including managed assets of $14.7 billion and custody assets of $18.7 billion ) at December 31, 2018 . 

Service Charges on Deposit Accounts. Service charges on deposit accounts for 2019 increased $3.8 million , or 4.5% , compared to 2018 . The increase was primarily related to increases in overdraft/insufficient funds charges on consumer and commercial accounts (up $3.3 million and $551 thousand, respectively) and, to a lesser extent, commercial service charges (up $354 thousand) partly offset by a decrease in consumer service charges (down $421 thousand). Overdraft/insufficient funds charges totaled $42.3 million during 2019 compared to $38.4 million during 2018 . Overdraft/insufficient funds charges included $33.1 million and $29.8 million related to consumer accounts during 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and $9.2 million and $8.7 million related to commercial accounts during 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 

The increases in overdraft/insufficient funds charges were partly due to increases in the number of accounts and transaction volumes. Overdraft/insufficient funds charges were also partly impacted by a change in the fee schedule during the second quarter of 2019. 

Insurance Commissions and Fees. Insurance commissions and fees for 2019 increased $3.4 million , or 6.9% , compared to 2018 . The increase was related to an increase in commission income (up $3.6 million) partly offset by a decrease in contingent income (down $200 thousand). The increase in commission income was primarily related to increases in commissions on commercial lines property and casualty policies, benefit plan commissions and life insurance commissions. The increases in property and casualty commissions and benefit plan commissions were related to increased business volumes and market rates. The increase in life insurance commissions was related to increased business volumes. 

Contingent income totaled $4.1 million in 2019 and $4.3 million in 2018 . Contingent income primarily consists of amounts received from various property and casualty insurance carriers related to the loss performance of insurance policies previously placed. These performance related contingent payments are seasonal in nature and are mostly received during the first quarter of each year. This performance related contingent income totaled $3.0 million in 2019 and $3.2 million in 2018 . The decrease in performance related contingent income during 2019 was related to lower growth within the portfolio partly offset by the impact of improvement in the loss performance of insurance policies previously placed. Contingent income also includes amounts received from various benefit plan insurance companies related to the volume of business generated and/or the subsequent retention of such business. This benefit plan related contingent income totaled $1.2 million in both 2019 and 2018 . 

Interchange and Debit Card Transaction Fees. Interchange fees, or &#8220;swipe&#8221; fees, are charges that merchants pay to us and other card-issuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions. Interchange and debit card transaction fees consist of income from check card usage, point of sale income from PIN-based debit card transactions and ATM service fees. Interchange and debit card transaction fees for 2019 and 2018 are reported on a net basis and totaled $14.9 million and $13.9 million , respectively. The increase in interchange and debit card transaction fees during 2019 , on a net basis, was primarily related to increases in the number of accounts and transaction volumes. Prior to 2018, interchange and debit card transaction fees were reported on a gross basis. A comparison of gross and net interchange and debit card transaction fees for the reported periods is presented in the table below:

##TABLE_END

Other Charges, Commissions and Fees. Other charges, commissions and fees for 2019 decreased $108 thousand , or 0.3% , compared to 2018 . The decrease was primarily related to decreases in processing fees (down $688 thousand), brokerage commissions (down $424 thousand), income from the sale of annuities and mutual funds (down $356 thousand and $190 thousand, respectively) and income from capital markets advisory services (down $323 thousand), among other things, mostly offset by increases in income from the sale of money market funds (up $1.4 million) and letter of credit fees (up $541 thousand), among other things. 

Net Gain/Loss on Securities Transactions . During 2019 and 2018 we sold certain available-for-sale U.S Treasury securities with amortized costs totaling $17.8 billion and $16.8 billion, respectively. We realized a net gain of $127 thousand on the 2019 sales and a net loss of $156 thousand on the 2018 sales. The sales were primarily related to securities purchased and subsequently sold in the same period of their purchase in connection with our tax planning strategies related to the Texas franchise tax. The gross proceeds from the sales of these securities outside of Texas are included in total revenues/receipts from all sources reported for Texas franchise tax purposes, which results in a reduction in the overall percentage of revenues/receipts apportioned to Texas and subjected to taxation under the Texas franchise tax. 

Additionally, during the second quarter of 2019, we sold certain available-for-sale U.S. Treasury securities with an amortized cost totaling $548.9 million and certain available-for-sale municipal securities with an amortized cost totaling $310.7 million. We realized a net gain of $166 thousand on those sales. The proceeds from the sales provided short-term liquidity and were subsequently reinvested in other higher yielding securities. 

Other Non-Interest Income. Other non-interest income for 2019 decreased $3.2 million , or 6.9% , compared to 2018 . The decrease was primarily related to decreases in sundry and other miscellaneous income (down $3.4 million); income from derivative and trading activities, primarily customer-related, (down $1.8 million); and gains on the sale of foreclosed and other assets (down $624 thousand) partly offset by an increase in public finance underwriting fees (up $1.9 million), among other things. Sundry income during 2019 included $2.6 million in VISA check card incentives related to business volumes, $1.7 million related to settlements, $1.7 million related to the recovery of prior write-offs and $278 thousand related to distributions from a private equity investment, among other things, while sundry income for 2018 included $4.5 million related to the recovery of prior write-offs, $2.1 million in VISA check card incentives, $1.7 million related to a distribution from a private equity investment and $997 thousand related to the settlement of an insurance claim, among other things. The fluctuations in public finance underwriting fees and income from customer derivative and trading activities during 2019 were primarily related to changes in business volumes. Other non-interest income also included gains on the sale of various branch and operational facilities totaling $6.7 million during 2019 and $7.0 million during 2018 .

##TABLE_END

Total non-interest expense for 2019 increased $55.8 million , or 7.2% , compared to 2018 . Changes in the various components of non-interest expense are discussed below. 

Salaries and Wages. Salaries and wages increased $24.7 million , or 7.1% , in 2019 compared to 2018 . The increase was primarily related to an increase in salaries, due to an increase in the number of employees and normal annual merit and market increases and, to a lesser extent, an increase in stock compensation. 

Employee Benefits . Employee benefits expense for 2019 increased $8.9 million , or 11.5% , compared to 2018 . The increase was primarily due to increases in expenses related to our defined benefit retirement plans (up $2.3 million), expenses related to our 401(k) plan (up $2.3 million), medical benefits expense (up $2.2 million) and payroll taxes (up $1.4 million). 

Our defined benefit retirement and restoration plans were frozen effective as of December 31, 2001 and were replaced by a profit sharing plan (which was merged with and into our 401(k) plan during 2019). Management believes these actions help reduce the volatility in retirement plan expense. However, we still have funding obligations related to the defined benefit and restoration plans and could recognize retirement expense related to these plans in future years, which would be dependent on the return earned on plan assets, the level of interest rates and employee turnover. We recognized a combined net periodic pension expense of $1.3 million related to our defined benefit retirement and restoration plans in 2019 compared to a combined net periodic pension benefit of $1.0 million in 2018. Future expense/benefits related to these plans is dependent upon a variety of factors, including the actual return on plan assets. For additional information related to our employee benefit plans, see Note 11 - Employee Benefit Plans in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report. 

Net Occupancy. Net occupancy expense for 2019 increased $12.7 million , or 16.5% , compared to 2018 . The increase was primarily related to increases in lease expense (up $11.6 million) and depreciation on leasehold improvements (up $2.0 million) partly offset by a decrease in property taxes (down $2.1 million). The increase in lease expense was primarily related to the commencement of the lease of our new corporate headquarters building in San Antonio and the renewal of the lease associated with our downtown Austin location. The increase was also partly related to renewals of other leases related to existing facilities and new locations, in part related to our expansion within the Houston market area. The increase in depreciation on leasehold improvements was primarily related to the new headquarters location 

in San Antonio and, to a lesser extent, other new locations. The decrease in property taxes was mostly related to our former headquarters location in downtown San Antonio. 

Fluctuations in the foregoing categories of net occupancy expense were primarily related to the commencement of the lease of our new corporate headquarters building in San Antonio and other leases related to existing facilities and our expansion within the Houston market area. 

Technology, Furniture and Equipment. Technology, furniture and equipment expense for 2019 increased $8.9 million , or 10.7% , compared to 2018 . The increase was primarily related to an increase in software maintenance/cloud services expense (up $9.3 million) due to new and renewed software and an increase in volume-based service payments. 

Deposit Insurance. Deposit insurance expense totaled $10.1 million in 2019 compared to $16.4 million in 2018 . The decrease was primarily related to the termination of the quarterly Deposit Insurance Fund surcharge in the fourth quarter of 2018. In August 2016, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) announced that the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio had surpassed 1.15% as of June 30, 2016. As a result, beginning in the third quarter of 2016, the range of initial assessment rates for all institutions was adjusted downward and institutions with $10 billion or more in assets were assessed a quarterly surcharge. The quarterly surcharge was terminated in the fourth quarter of 2018 as the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio as of September 30, 2018 exceeded the statutory minimum of 1.35% required by the Dodd-Frank Act. 

Intangible Amortization . Intangible amortization is primarily related to core deposit intangibles and, to a lesser extent, intangibles related to customer relationships and non-compete agreements. Intangible amortization totaled $1.2 million in 2019 compared to $1.4 million in 2018 . The decrease was primarily related to the completion of amortization of certain previously recognized intangible assets as well as a reduction in the annual amortization rate of certain previously recognized intangible assets as we use an accelerated amortization approach which results in higher amortization rates during the earlier years of the useful lives of intangible assets. See Note 5 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report. 

Other Non-Interest Expense. Other non-interest expense for 2019 increased $7.1 million , or 4.1% , compared to 2018 . The increase included, among other things, increases in advertising/promotions expense, partly related to new sponsorship arrangements (up $5.5 million); professional services expense (up $3.3 million) and platform fees related to investment services (up $2.7 million). The increase from these items was partly offset by a decrease in donations expense, which was impacted by a significant contribution to our charitable foundation in 2018 (down $4.0 million).

Net income for 2019 decreased $9.1 million , or 2.0% , compared to 2018 . The decrease was primarily the result of a $45.7 million increase in non-interest expense, a $12.1 million increase in the provision for loan losses and a $2.6 million increase in income tax expense partly offset by a $46.6 million increase in net interest income and a $4.7 million increase in non-interest income. 

Net interest income for 2019 increased $46.6 million , or 4.8% , compared to 2018 . The increase was primarily related to increases in the average yields on loans, taxable securities and interest-bearing deposits combined with increases in the average volumes of loans and both taxable and tax-exempt securities. The impact of these items was partly offset by increases in the average rates paid on and average volumes of interest-bearing deposits and other borrowed funds, a decrease in the average volume of interest bearing deposits (primarily excess reserves held in an interest-bearing 

account at the Federal Reserve) and a decrease in the average yield on tax-exempt securities. See the analysis of net interest income included in the section captioned &#8220;Net Interest Income&#8221; elsewhere in this discussion. 

The provision for loan losses for 2019 totaled $33.8 million compared to $21.6 million in 2018 . See the analysis of the provision for loan losses included in the section captioned &#8220;Allowance for Loan Losses&#8221; elsewhere in this discussion. 

Non-interest income for 2019 increased $4.7 million , or 2.2% , compared to 2018 . The increase was primarily due to increases in service charges on deposit accounts, insurance commissions and fees and interchange and debit card transactions fees partly offset by decreases in other non-interest income and other charges, commissions and fees. The increase in service charges on deposit accounts was primarily related to increases in overdraft/insufficient funds charges on consumer and commercial accounts and, to a lesser extent, commercial service charges partly offset by a decrease in consumer service charges. The increase in insurance commissions and fees was primarily related to increased business volumes and market rates partly offset by a decrease in contingent income. The increase in interchange and debit card transaction fees was primarily related to increased transaction volumes. The decrease in other non-interest income was primarily related to decreases in sundry and other miscellaneous income and income from derivative and trading activities, primarily customer related, and a decrease on gains on the sale of foreclosed and other assets partly offset by an increase in public finance underwriting fees, among other things. The decrease in other charges, commissions and fees was primarily related to decreases in processing fees and income from capital markets advisory services, among other things, partly offset by an increase in letter of credit fees, among other things. See the analysis of these categories of non-interest income included in the section captioned &#8220;Non-Interest Income&#8221; included elsewhere in this discussion. 

Non-interest expense for 2019 increased $45.7 million , or 6.9% , compared to 2018 . The increase was primarily related to increases in salaries and wages; technology, furniture and equipment expense; employee benefits; net occupancy expense; and other non-interest expense partly offset by a decrease in deposit insurance expense. 

The increase in salaries and wages was primarily due to an increase in the number of employees and normal annual merit and market increases and, to a lesser extent, an increase in stock compensation. The increase in technology, furniture and equipment expense was primarily related to an increase in software maintenance/cloud services expense. The increase in employee benefits was primarily related to increases in expenses related to our defined benefit retirement plans, expenses related to our 401(k) plan, medical benefits expense and payroll taxes. The increase in net occupancy expense was primarily related to increases in lease expense and depreciation on leasehold improvements partly offset by decreases in property taxes and utilities expense. The increase in other non-interest expense included increases in advertising/promotions expense; professional services expense; and travel, meals and entertainment; among other things, partly offset by decreases in donations expense; sundry and other miscellaneous expense; and losses on the sale of foreclosed and other assets; among other things. The decrease in deposit insurance expense was primarily related to the termination of the quarterly Deposit Insurance Fund surcharge in the fourth quarter of 2018. See the analysis of these categories of non-interest expense included in the section captioned &#8220;Non-Interest Expense&#8221; included elsewhere in this discussion. 

Income tax expense for 2019 increased $2.6 million , or 4.9% , compared to 2018 . See the section captioned &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; elsewhere in this discussion. 

Frost Insurance Agency, which is included in the Banking operating segment, had gross commission revenues of $53.1 million during 2019 compared to $49.6 million during 2018 . The increase was primarily related to increases in commissions on commercial lines property and casualty policies; benefit plan commissions; and life insurance commissions. The increases in property and casualty commissions and benefit plan commissions were related to increased business volumes and market rates. The increase in life insurance commissions was related to increased business volumes. See the analysis of insurance commissions and fees included in the section captioned &#8220;Non-Interest Income&#8221; included elsewhere in this discussion. 

Frost Wealth Advisors 

Net income for 2019 decreased $2.1 million , or 9.6% , compared to 2018 . The decrease was primarily due a $10.5 million increase in non-interest expense partly offset by a $7.9 million increase in non-interest income. 

Non-interest income for 2019 increased $7.9 million , or 5.7% , compared to 2018 . The increase was primarily related to an increase in trust and investment management fees, and to a lesser extent, an increase in other charges, commissions and fees. Trust and investment management fee income is the most significant income component for Frost Wealth 

Advisors. Investment fees are the most significant component of trust and investment management fees, making up approximately 82% and 83% of total trust and investment management fees for 2019 and 2018 . Investment and other custodial account fees are generally based on the market value of assets within a trust account. Volatility in the equity and bond markets impacts the market value of trust assets and the related investment fees. The increase in trust and investment management fees during 2019 was primarily the result of increases in trust investment fees due to higher average equity valuations and an increase in the number of accounts. The increase was also partly related to increases in estate fees and oil and gas fees. The increase in other charges, commissions and fees was primarily related to an increase in income related to the sale of money market funds partly offset by decreases in brokerage commissions and income from the sale of annuities and mutual funds. See the analysis of trust and investment management fees included in the section captioned &#8220;Non-Interest Income&#8221; included elsewhere in this discussion. 

Non-interest expense for 2019 increased $10.5 million , or 9.2% , compared to 2018 . The increase was primarily related to increases in net occupancy expense, other non-interest expense and salaries and wages. The increase in net occupancy expense was partly related to increases in lease overhead allocations. The increase in other non-interest expense was primarily due to increases in platform fees related to investment services; professional service expense; and travel, meals and entertainment expense, among other things. The increase in salaries and wages was primarily due to an increase in the number of employees and normal annual merit and market increases, as well as increases in incentive compensation. 

Non-Banks 

The Non-Banks operating segment had a net loss of $12.8 million for 2019 compared to a net loss of $12.7 million in 2018 . The increased net loss was primarily due to an increase in net interest expense due to increases in the interest rate paid on our long-term borrowings and an increase in other non-interest expense partly offset by decreases in salaries and wages. 

Income Taxes 

We recognized income tax expense of $55.9 million , for an effective tax rate of 11.2% , in 2019 compared to $53.8 million , for an effective tax rate of 10.6% , in 2018 . The effective income tax rates differed from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 21% during 2019 and 2018 primarily due to the effect of tax-exempt income from loans, securities and life insurance policies and certain non-deductible expenses as well as the discrete tax effect associated with stock-based compensation. The increase in the effective tax rate during 2019 compared to 2018 was partly related to an increase in the level of non-deductible compensation and a decrease in the net tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. See Note 13 - Income Taxes in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report. 

Sources and Uses of Funds 

The following table illustrates, during the years presented, the mix of our funding sources and the assets in which those funds are invested as a percentage of our average total assets for the period indicated. Average assets totaled $32.1 billion in 2019 compared to $31.0 billion in 2018 .

Deposits continue to be our primary source of funding. Average deposits increased $124.2 million , or 0.5% , in 2019 compared to 2018 . Non-interest-bearing deposits remain a significant source of funding, which has been a key factor in maintaining our relatively low cost of funds. Average non-interest-bearing deposits totaled 39.2% of total average deposits in 2019 compared to 40.9% in 2018 . Federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits were repealed in 2011. Nonetheless, we have not experienced any significant additional costs as a result. Should the market dictate, we may increase the interest rates we pay on some or all of our various interest-bearing deposit products. This could lead to a decrease in the relative proportion of non-interest-bearing deposits to total deposits. 

We primarily invest funds in loans and securities. Average securities increased $1.2 billion , or 10.2% , in 2019 compared to 2018 while average loans increased $822.6 million , or 6.0% , in 2019 compared to 2018 . Average federal funds sold and resell agreements and interest-bearing deposits decreased $1.4 billion , or 42.1% , in 2019 compared to 2018 .

##TABLE_END

Overview. Year-end total loans increased $650.6 million , or 4.6% , during 2019 compared to 2018 . The majority of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial and industrial loans, energy loans and real estate loans. Commercial and industrial loans made up 35.2% and 36.3% of total loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018 while energy loans made up 11.2% and 11.4% of total loans at both December 31, 2019 and 2018 and real estate loans made up 50.1% and 48.3% of total loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018 . Energy loans include commercial and industrial loans, leases and real estate loans to borrowers in the energy industry. Real estate loans include both commercial and consumer balances. 

Loan Origination/Risk Management. We have certain lending policies and procedures in place that are designed to maximize loan income within an acceptable level of risk. Management reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis. A reporting system supplements the review process by providing management with frequent reports related to loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies and non-performing and potential problem loans. Diversification in the loan portfolio is a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions. 

Commercial and industrial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower&#8217;s ability to operate profitably and prudently expand its business. Underwriting standards are designed to promote relationship banking rather than transactional banking. Once it is determined that the borrower&#8217;s management possesses sound ethics and solid business acumen, our management examines current and projected cash flows to determine the ability of the borrower to repay their obligations as agreed. Commercial and industrial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The cash flows of borrowers, however, may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most commercial and industrial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets such as accounts receivable or inventory and may incorporate a personal guarantee; however, some short-term loans may be made on an unsecured basis. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. 

Our energy loan portfolio includes loans for production, energy services and other energy loans, which includes private clients, transportation and equipment providers, manufacturers, refiners and traders. The origination process for energy loans is similar to that of commercial and industrial loans. Because, however, of the average loan size, the significance of the portfolio and the specialized nature of the energy industry, our energy lending requires a highly prescriptive underwriting policy. Production loans are secured by proven, developed and producing reserves. Loan 

proceeds are used for the development and drilling of additional wells, the acquisition of additional production, and/or the acquisition of additional properties to be developed and drilled. Our customers in this sector are generally large, independent, private owner-producers or large corporate producers. These borrowers typically have large capital requirements for drilling and acquisitions, and as such, loans in this portfolio are generally greater than $10 million. Production loans are collateralized by the oil and gas interests of the borrower. Collateral values are determined by the risk-adjusted and limited discounted future net revenue of the reserves. Our valuations take into consideration geographic and reservoir differentials as well as cost structures associated with each borrower. Collateral is calculated at least semi-annually using third party engineer-prepared reserve studies. These reserve studies are conducted using a discount factor and base case assumptions for the current and future value of oil and gas. To qualify as collateral, typically reserves must be proven, developed and producing. For certain borrowers, collateral may include up to 20% proven, non-producing reserves. Loan commitments are limited to 65% of estimated reserve value. Cash flows must be sufficient to amortize the loan commitment within 120% of the half-life of the underlying reserves. Loan commitments generally must also be 100% covered by the risk-adjusted and limited discounted future net revenue of the reserves when stressed at 75% of our base case price assumptions. In addition, the ratio of the borrower's debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") should generally not exceed 350%. 

Oil and gas service, transportation, and equipment providers are economically aligned due to their reliance on drilling and active oil and gas development. Income for these borrowers is highly dependent on the level of drilling activity and rig utilization, both of which are driven by the current and future outlook for the price of oil and gas. We mitigate the credit risk in this sector through conservative concentration limits and guidelines on the profile of eligible borrowers. Guidelines require that the companies have extensive experience through several industry cycles, and that they be supported by financially competent and committed guarantors who provide a significant secondary source of repayment. Borrowers in this sector are typically privately-owned, middle-market companies with annual sales of less than $100 million. The services provided by companies in this sector are highly diversified, and include down-hole testing and maintenance, providing and threading drilling pipe, hydraulic fracturing services or equipment, seismic testing and equipment and other direct or indirect providers to the oil and gas production sector. 

Our private client portfolio primarily consists of loans to wealthy individuals and their related oil and gas exploration and production entities, where the oil and gas producing reserves are not considered to be the primary source of repayment. These borrowers and guarantors typically have significant sources of wealth including significant liquid assets and/or cash flow from other investments which can fully repay the loans. The credit structures of these loans are generally similar to those of energy production loans, described above, with respect to the valuation of the reserves taken as collateral and the repayment structures. 

Although no balances were outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018, in prior years, we have had a small portfolio of loans to refiners where our credit involvement with these customers was through purchases of shared national credit syndications. These borrowers refine crude oil into gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, asphalt and other petrochemicals and are not dependent on drilling or development. All of the borrowers in this portfolio are very large public companies that are important employers in several of our major markets. These borrowers, for the most part, have been long-term customers and we have a strong relationship with these companies and their executive management. There is no new customer origination process for this segment and any outstanding balances are expected to only reflect the needs of these existing relationships. 

We also have a small portfolio of loans to energy trading companies that serve as intermediaries that buy and sell oil, gas, other petrochemicals, and ethanol. These companies are not dependent on drilling or development. As a general policy, we do not lend to energy traders; however, we have made an exception to this policy for certain customers based upon their underlying business models which minimize risk as commodities are bought only to fill existing orders (back-to-back trading). As such, the commodity price risk and sale risk are eliminated. There is no new customer origination process for this segment and any outstanding balances are expected to only reflect the needs of these existing relationships. 

Commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and industrial loans, in addition to those of real estate loans. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of these loans is generally largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. Commercial real estate loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The properties securing our commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location within Texas. This diversity helps reduce our exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single market or industry. Management monitors and evaluates 

commercial real estate loans based on collateral, geography and risk grade criteria. As a general rule, we avoid financing single-purpose projects unless other underwriting factors are present to help mitigate risk. We also utilize third-party experts to provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting market areas we serve. In addition, management tracks the level of owner-occupied commercial real estate loans versus non-owner occupied loans. At December 31, 2019 , approximately 43% of the outstanding principal balance of our commercial real estate loans were secured by owner-occupied properties. 

With respect to loans to developers and builders that are secured by non-owner occupied properties that we may originate from time to time, we generally require the borrower to have had an existing relationship with us and have a proven record of success. Construction loans are underwritten utilizing feasibility studies, independent appraisal reviews, sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates and financial analysis of the developers and property owners. Construction loans are generally based upon estimates of costs and value associated with the completed project. These estimates may be inaccurate. Construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project. Sources of repayment for these types of loans may be pre-committed permanent loans from approved long-term lenders, sales of developed property or an interim loan commitment from us until permanent financing is obtained. These loans are closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, general economic conditions and the availability of long-term financing. 

We originate consumer loans utilizing a computer-based credit scoring analysis to supplement the underwriting process. To monitor and manage consumer loan risk, policies and procedures are developed and modified, as needed, jointly by line and staff personnel. This activity, coupled with relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers, minimizes risk. Additionally, trend and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis. Underwriting standards for home equity loans are heavily influenced by statutory requirements, which include, but are not limited to, loan-to-value limitations, collection remedies, the number of such loans a borrower can have at one time and documentation requirements. 

We maintain an independent loan review department that reviews and validates the credit risk program on a periodic basis. Results of these reviews are presented to management and the appropriate committees of our board of directors. The loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel, as well as our policies and procedures. 

Commercial and Industrial . Commercial and industrial loans increased $75.5 million , or 1.5% , during 2019 compared to 2018 . Our commercial and industrial loans are a diverse group of loans to small, medium and large businesses. The purpose of these loans varies from supporting seasonal working capital needs to term financing of equipment. While some short-term loans may be made on an unsecured basis, most are secured by the assets being financed with collateral margins that are consistent with our loan policy guidelines. The commercial and industrial loan portfolio also includes the commercial lease and purchased shared national credits. 

Energy . Energy loans include loans to entities and individuals that are engaged in various energy-related activities including (i) the development and production of oil or natural gas, (ii) providing oil and gas field servicing, (iii) providing energy-related transportation services (iv) providing equipment to support oil and gas drilling (v) refining petrochemicals, or (vi) trading oil, gas and related commodities. Energy loans increased $50.3 million , or 3.1% , during 2019 compared to 2018 . The average loan size, the significance of the portfolio and the specialized nature of the energy industry requires a highly prescriptive underwriting policy. Exceptions to this policy are rarely granted. Due to the large borrowing requirements of this customer base, the energy loan portfolio includes participations and purchased shared national credits. 

Industry Concentrations. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , other than energy loans, there were no concentrations of loans within any single industry in excess of 10% of total loans, as segregated by Standard Industrial Classification code (&#8220;SIC code&#8221;). The SIC code system is a federally designed standard industrial numbering system used by us to categorize loans by the borrower&#8217;s type of business. The following table summarizes the industry concentrations of our loan portfolio, as segregated by SIC code. Industry concentrations, stated as a percentage of year-end total loans as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , are presented below:

Large Credit Relationships. The market areas served by us include three of the top ten most populated cities in the United States. These market areas are also home to a significant number of Fortune 500 companies. As a result, we originate and maintain large credit relationships with numerous commercial customers in the ordinary course of business. We consider large credit relationships to be those with commitments equal to or in excess of $10.0 million, excluding treasury management lines exposure, prior to any portion being sold. Large relationships also include loan participations purchased if the credit relationship with the agent is equal to or in excess of $10.0 million. In addition to our normal policies and procedures related to the origination of large credits, one of our Regional Credit Committees must approve all new credit facilities which are part of large credit relationships and renewals of such credit facilities with exposures between $20.0 million and $30.0 million. Our Central Credit Committee must approve all new credit facilities which are part of large credit relationships and renewals of such credit facilities with exposures that exceed $30.0 million. The Regional and Central Credit Committees meet regularly to review large credit relationship activity and discuss the current pipeline, among other things.

Purchased Shared National Credits (&#8220;SNCs&#8221;). Purchased SNCs are participations purchased from upstream financial organizations and tend to be larger in size than our originated portfolio. Our purchased SNC portfolio totaled $948.8 million at December 31, 2019 increasing $191.3 million , or 25.2% , from $757.5 million at December 31, 2018 . At December 31, 2019 , 45.6% of outstanding purchased SNCs were related to the energy industry, 17.7% of outstanding purchased SNCs were related to the construction industry and 10.5% of outstanding purchased SNCs were related to the financial services industry. The remaining purchased SNCs were diversified throughout various other industries, with no other single industry exceeding 10% of the total purchased SNC portfolio. Additionally, almost all of the outstanding balance of purchased SNCs was included in the energy and commercial and industrial portfolios, with the 

remainder included in the real estate categories. SNC participations are originated in the normal course of business to meet the needs of our customers. As a matter of policy, we generally only participate in SNCs for companies headquartered in or which have significant operations within our market areas. In addition, we must have direct access to the company&#8217;s management, an existing banking relationship or the expectation of broadening the relationship with other banking products and services within the following 12 to 24 months. SNCs are reviewed at least quarterly for credit quality and business development successes.

Real Estate Loans. Real estate loans increased $575.2 million , or 8.4% , during 2019 compared to 2018 . Real estate loans include both commercial and consumer balances. Commercial real estate loans totaled $6.2 billion , or 83.8% of total real estate loans, at December 31, 2019 and $5.7 billion , or 83.6% of total real estate loans, at December 31, 2018 . The majority of this portfolio consists of commercial real estate mortgages, which includes both permanent and intermediate term loans. Loans secured by owner-occupied properties make up a significant portion of our commercial real estate portfolio. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Consequently, these loans must undergo the analysis and underwriting process of a commercial and industrial loan, as well as that of a real estate loan. 

The following tables summarize our commercial real estate loan portfolio, including commercial real estate loans reported as a component of our energy loan portfolio segment, as segregated by (i) the type of property securing the credit and (ii) the geographic region in which the loans were originated. Property type concentrations are stated as a percentage of year-end total commercial real estate loans as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 :

Consumer real estate loans at December 31, 2019 increased $75.4 million , or 6.7% , from December 31, 2018 . Combined, home equity loans and lines of credit made up 61.1% and 61.8% of the consumer real estate loan total at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. We offer home equity loans up to 80% of the estimated value of the personal residence of the borrower, less the value of existing mortgages and home improvement loans. In general, we do not originate 1-4 family mortgage loans; however, from time to time, we may invest in such loans to meet the needs of our customers. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017, interest on home equity loans and lines of credit is no longer deductible. This change could adversely impact the level of originations and outstanding volumes of home equity loans and lines of credit in the future. The consumer and other loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 decreased $50.4 million , or 8.8% , from December 31, 2018 . This portfolio primarily consists of automobile loans, unsecured revolving credit products, personal loans secured by cash and cash equivalents, and other similar types of credit facilities. 

Foreign Loans . We make U.S. dollar-denominated loans and commitments to borrowers in Mexico. The outstanding balance of these loans and the unfunded amounts available under these commitments were not significant at December 31, 2019 or 2018 . 

Maturities and Sensitivities of Loans to Changes in Interest Rates. The following table presents the maturity distribution of our commercial and industrial loans, energy loans and commercial real estate loans at December 31, 2019 . The table also presents the portion of loans that have fixed interest rates or variable interest rates that fluctuate over the life of the loans in accordance with changes in an interest rate index such as the prime rate or LIBOR.

We generally structure commercial loans with shorter-term maturities in order to match our funding sources and to enable us to effectively manage the loan portfolio by providing the flexibility to respond to liquidity needs, changes in interest rates and changes in underwriting standards and loan structures, among other things. Due to the shorter-term nature of such loans, from time to time and in the ordinary course of business, we will renew/extend maturing lines of credit or refinance existing loans at their maturity dates. Some loans may renew multiple times in a given year as a result of general customer practice and need. These renewals, extensions and refinancings are made in the ordinary course of business for customers that meet our normal level of credit standards. Such borrowers typically request renewals to support their on-going working capital needs to finance their operations. Such borrowers are not experiencing financial difficulties and generally could obtain similar financing from another financial institution. In connection with each renewal, extension or refinancing, we may require a principal reduction, adjust the rate of interest and/or modify the structure and other terms to reflect the current market pricing/structuring for such loans or to maintain competitiveness with other financial institutions. In such cases, we do not generally grant concessions, and, except for those reported in Note 3 - Loans, any such renewals, extensions or refinancings that occurred during the reported periods were not deemed to be troubled debt restructurings pursuant to applicable accounting guidance. Loans exceeding $1.0 million undergo a complete underwriting process at each renewal.

Non-performing assets include non-accrual loans, restructured loans and foreclosed assets. Non-performing assets at December 31, 2019 increased $34.6 million compared to December 31, 2018 reflecting increases in non-accrual commercial and industrial loans and non-accrual energy loans and restructured loans partly offset by a decrease in non-accrual commercial real estate loans. Non-accrual commercial and industrial loans included one credit relationship in excess of $5.0 million totaling $8.4 million at December 31, 2019 . This credit relationship was first reported as a potential problem loan during the third quarter of 2019. There were no non-accrual commercial and industrial loans in excess of $5.0 million at December 31, 2018 . Non-accrual energy loans included two credit relationships in excess of $5 million totaling $61.7 million at December 31, 2019 . This included a single credit relationship totaling $34.0 million that was classified as non-accrual during the third quarter of 2019. The other credit relationship, which totaled $27.7 million at December 31, 2019 , was previously reported as non-accrual with an aggregate balance of $37.6 million at December 31, 2018 . We charged off $7.5 million related to this credit relationship during 2019 . Non-accrual energy loans at December 31, 2018 included one other credit relationship in excess of $5 million totaling $6.4 million. Non-accrual real estate loans primarily consist of land development, 1-4 family residential construction credit relationships and loans secured by office buildings and religious facilities. There were no non-accrual commercial real estate loans in excess of $5.0 million at December 31, 2019 . Non-accrual commercial real estate loans included one relationship in excess of $5.0 million totaling $12.2 million at December 31, 2018 . This credit relationship was sold during the second quarter of 2019. 

Generally, loans are placed on non-accrual status if principal or interest payments become 90 days past due and/or management deems the collectibility of the principal and/or interest to be in question, as well as when required by regulatory requirements. Once interest accruals are discontinued, accrued but uncollected interest is charged to current year operations. Subsequent receipts on non-accrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal, and interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured. Classification of a loan as non-accrual does not preclude the ultimate collection of loan principal or interest. 

Foreclosed assets represent property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans. Foreclosed assets are recorded at estimated fair value, less estimated selling costs, at the time of foreclosure. Write-downs occurring at foreclosure are charged against the allowance for loan losses. Regulatory guidelines require us to reevaluate the fair value of foreclosed assets on at least an annual basis. Our policy is to comply with the regulatory guidelines. Write-downs are provided for subsequent declines in value and are included in other non-interest expense along with other expenses related to maintaining the properties. There were no write-downs of foreclosed assets in 2019 while write-downs totaled $473 thousand and $16 thousand during 2018 and 2017 , respectively. There were no significant concentrations of any properties, to which the aforementioned write-downs relate, in any single geographic region. 

Accruing past due loans at December 31, 2019 decreased $21.9 million compared to December 31, 2018 . The decrease was primarily related to decreases in past due commercial real estate loans (down $9.8 million) and past due commercial and industrial loans (down $7.7 million). 

Potential problem loans consist of loans that are performing in accordance with contractual terms but for which management has concerns about the ability of an obligor to continue to comply with repayment terms because of the obligor&#8217;s potential operating or financial difficulties. Management monitors these loans closely and reviews their performance on a regular basis. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , we had $46.8 million and $63.4 million in loans of this type which are not included in any one of the non-accrual, restructured or 90 days past due loan categories. At December 31, 2019 , potential problem loans consisted of ten credit relationships. Of the total outstanding balance at December 31, 2019 , 23.8% was related to the restaurant industry, 23.2% was related to the energy industry, 15.4% was related to the real estate industry and 12.9% was related to building contractors. Weakness in these organizations&#8217; operating performance and financial condition, among other factors, have caused us to heighten the attention given to these credits. As such, all of the loans identified as potential problem loans at December 31, 2019 were graded as &#8220;substandard - accrual&#8221; (risk grade 11). Potential problem loans impact the allocation of our allowance for loan losses as a result of our risk grade based allocation methodology. See Note 3 - Loans in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for details regarding our allowance allocation methodology. 

Allowance For Loan Losses 

The allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, which represents management&#8217;s best estimate of inherent losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans. The allowance, in the judgment of management, is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. Our allowance for loan losses consists of: (i) specific valuation allowances determined in accordance with ASC Topic 310, &#8220;Receivables,&#8221; based on probable losses on specific loans; (ii) historical valuation allowances determined in accordance with ASC Topic 450, &#8220;Contingencies,&#8221; based on historical loan loss experience for similar loans with similar characteristics and trends, adjusted, as necessary, to reflect the impact of current conditions; (iii) general valuation allowances determined in accordance with ASC Topic 450 based on various risk factors that are internal to us; and (iv) macroeconomic valuation allowances determined in accordance with ASC Topic 450 based upon management's assessment of current and expected economic conditions, trends and other quantitative and qualitative portfolio risk factors that are external to us or that are not otherwise captured in our allowance modeling process but could impact the credit risk or inherent losses within our loan portfolio segments. 

Our model for the determination of the allowance for loan losses is largely prescriptive, based on policy, and calculated using quantitative data related to our loan portfolio. This calculation yields the minimum level of allowance required (&#8220;minimum calculated need&#8221;). In that the model is constructed to address aspects of the loan portfolio quantitatively as they move over time (both good and bad), the model output of the minimum calculated need will move directionally with the overall health of the portfolio and inherent losses in the portfolio at any period end. While the model inherently captures loan portfolio characteristics and actions such as risk grade migration, required specific reserves, net charge-offs, among other things, the model contains a degree of imprecision arising from various items and portfolio risk factors that are not and cannot be incorporated in to the model but nonetheless have an impact on the overall level of allowance deemed appropriate by management. To adequately address this imprecision, our methodology to determine the allowance for loan losses provides for additional reserves in excess of the minimum calculated need. This process entails the application of management judgment related to various non-model items and portfolio risk factors not addressed by the quantitative model but reflective of inherent losses in the portfolio. These additional reserves, which are reported as a component of our macroeconomic valuation allowances, are determined at the portfolio level and allocated as reserves for general economic risk to our various portfolio segments based upon management judgment. 

On January 1, 2020, we adopted a new accounting standard which replaces the &#8220;incurred loss&#8221; model for measuring credit losses discussed above with a new &#8220;expected loss&#8221; model. See Note 20 - Accounting Standard Updates in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data elsewhere in this report for additional details. 

The table below provides an allocation of the year-end allowance for loan losses by loan type; however, allocation of a portion of the allowance to one category of loans does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories. See Note 3 - Loans in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for further details regarding our methodology for estimating the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses and the amounts allocated to specific portfolio segments.

Allocation of the Allowance for Loan Losses at December 31, 2019 vs. December 31, 2018 

The reserve allocated to commercial and industrial loans at December 31, 2019 increased $3.0 million compared to December 31, 2018 . The increase was primarily due to increases in specific valuation allowances and historical valuation allowances partly offset by a decrease in macroeconomic valuation allowances. Specific valuation allowances for commercial and industrial loans increased $5.3 million from $2.6 million at December 31, 2018 to $7.8 million at December 31, 2019 . The increase included new specific valuation allowances totaling $5.6 million on three credit relationships which had an aggregate outstanding balance totaling $14.0 million at December 31, 2019 . Historical valuation allowances increased $3.7 million from $25.4 million at December 31, 2018 to $29.0 million at December 31, 2019 . The increase was primarily related to an increase in the volume of non-classified loans graded "watch" (risk grade 9). Classified loans consist of loans having a risk grade of 11, 12 or 13. Classified commercial and industrial loans totaled $79.9 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $78.9 million at December 31, 2018 . The weighted-average risk grade of commercial and industrial loans was 6.44 at December 31, 2019 compared to 6.30 at December 31, 2018 . Commercial loan net charge-offs totaled $10.1 million during 2019 compared to $22.4 million during 2018 . Charge-offs in 2018 included $15.3 million related to four credit relationships. Macroeconomic valuation allowances for commercial and industrial loans decreased $5.7 million from $10.6 million at December 31, 2018 to $4.9 million at December 31, 2019 . The decrease was primarily related to a decrease in the general macroeconomic risk allocation (down $5.3 million ), as further discussed below, and a decrease in the environmental risk adjustment (down $454 thousand) as a result of a decrease in the environmental adjustment factor. 

The reserve allocated to energy loans at December 31, 2019 increased $8.3 million compared to December 31, 2018 . As a result, reserves allocated to energy loans as a percentage of total energy loans totaled 2.26% at December 31, 2019 compared to 1.81% at December 31, 2018 . This increase was primarily related to increases in specific valuation allowances and, to a lesser extent, macroeconomic valuation allowances, partly offset by decreases in historical valuation allowances and general valuation allowances. Specific valuation allowances for energy loans totaled $20.2 million at December 31, 2019 and related to three credit relationships totaling $62.5 million while specific valuation allowances for energy loans totaled $9.7 million at December 31, 2018 and related to four credit relationships totaling $39.9 million . Macroeconomic valuation allowances related to energy loans increased $397 thousand from $3.7 million at December 31, 2018 to $4.1 million at December 31, 2019 , primarily due to an increase in the general macroeconomic risk allocation (up $1.0 million ), as further discussed below, partly offset by a decrease in the environmental risk 

adjustment (down $590 thousand ) as a result of decreases in the environmental adjustment factor and the historical loss valuation allowances to which the environmental risk adjustment factor is applied. Historical valuation allowances decreased $1.8 million from $9.7 million at December 31, 2018 to $7.9 million at December 31, 2019 . The decrease was partly related to decreases in the historical loss allocation factors for both non-classified energy loans and classified energy loans. The decrease was also partly related to decreases in the volume of classified energy loans graded as "substandard - accrual" (risk grade 11) (down $10.7 million ) and non-classified energy loans graded as "watch" (risk grade 9) (down $3.4 million ) partly offset by increases in the volume of non-classified energy loans graded as "pass"(risk grades below 9) (up $36.6 million ) and "special mention" (risk grade 10) (up $8.9 million ). Total classified energy loans increased $8.2 million from $72.4 million at December 31, 2018 to $80.5 million at December 31, 2019 . The weighted-average risk grade of energy loans increased to 6.39 at December 31, 2019 from to 6.22 at December 31, 2018 . Energy loan net charge-offs totaled $6.1 million during 2019 compared to net charge-offs of $13.1 million during 2018 . Charge-offs in 2019 included $7.5 million related to a single credit relationship. We also charged-off $6.0 million related to this credit relationship in 2018 as well as $7.3 million related to two other credit relationships. General valuation allowances decreased $818 thousand from $6.0 million at December 31, 2018 $5.2 million at December 31, 2019 . The decrease was primarily related to a decrease in the allocation for highly-leveraged transactions and an increase in the adjustment for recoveries partly offset by an increase in the allocation for excess concentrations. 

The reserve allocated to commercial real estate loans at December 31, 2019 decreased $7.7 million compared to December 31, 2018 . The decrease was primarily related to decreases in macroeconomic valuation allowances and specific valuation allowances partly offset by an increase in historical valuation allowances. Macroeconomic valuation allowances decreased $6.5 million from $11.0 million at December 31, 2018 to $4.5 million at December 31, 2019 . The decrease was primarily related to a decrease in the general macroeconomic risk allocation (down $5.7 million ), as further discussed below, and a decrease in the environmental risk adjustment (down $796 thousand ), primarily resulting from a decrease in the environmental risk adjustment factor. Specific valuation allowances for commercial real estate loans totaled $383 thousand at December 31, 2019 decreasing $2.2 million from $2.6 million at December 31, 2018 . Specific valuation allowances for commercial real estate loans at December 31, 2019 related to two credit relationships totaling $2.4 million . Specific valuation allowances at December 31, 2018 primarily related to a single credit relationship totaling $12.2 million . This relationship was sold during the second quarter of 2019. We recognized net charge-offs totaling $266 thousand in connection with the sale. Historical valuation allowances related to commercial real estate loans increased $1.1 million from $20.8 million at December 31, 2018 to $21.9 million at December 31, 2019 . Non-classified commercial real estate loans increased $523.3 million from $5.6 billion at December 31, 2018 to $6.1 billion at December 31, 2019 while classified commercial real estate loans decreased $23.5 million from $118.3 million at December 31, 2018 to $94.8 million at December 31, 2019 . The weighted-average risk grade of commercial real estate loans was 7.07 at December 31, 2019 and 7.05 at December 31, 2018 . General valuation allowances for commercial real estate loans decreased $165 thousand from $4.4 million at December 31, 2018 to $4.2 million at December 31, 2019 . 

The reserve allocated to consumer real estate loans at December 31, 2019 decreased $2.0 million compared to December 31, 2018 . This decrease was primarily due to a $1.1 million decrease in the general macroeconomic risk allocation, as further discussed below, and a $767 thousand decrease in general valuation allowances, which was primarily related to an increase in the adjustment for recoveries combined with a decrease in the allocation for loans not reviewed by concurrence. 

The reserve allocated to consumer and other loans at December 31, 2019 decreased $1.6 million compared to December 31, 2018 . The decrease was primarily related to decreases in specific valuation allowances (down $1.4 million ), macroeconomic valuation allowances (down $497 thousand ) and general valuation allowances (down $396 thousand ) partly offset by an increase in historical valuation allowances (up $717 thousand ). Specific allocations at December 31, 2018 included $1.4 million related to a single credit relationship of the same amount. The decrease in macroeconomic valuation allowances was primarily related to a decrease in the general macroeconomic risk allocation, as further discussed below, and a decrease in the environmental risk adjustment due to a decrease in the environmental risk adjustment factor. The decrease in general valuation allowances was primarily related to an increase in the adjustment for recoveries combined with a decrease in the allocation for loans not reviewed by concurrence. The increase in historical valuation allowances was primarily due to an increase in the historical loss allocation factor combined with an increase in the volume of consumer loans. 

As discussed above, under our allowance methodology, we allocate additional reserves for general macroeconomic risk in excess of our minimum calculated need calculated using our allowance model. These additional reserves are based upon management's assessment of current and expected economic conditions, trends and other quantitative and 

qualitative portfolio risk factors that are external to us or that are not otherwise captured in our allowance modeling process but impact the credit risk or inherent losses within our loan portfolio segments. These additional reserves are allocated to our various portfolio segments based upon management judgment.

##TABLE_END

The provision for loan losses reflects loan quality trends, including the levels of and trends related to non-accrual loans, past due loans, potential problem loans, classified and criticized loans and net charge-offs or recoveries, among other factors. The provision for loan losses also reflects the totality of actions taken on all loans for a particular period. In other words, the amount of the provision reflects not only the necessary increases in the allowance for loan losses related to newly identified criticized loans, but it also reflects actions taken related to other loans including, among other things, any necessary increases or decreases in required allowances for specific loans or loan pools. 

The provision for loan losses increased $12.1 million , or 56.2% , in 2019 compared to 2018 . The provision for loan losses during 2019 primarily reflects the level of net charge-offs and specific valuation allowances as well as the impact of the overall growth in the loan portfolio since December 31, 2018 . Net charge-offs totaled $33.7 million during 2019 compared to $44.8 million during 2018 . Specific valuation allowances totaled $28.5 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $16.2 million at December 31, 2018 . Classified energy, commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans totaled $255.2 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $269.6 million at December 31, 2018 . The overall weighted-average risk grade of our energy, commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loan portfolios was 6.73 at December 31, 2019 compared to 6.63 at December 31, 2018 . 

The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was 0.90% at December 31, 2019 compared to 0.94% at December 31, 2018 . Management believes the recorded amount of the allowance for loan losses is appropriate based upon management&#8217;s best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans. Should any of the factors considered by management in evaluating the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses 

change, our estimate of probable loan losses could also change, which could affect the level of future provisions for loan losses.

##TABLE_END

The following tables summarize the maturity distribution schedule with corresponding weighted-average yields of securities held to maturity and securities available for sale as of December 31, 2019 . Weighted-average yields have been computed on a fully taxable-equivalent basis using a tax rate of 21%. Mortgage-backed securities are included in maturity categories based on their stated maturity date. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations. Other securities classified as available for sale include stock in the Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Home Loan Bank, which have no maturity date. These securities have been included in the total column only.

##TABLE_END

Securities are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity. Securities are classified as available for sale when they might be sold before 

maturity. Securities available for sale are carried at fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income, net of tax. The remaining securities are classified as trading. Trading securities are held primarily for sale in the near term and are carried at their fair values, with unrealized gains and losses included immediately in other income. Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase. Securities with limited marketability, such as stock in the Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Home Loan Bank, are carried at cost. 

All mortgage-backed securities included in the above tables were issued by U.S. government agencies and corporations. At December 31, 2019 , approximately 99.7% of the securities in our municipal bond portfolio were issued by the State of Texas or political subdivisions or agencies within the State of Texas, of which approximately 69.1% are either guaranteed by the Texas Permanent School Fund, which has a &#8220;triple-A&#8221; insurer financial strength rating, or secured by U.S. Treasury securities via defeasance of the debt by the issuers. At December 31, 2019 , we held general obligation bonds issued by the State of Texas with an aggregate amortized cost of $998.4 million and an aggregate fair value of $1.1 billion. Such amounts were in excess of 10% of our shareholders&#8217; equity at December 31, 2019 . At such date, all of these securities were considered "high grade" or better by various credit rating agencies. At December 31, 2019 , there were no other holdings of any one issuer, other than the U.S. government and its agencies, in an amount greater than 10% of our shareholders&#8217; equity. 

The average taxable-equivalent yield on the securities portfolio based on a 21% tax rate was 3.40 % in 2019 compared to 3.38% in 2018 . Tax-exempt municipal securities totaled 62.0% of average securities in 2019 compared to 65.0% in 2018 . The average yield on taxable securities was 2.33 % in 2019 compared to 2.03% in 2018 , while the average taxable-equivalent yield on tax-exempt securities was 4.06 % in 2019 compared to 4.11% in 2018 . See the section captioned &#8220;Net Interest Income&#8221; elsewhere in this discussion. The overall growth in the securities portfolio in 2019 was primarily funded by the reinvestment of excess reserves held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve.

##TABLE_END

Average deposits increased $124.2 million , or 0.5% , in 2019 compared to 2018 . The most significant volume growth during 2019 compared to 2018 was in time, interest-bearing public funds, savings and interest checking and money market deposits. This growth was mostly offset by decreases in the volume of non-interest bearing commercial and individual deposits as well as non-interest bearing public funds deposits. The ratio of average interest-bearing deposits to total average deposits was 60.8% in 2019 compared to 59.1% in 2018 . The average cost of interest-bearing deposits and total deposits was 0.62% and 0.38% during 2019 compared to 0.49% and 0.29% during 2018 . The increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits in 2019 as compared to 2018 was related to higher average interest rates paid on most of our interest-bearing deposit products, particularly during the first half of 2019, as a result of higher average market interest rates.

Average non-interest-bearing deposits decreased $398.4 million , or 3.7% , in 2019 compared to 2018 . The decrease was primarily due to a $334.8 million , or 3.3% , decrease in average commercial and individual deposits and a $71.3 million , or 18.5% , decrease in average public fund deposits partly offset by a $7.7 million , or 3.8% , increase in average correspondent bank deposits.

Total average interest-bearing deposits increased $522.6 million , or 3.4% , in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to a $189.8 million , or 23.7% , increase in average time deposits, a $130.0 million , or 31.0% , increase in average public funds deposits, a $109.8 million , or 1.6% , increase in average savings and interest checking deposits and a $93.0 million , or 1.2% , increase in average money market deposits. 

From time to time, we have obtained interest-bearing deposits through brokered transactions including participation in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (&#8220;CDARS&#8221;). Brokered deposits were not significant during the reported periods. 

Geographic Concentrations . The following table summarizes our average total deposit portfolio, as segregated by the geographic region from which the deposit accounts were originated.

##TABLE_END

Foreign Deposits. Mexico has historically been considered a part of the natural trade territory of our banking offices. Accordingly, U.S. dollar-denominated foreign deposits from sources within Mexico have traditionally been a significant source of funding. Average deposits from foreign sources, primarily Mexico, totaled $774.0 million in 2019 and $737.6 million in 2018 . 

Short-Term Borrowings 

Our primary source of short-term borrowings is federal funds purchased from correspondent banks and repurchase agreements in our natural trade territory, as well as from upstream banks. Federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements totaled $1.7 billion , $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . The maximum amount of these borrowings outstanding at any month-end was $1.7 billion in 2019 , $1.4 billion in 2018 and $1.1 billion in 2017 . The weighted-average interest rate on federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements was 0.81% at December 31, 2019 , 1.33% at December 31, 2018 and 0.23% at December 31, 2017 .

The net funds purchased position increased $247.9 million in 2019 compared to 2018 . Average interest-bearing deposits (primarily excess reserves held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) totaled $1.6 billion in 2019 compared to $3.0 billion in 2018 and $3.6 billion in 2017 . During the reported periods, we have maintained excess liquid funds in interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve rather than federal funds sold in order to capitalize on higher available yields. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, Commitments, Guarantees, and Contractual Obligations 

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments to make future payments as of December 31, 2019 . Payments for borrowings do not include interest. Payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in the underlying contracts. Loan commitments and standby letters of credit are presented at contractual amounts; however, since many of these commitments are expected to expire unused or only partially used, the total amounts of these commitments do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements.

Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk. In the normal course of business, we enter into various transactions, which, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. We enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. We minimize our exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures. We also hold certain assets which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets including assets held in fiduciary or custodial capacity on behalf of our trust customers. 

Commitments to Extend Credit. We enter into contractual commitments to extend credit, normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses, at specified rates and for specific purposes. Substantially all of our commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding. Commitments to extend credit outstanding at December 31, 2019 are included in the table above. 

Standby Letters of Credit. Standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. In the event the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party, we would be required to fund the commitment. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment. If the commitment is funded, we would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer. Our policies generally require that standby letter of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements. Standby letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2019 are included in the table above. 

Trust Accounts . We also hold certain assets in fiduciary or custodial capacity on behalf of our trust customers. The estimated fair value of trust assets was approximately $37.8 billion (including managed assets of $16.4 billion and custody assets of $21.4 billion ) at December 31, 2019 . These assets were primarily composed of equity securities ( 50.7% of trust assets), fixed income securities ( 35.0% of trust assets) and cash equivalents ( 8.9% of trust assets). 

Capital and Liquidity 

Capital . Shareholders&#8217; equity totaled $3.9 billion at December 31, 2019 and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2018 . In addition to net income of $443.6 million , other sources of capital during 2019 included other comprehensive income, net of tax, of $331.0 million , $20.8 million in proceeds from stock option exercises and $15.9 million related to stock-based compensation. Uses of capital during 2019 included $185.1 million of dividends paid on preferred and common stock, $68.8 million of treasury stock purchases and $14.7 million related to the cumulative effect of a new accounting principle adopted during the first quarter of 2019. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 

The accumulated other comprehensive income/loss component of shareholders&#8217; equity totaled a net, after-tax, unrealized gain of $267.4 million at December 31, 2019 compared to a net, after-tax, unrealized loss of $63.6 million at December 31, 2018 . The change was primarily due to a $329.4 million net after-tax change in the net unrealized gain/loss on securities available for sale and securities transferred to held to maturity. 

Under the Basel III Capital Rules, we elected to opt-out of the requirement to include most components of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital. Accordingly, amounts reported as accumulated other comprehensive income/loss related to securities available for sale, effective cash flow hedges and defined benefit post-retirement benefit plans do not increase or reduce regulatory capital and are not included in the calculation of risk-based capital and leverage ratios. Regulatory agencies for banks and bank holding companies utilize capital guidelines designed to measure capital and take into consideration the risk inherent in both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items. See Note 9 - Capital and Regulatory Matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report. 

We paid quarterly dividends of $0.67 , $0.71 , $0.71 and $0.71 per common share during the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2019 , respectively, and quarterly dividends of $0.57 , $0.67 , $0.67 and $0.67 per common share during the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2018 , respectively. This equates to a dividend payout ratio of 40.6% in 2019 and 37.0% in 2018 . Under the terms of the junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures that Cullen/Frost has issued to Cullen/Frost Capital Trust II and WNB Capital Trust I, we have the right at any time during the term of the debentures to defer the payment of interest any time or from time to time for an extension period not exceeding 20 consecutive quarterly periods with respect to each extension period. Our ability to declare or pay dividends on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our capital stock is subject to certain restrictions during any such extension period. Under the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock, our ability to declare or pay dividends on, or purchase, 

redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our common stock or any of our securities that rank junior to the Series A Preferred Stock is subject to certain restrictions in the event that we do not declare and pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock for the most recent dividend period. 

Stock Repurchase Plans. From time to time, our board of directors has authorized stock repurchase plans. In general, stock repurchase plans allow us to proactively manage our capital position and return excess capital to shareholders. Shares purchased under such plans also provide us with shares of common stock necessary to satisfy obligations related to stock compensation awards. On July 24, 2019 , our board of directors authorized a $100.0 million stock repurchase program, allowing us to repurchase shares of our common stock over a one -year period from time to time at various prices in the open market or through private transactions. Under this plan, we repurchased 202,724 shares at a total cost of $17.2 million during 2019 . Under prior stock repurchase programs, we repurchased 496,307 shares at a total cost of $50.0 million during 2019 and 1,027,292 shares at a total cost of $100.0 million during 2018 . See Part II, Item 5 - Market for Registrant&#8217;s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, elsewhere in this report. 

Liquidity . Liquidity measures the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs as they become due. The liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to meet loan requests, to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and to take advantage of interest rate market opportunities. The ability of a financial institution to meet its current financial obligations is a function of its balance sheet structure, its ability to liquidate assets and its access to alternative sources of funds. The objective of our liquidity management is to manage cash flow and liquidity reserves so that they are adequate to fund our operations and to meet obligations and other commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. We seek to achieve this objective and ensure that funding needs are met by maintaining an appropriate level of liquid funds through asset/liability management, which includes managing the mix and time to maturity of financial assets and financial liabilities on our balance sheet. Our liquidity position is enhanced by our ability to raise additional funds as needed in the wholesale markets. 

Asset liquidity is provided by liquid assets which are readily marketable or pledgeable or which will mature in the near future. Liquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits in banks, securities available for sale, maturities and cash flow from securities held to maturity, and federal funds sold and resell agreements. 

Liability liquidity is provided by access to funding sources which include core deposits and correspondent banks in our natural trade area that maintain accounts with and sell federal funds to Frost Bank, as well as federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements from upstream banks and deposits obtained through financial intermediaries. 

Our liquidity position is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate. Liquidity risk management is an important element in our asset/liability management process. We regularly model liquidity stress scenarios to assess potential liquidity outflows or funding problems resulting from economic disruptions, volatility in the financial markets, unexpected credit events or other significant occurrences deemed problematic by management. These scenarios are incorporated into our contingency funding plan, which provides the basis for the identification of our liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2019 , management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital resources or operations. In addition, management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity that would have a material adverse effect on us. 

Since Cullen/Frost is a holding company and does not conduct operations, its primary sources of liquidity are dividends upstreamed from Frost Bank and borrowings from outside sources. Banking regulations may limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by Frost Bank. See Note 9 - Capital and Regulatory Matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report regarding such dividends. At December 31, 2019 , Cullen/Frost had liquid assets, including cash and resell agreements, totaling $ 267.1 million . 

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 

Our financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). GAAP presently requires us to measure financial position and operating results primarily in terms of historic dollars. Changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered. The primary effect of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. In management&#8217;s opinion, changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate. While interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate, they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate. Interest rates are highly 

sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including changes in the expected rate of inflation, the influence of general and local economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government, its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities, among other things, as further discussed in the next section. 

Regulatory and Economic Policies 

Our business and earnings are affected by general and local economic conditions and by the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government, its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities, among other things. The Federal Reserve Board regulates the supply of money in order to influence general economic conditions. Among the instruments of monetary policy historically available to the Federal Reserve Board are (i) conducting open market operations in United States government obligations, (ii) changing the discount rate on financial institution borrowings, (iii) imposing or changing reserve requirements against financial institution deposits, and (iv) restricting certain borrowings and imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by financial institutions and their affiliates. These methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to affect directly the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. For that reason alone, the policies of the Federal Reserve Board have a material effect on our earnings. 

Governmental policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future; however, we cannot accurately predict the nature, timing or extent of any effect such policies may have on our future business and earnings. 

Accounting Standards Updates 

See Note 20 - Accounting Standards Updates in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for details of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our financial statements.
