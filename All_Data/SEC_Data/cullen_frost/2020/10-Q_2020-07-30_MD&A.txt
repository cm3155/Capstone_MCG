Recent Developments Related to COVID-19 

Overview. Our business has been, and continues to be, impacted by the recent and ongoing outbreak of COVID-19. In March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and a national emergency by the President of the United States. Efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 have led to shelter-in-place orders, the closure of non-essential businesses, travel restrictions, supply chain disruptions and prohibitions on public gatherings, among other things, throughout many parts of the United States and, in particular, the markets in which we operate. As the current pandemic is ongoing and dynamic in nature, there are many uncertainties related to COVID-19 including, among other things, its ultimate geographic spread; its severity; the duration of the outbreak; the impact to our customers, employees and vendors; the impact to the financial services and banking industry; and the impact to the economy as a whole as well as the effect of actions taken, or that may yet be taken, or inaction by governmental authorities to contain the outbreak or to mitigate its impact (both economic and health-related). COVID-19 has negatively affected, and is expected to continue to negatively affect, our business, financial position and operating results. In light of the uncertainties and continuing developments discussed herein, the ultimate adverse impact of COVID-19 cannot be reliably estimated at this time, but it has been and is expected to continue to be material. 

Impact on our Operations. In the State of Texas, many jurisdictions have declared health emergencies. The resulting closures and/or limited operations of non-essential businesses and related economic disruption has impacted our operations as well as the operations of our customers. Financial services have been identified as a Critical Infrastructure Sector by the Department of Homeland Security. Accordingly, our business remains open. To address the issues arising as a result of COVID-19, and in order to facilitate the continued delivery of essential services while maintaining a high level of safety for our customers as well as our employees, we have implemented our Business Continuity and Health Emergency Response plans. Among other things, significant actions taken under these plans include: 

&#8226; Implemented our communications plans to ensure our employees, customers and critical vendors are kept abreast of developments affecting our operations. 

&#8226; Restricted all non-essential travel and large external gatherings and have instituted a mandatory quarantine period for anyone that has traveled to an impacted area. 

&#8226; Temporarily closed all of our financial center lobbies and other corporate facilities to non-employees, except for certain limited cases by appointment only. We continue to serve our consumer and business customers through our motor-banks, ATMs, internet banking, mobile app and telephone customer service capabilities. 

&#8226; Expanded remote-access availability so that nearly all of our work-force has the capability to work from home or other remote locations. All activities are performed in accordance with our compliance and information security policies designed to ensure customer data and other information is properly safeguarded. 

&#8226; Instituted mandatory social distancing policies for those employees not working remotely. Members of certain operations teams have been split into separate buildings or locations to create redundancy for key functions across the organization. 

Table of Co ntents 

Notwithstanding the foregoing actions, the COVID-19 outbreak could still greatly affect our routine and essential operations due to staff absenteeism, particularly among key personnel; further limited access to or closures of our branch facilities and other physical offices; operational, technical or security-related risks arising from a remote work-force; and government or regulatory agency orders, among other things. The business and operations of our third party service providers, many of whom perform critical services for our business, could also be significantly impacted, which in turn could impact us. As a result, we are currently unable to fully assess or predict the extent of the effects of COVID-19 on our operations as the ultimate impact will depend on factors that are currently unknown and/or beyond our control. 

Impact on our Financial Position and Results of Operations. Our financial position and results of operations are particularly susceptible to the ability of our loan customers to meet loan obligations, the availability of our workforce, the availability of our vendors and the decline in the value of assets held by us. While its effects continue to materialize, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant decrease in commercial activity throughout the State of Texas as well as nationally. This decrease in commercial activity has caused and may continue to cause our customers (including affected businesses and individuals), vendors and counterparties to be unable to meet existing payment or other obligations to us. The national public health crisis arising from the COVID-19 pandemic (and public expectations about it), combined with certain pre-existing factors, including, but not limited to, international trade disputes, inflation risks and oil price volatility, could further destabilize the financial markets and geographies in which we operate. The resulting economic pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding the sustainability of any economic improvements has impacted the creditworthiness of potential and current borrowers. Borrower loan defaults that adversely affect our earnings correlate with deteriorating economic conditions (such as the unemployment rate), which, in turn, are likely to impact our borrowers' creditworthiness and our ability to make loans. See further information related to the risk exposure of our loan portfolio under the sections captioned &#8220;Loans&#8221; and &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; elsewhere in this discussion. 

In addition, the economic pressures and uncertainties arising from the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in and may continue to result in specific changes in consumer and business spending and borrowing and saving habits, affecting the demand for loans and other products and services we offer. Consumers affected by COVID-19 may continue to demonstrate changed behavior even after the crisis is over. For example, consumers may decrease discretionary spending on a permanent or long-term basis, certain industries may take longer to recover (particularly those that rely on travel or large gatherings) as consumers may be hesitant to return to full social interaction, We lend to customers operating in such industries including energy, restaurants, hotels/lodging, aviation, entertainment, retail and commercial real estate, among others, that have been significantly impacted by COVID-19 and we are continuing to monitor these customers closely. To help mitigate the adverse effects of COVID-19, loan customers may apply for a deferral of payments, or portions thereof, for up to 90 days. After 90 days, customers may apply for an additional deferral. Additionally, the temporary closures of bank branches and the safety precautions implemented at re-opened branches could result in consumers becoming more comfortable with technology and devaluing face-to-face interaction. Our business is relationship driven and such changes could necessitate changes to our business practices to accommodate changing consumer behaviors. The potential changes in behaviors driven by COVID-19 also present heightened liquidity risks, for example, arising from increased demand for our products and services (such as unusually high draws on credit facilities) or decreased demand for our products and services (such as idiosyncratic, or broad-based, market or other developments that lead to deposit outflows). 

Legislative and Regulatory Developments. Recent actions taken by the federal government and the Federal Reserve and other bank regulatory agencies to mitigate the economic effects of COVID-19 will also have an impact on our financial position and results of operations. These actions are further discussed below. 

In an emergency measure aimed at blunting the economic impact of COVID-19, the Federal Reserve lowered the target for the federal funds rate to a range of between zero to 0.25% effective on March 16, 2020. This action by the Federal Reserve followed a prior reduction of the targeted federal funds rates to a range of 1.0% to 1.25% effective on March 4, 2020. Our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. As our balance sheet is more asset sensitive, our earnings are more adversely affected by decreases in market interest rates as the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly and to a larger degree than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. The decline in interest rates has already led to new all-time low yields across the US Treasury maturity curve. In June 2020, the Federal Reserve indicated that it expects to maintain the targeted federal funds rate at current levels through 2022. Nonetheless, if the Federal Reserve decreases the targeted federal funds rates even further in response to the economic effects of COVID-19, overall interest rates will decline further, which will negatively impact our net interest income and further compress our net interest margin. 

Table of Co ntents 

Other actions taken by the Federal Reserve in an effort to provide monetary stimulus to counteract the economic disruption caused by COVID-19 include: 

&#8226; Expanded reverse repo operations, adding liquidity to the banking system. 

&#8226; Restarted quantitative easing. 

&#8226; Lowered the interest rate on the discount window by 1.5% to 0.25%. 

&#8226; Reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent. 

&#8226; Encouraged banks to use their capital and liquidity buffers to lend. 

&#8226; Introduced and expanded several new programs that will operate on a temporary basis to help preserve market liquidity. 

The U.S. government has also enacted certain fiscal stimulus measures in several phases to counteract the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19. The Phase 1 legislation, the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, was enacted on March 6, 2020 and, among other things, authorized funding for research and development of vaccines and allocated money to state and local governments to aid containment and response measures. The Phase 2 legislation, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, was enacted on March 18, 2020 and provides for paid sick/medical leave, establishes no-cost coverage for coronavirus testing, expands unemployment benefits, expands food assistance, and provides additional funding to states for the ongoing economic consequences of the pandemic, among other provisions. The Phase 3 legislation, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the &#8220;CARES Act&#8221;), was enacted on March 27, 2020. Among other provisions, the CARES Act (i) authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to make loans, loan guarantees and other investments, up to $500 billion, for assistance to eligible businesses, States and municipalities with limited, targeted relief for passenger air carriers, cargo air carriers, and businesses critical to maintaining national security, (ii) creates a $349 billion loan program called the Paycheck Protection Program (the &#8220;PPP&#8221;) for loans to small businesses for, among other things, payroll, group health care benefit costs and qualifying mortgage, rent and utility payments, (iii) provides certain credits against the 2020 personal income tax for eligible individuals and their dependents, (iv) expands eligibility for unemployment insurance and provides eligible recipients with an additional $600 per week on top of the unemployment amount determined by each State and (v) expands tele-health services in Medicare. The Phase 3.5 legislation, the Paycheck Protection Program and Healthcare Enhancement Act of 2020 (the &#8220;PPPHE Act&#8221;), was enacted on April 24, 2020. Among other things, the PPPHE Act provided an additional $310 billion of funding for the PPP of which, $30 billion is specifically allocated for use by banks and other insured depository institutions that have assets between $10 billion and $50 billion. 

The Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act of 2020&#8221; (the &#8220;PPPF Act&#8221;) was enacted in June 2020 and modifies the PPP as follows: (i) establishes a minimum maturity of five years for all loans made after the enactment of the PPPF Act and permits an extension of the maturity of existing loans to five years if the borrower and lender agree; (ii) extends the &#8220;covered period&#8221; of the CARES Act from June 30, 2020, to December 31, 2020; (iii) extends the eight-week &#8220;covered period&#8221; for expenditures that qualify for forgiveness to the earlier of 24 weeks following loan origination or December 31, 2020; (iv) extends the deferral period for payment of principal, interest and fees to the date on which the forgiveness amount is remitted to the lender by the SBA; (v) requires the borrower to use at least 60% (down from 75%) of the proceeds of the loan for payroll costs, and up to 40% (up from 25%), for other permitted purposes, as a condition to obtaining forgiveness of the loan; (vi) delays from June 30, 2020 to December 31, 2020 the date by which employees must be rehired to avoid a reduction in the amount of forgiveness of a loan, and creates a &#8220;rehiring safe harbor&#8221; that allows businesses to remain eligible for loan forgiveness if they make a good-faith attempt to rehire employees or hire similarly qualified employees, but are unable to do so, or are able to document an inability to return to pre-COVID-19 levels of business activity due to compliance with social distancing measures; and (vii) allows borrowers to receive both loan forgiveness under the PPP and the payroll tax deferral permitted under the CARES Act, rather than having to choose which of the two would be more advantageous. 

In July 2020, the CARES Act was amended to extend, through August 8, 2020, the SBA&#8217;s authority to make commitments under the PPP. The SBA&#8217;s existing authority had previously expired on June 30, 2020. We are continuing to monitor the potential development of additional legislation and further actions taken by the U.S. government. 

The Federal Reserve has created various additional lending facilities and expanded existing facilities to help provide financing in response to the financial disruptions caused by COVID-19. The programs include, among other things, (i) the PPP Facility, which is intended to extend loans to banks making PPP loans, (ii) the Municipal Liquidity Facility, which is intended to facilitate the purchase of eligible notes from states, and certain counties and cities around the country, and (iii) the Main Street Lending Program (&#8220;MSLP&#8221;), which is intended to facilitate credit flows to businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic with up to 10,000 employees or up to $2.5 billion in 2019 annual revenues. As more fully discussed in the section captioned &#8220;Loans&#8221; elsewhere in this discussion, we are currently participating in the PPP as a lender. Additionally, we are currently evaluating participation in the MSLP.

Banks and bank holding companies have been particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of disruption and volatility in the global capital markets. This disruption has impacted our cost of capital and may adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets if we need or desire to do so and, although the ultimate impact cannot be reliably estimated at this time in light of the uncertainties and ongoing developments noted herein, such impacts could be material. Furthermore, bank regulatory agencies have been (and are expected to continue to be) very proactive in responding to both market and supervisory concerns arising from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the potential impact on customers, especially borrowers. As shown during and following the financial crisis of 2007-2008, periods of economic and financial disruption and stress have, in the past, resulted in increased scrutiny of banking organizations. We are closely monitoring the potential for new laws and regulations impacting lending and funding practices as well as capital and liquidity standards. Such changes could require us to maintain significantly more capital, with common equity as a more predominant component, or manage the composition of our assets and liabilities to comply with formulaic liquidity requirements. Furthermore, provisions of the CARES Act allow, but do not require, the FDIC to guarantee deposit obligations of banks in non-interest-bearing transaction accounts through December 31, 2020. Participation in any such guarantee program may result in fees and other assessments as the FDIC determines and may include special assessments. Other provisions of the CARES Act as well as actions taken by bank regulators, such as potential relief for working with borrowers who are distressed as a result of the effects of COVID-19, could similarly impact aggregate deposit insurance expense. 

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Accounting Estimates 

We follow accounting and reporting policies that conform, in all material respects, to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and to general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. While we base estimates on historical experience, current information and other factors deemed to be relevant, actual results could differ from those estimates. 

We consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if (i) the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and (ii) different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial statements. 

Accounting policies related to the allowance for credit losses on financial instruments including loans and off-balance-sheet credit exposures are considered to be critical as these policies involve considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management. As discussed in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, our policies related to allowances for credit losses changed on January 1, 2020 in connection with the adoption of a new accounting standard update as codified in Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 326 (&#8220;ASC 326&#8221;) Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. In the case of loans, the allowance for credit losses is a contra-asset valuation account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected. In the case of off-balance-sheet credit exposures, the allowance for credit losses is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, reported as a component of accrued interest payable and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of each allowance account represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses on these financial instruments considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. While historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions or other relevant factors. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the performance of our portfolios, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets. For additional information regarding critical accounting policies, refer to Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 - Loans in the notes to consolidated financial statements. 

Overview 

A discussion of our results of operations is presented below. Certain reclassifications have been made to make prior periods comparable. Taxable-equivalent adjustments are the result of increasing income from tax-free loans and investments by an amount equal to the taxes that would be paid if the income were fully taxable based on a 21% federal tax rate, thus making tax-exempt yields comparable to taxable asset yields.

Results of Operations 

Net income available to common shareholders totaled $93.1 million, or $1.47 per diluted common share, and $140.3 million, or $2.21 per diluted common share, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $109.6 million, or $1.72 per diluted common share, and $224.1 million, or $3.51 per diluted common share, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. 

Selected data for the comparable periods was as follows:

Net income available to common shareholders decreased $16.5 million, or 15.1%, for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and decreased $83.8 million, or 37.4%, for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. The decrease during the three months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily the result of a $25.6 million increase in credit loss expense, a $7.6 million decrease in net interest income and a $5.0 million decrease in non-interest income partly offset by a $16.2 million decrease in income tax expense and a $3.5 million decrease in non-interest expense. The decrease during the six months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily the result of a $189.8 million increase in credit loss expense, an $18.8 million increase in non-interest expense and a $9.6 million decrease in net interest income partly offset by a $111.1 million increase in non-interest income and a $26.8 million decrease in income tax expense. The increase in credit loss expense during the comparable periods resulted from both our adoption of a new credit loss accounting standard and the adverse events impacting our loan portfolio, including those arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant volatility in oil prices. The increase in non-interest income during the six months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily related to a $109.0 million net gain on securities transactions. Net income available to common shareholders for the six months ended June 30, 2020 was also impacted by the reclassification of $5.5 million of issuance costs associated with our preferred stock to retained earnings upon redemption of the preferred stock in the first quarter. 

Details of the changes in the various components of net income are further discussed below. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, which are used to fund those assets. Net interest income is our largest source of revenue, representing 62.8% of total revenue during the first six months of 2020. Excluding the revenue associated with the $109.0 million net gain on securities transactions realized during the first quarter of 2020, net interest income would have represented 73.0% of total revenue during the first six months of 2020. Net interest margin is the ratio of taxable-equivalent net interest income to average earning assets for the period. The level of interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities impact net interest income and net interest margin.

The Federal Reserve influences the general market rates of interest, including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions. Our loan portfolio is significantly affected by changes in the prime interest rate. The prime rate began 2019 at 5.50% and decreased 50 basis points during the third quarter of 2019 (25 basis points in each of August and September) and 25 basis points in October 2019 to end the year at 4.75%. During 2020, the prime rate decreased 150 basis points in March to 3.25% where it remained through June 30, 2020. Our loan portfolio is also impacted by changes in the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). At June 30, 2020, the one-month and three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR interest rates were 0.16% and 0.30%, respectively, while at June 30, 2019, the one-month and three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR interest rates were 2.40% and 2.32%, respectively. The target range for the federal funds rate, which is the cost of immediately available overnight funds, began 2019 at 2.25% to 2.50% and decreased 50 basis points during the third quarter of 2019 (25 basis points in each of August and September) and 25 basis points in October 2019 to end the year at 1.50 to 1.75%. During 2020, the target range for the federal funds rate decreased 150 basis points in March to zero to 0.25% where it remained through June 30, 2020. As noted in the section captioned &#8220;Recent Developments Related to COVID-19&#8221; elsewhere in this discussion, the decrease in the target range for the federal funds rate in March 2020 was largely an emergency measure by the Federal Reserve aimed at blunting the economic impact of COVID-19. 

We are primarily funded by core deposits, with non-interest-bearing demand deposits historically being a significant source of funds. This lower-cost funding base is expected to have a positive impact on our net interest income and net interest margin in a rising interest rate environment. Though federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits were repealed in 2011, we have not experienced any significant additional interest costs as a result. See Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk elsewhere in this report for information about our sensitivity to interest rates. Further analysis of the components of our net interest margin is presented below. 

The following table presents the changes in taxable-equivalent net interest income and identifies the changes due to differences in the average volume of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the changes due to changes in the average interest rate on those assets and liabilities. The changes in net interest income due to changes in both average volume and average interest rate have been allocated to the average volume change or the average interest rate change in proportion to the absolute amounts of the change in each. The comparison between the quarters includes an additional change factor that shows the effect of the difference in the number of days in each period for assets and liabilities that accrue interest based upon the actual number of days in the period, as further discussed below.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2020 decreased $8.0 million, or 2.9%, while taxable-equivalent net interest income for six months ended June 30, 2020 decreased $10.8 million, or 2.0%, compared to the same periods in 2019. Taxable-equivalent net interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2020 included 182 days compared to 181 days for the same period in 2019 as a result of the leap year. The additional day added approximately $1.8 million to taxable-equivalent net interest income during the six months ended June 30, 2020. Excluding the impact of the additional day results in an effective decrease in taxable-equivalent net interest income of approximately $12.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020. The taxable-equivalent net interest margin decreased 72 basis points from 3.85% during the three months ended June 30, 2019 to 3.13% during the three months ended June 30, 2020 while the taxable-equivalent net interest margin decreased 49 basis points from 3.82% during the six months ended June 30, 2019 to 3.33% during the six months ended June 30, 2020. 

The decreases in taxable-equivalent net interest income and taxable-equivalent net interest margin during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 were primarily related to decreases in the average yields on loans, interest-bearing deposits and federal funds sold and resell agreements combined with decreases in the average volume of taxable securities (based on amortized cost) and increases in the average volume of interest bearing liabilities, and for the three months ended June 30, 2020, a decrease in the average volumes of tax-exempt securities. The impact of these items was partly offset by decreases in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits and other borrowed funds combined with increases in the average volumes of loans and interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve), and for the six months ended June 30, 2020, increases in the average yields on taxable and tax-exempt securities. 

The average volume of interest-earning assets for the three months ended June 30, 2020 increased $6.0 billion, while the average volume of interest-earning assets for the six months ended June 30, 2020 increased $3.9 billion compared to the same periods in 2019, respectively. The increase in the average volume of interest-earning assets for the three months ended June 30, 2020 included a $3.7 billion increase in average interest-bearing deposits, federal funds sold and resell agreements, a $3.2 billion increase in average loans (of which approximately $2.5 billion related to PPP loans, as further discussed below) and a $218.6 million increase in average tax-exempt securities partly offset by a $1.0 billion decrease in average taxable securities. The increase in the average volume of interest-earning assets for the six months ended June 30, 2020 included a $2.3 billion increase in average interest-bearing deposits, federal funds sold and resell agreements, a $2.0 billion increase in average loans (of which $1.2 billion related to PPP loans, as further discussed below) and a $228.6 million increase in average tax-exempt securities partly offset by a $544.3 million decrease in average taxable securities. 

The average taxable-equivalent yield on interest-earning assets decreased 109 basis points from 4.33% during the three months ended June 30, 2019 to 3.24% during the three months ended June 30, 2020 while the average taxable-equivalent yield on interest-earning assets decreased 78 basis points from 4.30% during the six months ended June 30, 2019 to 3.52% during the six months ended June 30, 2020. The average taxable-equivalent yield on interest-earning assets was primarily impacted by the aforementioned changes in market interest rates and changes in the volume and relative mix of interest-earning assets. 

Table of Co ntents 

The average taxable-equivalent yield on loans decreased 139 basis points from 5.34% during the three months ended June 30, 2019 to 3.95% during the three months ended June 30, 2020 while the average taxable-equivalent yield on loans decreased 106 basis points from 5.33% during the six months ended June 30, 2019 to 4.27% during the six months ended June 30, 2020. The average taxable-equivalent yield on loans was negatively impacted by lower average market interest rates during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. The average volume of loans for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 increased $3.2 billion, or 22.1%, and $2.0 billion, or 13.9%, compared to the same periods in 2019. Loans made up approximately 50.0% and 49.4% of average interest-earning assets during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, compared to 49.4% and 49.2% during the same periods in 2019 respectively. As discussed in the section captioned &#8220;Loans&#8221; elsewhere in this discussion, in April 2020, we began originating loans to qualified small businesses under the PPP administered by the SBA under the provisions of the CARES Act. Through June 30, 2020, we have funded approximately $3.2 billion of SBA-approved PPP loans. During the second quarter of 2020, we recognized approximately $19.3 million in PPP loan related deferred processing fees (net of amortization of related deferred origination costs) as a yield adjustment and this amount is included in interest income on loans. As a result of the inclusion of these net fees in interest income, the average yield on PPP loans was approximately 4.13% during the second quarter of 2020 compared to the stated interest rate of 1.0% on these loans. As of June 30, 2020, we expect to recognize additional PPP loan related deferred processing fees (net of deferred origination costs) totaling approximately $77.4 million as a yield adjustment over the remaining terms of these loans. 

The average taxable-equivalent yield on securities was 3.53% during the three months ended June 30, 2020, increasing 11 basis points from 3.42% during the same period in 2019 while the average taxable-equivalent yield on securities was 3.49% during the six months ended June 30, 2020, increasing 9 basis points from 3.40% during the same period in 2019. The average taxable-equivalent yield on securities during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 was positively impacted by increases in the average yields on tax-exempt securities, and for the six months taxable securities, as a result of investments in higher-yielding, longer-duration securities and an increase in the relative proportion tax-exempt securities to total securities. 

The average yield on taxable securities remained unchanged at 2.40% during the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 while the average yield on taxable securities increased 8 basis points from 2.30% during the six months ended June 30, 2019 to 2.38% during the six months ended June 30, 2020. This increase during the six months ended June 30, 2020 resulted as the proceeds from the maturity of a significant volume of U.S. Treasury securities during the second half of 2019 were reinvested in higher-yielding residential mortgage-backed securities. The average taxable-equivalent yield on tax-exempt securities increased 1 basis point from 4.06% during the three months ended June 30, 2019 to 4.07% during the three months ended June 30, 2020 while the average taxable-equivalent yield on tax-exempt securities increased 2 basis points from 4.05% during the six months ended June 30, 2019 to 4.07% during the six months ended June 30, 2020. Tax exempt securities made up approximately 67.7% and 66.5% of total average securities during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, compared to 61.8% and 63.1% during the same respective periods in 2019. The average volume of total securities (based on carrying amount) during the three months ended June 30, 2020 decreased $821.5 million, or 6.2%, compared to the same period in 2019 while the average volume of total securities (based on carrying amount) during the six months ended June 30, 2020 decreased $315.7 million, or 2.4%, compared to the same period in 2019. Securities made up approximately 35.6% of average interest-earning assets during the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 45.8% during the same period in 2019 while securities made up approximately 38.6% of average interest-earning assets during the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 44.9% during the same period in 2019. The decreases were partly related to the impact of PPP loans and increased interest-bearing deposits on total average interest-earning assets. 

Average interest-bearing deposits, federal funds sold and resell agreements for the three months ended June 30, 2020 increased $3.7 billion, or 258.5%, compared to the same period in 2019 while average interest-bearing deposits, federal funds sold and resell agreements for the six months ended June 30, 2020 increased $2.3 billion, or 133.6%, compared to the same period in 2019. Interest-bearing deposits, federal funds sold and resell agreements made up approximately 14.5% and 12.0% of average interest-earning assets during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, compared to 4.9% and 5.8% during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively. The increases in the average volume of interest-bearing deposits, federal funds sold and resell agreements was primarily due to an increase in the average volume of amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily due to an increase in the average volume of deposits and other borrowed funds and the proceeds from the sale of securities. The combined average yield on interest-bearing deposits, federal funds sold and resell agreements was 0.10% and 0.51% during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, compared to 2.62% and 2.53% during the same periods in 2019, respectively. The average yield on interest-bearing deposits, federal funds sold and resell agreements was negatively impacted by lower average market interest rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. 

The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 0.19% during the three months ended June 30, 2020 decreasing 61 basis points from 0.80% during the same period in 2019 while the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 0.33% 

Table of Co ntents 

during the six months ended June 30, 2020 decreasing 48 basis points from 0.81% during the same period in 2019. Average deposits increased $5.3 billion, or 20.5%, during the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 and included a $1.7 billion increase in average interest-bearing deposits and a $3.6 billion increase in average non-interest bearing deposits. Average deposits increased $3.3 billion, or 12.7%, during the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 and included a $1.2 billion increase in average interest-bearing deposits and a $2.1 billion increase in average non-interest bearing deposits. The ratio of average interest-bearing deposits to total average deposits was 56.0% and 58.2% during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, compared to 61.0% during the same periods in 2019. The average cost of deposits is primarily impacted by changes in market interest rates as well as changes in the volume and relative mix of interest-bearing deposits. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits and total deposits was 0.14% and 0.08%, respectively, during the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 0.68% and 0.41%, respectively, during the same period in 2019. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits and total deposits was 0.26% and 0.15%, respectively, during the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 0.69% and 0.42%, respectively, during the same period in 2019. The average cost of deposits during the first six months of 2020 was impacted by decreases in the interest rates we pay on most of our interest-bearing deposit products as a result of the aforementioned decreases in market interest rates. 

In April 2020, we borrowed an aggregate $1.3 billion from the Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) to provide additional liquidity in light of our significant PPP lending volume. These advances were subsequently paid-off in May 2020 as we determined additional liquidity resources were not necessary. Average FHLB advances totaled $439.6 million during the second quarter of 2020 while the average cost of these advances was 0.29%. The cost of the advances was partly offset by dividends received on the FHLB stock we were required to purchase in connection with the advances. The FHLB stock was redeemed in connection with the repayment of the advances. 

Our net interest spread, which represents the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, was 3.19% during the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 3.49% during same period in 2019. The net interest spread, as well as the net interest margin, will be impacted by future changes in short-term and long-term interest rate levels, as well as the impact from the competitive environment. A discussion of the effects of changing interest rates on net interest income is set forth in Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included elsewhere in this report. 

Our hedging policies permit the use of various derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, swaptions, caps and floors, to manage exposure to changes in interest rates. Details of our derivatives and hedging activities are set forth in Note 8 - Derivative Financial Instruments in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Information regarding the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on our derivative financial instruments is set forth in Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included elsewhere in this report. 

Our net interest income and net interest margin have been, and we currently expect them to continue to be, impacted by the aforementioned decreases in market interest rates and the expectation that interest rates will remain at these low levels for some period of time in light of the on-going economic disruption arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our participation in the PPP, as discussed above, is expected to continue to positively impact net interest income and net interest margin in the near term. 

Credit Loss Expense 

Credit loss expense is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for credit loss accounts for various types of financial instruments including loans, securities and off-balance-sheet credit exposures after net charge-offs have been deducted to bring the allowances to a level which, in management&#8217;s best estimate, is necessary to absorb expected credit losses over the lives of the respective financial instruments. The components of credit loss expense were as follows: 

Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Credit loss expense related to: Loans $ 27,228 &#160; $ 6,400 &#160; $ 200,153 &#160; $ 17,403 &#160; Off-balance-sheet credit exposures 4,775 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 7,062 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Securities held to maturity (28) &#160; &#8212; &#160; (43) &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total $ 31,975 &#160; $ 6,400 &#160; $ 207,172 &#160; $ 17,403 &#160; 

Credit loss expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 was calculated under the prior incurred loss accounting methodology. See the section captioned &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; elsewhere in this discussion for further analysis of credit loss expense related to loans and off-balance-sheet credit exposures. 

Table of Co ntents 

Non-Interest Income 

The components of non-interest income were as follows: 

Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Trust and investment management fees $ 31,060 &#160; $ 30,448 &#160; $ 65,533 &#160; $ 62,145 &#160; Service charges on deposit accounts 17,580 &#160; 21,798 &#160; 40,231 &#160; 42,588 &#160; Insurance commissions and fees 10,668 &#160; 10,118 &#160; 27,153 &#160; 28,524 &#160; Interchange and debit card transaction fees 2,966 &#160; 3,868 &#160; 6,221 &#160; 7,148 &#160; Other charges, commissions and fees 7,663 &#160; 8,933 &#160; 17,028 &#160; 17,995 &#160; Net gain (loss) on securities transactions &#8212; &#160; 169 &#160; 108,989 &#160; 169 &#160; Other 7,664 &#160; 7,304 &#160; 25,361 &#160; 20,854 &#160; Total $ 77,601 &#160; $ 82,638 &#160; $ 290,516 &#160; $ 179,423 &#160; 

Total non-interest income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 decreased $5.0 million, or 6.1%, and increased $111.1 million, or 61.9%, respectively compared to the same periods in 2019. Excluding $109.0 million and $169 thousand in net gains on securities transaction during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, total non-interest income increased $2.3 million, or 1.3%, during the six months ended June 30, 2020. Changes in the various components of non-interest income are discussed in more detail below. 

Trust and Investment Management Fees. Trust and investment management fees for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 increased $612 thousand, or 2.0%, and $3.4 million, or 5.5%, respectively compared to the same periods in 2019. Investment fees are the most significant component of trust and investment management fees, making up approximately 80.2% and 82.2% of total trust and investment management fees for the first six months of 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in trust and investment management fees during the three months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily due to increases in trust investment fees (up $699 thousand) and custody fees (up $389 thousand) partly offset by decreases in real estate fees (down $257 thousand) and oil and gas fees (down $102 thousand). The increase in trust and investment management fees during the six months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily due to increases in trust investment fees (up $1.4 million), estate fees (up $1.1 million), real estate fees (up $384 thousand) and oil and gas fees (up $373 thousand). Investment and other custodial account fees are generally based on the market value of assets within a trust account. The increase in trust investment fees was primarily related to an increase in the number of accounts. The fluctuations in estate fees and real estate fees were primarily related to variation in transaction volume. Oil and gas fees during the second quarter of 2020 were impacted by the sharp decline in oil prices in March 2020. Volatility in the equity and bond markets impacts the market value of trust assets and the related investment fees. Investor concerns related to the uncertain economic outlook arising from the COVID-19 pandemic have caused significant market volatility resulting in significant declines in market valuations, particularly among equity securities, during the latter part of the first quarter of 2020 and the early part of the second quarter of 2020. While as of June 30, 2020, market valuations have rebounded somewhat from recent declines, the volatility and on-going uncertainty related to the economic effects of COVID-19 impacted trust and investment management fees during the second quarter of 2020. Furthermore, trust and investment management fees may be similarly impacted in future periods as a result of decreased demand and overall transaction volume for our other trust services. 

At June 30, 2020, trust assets, including both managed assets and custody assets, were primarily composed of equity securities (49.3% of assets), fixed income securities (34.7% of assets) and cash equivalents (9.7% of assets). The estimated fair value of these assets was $35.7 billion (including managed assets of $15.8 billion and custody assets of $19.9 billion) at June 30, 2020, compared to $37.8 billion (including managed assets of $16.4 billion and custody assets of $21.4 billion) at December 31, 2019 and $36.2 billion (including managed assets of $15.6 billion and custody assets of $20.5 billion) at June 30, 2019. 

Service Charges on Deposit Accounts. Service charges on deposit accounts for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 decreased $4.2 million, or 19.4%, and $2.4 million, or 5.5%, compared to the same periods in 2019. The decreases were primarily related to decreases in overdraft/insufficient funds charges on consumer and commercial accounts. Overdraft/insufficient funds charges totaled $5.6 million ($4.5 million consumer and $1.2 million commercial) during the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $10.3 million ($8.1 million consumer and $2.2 million commercial) during the same period in 2019. Overdraft/insufficient funds charges totaled $16.1 million ($12.6 million consumer and $3.6 million commercial) during the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $19.9 million ($15.5 million consumer and $4.4 million commercial) during the same period in 2019. Consumer overdraft/insufficient funds charges decreased $3.6 million and $3.0 million during the three months and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, while commercial overdrafts/insufficient funds charges decreased $1.0 million and $812 thousand during the same respective periods. The decreases in overdraft/insufficient funds 

Table of Co ntents 

charges during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 were primarily related to a decrease in the volume of overdrafts relative to the same periods in 2019. 

Commercial service charges increased $722 thousand and $2.0 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. The increases in commercial service charges were impacted by a lower earnings credit rate partly offset by decreases in the volume of billable services. The earnings credit rate is the value given to deposits maintained by treasury management customers. Earnings credits applied to customer deposit balances offset service fees that would otherwise be charged. Because average market interest rates in 2020 were lower compared to 2019, deposit balances have become less valuable and are yielding a lower earnings credit rate. 

Insurance Commissions and Fees . Insurance commissions and fees for the three months ended June 30, 2020 increased $550 thousand, or 5.4%, while insurance commissions and fees for the six months ended June 30, 2020 decreased $1.4 million, or 4.8%, compared to the same periods in 2019. The increase in insurance commissions and fees during the three months ended June 30, 2020 was the result of increases in commission income (up $495 thousand) and contingent income (up $55 thousand). The increase in commission income during the three months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily related to increases in commercial lines and, to a lesser extent, personal lines property and casualty commissions resulting from increased rates combined with increased coverage levels. The decrease in insurance commissions and fees during the six months ended June 30, 2020 was the result of decreases in commission income (down $835 thousand) and contingent income (down $535 thousand). The decrease in commission income was primarily related to decreases in benefit plan commissions and life insurance commissions partly offset by increases in both commercial lines and personal lines property and casualty commissions. The decrease in benefit plan commissions was related to decreased business volumes, premium reductions and flat to lower market rates. The decrease in life insurance commissions was related to a decrease business volumes. The increases in commercial lines and personal lines property and casualty commissions were related to increased rates, partly offset by decreased business volumes. 

Contingent income totaled $414 thousand and $3.0 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, compared to $359 thousand and $3.6 million during the same periods in 2019. Contingent income primarily consists of amounts received from various property and casualty insurance carriers related to the loss performance of insurance policies previously placed. These performance related contingent payments are seasonal in nature and are mostly received during the first quarter of each year. This performance related contingent income totaled $2.1 million and $2.7 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in performance related contingent income during 2020 was related to lower growth within the portfolio combined with a deterioration in the loss performance of insurance policies previously placed. Contingent income also includes amounts received from various benefit plan insurance companies related to the volume of business generated and/or the subsequent retention of such business. This benefit plan related contingent income totaled $378 thousand and $986 thousand during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, compared to $262 thousand and $865 thousand during the same periods in 2019. 

Notwithstanding normal seasonal variation, commission income during the second quarter of 2020 was partly impacted by reduced business volumes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, relative to the first quarter of 2020. Commission income in future periods may be similarly impacted. Benefit plan commissions may be particularly impacted by the effects of temporary furloughs and permanent layoffs. The COVID-19 pandemic has also given rise to a hard insurance market characterized by decreased capacity for most types of insurance coupled with more stringent underwriting standards among insurers. This may cause clients to drop or adjust coverage choices as part of expense control measures. Reduced business volumes may also adversely impact the level of contingent commissions we receive in 2021.

Interchange and Debit Card Transaction Fees . Interchange fees, or &#8220;swipe&#8221; fees, are charges that merchants pay to us and other card-issuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions. Interchange and debit card transaction fees consist of income from debit card usage, point of sale income from PIN-based debit card transactions and ATM service fees. Interchange and debit card transaction fees are reported net of related network costs. 

A comparison of gross and net interchange and debit card transaction fees for the reported periods is presented in the table below. Revenue from interchange and debit card transactions was impacted by reduced transaction volumes and fee waivers resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. We currently expect that revenue from interchange and debit card transactions will be similarly impacted in future periods. 

Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Income from debit card transactions $ 5,527 &#160; $ 5,974 &#160; $ 11,332 &#160; $ 11,379 &#160; ATM service fees 753 &#160; 1,086 &#160; 1,680 &#160; 2,067 &#160; Gross interchange and debit card transaction fees 6,280 &#160; 7,060 &#160; 13,012 &#160; 13,446 &#160; Network costs 3,314 &#160; 3,192 &#160; 6,791 &#160; 6,298 &#160; Net interchange and debit card transaction fees $ 2,966 &#160; $ 3,868 &#160; $ 6,221 &#160; $ 7,148 &#160; 

Federal Reserve rules applicable to financial institutions that have assets of $10 billion or more provide that the maximum permissible interchange fee for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. An upward adjustment of no more than 1 cent to an issuer's debit card interchange fee is allowed if the card issuer develops and implements policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve certain fraud-prevention standards. The Federal Reserve also has rules governing routing and exclusivity that require issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product. 

Other Charges, Commissions and Fees . Other charges, commissions and fees for the three months ended June 30, 2020 decreased $1.3 million, or 14.2%, compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease included decreases in income from the sale of money market accounts (down $551 thousand) and mutual funds (down $134 thousand); funds transfer service charges (down $157 thousand); and merchant services rebates (down $134 thousand); among other things. Other charges, commissions and fees for the six months ended June 30, 2020 decreased $967 thousand, or 5.4%, compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease included decreases in letter of credit fees (down $403 thousand); income from the sale of life insurance (down $384 thousand) and money market accounts (down $298 thousand thousand); income from capital markets advisory services (down $223 thousand); funds transfer service charges (down $140 thousand); and merchant service rebates (down $115 thousand); among other things. The decreases in these items were partly offset by increases in income from the sale of mutual funds (up $278 thousand) and annuities (up $166 thousand) and an increase in brokerage commissions (up $115 thousand). The aforementioned revenue streams were adversely impacted by reduced transaction volumes during the second quarter of 2020 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. We currently expect that these revenue streams will be similarly impacted in future periods. 

Net Gain/Loss on Securities Transactions . During the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, we sold certain available-for-sale securities with amortized costs totaling $1.1 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. We realized a net gain of $109.0 million on the 2020 sales and a net gain of $169 thousand on the 2019 sales. During the first quarter of 2020, we sold $483.1 million of residential mortgage-backed securities and realized a net gain of $1.9 million on those sales. The proceeds from these sales were reinvested into other residential mortgage-backed securities that had lower pre-payment rates. We also sold $519.1 million of 30-year U.S Treasury securities during the first quarter of 2020 and realized a net gain of $107.1 million on those sales. These U.S. Treasury securities were purchased during the fourth quarter of 2019 to hedge, in effect, against falling interest rates. Prior to their sale, these securities had significant unrealized holding gains as a result of decreases in market interest rates during the first quarter of 2020. We elected to sell these securities to provide liquidity and realize the gains. 

During the first six months of 2019, we purchased and subsequently sold $2.4 billion of U.S. Treasury securities in connection with our tax planning strategies related to the Texas franchise tax. The gross proceeds from the sales of these securities outside of Texas are included in total revenues/receipts from all sources reported for Texas franchise tax purposes, which results in a reduction in the overall percentage of revenues/receipts apportioned to Texas and subjected to taxation under the Texas franchise tax. We realized a net gain of $3 thousand on those sales. We also sold certain available-for-sale U.S. Treasury securities with an amortized cost totaling $548.9 million and certain available-for-sale municipal securities with an amortized cost totaling $310.7 million. We realized a net gain of $166 thousand on those sales. The proceeds from the sales provided short-term liquidity and were subsequently reinvested in other higher yielding securities.

Other Non-Interest Income. Other non-interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2020 increased $360 thousand, or 4.9%, compared to the same period in 2019. The increase was primarily related to an increase in public finance underwriting fees (up $759 thousand) partly offset by a decrease in income from customer foreign exchange transactions (down $362 thousand). Changes in these items were primarily due to an fluctuations in business volumes. Other non-interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2020 increased $4.5 million, or 21.6%, compared to the same period in 2019. Other non-interest income during the six months ended June 30, 2020 included approximately $6.0 million in gains realized on the sale of certain non-hedge related, short-term put options on U.S. Treasury securities with an aggregate notional amount of $500 million. The put options were not exercised and expired in March 2020. The increase in other non-interest income during the six months ended June 30, 2020 was also partly related to an increase in income from customer derivative and trading activities (up $1.6 million), primarily due to an increase in business volume, an increase in sundry and other miscellaneous income (up $1.2 million) and an increase in public finance underwriting fees (up $677 thousand). Sundry and other miscellaneous income included $2.6 million and $931 thousand related to the recovery of prior write-offs in 2020 and 2019, respectively, among other things. The aforementioned items were partly offset by a decrease in gains on the sale of foreclosed and other assets (down $4.6 million). Other non-interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 included gains on the sale of various branch and operational facilities totaling $758 thousand and $5.4 million, respectively, among other things. 

Non-Interest Expense 

The components of non-interest expense were as follows: 

Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Salaries and wages $ 90,350 &#160; $ 90,790 &#160; $ 189,162 &#160; $ 183,266 &#160; Employee benefits 18,861 &#160; 20,051 &#160; 43,750 &#160; 43,577 &#160; Net occupancy 25,266 &#160; 21,133 &#160; 50,650 &#160; 40,400 &#160; Technology, furniture and equipment 26,046 &#160; 22,157 &#160; 51,286 &#160; 43,821 &#160; Deposit insurance 2,800 &#160; 2,453 &#160; 5,424 &#160; 5,261 &#160; Intangible amortization 241 &#160; 305 &#160; 498 &#160; 630 &#160; Other 36,115 &#160; 46,320 &#160; 83,072 &#160; 88,054 &#160; Total $ 199,679 &#160; $ 203,209 &#160; $ 423,842 &#160; $ 405,009 &#160; 

Total non-interest expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 decreased $3.5 million, or 1.7%, and $18.8 million, or 4.7%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019. Changes in the various components of non-interest expense are discussed below. 

Salaries and Wages . Salaries and wages for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 decreased $440 thousand, or 0.5%, and increased $5.9 million, or 3.2%, compared to the same periods in 2019. The decrease during the three months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily related to an increase in salary costs deferred as loan origination costs in connection with the high volume of PPP loan originations during the second quarter of 2020. These deferred salary costs, which totaled $5.5 million, will be recognized as a yield adjustment component of interest income over the remaining terms of these loans. The decrease was also partly related to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. The impact of these items was mostly offset by an increase in salaries due to an increase in the number of employees and normal, annual merit and market increases. The increase in salaries and wages during the six months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily related to an increase in salaries, due to an increase in the number of employees and normal, annual merit and market increases, partly offset the aforementioned increase in salary costs deferred as loan origination costs and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. 

Employee Benefits . Employee benefits expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 decreased $1.2 million, or 5.9%, and increased $173 thousand, or 0.4%, compared to the same periods in 2019. The decrease in employee benefits expense during the three months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily related to decreases in certain discretionary benefit plan expenses partly offset by an increase in medical benefits expense and payroll taxes, among other things. The increase in employee benefits expense during the six months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily due to increases in medical benefits expense and payroll taxes mostly offset by a decreases in certain discretionary benefit plan expenses. 

Our defined benefit retirement and restoration plans were frozen effective as of December 31, 2001 and were replaced by a profit sharing plan (which was merged with and into our 401(k) plan during 2019). Management believes these actions helped to reduce the volatility in retirement plan expense. However, we still have funding obligations related to the defined benefit and restoration plans and could recognize retirement expense related to these plans in future years, which would be dependent on the return earned on plan assets, the level of interest rates and employee turnover. A prolonged negative impact on the value of stocks and other asset classes due to the COVID-19 pandemic could result in a significant reduction to pension plan asset values 

Table of Co ntents 

and expected returns, which could impact the level of future funding and expense. See Note 12 - Defined Benefit Plans for additional information related to our net periodic pension benefit/cost. 

Net Occupancy . Net occupancy expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 increased $4.1 million, or 19.6%, and increased $10.3 million, or 25.4%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019. The increases were primarily related to increases in lease expense (up $2.1 million and $4.9 million, respectively), depreciation on leasehold improvements (up $1.3 million and $2.3 million respectively), property taxes (up $809 thousand and $1.6 million, respectively) and building depreciation (up $466 thousand and $964 thousand, respectively), among other things. The increases from these items were partly offset by decreases in repairs and maintenance/service contracts expense (down $1.1 million and $600 thousand, respectively). Net occupancy expense was impacted by the commencement of the lease of our new corporate headquarters building in San Antonio in June 2019, as well as renewals of other leases related to existing facilities and new locations, in part related to our expansion within the Houston market area. 

Technology, Furniture and Equipment. Technology, furniture and equipment expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 increased $3.9 million, or 17.6%, and increased $7.5 million, or 17.0%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019. The increases were primarily related to increases in cloud services expense (up $2.4 million and $3.9 million, respectively), depreciation of furniture and equipment (up $961 thousand and $2.0 million, respectively) and software maintenance (up $523 thousand and $1.8 million respectively). 

Deposit Insurance . Deposit insurance expense totaled $2.8 million and $5.4 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $2.5 million and $5.3 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. Provisions of the CARES Act allow, but do not require, the FDIC to expand deposit insurance coverage for non-interest-bearing transaction accounts through December 31, 2020. Such action could result in additional deposit insurance expense. Other provisions of the CARES Act as well as actions taken by bank regulators, such as potential relief for working with borrowers who are distressed as a result of the effects of COVID-19, could similarly impact aggregate deposit insurance expense. 

Other Non-Interest Expense . Other non-interest expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 decreased $10.2 million, or 22.0%, and decreased $5.0 million, or 5.7%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019. The decrease in other non-interest expense during the three months ended June 30, 2020 included decreases in advertising/promotions expense (down $3.1 million); travel, meals and entertainment expense (down $3.0 million); and business development expense (down $806 thousand), among other things. The decrease in other non-interest expense during the three months ended June 30, 2020 was also partly due to an increase in costs deferred as loan origination costs in connection with the high volume of PPP loan originations during the second quarter of 2020. These deferred costs, which totaled $1.8 million, will be recognized as a yield adjustment component of interest income over the remaining terms of these loans. The decrease in other non-interest expense during the six months ended June 30, 2020 included decreases in travel, meals and entertainment expense (down $3.0 million); advertising/promotions expense (down $2.5 million); and business development expense (down $435 thousand), among other things. The decrease in other non-interest expense during the six months ended June 30, 2020 was also partly due to the aforementioned increase in costs deferred as loan origination costs in connection with the high volume of PPP loan originations during the second quarter of 2020. The decreases in these items were partly offset by increases in donations expense (up $859 thousand); telephone/data communications expense (up $777 thousand); platform fees related to investment services (up $777 thousand); professional services expense (up $511 thousand); and sundry and other miscellaneous expenses (up $465 thousand). 

Results of Segment Operations 

Our operations are managed along two primary operating segments: Banking and Frost Wealth Advisors. A description of each business and the methodologies used to measure financial performance is described in Note 15 - Operating Segments in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Net income (loss) by operating segment is presented below:

Net income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 decreased $18.4 million, or 16.6%, and decreased $79.3 million, or 35.4%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019. The decrease during the three months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily the result of a $25.6 million increase in credit loss expense, a $7.7 million decrease in net interest income and a $4.9 million decrease in non-interest income partly offset by a $15.9 million decrease in income tax expense and a $3.9 million decrease in non-interest expense. The decrease during the six months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily the result of a $189.8 million increase in credit loss expense, a $13.8 million increase in non-interest expense and a $9.9 million decrease in net interest income partly offset by a $108.1 million increase in non-interest income and a $26.0 million decrease in income tax expense. 

Net interest income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 decreased $7.7 million, or 3.0%, and decreased $9.9 million, or 2.0%, compared to the same periods in 2019. The decreases were primarily related to decreases in the average yields on loans, interest-bearing deposits and federal funds sold and resell agreements combined with decreases in the average volumes of taxable securities (based on amortized cost) and increases in the average volume of interest bearing liabilities, and for the three months ended June 30, 2020, a decrease in the average volume of tax-exempt securities. The impact of these items was partly offset by decreases in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits and other borrowed funds combined with increases in the average volumes of loans and interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve), and for the six months ended June 30, 2020, increases in the average yields on taxable and tax-exempt securities. Net interest income for the first six months of 2020 was also positively impacted by the additional day as a result of leap year. See the analysis of net interest income included in the section captioned &#8220;Net Interest Income&#8221; included elsewhere in this discussion. 

Credit loss expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 totaled $32.0 million and $207.2 million compared to $6.4 million and $17.4 million for the same periods in 2019. The increases resulted from both our adoption of a new credit loss accounting standard and the adverse events impacting our loan portfolio, including those arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant decline in oil prices. See the sections captioned &#8220;Credit Loss Expense&#8221; and &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; elsewhere in this discussion for further analysis of credit loss expense related to loans and off-balance-sheet commitments. 

Non-interest income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 decreased $4.9 million, or 10.2% and increased $108.1 million, or 99.9%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019. The decrease during the three months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily due to decreases in services charges on deposit accounts, interchange and debit card transaction fees, and other charges, commissions partly offset by increases in insurance commissions and fees and other non-interest income. The increase during the six months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily due to a $109.0 million net gain on securities transactions. Excluding the net gain on securities transactions during the six months ended June 30, 2020, total non-interest income for the Banking segment decreased $702 thousand, or 0.6%, compared to the same period in 2019. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in services charges on deposit accounts, insurance commissions and fees, interchange and debit card transaction fees, and other charges, commissions and fees partly offset by an increase in other non-interest income. The decreases in services charges on deposit accounts during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 were primarily related to decreases in overdraft/insufficient funds charges on consumer and commercial accounts due to decreases in transaction volumes. The decreases in interchange and debit card transactions fees during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 were impacted by reduced transaction volumes and fee waivers resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in other charges, commissions and fees during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 included decreases in funds transfer service charges; merchant services rebates; income from capital markets advisory services; and letter of credit fees; among other things. The increase in other non-interest income during the three months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily related to increases in public finance underwriting fees and income from customer derivative and trading activities partly offset by a decrease in income from customer foreign exchange transactions. Changes in these items were primarily due to fluctuations in business volumes. The increase in other non-interest income during the six months ended June 30, 2020 included approximately $6.0 million in gains realized on the sale of certain non-hedge related, short-term put options on U.S. Treasury securities with an aggregate notional amount of $500 million. The put options were not exercised and expired in March 2020. The increase in other non-interest income during the six months ended June 30, 2020 was also partly related to an increase in income from customer derivative and trading activities, primarily due to an increase in business volume, an increase in sundry and other miscellaneous income and an increase in public finance underwriting fees. The fluctuations in insurance commissions and fees during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 are further discussed below in relation to Frost Insurance Agency. See the analysis of these categories of non-interest income included in the section captioned &#8220;Non-Interest Income&#8221; included elsewhere in this discussion. 

Non-interest expense decreased $3.9 million, or 2.3%, for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and increased $13.8 million, or 4.0%, for the six months ended June 30, 2020, compared to the same periods in 2019. The decrease during the three months ended was primarily due to decreases in other non-interest expense, employee benefits and salaries and wages partly

offset by increases in technology, furniture and equipment expense and net occupancy expense. The increase during the six months ended was primarily related to increases in technology, furniture and equipment expense, net occupancy expense and salaries and wages partly offset by a decrease in other non-interest expense. The decrease in other non-interest expense during the three months ended June 30, 2020 included decreases in advertising/promotions expense; travel, meals and entertainment expense; business development expense, and professional service expense, among other things. The decrease in other non-interest expense during the six months ended June 30, 2020 included decreases in travel, meals and entertainment expense; advertising/promotions expense; and business development expense, among other things. The decreases in these items were partly offset by increases in donations expense; telephone/data communications expense; professional services expense; and sundry and other miscellaneous expenses. The decreases in other non-interest expense during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 were also partly due to an increase in costs deferred as loan origination costs in connection with the high volume of PPP loan originations during the second quarter of 2020. The decrease in employee benefits expense during the three months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily related to decreases in certain benefit plan expenses partly offset by an increase in medical benefits expense and payroll taxes, among other things. The decrease in salaries and wages during the three months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily related to an increase in salary costs deferred as loan origination costs in connection with the high volume of PPP loan originations during the second quarter of 2020. The increase in salaries and wages during the six months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily related to an increase in salaries, due to an increase in the number of employees and normal annual merit and market increases, partly offset the aforementioned increase in salary costs deferred as loan origination costs and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. The increases in technology, furniture and equipment expense during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 were primarily related to increases in cloud services expense, depreciation of furniture and equipment and software maintenance. The increases in net occupancy expense during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 were primarily related to increases in lease expense, depreciation on leasehold improvements, property taxes and building depreciation, among other things. The increases from these items were partly offset by decreases in repairs and maintenance/service contracts expense. See the analysis of these categories of non-interest expense included in the section captioned &#8220;Non-Interest Expense&#8221; included elsewhere in this discussion. 

Frost Insurance Agency, which is included in the Banking operating segment, had gross commission revenues of $10.7 million and $27.2 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $10.1 million and $28.7 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. The increase in insurance commissions and fees during the three months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily the result of increases in commission income, primarily related to increases in commercial lines and, to a lesser extent, personal lines property and casualty commissions resulting from increased rates combined with increased in coverage levels. The decrease in insurance commissions and fees during the six months ended June 30, 2020 was the result of decreases in commission income and contingent income. The decrease in commission income was primarily related to decreases in benefit plan commissions (related to decreased business volumes, premium reductions and flat to lower market rates) and life insurance commissions (related to decreased business volumes) partly offset by increases in both commercial lines and personal lines property and casualty commissions (related to increased rates, partly offset by decreased business volumes). Business volumes during the second quarter of 2020 were adversely impacted the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in contingent income during the six months ended June 30, 2020 was partly due to lower growth and a deterioration in the loss performance of insurance policies previously placed. See the analysis of insurance commissions and fees included in the section captioned &#8220;Non-Interest Income&#8221; included elsewhere in this discussion.

Net income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 decreased $972 thousand, or 19.8%, and decreased $1.8 million, or 15.8%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019. The decrease during three months ended was primarily related to a $672 thousand increase in non-interest expense, a $412 thousand decrease in net interest income and a $148 thousand decrease in non-interest income partly offset by a $258 thousand decrease in income tax expense. The decrease during the six months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily related to a $5.0 million increase in non-interest expense and a $488 thousand decrease in net interest income partly offset by a $3.2 million increase in non-interest income and $474 thousand decrease in income tax expense. 

Net interest income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 decreased $412 thousand, or 37.6%, and $488 thousand, or 23.8%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019. These decreases were primarily due to decreases in the average funds transfer prices allocated to the funds provided by Frost Wealth Advisors. The decreases in the average funds transfer prices were primarily due to decreases in market interest rates. See the analysis of net interest income included in the section captioned &#8220;Net Interest Income&#8221; included elsewhere in this discussion. 

Non-interest income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 decreased $148 thousand, or 0.4%, and increased $3.2 million, or 4.5%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019. The decrease during the three months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily related to a decrease in other charges, commissions and fees mostly offset by an increase in trust and investment management fees. The increase during the six months end June 30, 2020 was primarily related to an increase in trust and investment management fees. Trust and investment management fee income is the most significant income component 

Table of Co ntents 

for Frost Wealth Advisors. Investment fees are the most significant component of trust and investment management fees, making up approximately 80.2% of total trust and investment management fees for the first six months of 2020. 

The decrease in other charges, commissions and fees during the three months ended included decreases in income from the sale of money market accounts and mutual funds, among other things. The increase in trust and investment management fees during the three months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily due to increases in trust investment fees and custody fees partly offset by decreases in real estate fees and oil and gas fees. The increase in trust and investment management fees during the six months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily due to increases in trust investment fees, estate fees, real estate fees and oil and gas fees. See the analysis of trust and investment management fees, particularly as it relates to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and other charges, commissions and fees included in the section captioned &#8220;Non-Interest Income&#8221; included elsewhere in this discussion. 

Non-interest expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 increased $672 thousand, or 2.2%, and $5.0 million, or 8.4%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019. The increase during the three months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily due to an increase in net occupancy expense partly offset by a decrease in other non-interest expense. The increase during the six months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily due to increases in net occupancy expense and salaries and wages. The increases in net occupancy expense during the three and six months end June 30, 2020 were primarily related to increases in lease expense. The decrease in other non-interest expense during the three months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily related to decreases in travel, meals and entertainment expense, professional service expense and management fee expense, among other things. The increase in salaries and wages during the six months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily due to an increase in the number of employees and normal, annual merit and market increases. 

Non-Banks 

The Non-Banks operating segment had net losses of $3.3 million and $6.2 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, compared to a net losses of $4.2 million and $7.0 million during the same respective periods in 2019. The decreases in the net losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 were primarily due to decreases in net interest expense, primarily related to decreases in the average rates paid on our long term borrowings, and increases in income tax benefit. The net loss during the three months ended June 30, 2020 was also partly reduced by a decrease in other non-interest expense. This decrease was primarily related to a decrease in travel, meals and entertainment expense. 

Income Taxes 

During the three months ended June 30, 2020, we recognized an income tax benefit of $1.3 million, for an effective tax rate of negative 1.4%, compared to income tax expense of $14.9 million, for an effective tax rate of 11.8%, during the same period in 2019. During the six months ended June 30, 2020, we recognized income tax expense of $2.0 million, for an effective tax rate of 1.3%, compared to income tax expense of $28.8 million, for an effective tax rate of 11.2%, for the same period in 2019. 

The effective income tax rates differed from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 21% during 2020 and 2019 primarily due to the effect of tax-exempt income from loans, securities and life insurance policies and the income tax effects associated with stock-based compensation, among other things, and their relative proportion to total pre-tax net income. The decreases in the effective tax rates during 2020 were primarily related to a decrease in pre-tax net income. The effective tax rates during 2020 were also impacted by a one-time, discrete tax benefit associated with an asset contribution to a charitable trust during the second quarter. 

Average Balance Sheet 

Average assets totaled $35.7 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2020 representing an increase of $4.3 billion, or 13.7%, compared to average assets for the same period in 2019. Earning assets increased $3.9 billion, or 13.5%, during the first six months of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The increase in earning assets was primarily related to a $2.3 billion increase in average interest-bearing deposits, federal funds sold and resell agreements; a $2.0 billion increase in average loans; and a $228.6 million increase in average tax-exempt securities partly offset by a $544.3 million decrease in average taxable securities. Average premises and equipment increased $261.4 million, or 33.9%, in part due to the commencement of the lease on our new downtown San Antonio headquarters in the second quarter of 2019 as well as the commencement of other new leases associated with various new branch locations. Average deposits increased $3.3 billion, or 12.7%, during the first six months of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The increase included a $2.1 billion increase in non-interest bearing deposits and a $1.2 billion increase in interest-bearing deposit accounts. Average non-interest bearing deposits made up 41.8% and 39.0% of average total deposits during the first six months of 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Loans increased $3.2 billion, or 21.8%, compared to December 31, 2019. As further discussed below, during the second quarter of 2020, we began originating loans to qualified small businesses under the PPP administered by the SBA under the provisions of the CARES Act. Excluding PPP loans, total loans would have otherwise increased $59.3 million, or 0.4%, from December 31, 2019, and decreased $528.6 million, or 3.4%, from total loans of $15.3 billion at March 31, 2020. The majority of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial and industrial loans, energy loans, and real estate loans. Real estate loans include both commercial and consumer balances. Selected details related to our loan portfolio segments are presented below. Refer to our 2019 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of our loan origination and risk management processes. Other than in connection with our making PPP loans as described below, it is possible that the effects of COVID-19 could continue to result in less demand for our loan products. 

Commercial and industrial. Commercial and industrial loans decreased $183.2 million, or 3.5%, during the first six months of 2020. Our commercial and industrial loans are a diverse group of loans to small, medium and large businesses. The purpose of these loans varies from supporting seasonal working capital needs to term financing of equipment. While some short-term loans may be made on an unsecured basis, most are secured by the assets being financed with collateral margins that are consistent with our loan policy guidelines. The commercial and industrial loan portfolio also includes commercial leases and purchased shared national credits ("SNC"s). 

Energy . Energy loans include loans to entities and individuals that are engaged in various energy-related activities including (i) the development and production of oil or natural gas, (ii) providing oil and gas field servicing, (iii) providing energy-related transportation services, (iv) providing equipment to support oil and gas drilling, (v) refining petrochemicals, or (vi) trading oil, gas and related commodities. Energy loans decreased $228.0 million, or 13.8%, during the first six months of 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. The average loan size, the significance of the portfolio and the specialized nature of the energy industry requires a highly prescriptive underwriting policy. Exceptions to this policy are rarely granted. Due to the large borrowing requirements of this customer base, the energy loan portfolio includes participations and SNCs. 

Purchased Shared National Credits. Purchased shared national credits are participations purchased from upstream financial organizations and tend to be larger in size than our originated portfolio. Our purchased SNC portfolio totaled $935.5 million at June 30, 2020, decreasing $13.3 million, or 1.4%, from $948.8 million at December 31, 2019. At June 30, 2020, 40.4% of outstanding purchased SNCs were related to the energy industry while 17.7% were related to the construction industry, 10.4% were related to the real estate management industry and 10.1% were related to the financial services industry. The remaining purchased SNCs were diversified throughout various other industries, with no other single industry exceeding 10% of the total purchased SNC portfolio. Additionally, almost all of the outstanding balance of purchased SNCs was included in the energy and commercial and industrial portfolio, with the remainder included in the real estate categories. SNC participations are 

Table of Co ntents 

originated in the normal course of business to meet the needs of our customers. As a matter of policy, we generally only participate in SNCs for companies headquartered in or which have significant operations within our market areas. In addition, we must have direct access to the company&#8217;s management, an existing banking relationship or the expectation of broadening the relationship with other banking products and services within the following 12 to 24 months. SNCs are reviewed at least quarterly for credit quality and business development successes. 

Commercial Real Estate. Commercial real estate loans totaled $6.6 billion at June 30, 2020, increasing $428.7 million, or 6.9%, compared to $6.2 billion at December 31, 2019. At such dates, commercial real estate loans represented 84.1% and 83.8% of total real estate loans, respectively. The majority of this portfolio consists of commercial real estate mortgages, which includes both permanent and intermediate term loans. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Consequently, these loans must undergo the analysis and underwriting process of a commercial and industrial loan, as well as that of a real estate loan. At June 30, 2020, approximately 46% of the outstanding principal balance of our commercial real estate loans were secured by owner-occupied properties. 

Consumer Real Estate and Other Consumer Loans. The consumer loan portfolio, including all consumer real estate and consumer installment loans, totaled $1.8 billion at June 30, 2020 and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2019. Consumer real estate loans increased $55.8 million, or 4.7%, from December 31, 2019. Combined, home equity loans and lines of credit made up 59.3% and 61.1% of the consumer real estate loan total at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. We offer home equity loans up to 80% of the estimated value of the personal residence of the borrower, less the value of existing mortgages and home improvement loans. In general, we do not originate 1-4 family mortgage loans; however, from time to time, we may invest in such loans to meet the needs of our customers or for other regulatory compliance purposes. Consumer and other loans decreased $13.9 million, or 2.7%, from December 31, 2019. The consumer and other loan portfolio primarily consists of automobile loans, overdrafts, unsecured revolving credit products, personal loans secured by cash and cash equivalents and other similar types of credit facilities. 

Paycheck Protection Program . In April 2020, we began originating loans to qualified small businesses under the PPP administered by the SBA under the provisions of the CARES Act. Loans covered by the PPP may be eligible for loan forgiveness for certain costs incurred related to payroll, group health care benefit costs and qualifying mortgage, rent and utility payments. The remaining loan balance after forgiveness of any amounts is still fully guaranteed by the SBA. Terms of the PPP loans include the following (i) maximum amount limited to the lesser of $10 million or an amount calculated using a payroll-based formula, (ii) maximum loan term of five years, (iii) interest rate of 1.00%, (iv) no collateral or personal guarantees are required, (v) no payments are required until the date on which the forgiveness amount relating to the loan is remitted to the lender and (vi) loan forgiveness up to the full principal amount of the loan and any accrued interest, subject to certain requirements including that no more than 40% of the loan forgiveness amount may be attributable to non-payroll costs. In return for processing and booking the loan, the SBA will pay the lender a processing fee tiered by the size of the loan (5% for loans of not more than $350 thousand; 3% for loans of more than $350 thousand and less than $2 million; and 1% for loans of at least $2 million). 

Through June 30, 2020, we have funded approximately $3.2 billion of SBA-approved PPP loans. During the second quarter of 2020, we recognized approximately $19.3 million in PPP loan related deferred processing fees (net of amortization of related deferred origination costs) as a yield adjustment and this amount is included in interest income on loans. As a result of the inclusion of these net fees in interest income, the average yield on PPP loans was approximately 4.13% during the second quarter of 2020 compared to the stated interest rate of 1.0% on these loans. As of June 30, 2020, we expect to recognize additional PPP loan related deferred processing fees (net of deferred origination costs) totaling approximately $77.4 million as a yield adjustment over the remaining terms of these loans.

Non-performing assets include non-accrual loans, troubled debt restructurings and foreclosed assets. Non-performing assets at June 30, 2020 decreased $24.3 million from December 31, 2019 primarily due to a decrease in non-accrual energy loans, which, for the most part, was related to the recognition of charge-offs as further discussed below. 

Generally, loans are placed on non-accrual status if principal or interest payments become 90 days past due and/or management deems the collectibility of the principal and/or interest to be in question, as well as when required by regulatory requirements. Once interest accruals are discontinued, accrued but uncollected interest is charged to current year operations. Subsequent receipts on non-accrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal, and interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured. Classification of a loan as non-accrual does not preclude the ultimate collection of loan principal or interest. Non-accrual commercial and industrial loans included one credit relationship in excess of $5.0 million totaling $8.4 million at June 30, 2020. This credit relationship was previously reported as non-accrual with an aggregate balance of $8.4 million at December 31, 2019. Non-accrual energy loans included two credit relationships in excess of $5 million totaling $35.9 million at June 30, 2020 and two credit relationships in excess of $5 million totaling $61.7 million at December 31, 2019. During the six months ended June 30, 2020, we charged off $68.8 million related to energy loans. Of that amount, $48.8 million related to credit relationships previously reported as non-accrual as of December 31, 2019. Non-accrual real estate loans primarily consist of land development, 1-4 family residential construction credit relationships and loans secured by office buildings and religious facilities. There were no non-accrual commercial real estate loans in excess of $5.0 million at June 30, 2020 or December 31, 2019. 

Table of Co ntents 

Restructured loans totaled $4.9 million at June 30, 2020 and consisted of a single credit relationship including commercial and industrial loans, a commercial real estate loan and a consumer loan. Restructured loans at December 31, 2019 totaled $6.1 million and consisted of three credit relationships primarily related to commercial real estate. 

Foreclosed assets represent property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans. Foreclosed assets are recorded at estimated fair value, less estimated selling costs, at the time of foreclosure. Write-downs occurring at foreclosure are charged against the allowance for loan losses. Regulatory guidelines require us to reevaluate the fair value of foreclosed assets on at least an annual basis. Our policy is to comply with the regulatory guidelines. Write-downs are provided for subsequent declines in value and are included in other non-interest expense along with other expenses related to maintaining the properties. Write-downs of foreclosed assets totaled $231 thousand during the six months ended June 30, 2020, while there were no write-downs of foreclosed assets during the six months ended June 30, 2019. 

Accruing past due loans at June 30, 2020 increased $32.8 million compared to December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily related to increases in all loan portfolio segments with the largest increases in past due commercial and industrial loans (up $16.8 million), consumer real estate (up $5.8 million) and commercial real estate loans (up $4.2 million). 

Potential problem loans consist of loans that are performing in accordance with contractual terms but for which management has concerns about the ability of an obligor to continue to comply with repayment terms because of the obligor&#8217;s potential operating or financial difficulties. Management monitors these loans closely and reviews their performance on a regular basis. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had $105.0 million and $63.4 million in loans of this type which are not included in any one of the non-performing non-accrual, restructured or 90 days past due loan categories. At June 30, 2020, potential problem loans consisted of 12 credit relationships. Of the total outstanding balance at June 30, 2020, 54.3% was related to the energy industry, 24.2% was related to the manufacturing industry and 13.9% was related to the restaurant industry. Weakness in these organizations&#8217; operating performance and financial condition, among other factors, have caused us to heighten the attention given to these credits. 

Certain borrowers are currently unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the adverse effects of COVID-19. In an effort to mitigate these effects, loan customers may apply for a deferral of payments, or portions thereof, for up to 90 days. After 90 days, customers may apply for an additional deferral. In the absence of other intervening factors, such short-term modifications made on a good faith basis are not categorized as troubled debt restructurings, nor are loans granted payment deferrals related to COVID-19 reported as past due or placed on non-accrual status (provided the loans were not past due or on non-accrual status prior to the deferral). The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to an increased risk of delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number and amount of our loans have experienced ratings downgrades, credit deterioration and defaults. We have a significant amount of loans in certain industries that have been particularly impacted. These include energy, aviation, restaurants, hotels/lodging, entertainment, retail and commercial real estate, among others. See additional information about the effects of and risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in the section captioned &#8220;Recent Developments Related to COVID-19&#8221; elsewhere in this discussion and Part II. Other Information, Item 1A. Risk Factors elsewhere in this report. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

As discussed in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements, our policies and procedures related to accounting for credit losses changed on January 1, 2020 in connection with the adoption of a new accounting standard update as codified in Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 326 (&#8220;ASC 326&#8221;) Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. In the case of loans and securities, allowances for credit losses are contra-asset valuation accounts, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, that are deducted from the amortized cost basis of these assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. In the case of off-balance-sheet credit exposures, the allowance for credit losses is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, reported as a component of accrued interest payable and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of each allowance account represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) on these financial instruments considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. While historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions or other relevant factors. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the performance of our portfolios, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets. For additional information regarding critical accounting policies, refer to Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 - Loans in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.

Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans. The table below provides, as of the dates indicated, an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan portfolio segment; however, allocation of a portion of the allowance to one segment does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other segments: 

June 30, 2020 March 31, 2020 Post ASC 326 Adoption on January 1, 2020 December 31, 2019 Commercial and industrial $ 98,536 &#160; $ 92,152 &#160; $ 72,856 &#160; $ 51,593 &#160; Energy 40,817 &#160; 103,201 &#160; 26,929 &#160; 37,382 &#160; Commercial real estate 93,425 &#160; 52,319 &#160; 17,518 &#160; 31,037 &#160; Consumer real estate 8,998 &#160; 8,170 &#160; 6,505 &#160; 4,113 &#160; Consumer and other 8,285 &#160; 8,039 &#160; 5,794 &#160; 8,042 &#160; Total $ 250,061 &#160; $ 263,881 &#160; $ 129,602 &#160; $ 132,167 &#160; 

Upon the adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2020, the total amount of the allowance for credit losses on loans estimated using the CECL methodology decreased $2.6 million compared to the total amount of the allowance for credit losses on loans estimated as of December 31, 2019 using the prior incurred loss model. Fluctuations in the estimated allowances by portfolio segment offset one another, for the most part, and, as a result, the overall estimated amount of allowance for credit losses did not significantly change as a result of the change in methodology. The manner in which credit loss allowances are allocated to the individual portfolio segments was partly impacted by a change in the way the underlying loans within each segment are pooled for modeling purposes. The impact of varying economic conditions and portfolio stress factors are now a component of the credit loss models applied to each modeling pool. In that regard, the amounts allocated to the underlying pools of loans within each portfolio segment more directly reflect the economic variables and portfolio stress factors that correlate with credit losses within each portfolio. Under the prior methodology, allocations in excess of those derived from historical loss rates were recognized as an overlay on each of the various portfolios based upon management judgment. Nonetheless, despite fluctuations in the allocation of portions of the overall allowance to the various portfolio segments, the entire allowance is available to absorb any credit losses within the entire loan portfolio. The remainder of this discussion focuses on expected credit losses estimated as of June 30, 2020 compared to the post ASC 326 estimate of expected credit losses as of January 1, 2020 and, in some cases, March 31, 2020. 

The allowance allocated to commercial and industrial loans totaled $98.5 million, or 1.97% of total commercial and industrial loans, at June 30, 2020 increasing $25.7 million, or 35.2%, compared to $72.9 million, or 1.40% of total commercial and industrial loans, post ASC 326 adoption on January 1, 2020. Modeled expected credit losses increased $28.8 million while Q-Factor adjustments related to commercial and industrial loans decreased $7.3 million. Specific allocations for commercial and industrial loans that were evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis increased from $7.9 million post ASC 326 adoption on January 1, 2020 to $12.1 million at June 30, 2020. The allowance allocated to energy loans totaled $40.8 million, or 2.86% of total energy loans, at June 30, 2020 increasing $13.9 million, or 51.6%, compared to $26.9 million, or 1.63% of total energy loans, post ASC 326 adoption on January 1, 2020. Modeled expected credit losses related to energy loans increased $12.1 million while Q-Factor adjustments related to energy loans increased $19.8 million. Specific allocations for energy loans that were evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis totaled $20.2 million post ASC 326 adoption on January 1, 2020. The loans to which these specific allocations were related were subsequently charged off and there were $2.3 million of specific allocations related to energy loans at June 30, 2020. The allowance allocated to commercial real estate loans totaled $93.4 million, or 1.41% of total commercial real estate loans, at June 30, 2020 increasing $75.9 million, or 433.3%, compared to $17.5 million, or 0.28% of total commercial real estate loans, post ASC 326 adoption on January 1, 2020. Modeled expected credit losses related to commercial real estate loans increased $106.6 million while Q-Factor adjustments related to commercial real estate loans decreased $31.7 million. Specific allocations for commercial real estate loans that were evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis increased from $383 thousand post ASC 326 adoption on January 1, 2020 to $1.3 million at June 30, 2020. The allowance allocated to consumer real estate loans totaled $9.0 million, or 0.72% of total consumer real estate loans, at June 30, 2020 increasing $2.5 million, or 38.3%, compared to $6.5 million, or 0.54% of total consumer real estate loans, post ASC 326 adoption on January 1, 2020. Modeled expected credit losses related to consumer real estate loans increased $3.0 million while Q-Factor adjustments related to consumer real estate loans decreased $458 thousand. The allowance allocated to consumer loans totaled $8.3 million, or 1.64% of total consumer loans, at June 30, 2020 increasing $2.5 million, or 43.0%, compared to $5.8 million, or 1.12% of total consumer loans, post ASC 326 adoption on January 1, 2020. Modeled expected credit losses related to consumer loans increased $2.6 million while Q-Factor adjustments related to consumer loans decreased $111 thousand. 

As more fully described in Note 3 - Loans in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we measure expected credit losses over the life of each loan utilizing a combination of models which measure probability of default and loss given default, among other things. The measurement of expected credit losses is impacted by loan/borrower attributes and certain 

Table of Co ntents 

macroeconomic variables. Models are adjusted to reflect current impact of certain macroeconomic variables as well as their expected changes over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. 

In estimating expected credit losses as of June 30, 2020, we utilized the Moody&#8217;s Analytics June 2020 CF Consensus Scenario (the &#8220;CF Scenario&#8221;) to forecast the macroeconomic variables used in our models. The CF Scenario is based on the review of a variety of surveys of baseline forecasts of the U.S. economy. The CF Scenario projections include, among other things, (i) a 36.9% decline in the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (&#8220;GDP&#8221;) in the second quarter of 2020 followed by a 23.5% rebound in the third quarter of 2020; (ii) a U.S. unemployment rate of 15.8% for in the second quarter of 2020 improving to 9.6% by the fourth quarter of 2020 and 6.5% by the end of the forecast period in the second quarter of 2022 with Texas unemployment rates slightly less at those dates; and (iii) an average 10 year Treasury rate of 0.67% in the second quarter of 2020, dropping to a low of 0.34% in the second quarter of 2021 and increasing to 0.91% by the end of the forecast period in the second quarter of 2022. The CF Scenario also projects average oil prices of $26 per barrel in the second quarter of 2020, $32 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2020, $42 per barrel on average for the year in 2021 and $50 in the second quarter of 2022. For our March 31, 2020 estimate of expected credit losses, our outlook for oil prices was significantly more negative as a result of the assumed persistence of the oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia and increasing oil supplies in the face of decreasing global demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we used significant qualitative adjustments in the determination of the allowance for credit losses on energy loans. Though less as of June 30, 2020, we continue to make qualitative adjustments related to the impact of oil price volatility in the determination of the allowance for credit losses on energy loans, as further discussed below. 

In estimating expected credit losses as of March 31, 2020, we utilized the Moody&#8217;s Analytics March 2020 S8 Low Oil Price Scenario (the &#8220;S8 Scenario&#8221;) to forecast the macroeconomic variables used in our models. The S8 scenario used the Moody&#8217;s Baseline forecast, updated during the week of March 16, 2020, adjusted to assume that the price per barrel of West Texas Intermediate (&#8220;WTI&#8221;) crude oil will remain at $35 flat for two years. The S8 Scenario also assumed the persistence of the oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia and increasing oil supplies in the face of decreasing global demand. At that time, the S8 Scenario forecasted declines in the U.S. Gross Domestic Product and the Texas Gross State Product in the second quarter of 2020, a flat U.S. unemployment rate for the remainder of 2020 and the 10-yr Treasury rate dropping to 0.49% in second quarter of 2020 and remaining below 1.0% until the second quarter of 2021. The low oil prices incorporated in the S8 Scenario also resulted in a forecasted gradual increase in the Texas unemployment rate, from 3.6% in the first quarter of 2020 to 6.2% by the first quarter of 2022, exceeding the forecasted U.S. unemployment rate of 4.1% for the first quarter of 2022 and reflecting the impact of oil prices on the overall Texas economy. In late March and early April 2020, Moody's updated various macroeconomic variables in Moody's Baseline forecast subsequent to our modeling processes in order to incorporate the expected economic impact of recent developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the level of economic disruption and uncertainty within the State of Texas and the nation as a whole, arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and volatility and declines in oil and gas prices driven by decreased demand and increased supply, we qualitatively adjusted the model results for these and other risk factors that are not considered within our modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools as further discussed below. 

The economic forecast used in our initial estimate of expected credit losses under ASC 326 on January 1, 2020 projected that the Texas unemployment rate would remain below 4.0% through 2021. The increases in modeled expected credit losses across all of our loan portfolios as of June 30, 2020 compared to the modeled expected credit losses as of our initial adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2020 were primarily the result of changes in our economic forecast, particularly forecasts related to unemployment and the gross domestic product, as well as changes in portfolio volumes and risk attributes, as discussed below. 

The overall loan portfolio, excluding PPP loans which are fully guaranteed by the SBA, increased $59.3 million, or 0.4%, which included a $428.7 million, or 6.9%, increase in commercial real estate loans and a $55.8 million, or 4.7%, increase in consumer real estate loans mostly offset by a $183.2 million, or 3.5%, decrease in commercial and industrial loans, a $228.0 million, or 13.8%, decrease in energy loans and a $13.9 million, or 2.7% decrease in consumer and other loans. The weighted average risk grade for commercial and industrial loans did not significantly change totaling 6.45 at June 30, 2020 compared to 6.44 at December 31, 2019. Commercial and industrial loans graded &#8220;watch&#8221; and &#8220;special mention&#8221; (risk grades 9 and 10) increased $51.9 million during the first six months of 2020 while classified commercial and industrial loans increased $14.9 million. Classified loans consist of loans having a risk grade of 11, 12 or 13. The weighted-average risk grade for energy loans increased to 7.24 at June 30, 2020 from 6.39 at December 31, 2019. The increase in the weighted average risk grade was primarily related to a $49.2 million increase in classified energy loans and a $204.6 million increase in energy loans graded &#8220;watch&#8221; and &#8220;special mention,&#8221; while pass grade energy loans decreased $481.9 million. The weighted average risk grade for commercial real estate loans increased to 7.30 at June 30, 2020 from 7.07 at December 31, 2019. Commercial real estate loans graded as &#8220;watch&#8221; and &#8220;special mention&#8221; increased $342.8 million while classified commercial real estate loans increased $18.3 million.

As noted above our credit loss models utilized the economic forecasts in the Moody&#8217;s CF Consensus Scenario for June 2020 in the second quarter of 2020 and the Moody's S8 Low Oil Scenario for March 2020 in the first quarter of 2020. We qualitatively adjust the model results based on this scenario for various risk factors that are not considered within our modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools. These Q-Factor adjustments are discussed below. 

Q-Factor adjustments are based upon management judgment and current assessment as to the impact of risks related to changes in lending policies and procedures; economic and business conditions; loan portfolio attributes and credit concentrations; and external factors, among other things, that are not already captured within the modeling inputs, assumptions and other processes. Management assesses the potential impact of such items within a range of severely negative impact to positive impact and adjusts the modeled expected credit loss by an aggregate adjustment percentage based upon the assessment. As a result of this assessment as of June 30, 2020, modeled expected credit losses were adjusted upwards by a weighted-average Q-Factor adjustment of approximately 0.7%. This weighted-average Q-Factor adjustment was based on a positive expected impact related to changes in lending policies, procedures and underwriting standards; a limited negative expected impact associated with changes in loan portfolio attributes and concentrations, changes in risk grades, changes in the volumes and severity of loan delinquencies and adverse classifications and potential deterioration of collateral values; and a severely negative impact from other risk factors associated with our commercial real estate construction and land portfolios, particularly the risks related to expected extensions. 

In connection with our assessment of Q-Factor adjustments for our initial estimate of expected credit losses upon the adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2020, modeled expected credit losses were adjusted upwards by a weighted-average Q-Factor adjustment of approximately 12.9%, which included a 10% upward adjustment to modeled expected credit losses related to risks associated with model uncertainty and under-prediction. This adjustment was based upon the results of certain back testing procedures performed on our credit loss models. The Q-Factor adjustment as of June 30, 2020 did not include this additional 10% upward adjustment related to risks associated with model uncertainty and under-prediction. While management believes this adjustment is appropriate in a relatively benign or moderately stressful economic environment, management nonetheless believes this adjustment is not currently appropriate given the extreme levels and volatility in macroeconomic indicators under the current economic conditions and the fact that such conditions are expected to persist for the foreseeable future. The weighted-average Q-Factor adjustment totaled approximately 17.9% as of March 31, 2020 and included the 10% adjustment related to risks associated with model uncertainty and under-prediction. The decrease in the Q-Factor adjustment since March 31, 2020 reflects the fact that much of these expected credit losses are now captured in our credit loss models as a result of updates in policies and procedures related to managing the effects of COVID-19 on our loan customers, risk-grade migrations and updated macroeconomic forecasts. 

Management also made certain other qualitative adjustments for loans within certain industries that are expected to be more significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and oil price volatility and declines as described below. 

In early March 2020, Saudi Arabia announced significant price discounts on oil which resulted in a sharp decrease in global oil prices including the benchmark WTI. Saudi Arabia further announced that it would significantly increase its production leading Russia to respond in kind. These actions arose in the face of increasing global supplies and decreasing global demand. The subsequent worsening global economic outlook and decreased demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in further decreases in energy prices. The WTI price per barrel of crude oil was approximately $39 as of June 30, 2020 up from $20 per barrel as of March 31, 2020 but still down from approximately $61 per barrel as of December 31, 2019. In late March 2020, we established a special Energy Oversight Council to oversee and assess the credit quality of our energy loan portfolio. 

As of June 30, 2020, we provided an additional $20.5 million of qualitative adjustments for our energy loan portfolio. This amount is down from $85.0 million as of March 31, 2020. In assessing the energy portfolio for the additional qualitative adjustments during the second quarter, we updated our borrowing base determinations for nearly all of our energy production loans using current engineering valuations and an oil price deck of $30 in 2020. Through this process, we estimated an aggregate borrowing base deficiency on energy production loans totaling approximately $36 million at June 30, 2020 compared to an aggregate borrowing base deficiency of approximately $106 million at March 31, 2020. The March 31, 2020 estimated aggregate borrowing base deficiency was based on a stress testing exercise using an oil price deck of $9 for 2020 and included an analysis of our customers' secondary sources of capital. Management believes that the aggregate borrowing base deficiency amount should serve as the appropriate level of expected credit losses for energy production loans. Accordingly, we provided an additional qualitative adjustment of $15.5 million at June 30, 2020 for energy production loans. This amount is down from $84.0 million at March 31, 2020 in part due to the rebound in oil prices and the recognition of $35.0 million of charge-offs related to three large energy production credit relationships during the second quarter of 2020.

We performed a separate assessment of other energy loans which are primarily made up of borrowers associated with oilfield services such as transportation and logistics; equipment manufacturing and other services, among other things. Business activity among oilfield service firms has experienced significant contraction since March 2020 and there are indications of further worsening of conditions due to significant declines in equipment utilization and operating margins. Furthermore, there has been a significant decrease in the number of active oil rigs in Texas since March 2020, while the aforementioned rebound in oil prices during the second quarter has not had any apparent impact on stemming the decline. As a result, we expect that the revenues and operating margins of our oilfield services customers will be significantly impacted. Accordingly, we provided an additional qualitative adjustment of $5.0 million for our other, non-production energy loans portfolio at June 30, 2020. This amount is up from $1.0 million at March 31, 2020. 

In late June 2020, we established a special Commercial Real Estate Oversight Council to oversee and assess the credit quality of our non-owner occupied and construction commercial real estate portfolios. Due to the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, management believes these portfolios have an elevated level of risk that requires a higher level of oversight, particularly as it relates to monitoring risk grades, payment deferrals, covenant modifications and structuring issues, among other things. 

In estimating current expected credit losses as of June 30, 2020, we determined that our credit loss models for our owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio were overly sensitive to the volatility of the forecasted Texas unemployment rate and the forecasted U.S. GDP. The modeled loss rate for this portfolio was nearly 170% higher than the modeled loss rate for our commercial and industrial loan portfolio. Management believes that the loss rates for our owner occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio and our commercial and industrial loan portfolio should be similar due to the fact that that the loans within both portfolios are underwritten with the assumption that the primary repayment source is the cash flow from the operations of the borrower. This differs from non-owner occupied real estate where the primary repayment source is the cash flow generated by the underlying real estate being financed. Furthermore, our owner occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio and our commercial and industrial loan portfolio have a similar customer base. The loans within our owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio generally have a longer term than the loans within our commercial and industrial loan portfolio, which increases the modeled loss rate of the portfolio, despite the fact that this portfolio generally experiences lower losses in the case of default due to higher collateral valuations relative to the amount of the underlying loans. In light of the foregoing, management reduced the modeled loss allocation for owner occupied commercial real estate by $53.1 million as of June 30, 2020. Of this amount, $8.6 million was reallocated to the non-owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio and $2.8 million was reallocated to the commercial real estate construction portfolio. Additional qualitative adjustments were made for these portfolios as we believe our borrowers' ability to access the capital markets for the sale or refinancing of assets, including those under construction, may be impaired for a significant amount of time. This would require secondary sources of capital and liquidity to support completed projects, access to which may take considerably longer to stabilize than was expected at the time the loans to these borrowers were originally underwritten. Additionally, management reallocated an additional $10.9 million for specific industries within the commercial real estate portfolio that have been particularly impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as further discussed below. The net effect of these additional qualitative adjustments, when combined with the aforementioned 0.7% Q-Factor adjustment, was an overall negative qualitative adjustment to the allowance for credit losses on commercial real estate loans totaling $29.9 million. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant decrease in commercial activity throughout the State of Texas as well as nationally. Efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 have led to the closure of non-essential businesses, travel restrictions, supply chain disruptions and prohibitions on public gatherings, among other things, throughout many parts of the United States and, in particular, the markets in which we operate. Aside from the energy industry, which is discussed above, we lend to customers operating in certain other industries that have been, and are expected to be, more significantly impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. These industries are presented in the following table and include amounts reported as both commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans while PPP loans are excluded.

We are continuing to monitor customers in these industries closely. In assessing these portfolios for an additional qualitative adjustment as of June 30, 2020, we performed a comprehensive review of the financial condition and overall outlook of the borrowers within these portfolios. Based on this analysis, we determined that there continues to be an elevated level of risk due to state and nationwide restrictions impacting each of these industries. As a result, we provided an additional qualitative adjustment of $10.9 million, all of which was allocated to commercial real estate loans. This amount is up from $8.8 million at March 31, 2020, of which $7.8 million was allocated to commercial real estate loans and $1.0 million was allocated to commercial and industrial loans. 

Activity in the allowance for credit losses on loans is presented in the following table.

Credit loss expense related to loans increased $182.8 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Credit loss expense related to loans during the six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily reflects the increase in expected credit losses resulting from a deterioration in forecasted economic conditions and the current and uncertain future impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and recent volatility in oil prices. Credit loss expense also reflects the level of net charge-offs, the deterioration of credit quality and other changes within the loan portfolio during the first quarter of 2020. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses on loans to total loans was 1.39% (1.69% excluding PPP loans) at June 30, 2020 compared to 0.90% at December 31, 2019. Management believes the recorded amount of the allowance for credit losses on loans is appropriate based upon management&#8217;s best estimate of current expected credit losses within the existing portfolio of loans. Should any of the factors considered by management in making this estimate change, our estimate of current expect credit losses could also change, which could affect the level of future credit loss expense related to loans. 

Allowance for Credit Losses - Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures. Upon the adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2020, the total amount of the allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures estimated using the CECL methodology increased $39.4 million compared to the total amount of the allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures estimated as of December 31, 2019 using the prior incurred loss model. The increase reflects the impact of assuming portions of all of these commitments will fund in the future and applying our credit loss modeling processes to such amounts as if such amounts were funded loans. Previously, we only recognized a liability for estimated incurred credit losses on off-balance-sheet 

Table of Co ntents 

credit exposures when the borrowers to which such commitments were extended exceeded certain risk grades and had not violated any underlying covenants that would relieve us of any obligation to fund additional amounts under the commitment. Subsequent to the adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2020, we recognized credit loss expense related to off-balance-sheet credit exposures totaling $7.1 million during the first six months of 2020 to increase the amount of the related allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures to $46.9 million as of June 30, 2020. The increase primarily reflects changes in underlying risk grades and expected utilization of available funds, an increase in overall off-balance-sheet credit exposures and a deterioration in forecasted economic conditions and the current and uncertain future impacts associated with COVID-19. Further information regarding our policies and methodology used to estimate the allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures is presented in Note 6 - Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements, Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements. 

Capital and Liquidity 

Capital . Shareholders&#8217; equity totaled $4.0 billion at June 30, 2020 and $3.9 billion December 31, 2019. In addition to net income of $147.8 million, other sources of capital during the six months ended June 30, 2020 included other comprehensive income, net of tax, of $220.9 million; $5.8 million related to stock-based compensation and $4.8 million in proceeds from stock option exercises. Additionally, we issued $2.8 million of common stock held in treasury to our 401(k) plan. During the second quarter of 2020, we began to issue shares of our common stock directly to our 401(k) plan in connection with matching contributions. Previously, we contributed the matching contributions in cash which were then utilized to purchase shares of our common stock on the open market. Uses of capital during the six months ended June 30, 2020 included a $150.0 million redemption of preferred stock, $91.8 million of dividends paid on preferred and common stock, $29.3 million related to the cumulative effect of adopting a new accounting principle and $14.0 million of treasury stock purchases. See Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies. 

The accumulated other comprehensive income/loss component of shareholders&#8217; equity totaled a net, after-tax, unrealized gain of $488.3 million at June 30, 2020 compared to $267.4 million at December 31, 2019. The change was primarily due to a $219.3 million net, after-tax, increase in the net unrealized gain on securities available for sale. 

Under the Basel III Capital Rules, we have elected to opt-out of the requirement to include most components of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital. Accordingly, amounts reported as accumulated other comprehensive income/loss do not increase or reduce regulatory capital and are not included in the calculation of our regulatory capital ratios. In connection with the adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2020, we also elected to exclude, for a transitional period, the effects of credit loss accounting under CECL in the calculation of our regulatory capital and regulatory capital ratios. Regulatory agencies for banks and bank holding companies utilize capital guidelines designed to measure capital and take into consideration the risk inherent in both on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet items. See Note 7 - Capital and Regulatory Matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 

We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.71 per common share during the first and second quarters of both 2020 and 2019. This equates to a common stock dividend payout ratio of 64.0% and 39.0% during the first six months of 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our ability to declare or pay dividends on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our capital stock may be impacted by certain restrictions described in Note 7 - Capital and Regulatory Matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 

Preferred Stock. On March 16, 2020, we redeemed all 6,000,000 shares of our 5.375% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, (&#8220;Series A Preferred Stock&#8221;) at a redemption price of $25 per share, or an aggregate redemption of $150.0 million. When issued, the net proceeds of the Series A Preferred Stock totaled $144.5 million after deducting $5.5 million of issuance costs including the underwriting discount and professional service fees, among other things. Upon redemption, these issuance costs were reclassified to retained earnings and reported as a reduction of net income available to common shareholders. 

Stock Repurchase Plans. From time to time, our board of directors has authorized stock repurchase plans. In general, stock repurchase plans allow us to proactively manage our capital position and return excess capital to shareholders. Shares purchased under such plans also provide us with shares of common stock necessary to satisfy obligations related to stock compensation awards. On July 24, 2019, our board of directors authorized a $100.0 million stock repurchase program, allowing us to repurchase shares of our common stock over a one-year period from time to time at various prices in the open market or through private transactions. We repurchased 177,834 shares at a total cost of $13.7 million during the first quarter of 2020 and 202,724 shares at a total cost of $17.2 million during the third quarter of 2019. No further repurchases were made under this plan prior to its expiration on July 24, 2020. See Note 7 - Capital and Regulatory Matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements and Part II, Item 2 - Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds, each included elsewhere in this report.

Liquidity . As more fully discussed in our 2019 Form 10-K, our liquidity position is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate. Liquidity risk management is an important element in our asset/liability management process. We regularly model liquidity stress scenarios to assess potential liquidity outflows or funding problems resulting from economic disruptions, volatility in the financial markets, unexpected credit events or other significant occurrences deemed problematic by management. These scenarios are incorporated into our contingency funding plan, which provides the basis for the identification of our liquidity needs. Our principal source of funding has been our customer deposits, supplemented by our short-term and long-term borrowings as well as maturities of securities and loan amortization. As of June 30, 2020, we had approximately $5.0 billion held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve. We also have the ability to borrow funds as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;). As of June 30, 2020, based upon available, pledgeable collateral, our total borrowing capacity with the FHLB was approximately $2.7 billion. Furthermore, at June 30, 2020, we had approximately $8.8 billion in securities that were unencumbered by a pledge and could be used to support additional borrowings through repurchase agreements or the Federal Reserve discount window, as needed. 

Since Cullen/Frost is a holding company and does not conduct operations, its primary sources of liquidity are dividends upstreamed from Frost Bank and borrowings from outside sources. Banking regulations may limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by Frost Bank. See Note 7 - Capital and Regulatory Matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report regarding such dividends. At June 30, 2020, Cullen/Frost had liquid assets, including cash and resell agreements, totaling $184.8 million.
