&#8226; Our success at managing the risks involved in the foregoing items. 

In addition, financial markets and global supply chains may continue to be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including the current Russian invasion of Ukraine, terrorism or other geopolitical events. 

Further, statements about the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations may constitute forward-looking statements and are subject to the risk that the actual effects may differ, possibly materially, from what is reflected in those forward-looking statements due to factors and future developments that are uncertain, unpredictable and in many cases beyond our control, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic, and the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our customers, clients, third parties and us. 

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made. We do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 

COVID-19 Effects and Actions 

Our business has been, and continues to be, impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. There remains many uncertainties related to COVID-19 including, among other things, the ongoing impact to our customers, employees and vendors; the impact to the financial services and banking industry; and the impact to the economy as a whole as well as the effect of actions taken, or that may yet be taken, or inaction by governmental authorities to mitigate both the economic and health-related effects of COVID-19. Refer to our 2021 Form 10-K for further information regarding (i) the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and our results thereof, as well as the impact on our financial position and (ii) legislative and regulatory actions taken related to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly as they relate to the banking and financial services industry. 

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Accounting Estimates 

We follow accounting and reporting policies that conform, in all material respects, to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and to general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. While we base estimates on historical experience, current information and other factors deemed to be relevant, actual results could differ from those estimates. 

We consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if (i) the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and (ii) different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial statements. 

Accounting policies related to the allowance for credit losses on financial instruments including loans and off-balance-sheet credit exposures are considered to be critical as these policies involve considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management. In the case of loans, the allowance for credit losses is a contra-asset valuation account, calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 326 (&#8220;ASC 326&#8221;) Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected. In the case of off-balance-sheet credit exposures, the allowance for credit losses is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, reported as a component of accrued interest payable and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of each allowance account represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses on these financial instruments considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term 

of the instrument. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. While historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions or other relevant factors. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the performance of our portfolios, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets. Refer to the 2021 Form 10-K for additional information regarding critical accounting policies. 

Overview 

A discussion of our results of operations is presented below. Certain reclassifications have been made to make prior periods comparable. Taxable-equivalent adjustments are the result of increasing income from tax-free loans and investments by an amount equal to the taxes that would be paid if the income were fully taxable based on a 21% federal tax rate, thus making tax-exempt yields comparable to taxable asset yields. 

Results of Operations 

Net income available to common shareholders totaled $168.1 million, or $2.59 per diluted common share, and $383.0 million, or $5.90 per diluted common share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $106.3 million, or $1.65 per diluted common share, and $336.6 million, or $5.22 per diluted common share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. 

Selected data for the comparable periods was as follows: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Taxable-equivalent net interest income $ 379,518 $ 269,321 $ 963,089 $ 813,266 Taxable-equivalent adjustment 23,971 23,199 70,263 69,107 Net interest income 355,547 246,122 892,826 744,159 Credit loss expense &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 63 Net interest income after credit loss expense 355,547 246,122 892,826 744,096 Non-interest income 99,821 93,189 299,138 277,672 Non-interest expense 257,898 218,003 742,977 643,399 Income before income taxes 197,470 121,308 448,987 378,369 Income taxes 27,710 13,333 61,011 36,311 Net income 169,760 107,975 387,976 342,058 Preferred stock dividends 1,668 1,668 5,006 5,488 Net income available to common shareholders $ 168,092 $ 106,307 $ 382,970 $ 336,570 Earnings per common share &#8211; basic $ 2.60 $ 1.66 $ 5.92 $ 5.25 Earnings per common share &#8211; diluted 2.59 1.65 5.90 5.22 Dividends per common share 0.87 0.75 2.37 2.19 Return on average assets 1.27 % 0.90 % 1.00 % 1.00 % Return on average common equity 20.13 9.87 14.19 10.72 Average shareholders&#8217; equity to average assets 6.60 9.44 7.32 9.65 

Net income available to common shareholders increased $61.8 million, or 58.1%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and increased $46.4 million, or 13.8%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. The increase during the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily the result of a $109.4 million increase in net interest income and a $6.6 million increase in non-interest income partly offset by a $39.9 million increase in non-interest expense and a $14.4 million increase in income tax expense. The increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily the result of a $148.7 million increase in net interest income and a $21.5 million increase in non-interest income partly offset by a $99.6 million increase in non-interest expense and a $24.7 million increase in income tax expense. Details of the changes in the various components of net income are further discussed below. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, which are used to fund those assets. Net interest income is our largest source of revenue, representing 74.9% of total revenue during the first nine months of 2022. Net interest margin is the ratio of taxable-equivalent net interest income to average earning assets for the period. The level of interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities impact net interest income and net interest margin. 

The Federal Reserve influences the general market rates of interest, including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions. As of September 30, 2022, approximately 42.2% of our loans had a fixed interest rate, while the remaining loans had floating interest rates that were primarily tied to the prime interest rate (approximately 28.4%) or the London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) (approximately 13.7%). We discontinued originating LIBOR-based loans effective December 31, 2021 and have begun to negotiate loans using our preferred replacement index, the American Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;AMERIBOR&#8221;), a benchmark developed by the American Financial Exchange, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) or a benchmark developed by Bloomberg Index Services (&#8220;BSBY&#8221;). As of September 30, 2022, approximately 15.7% of loans were tied to one of these indexes. For our currently outstanding LIBOR-based loans, the timing and manner in which each customer&#8217;s contract transitions from LIBOR to another rate will vary on a case-by-case basis. Our goal is to complete all transitions by the first quarter of 2023.

In September 2022, the Federal Reserve released projections whereby the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate would rise to 4.4% by the end of 2022 and to 4.6% by the end of 2023. While there can be no such assurance that any increases in the federal funds rate will occur, these projections imply up to a 125 basis point increase in the federal funds rate during the remainder of 2022, followed by an additional 25 basis point increase in 2023. 

We are primarily funded by core deposits, with non-interest-bearing demand deposits historically being a significant source of funds. This lower-cost funding base is expected to have a positive impact on our net interest income and net interest margin in a rising interest rate environment. See Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk elsewhere in this report for information about our sensitivity to interest rates. Further analysis of the components of our net interest margin is presented below. 

The following tables present an analysis of net interest income and net interest spread for the periods indicated, including average outstanding balances for each major category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the interest earned or paid on such amounts, and the average rate earned or paid on such assets or liabilities, respectively. The tables also set forth the net interest margin on average total interest-earning assets for the same periods. For these computations: (i) average balances are presented on a daily average basis, (ii) information is shown on a taxable-equivalent basis assuming a 21% tax rate, (iii) average loans include loans on non-accrual status, and (iv) average securities include unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale, while yields are based on average amortized cost.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2022 increased $110.2 million, or 40.9%, while taxable-equivalent net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased $149.8 million, or 18.4%, compared to the same periods in 2021. The increase in taxable-equivalent net interest income during the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily related to an increase in the average yield on interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve); an increase in the average volume of taxable securities; increases in the average yield on and, to a lesser extent, the average volume of loans; and increases in the average volume of and the average taxable-equivalent yield on tax-exempt securities. The impact of these items was partly offset by increases in the average cost 

of interest-bearing deposit accounts (primarily money market deposit accounts) and an increase in the average cost of repurchase agreements, among other things. 

The increase in taxable-equivalent net interest income during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily related to an increase in the average volume of taxable securities; an increase in the average yield on interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve); an increase in the average yield on loans; and an increase in the average volume of tax-exempt securities. The impact of these items was partly offset by increases in the average cost and the average volume of interest-bearing deposit accounts (primarily money market deposit accounts), an increase in the average cost of repurchase agreements and a decrease in the average volume of loans. 

As a result of the aforementioned fluctuations, the taxable-equivalent net interest margin increased 54 basis points from 2.47% during the three months ended September 30, 2021 to 3.01% during the three months ended September 30, 2022 while the taxable-equivalent net interest margin increased 3 basis points from 2.61% during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to 2.64% during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. 

The average volume of interest-earning assets for the three months ended September 30, 2022 increased $5.1 billion while the average volume of interest-earning assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased $5.9 billion compared to the same periods in 2021. The increase in the average volume of interest-earning assets during the three months ended September 30, 2022 primarily related to a $7.3 billion increase in average taxable securities and a $633.6 million increase in average loans (which was impacted by a $1.3 billion decrease in average PPP loans, as further discussed below), partly offset by a $2.5 billion decrease in average interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) and a $439.6 million decrease in average tax-exempt securities. The increase in the average volume of interest-earning assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily related to a $6.2 billion increase in average taxable securities and a $341.1 million increase in average interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) partly offset by a $404.8 million decrease in average loans (which was primarily impacted by a $2.1 billion decrease in average PPP loans, as further discussed below) and a $276.9 million decrease in average tax-exempt securities. 

The average taxable-equivalent yield on interest-earning assets increased 90 basis points from 2.53% during the three months ended September 30, 2021 to 3.43% during the three months ended September 30, 2022 while the average taxable-equivalent yield on interest-earning assets increased 19 basis points from 2.67% during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to 2.86% during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The average taxable-equivalent yield on interest-earning assets during 2022 was impacted by the aforementioned changes in market interest rates and changes in the volume and relative mix of interest-earning assets. 

The average taxable-equivalent yield on loans increased 73 basis points from 4.16% during the three months ended September 30, 2021 to 4.89% during the three months ended September 30, 2022 while the average taxable-equivalent yield on loans increased 13 basis points from 4.10% during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to 4.23% during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The average taxable-equivalent yields on loans during three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were positively impacted by recent increases in market interest rates. The average taxable-equivalent yield on loans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 was positively impacted by a higher average proportion of higher-yielding PPP loans to total loans compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. The average volume of loans for the three months ended September 30, 2022 increased $633.6 million, or 3.9%, while the average volume of loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 decreased $404.8 million, or 2.4%, compared to the same periods in 2021. The average volumes of loans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were impacted by decreases in the average volumes of PPP loans. Excluding PPP loans, average loans would have increased $1.9 billion, or 13.0%, and $1.7 billion, or 11.5%, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. Loans made up approximately 34.3% and 34.6% of average interest-earning assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to 36.8% and 40.3% during the same respective periods in 2021. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recognized approximately $2.6 million in PPP loan related deferred processing fees (net of amortization of related deferred origination costs) as a yield adjustment and this amount is included in interest income on loans. Such amounts were not significant during the three months ended September 30, 2022. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, we recognized approximately $26.5 million and $88.9 million, respectively, in PPP loan related deferred processing fees (net of amortization of related deferred origination costs). As a result of the inclusion of these net fees in interest income, the average yields on PPP loans was 1.00% and 3.00% during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, and 8.72% and 6.23% during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to the stated interest rate of 1.0% on these loans. 

The average taxable-equivalent yield on securities was 2.94% and 2.90% during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, decreasing 41 basis points from 3.35% during the three months ended September 30, 2021 and decreasing 47 basis points from 3.37% during the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The average yield on taxable securities was 2.20% during the three months ended September 30, 2022 increasing 17 basis points from 2.03% during the same period in 2021 while the average yield on taxable securities was 2.06% during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 increasing 3 basis points from 2.03% during the same period in 2021. The average taxable-equivalent yield on tax-exempt securities was 4.09% during the three months ended September 30, 2022 increasing 5 basis points from 4.04% during the same period in 2021 while the average taxable-equivalent yield on tax-exempt securities was 4.05% during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, decreasing 2 basis points from 4.07% during the same period in 2021. 

Tax exempt securities made up approximately 40.8% and 43.6% of total average securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to 66.8% and 66.7% during the same periods in 2021. The average volume of total securities during the three months ended September 30, 2022 increased $6.9 billion, or 55.2%, compared to the same period in 2021 while the average volume of total securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased $5.9 billion, or 47.7%, compared to the same period in 2021. Securities made up approximately 39.5% of average interest-earning assets during the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to 28.4% during the same period in 2021 while securities made up approximately 37.9% of average interest-earning assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to 29.2% during the same period in 2021. The increases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily related to the investment of available funds (primarily from growth in customer deposits and reinvestment of amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) into taxable securities. 

Average interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) for the three months ended September 30, 2022 decreased $2.5 billion, or 16.4%, compared to the same period in 2021 while average interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased $341.1 million, or 2.7%, compared to the same period in 2021. Interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) made up approximately 26.1% of average interest-earning assets during the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to 34.7% during the same period in 2021 while interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) made up approximately 27.4% of average interest-earning assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to 30.4% during the same period of 2021. The decreases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily related to the reinvestment of amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve into taxable securities. The average yield on interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) was 2.27% and 1.07% during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to 0.15% and 0.12% during the same respective periods in 2021. The average yields on interest-bearing deposits during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were impacted by higher interest rates paid on reserves held at the Federal Reserve, compared to the same respective periods in 2021. 

The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 0.71% during the three months ended September 30, 2022, increasing 61 basis points from 0.10% during the same period in 2021 while the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 0.37% during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 increasing 27 basis points from 0.10% during the same period in 2021. Average deposits increased $6.7 billion, or 17.1%, during the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 and included a $5.2 billion increase in average interest-bearing deposits and a $1.5 billion increase in average non-interest bearing deposits. Average deposits increased $6.9 billion, or 18.3%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 and included a $4.9 billion increase in average interest-bearing deposits and a $2.0 billion increase in average non-interest bearing deposits. The ratio of average interest-bearing deposits to total average deposits was 59.6% and 58.9% during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to 56.5% and 56.8% during the same respective periods in 2021. The average cost of deposits is primarily impacted by changes in market interest rates as well as changes in the volume and relative mix of interest-bearing deposits. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits and total deposits was 0.62% and 0.37%, respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to 0.07% and 0.04%, respectively, during the same period in 2021. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits and total deposits was 0.32% and 0.19%, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to 0.07% and 0.04%, respectively, during the same period in 2021. The average cost of deposits during 2022 was impacted by an increase in the interest rates we pay on most of our interest-bearing deposit products as a result of the aforementioned increase in market interest rates. 

Our net interest spread, which represents the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, was 2.72% and 2.49% during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to 2.43% and 2.57% during the same respective periods in 2021. The net interest spread, as well as the net interest margin, will be impacted by future changes in short-term and long-term interest rate levels, as well as the impact from the competitive environment. A discussion of the effects of changing interest rates on net interest income is set forth in Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included elsewhere in this report. 

Our hedging policies permit the use of various derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, swaptions, caps and floors, to manage exposure to changes in interest rates. Details of our derivatives and hedging activities are set forth in Note 8 - Derivative Financial Instruments in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Information regarding the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on our derivative financial instruments is set forth in Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included elsewhere in this report. 

Credit Loss Expense 

Credit loss expense is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for credit loss accounts for various types of financial instruments including loans, securities and off-balance-sheet credit exposures after net charge-offs have been deducted to bring the allowances to a level which, in management&#8217;s best estimate, is necessary to absorb expected credit losses over the lives of the respective financial instruments. The components of credit loss expense were as follows: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Credit loss expense (benefit) related to: Loans $ (2,463) $ (3,023) $ (2,395) $ (7,402) Off-balance-sheet credit exposures 2,463 3,023 2,395 7,467 Securities held to maturity &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; (2) Total $ &#8212; $ &#8212; $ &#8212; $ 63 

See the section captioned &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; elsewhere in this discussion for further analysis of credit loss expense related to loans and off-balance-sheet credit exposures. 

Non-Interest Income 

Total non-interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased $6.6 million, or 7.1%, and increased $21.5 million, or 7.7%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. Changes in the various components of non-interest income are discussed in more detail below. 

Trust and Investment Management Fees. Trust and investment management fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased $1.2 million, or 3.1%, and $4.4 million, or 4.0%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. Investment management fees are the most significant component of trust and investment management fees, making up approximately 78.0% and 82.4% of total trust and investment management fees for the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in trust and investment management fees during the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to increases in oil and gas fees (up $2.9 million), real estate fees (up $467 thousand) and estate fees (up $314 thousand) partly offset by a decrease in investment management fees (down $2.5 million). 

The increase in trust and investment management fees during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to increases in oil and gas fees (up $5.5 million) and real estate fees (up $1.0 million) partly offset by decreases in investment management fees (down $1.5 million) and estate fees (down $574 thousand). Oil and gas fees during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were impacted by increases in oil and gas prices. The fluctuations in estate fees and real estate fees during the comparable periods were primarily related to variations in transaction volumes. Investment management fees are generally based on the market value of assets within an account and are thus impacted by volatility in the equity and bond markets. The decreases in investment management fees during three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily related to lower average equity valuations, in part related to the sharp decline in equity valuations during the second and third quarters of 2022. 

At September 30, 2022, trust assets, including both managed assets and custody assets, were primarily composed of equity securities (41.7% of assets), fixed income securities (33.8% of assets), alternative investments (7.5% of assets) and cash equivalents (9.6% of assets). The estimated fair value of these assets was $40.1 billion (including managed assets of $19.3 billion and custody assets of $20.8 billion) at September 30, 2022, compared to $43.3 billion (including managed assets of $19.1 billion and custody assets of $24.2 billion) at December 31, 2021 and $41.2 billion (including managed assets of $18.2 billion and custody assets of $22.9 billion) at September 30, 2021. 

Service Charges on Deposit Accounts. Service charges on deposit accounts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased $1.7 million, or 8.2%, and $8.5 million, or 13.9%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. The increase during the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily related to increases in overdraft charges on consumer and commercial accounts (up $1.3 million and $568 thousand, respectively) and consumer service charges (up $260 thousand) partly offset by a decrease in commercial service charges (down $400 thousand). The increase during the nine 

months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily related to increases in overdraft charges on consumer and commercial accounts (up $4.1 million and $1.7 million, respectively), commercial service charges (up $2.1 million) and consumer service charges (up $702 thousand). 

Overdraft charges totaled $9.7 million ($7.2 million consumer and $2.4 million commercial) during the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $7.8 million ($5.9 million consumer and $1.9 million commercial) during the same period in 2021. Overdraft charges totaled $27.9 million ($21.4 million consumer and $6.5 million commercial) during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $22.2 million ($17.3 million consumer and $4.9 million commercial) during the same period in 2021. The increases in overdraft charges during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were impacted by increases in the volumes of fee assessed overdrafts relative to the same periods in 2021, in part due to growth in the number of accounts. The decrease in commercial service charges during the three months ended September 30, 2022 primarily resulted from a higher average earnings credit rate applied to deposits maintained by treasury management customers. Because average market interest rates were higher during 2022 compared to 2021, deposit balances were more valuable and yielded a higher average earnings credit rate. As a result, customers paid for less of their services through fees rather than with earnings credits applied to their deposit balances. The increase in commercial service charges during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily related to an increase in the volume of billable services compared to the same period in 2021, partly offset by the impact of a higher average earnings credit rate. The increases in consumer service charges during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were partly related to increases in overall deposit accounts and volumes. 

In June 2022, we expanded the overdraft grace feature first implemented in April 2021. This feature, which was previously only available to certain consumer demand deposit accounts, is now available to all of our consumer demand deposit accounts, regardless of direct deposit status. With this feature, no fees will be assessed on overdrafts of $100 or less. Additionally, we also eliminated fees on non-sufficient and returned items for all consumer deposit accounts. We expect these changes will impact revenue by as much as $3.5 million on an annual basis. 

Insurance Commissions and Fees . Insurance commissions and fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased $1.4 million, or 12.0%, and $1.7 million, or 4.3%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. The increase during the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily the result of an increase in commission income (up $1.4 million). The increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was the result of an increase in commission income (up $2.7 million) partly offset by a decrease in contingent income (down $964 thousand). 

The increases in commission income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily related to increases in commercial and personal lines property and casualty commissions. These increases were related to increased business volumes and increased market rates. 

Contingent income totaled $278 thousand and $3.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $241 thousand and $4.3 million during the same periods in 2021. Contingent income primarily consists of amounts received from various property and casualty insurance carriers related to portfolio growth and the loss performance of insurance policies previously placed. These performance related contingent payments are seasonal in nature and are mostly received during the first quarter of each year. This performance related contingent income totaled $1.9 million and $3.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in performance related contingent income during 2022 was related to low growth within the portfolio and a deterioration in the loss performance of insurance policies previously placed. This deterioration was impacted by a severe weather event in Texas during the first quarter of 2021 that resulted in a significant increase in property and casualty claims and losses. Contingent income also includes amounts received from various benefit plan insurance companies related to the volume of business generated and/or the subsequent retention of such business. This benefit plan related contingent income totaled $232 thousand and $1.4 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $201 thousand and $1.1 million during the same respective periods in 2021. 

Interchange and Card Transaction Fees . Interchange fees, or &#8220;swipe&#8221; fees, are charges that merchants pay to us and other card-issuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions. Interchange and card transaction fees consist of income from debit and credit card usage, point of sale income from PIN-based card transactions and ATM service fees. Interchange and card transaction fees are reported net of related network costs. 

Net interchange and card transaction fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased $124 thousand, or 2.8%, and $527 thousand, or 4.0%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021 primarily due to increases in transaction volumes as well as the impact of new card products partly offset by an increase in network costs. A comparison of gross and net interchange and card transaction fees for the reported periods is presented in the table below. 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Income from card transactions $ 8,292 $ 7,721 $ 24,081 $ 21,666 ATM service fees 871 841 2,502 2,492 Gross interchange and card transaction fees 9,163 8,562 26,583 24,158 Network costs 4,549 4,072 12,832 10,934 Net interchange and card transaction fees $ 4,614 $ 4,490 $ 13,751 $ 13,224 

Federal Reserve rules applicable to financial institutions that have assets of $10 billion or more provide that the maximum permissible interchange fee for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. An upward adjustment of no more than 1 cent to an issuer's debit card interchange fee is allowed if the card issuer develops and implements policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve certain fraud-prevention standards. The Federal Reserve also has rules governing routing and exclusivity that require issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product. 

Other Charges, Commissions and Fees . Other charges, commissions and fees for the three months ended September 30, 2022 increased $1.3 million, or 13.4%, compared to the same period in 2021. The increase was primarily related to increases in income from the placement of money market accounts (up $1.6 million) and merchant services rebates/bonuses (up $417 thousand), among other things, partly offset by a decrease in income from the sale of mutual funds (down $983 thousand), among other things. Other charges, commissions and fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased $3.9 million, or 14.5%, compared to the same period in 2021. The increase was primarily related to increases in income from the placement of money market accounts (up $2.6 million), merchant services rebates/bonuses (up $1.3 million), letter of credit fees (up $681 thousand) and funds transfer service charges (up $446 thousand), among other things, partly offset by a decrease in income from the sale of mutual funds (down $1.1 million), among other things. 

Other Non-Interest Income. Other non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2022 increased $879 thousand, or 10.3%, compared to the same period in 2021. The increase was primarily related to increases in sundry and other miscellaneous income (up $927 thousand), public finance underwriting fees (up $629 thousand) and income from customer foreign exchange transactions (up $364 thousand), among other things, partly offset by a decrease in income from customer derivative and securities trading transactions (down $660 thousand), among other things. Sundry income during the three months ended September 30, 2022 included $1.2 million in card related incentives/rebates, among other things. The fluctuations in income from public finance underwriting fees; customer derivative and securities trading transactions and customer foreign exchange transactions were primarily related to fluctuations in transaction volumes. 

Other non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased $2.4 million, or 9.3%, compared to the same period in 2021. The increase was primarily related to increases in sundry and other miscellaneous income (up $3.2 million), public finance underwriting fees (up $2.3 million) and income from customer foreign exchange transactions (up $1.3 million) partly offset by decreases in gains on the sale of foreclosed and other assets (down $2.0 million), income from customer derivative and securities trading transactions (down $1.1 million) and mineral interest income (down $574 thousand), among other things. Sundry income during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 included $2.2 million in card related incentives/rebates, $1.2 million related to the recovery of prior write-offs and $458 thousand related to a contract fee. The increases in public finance underwriting fees and income from customer foreign exchange transactions were primarily related to increases in transaction volumes. Gains on the sale of assets during 2021 included $1.8 million related to the sale of certain parking lots in downtown San Antonio during the second quarter. The decrease in income from customer derivative transactions was primarily due to a decrease in transaction volume. The decrease in mineral interest income was related to the donation of certain mineral interests in 2021. 

Non-Interest Expense 

Total non-interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased $39.9 million, or 18.3%, and increased $99.6 million, or 15.5%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. Changes in the various components of non-interest expense are discussed below. 

Salaries and Wages . Salaries and wages for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased $27.7 million, or 27.9%, and $65.4 million, or 22.6%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. The increases in salaries and wages were primarily related to increases in salaries, due to annual merit and market increases as well as the implementation of a $20 per hour minimum wage in December, 2021. Salaries and wages were also impacted by increases in the number of employees, increases in incentive and stock-based compensation and, primarily during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, a decrease in salary costs deferred in connection with loan originations as the first quarter of 2021 was impacted by the high volume of PPP loan originations. The increases in the number of employees were partly related to our investments in organic expansion in the Houston and Dallas markets as well as preparations for our mortgage loan product offering. We are experiencing a competitive labor market which has resulted in and could continue to result in an increase in our staffing costs. 

Employee Benefits . Employee benefits expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased $104 thousand, or 0.5%, and $3.8 million, or 6.0%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. The increase during the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily related to increases in payroll taxes, medical benefits expense and other employee benefits, among other things, partly offset by a decrease in 401(k) plan expense, primarily due to a discretionary profit sharing accrual during the third quarter of 2021, and an increase in the net periodic benefit related to our defined benefit retirement plan. The increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily related to increases in payroll taxes, medical benefits expense, 401(k) plan expense and other employee benefits, among other things, partly offset by an increase in the net periodic benefits related to our defined benefit retirement plan. 

Our defined benefit retirement and restoration plans were frozen in 2001 which has helped to reduce the volatility in retirement plan expense. We nonetheless still have funding obligations related to these plans and could recognize expense related to these plans in future years, which would be dependent on the return earned on plan assets, the level of interest rates and employee turnover. See Note 12 - Defined Benefit Plans for additional information related to our net periodic pension benefit/cost. 

Net Occupancy . Net occupancy expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased $925 thousand, or 3.4%, and $4.0 million, or 5.0%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. The increase during the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily related to increases in lease expense (up $545 thousand) and depreciation on buildings and leasehold improvements (together up $313 thousand), among other things. The increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily related to increases in repairs and maintenance/service contracts expense (up $1.6 million), lease expense (up $1.1 million), depreciation on buildings and leasehold improvements (together up $976 thousand) and insurance expense (up $477 thousand), among other things. The increases in the aforementioned components of net occupancy expense were impacted, in part, by our expansion within the Houston and Dallas market areas. 

Technology, Furniture and Equipment. Technology, furniture and equipment expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased $2.3 million, or 8.0%, and $5.4 million, or 6.3%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. The increases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily related to increases in cloud services expense (up $999 thousand and $2.9 million, respectively), depreciation of furniture and equipment (up $189 thousand and $1.1 million, respectively), service contracts expense (up $240 thousand and $823 thousand, respectively) and software maintenance (up $846 thousand and $289 thousand, respectively), among other things. 

Deposit Insurance . Deposit insurance expense totaled $4.3 million and $11.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $3.1 million and $8.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increases were primarily related to an increase in total assets. In October 2022, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation adopted a final rule to increase the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by 2 basis points beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. 

Other Non-Interest Expense . Other non-interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased $7.7 million, or 20.3%, and $18.4 million, or 15.8%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. The increase during the three months ended September 30, 2022 included increases in advertising/promotions expense (up $2.0 million); professional services expense (up $1.3 million); travel, meals and entertainment (up $1.2 million); and sundry and other miscellaneous expenses (up $1.2 million), among other things. 

The increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 included increases in advertising/promotions expense (up $4.8 million); professional services expense (up $4.3 million); travel, meals and entertainment (up $4.2 million); sundry and 

other miscellaneous expenses (up $1.4 million) and business development expense (up $1.1 million), among other things. Other non-interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was also impacted by a decrease in costs deferred as loan origination costs (down $1.2 million) as the first quarter of 2021 was impacted by a large volume of PPP loan originations. The impact of the aforementioned items was partly offset by a decrease in donations expense (down $3.4 million), which was impacted by $3.3 million in contributions to the Frost Charitable Foundation during the first and second quarters of 2021, among other things. Sundry and other miscellaneous expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 included a $1.6 million accrual related to a probable loss. 

Results of Segment Operations 

We are managed under a matrix organizational structure whereby our two primary operating segments, Banking and Frost Wealth Advisors, overlap a regional reporting structure. A third operating segment, Non-Banks, is for the most part the parent holding company, as well as certain other insignificant non-bank subsidiaries of the parent that, for the most part, have little or no activity. A description of each segment, the methodologies used to measure segment financial performance and summarized operating results by segment are described in Note 15 - Operating Segments in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Segment operating results are discussed in more detail below. 

Banking 

Net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased $62.0 million, or 61.6%, and $46.8 million, or 14.6%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. The increase during the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily the result of a $109.1 million increase in net interest income and a $4.7 million increase in non-interest income partly offset by a $37.3 million increase in non-interest expense and a $14.5 million increase in income tax expense. The increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily the result of by a $147.8 million increase in net interest income and a $16.1 million increase in non-interest income partly offset by a $92.6 million increase in non-interest expense and a $24.5 million increase in income tax expense. 

Net interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased $109.1 million, or 44.1%, and $147.8 million, or 19.8%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. The increase during the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily related to an increase in the average yield on interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve); an increase in the average volume of taxable securities; increases in the average yield on and, to a lesser extent, the average volume of loans; and increases in the average volume of and the average taxable-equivalent yield on tax-exempt securities. The impact of these items was partly offset by increases in the average cost of interest-bearing deposit accounts (primarily money market deposit accounts) and an increase in the average cost of repurchase agreements, among other things. The increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily related to an increase in the average volume of taxable securities; an increase in the average yield on interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve); an increase in the average yield on loans; and an increase in the average volume of tax-exempt securities. The impact of these items was partly offset by increases in the average cost and the average volume of interest-bearing deposit accounts (primarily money market deposit accounts), an increase in the average cost of repurchase agreements and a decrease in the average volume of loans. See the analysis of net interest income included in the section captioned &#8220;Net Interest Income&#8221; included elsewhere in this discussion. 

Credit loss expense/benefit was not significant for the Banking segment during the reported periods. See the sections captioned &#8220;Credit Loss Expense&#8221; and &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; elsewhere in this discussion for further analysis of credit loss expense related to loans and off-balance-sheet commitments. 

Non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2022 increased $4.7 million, or 9.2%, while non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased $16.1 million, or 10.5%, compared to the same respective periods in 2021. The increases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily due to increases in service charges on deposit accounts; insurance commissions and fees; other charges, commissions and fees; and other non-interest income. The increase in service charges on deposit accounts during the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily related to increases in overdraft charges on consumer and commercial accounts and consumer service charges partly offset by a decrease in commercial service charges. The increase in service charges on deposit accounts during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily related to increases in overdraft charges on consumer and commercial accounts, commercial service charges and consumer service charges. The increases in overdraft charges during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were impacted by increases in the volumes of fee assessed overdrafts relative to the same periods in 2021. The increases in consumer service charges during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were partly related to increases in overall deposit accounts and volumes. The decrease in commercial service charges during the three months ended September 30, 2022 primarily resulted from a higher average earnings credit rate applied to deposits maintained by treasury management customers. The increase in commercial service charges during the nine months ended September 30, 

2022 was primarily related to an increase in the volumes of billable services compared to the same period in 2021, partly offset by the impact of a higher average earnings credit rate. The increases in insurance commissions and fees during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily related to increases in commission income, while the increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was partly offset by a decrease in contingent income. Insurance commissions and fees are further discussed below in relation to Frost Insurance Agency. The increases in other charges, commissions and fees during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily related to increases in merchant services rebates/bonuses, among other things, and, additionally for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, increases in letter of credit fees and funds transfer service charges. The increases in other non-interest income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily due to increases in sundry and other miscellaneous income; public finance underwriting fees; and income from customer foreign exchange transactions. The increases from these items were partly offset by decreases in income from customer derivative and securities trading transactions, among other things, and, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, a decrease in gains on the sale of foreclosed and other assets. Sundry and other miscellaneous income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 was impacted by certain card related incentives/rebates. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, sundry and other miscellaneous income was also impacted by the recovery of prior write-offs and the recognition of a contract fee. The fluctuations in income from public finance underwriting fees; customer derivative and securities trading transactions and customer foreign exchange transactions were primarily related to fluctuations in transaction volumes. See the analysis of these categories of non-interest income included in the section captioned &#8220;Non-Interest Income&#8221; included elsewhere in this discussion. 

Non-interest expense for three months ended September 30, 2022 increased $37.3 million, or 20.1%, while non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased $92.6 million, or 16.9%, compared to the same respective periods in 2021. The increases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily due to increases in salaries and wages and other non-interest expense and, to a lesser extent, increases in technology, furniture and equipment expense, net occupancy expense and deposit insurance. Non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was also negatively impacted by an increase in employee benefit expense. The increases in salaries and wages during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, were primarily related to increases in salaries, due to annual merit and market increases as well as the implementation of a $20 per hour minimum wage in December, 2021.

Other non-interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was also impacted by a decrease in costs deferred as loan origination costs as the first quarter of 2021 was impacted by a large volume of PPP loan originations. The increases in the aforementioned items during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 were partly offset by a decrease in donations expense, among other things. Donations expense during 2021 was impacted by $3.3 million in contributions to the Frost Charitable Foundation in the first and second quarters. The increases in technology, furniture and equipment expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily related to increases in cloud services expense, depreciation of furniture and equipment, service contracts expense and software maintenance, among other things. The increases in net occupancy during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily related to increases in depreciation on buildings and leasehold improvements and lease expense, among other things, and, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, increases in repairs and maintenance/service contracts expense and insurance expense.

Frost Insurance Agency, which is included in the Banking operating segment, had gross commission revenues of $13.2 million and $41.6 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $11.7 million and $39.9 million during the same respective periods in 2021. The increase during the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily related to increases in commission income while the increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily related an increase in commission income partly offset by a decrease in contingent income. The increases in gross commission income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily related to increases in commercial and personal lines property and casualty commissions, due to increases in business volumes and market rates. The decrease in contingent income during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily related to a decrease in 

performance related contingent payments due to low growth within the portfolio and a deterioration in the loss performance of insurance policies previously placed. The decrease in performance related contingent commissions during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was partly offset by an increase in contingent commissions received from various benefit plan insurance companies. See the analysis of insurance commissions and fees included in the section captioned &#8220;Non-Interest Income&#8221; included elsewhere in this discussion. 

Frost Wealth Advisors 

Net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased $218 thousand, or 2.3%, and increased $761 thousand, or 2.8%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. The increase during the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily the result of a $1.9 million increase in non-interest income and a $821 thousand increase in net interest income partly offset by a $2.4 million increase in non-interest expense. The increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily the result of a $6.0 million increase in non-interest income and a $1.5 million increase in net interest income partly offset by a $6.6 million increase in non-interest expense. 

Net interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased $821 thousand, or 153.2%, and $1.5 million, or 97.1%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. The increases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily due to increases in the average volume of funds provided by Frost Wealth Advisors and an increase in the average funds transfer prices allocated to such funds. See the analysis of net interest income included in the section captioned &#8220;Net Interest Income&#8221; included elsewhere in this discussion. 

Non-interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased $1.9 million, or 4.5%, and $6.0 million, or 4.8%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. The increases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily due to increases in trust and investment management fees; other charges, commissions and fees; and other non-interest income. Trust and investment management fee income is the most significant income component for Frost Wealth Advisors. Investment management fees are the most significant component of trust and investment management fees, making up approximately 78.0% of total trust and investment management fees for the first nine months of 2022. The increases in trust and investment management fees during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily due to increases in oil and gas fees and real estate fees partly offset by decreases in investment management fees. Trust and investment management fees for the three months ended September 30, 2022 were also positively impacted by an increase in estate fees compared to the same period in 2021 while trust and investment management fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 were also negatively impacted by a decrease in estate fees compared to the same period in 2021. Oil and gas fees during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were impacted by increases in oil and gas prices. The decreases in investment management fees during three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily related to lower average equity valuations, in part related to the sharp decline in equity valuations during the second and third quarters of 2022. The fluctuations in estate fees and real estate fees during the comparable periods were primarily related to variations in transaction volumes. The increases in other charges, commissions and fees during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily related to increases in income from the placement of money market accounts, among other things, partly offset by decreases in income from the sale of mutual funds, among other things. The increases in other non-interest income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily related to increases in income from customer securities trading transactions partly offset by decreases in sundry and other miscellaneous income. See the analysis of trust and investment management fees and other charges, commissions and fees included in the section captioned &#8220;Non-Interest Income&#8221; included elsewhere in this discussion. 

Non-interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased $2.4 million, or 7.9%, and $6.6 million, or 7.2%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. The increases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily due to increases in salaries and wages and other non-interest expense, and to a lesser extent, increases in employee benefits expense and technology, furniture and equipment expense. 

The increases in salaries and wages during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily due to increases in salaries, due to annual merit and market increases, as well as increases in commission expense and incentive and stock compensation expense. The increases in other non-interest expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were mostly related to increases in sundry and other miscellaneous expenses, which was primarily related to the write-off of certain assets; and travel, meals and entertainment; among other things. Other non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was also negatively impacted by an increase in research and platform fees. The increases in employee benefits during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily related to increases in 401(k) plan expense, medical benefits expense and payroll taxes. The increases in technology, furniture and equipment expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily related to increases in cloud services expense. 

Non-Banks 

The Non-Banks operating segment had net losses of $2.6 million and $8.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to net losses of $2.1 million and $6.6 million during the same periods in 2021. The increase in the net loss during the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to an increase in net interest expense. The increase in the net loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in other non-interest income combined with an increase in net interest expense. The increases in net interest expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily related to increases in the average rate paid on our long-term borrowings partly offset by the impact of the redemption, during the fourth quarter of 2021, of $13.4 million of junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued to WNB Capital Trust I. The decrease in other non-interest income during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in mineral interest income as the related mineral interest assets were donated to the Frost Charitable Foundation during the third quarter of 2021. 

Income Taxes 

During the three months ended September 30, 2022, we recognized income tax expense of $27.7 million, for an effective tax rate of 14.0%, compared to $13.3 million, for an effective tax rate of 11.0%, for the same period in 2021. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recognized income tax expense of $61.0 million, for an effective tax rate of 13.6%, compared to $36.3 million, for an effective tax rate of 9.6%, for the same period in 2021. The effective income tax rates differed from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 21% during 2022 and 2021 primarily due to the effect of tax-exempt income from loans, securities and life insurance policies and the income tax effects associated with stock-based compensation, among other things, and their relative proportion to total pre-tax net income. The increases in the effective tax rates during 2022 were primarily related to increases in projected pre-tax net income and, to a lesser extent during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, a decrease in discrete tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. 

Average Balance Sheet 

Average assets totaled $51.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 representing an increase of $6.3 billion, or 13.9%, compared to average assets for the same period in 2021. Earning assets increased $5.9 billion, or 13.8%, during the first nine months of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. The increase in earning assets was primarily related to a $6.2 billion increase in average taxable securities and a $341.1 million increase in average interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) partly offset by a $404.8 million decrease in average loans. Average deposits increased $6.9 billion, or 18.3%, during the first nine months of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. Growth in average deposits was related to increased customer balances as well as new customer accounts. The increase included a $2.0 billion increase in non-interest bearing deposits and a $4.9 billion increase in interest-bearing deposit accounts. Average non-interest bearing deposits made up 41.1% and 43.2% of average total deposits during the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Loans 

Details of our loan portfolio are presented in Note 3 - Loans in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Loans increased $614.2 million, or 3.8%, from $16.3 billion at December 31, 2021 to $17.0 billion at September 30, 2022. As further discussed below, during the second quarter of 2020, we began originating loans to qualified small businesses under the Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;) administered by the SBA under the provisions of the CARES Act. Excluding PPP loans, total loans would have otherwise increased $992.1 million, or 6.2%, from $15.9 billion at December 31, 2021 to $16.9 billion at September 30, 2022. The majority of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial and industrial loans, energy loans, and real estate loans. Real estate loans include both commercial and consumer balances. Selected details related to our loan portfolio segments are presented below. Refer to our 2021 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of our loan origination and risk management processes. 

Commercial and Industrial. Commercial and industrial loans increased $166.9 million, or 3.1%, from $5.4 billion at December 31, 2021 to $5.5 billion at September 30, 2022. Our commercial and industrial loans are a diverse group of loans to small, medium and large businesses. The purpose of these loans varies from supporting seasonal working capital needs to term financing of equipment. While some short-term loans may be made on an unsecured basis, most are secured by the assets being financed with collateral margins that are consistent with our loan policy guidelines. The commercial and industrial loan portfolio also includes commercial leases and purchased shared national credits ("SNC"s). 

Energy . Energy loans include loans to entities and individuals that are engaged in various energy-related activities including (i) the development and production of oil or natural gas, (ii) providing oil and gas field servicing, (iii) providing energy-related transportation services, (iv) providing equipment to support oil and gas drilling, (v) refining petrochemicals, or (vi) trading oil, gas and related commodities. Energy loans decreased $159.7 million, or 14.8%, from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2021 to 

$918.1 million at September 30, 2022. We have recently made efforts to reduce our exposure to energy loans. Nonetheless energy loans remain our largest industry concentration totaling 5.4% of total loans (also 5.4% excluding PPP loans) at September 30, 2022, down from 6.6% of total loans (6.8% excluding PPP loans) at December 31, 2021. The average loan size, the significance of the portfolio and the specialized nature of the energy industry requires a highly prescriptive underwriting policy. Exceptions to this policy are rarely granted. Due to the large borrowing requirements of this customer base, the energy loan portfolio includes participations and SNCs. 

Purchased Shared National Credits. Purchased shared national credits are participations purchased from upstream financial organizations and tend to be larger in size than our originated portfolio. Our purchased SNC portfolio totaled $710.3 million at September 30, 2022, increasing $11.9 million, or 1.7%, from $698.4 million at December 31, 2021. At September 30, 2022, 29.6% of outstanding purchased SNCs were related to the construction industry while 23.4% were related to the energy industry, 15.5% were related to the financial services industry and 11.7% were related to the real estate management industry. The remaining purchased SNCs were diversified throughout various other industries, with no other single industry exceeding 10% of the total purchased SNC portfolio. Additionally, almost all of the outstanding balance of purchased SNCs was included in the energy and commercial and industrial portfolio, with the remainder included in the real estate categories. SNC participations are originated in the normal course of business to meet the needs of our customers. As a matter of policy, we generally only participate in SNCs for companies headquartered in or which have significant operations within our market areas. In addition, we must have direct access to the company&#8217;s management, an existing banking relationship or the expectation of broadening the relationship with other banking products and services within the following 12 to 24 months. SNCs are reviewed at least quarterly for credit quality and business development successes. 

Commercial Real Estate. Commercial real estate loans increased $654.7 million, or 8.6%, from $7.6 billion at December 31, 2021 to $8.2 billion at September 30, 2022. Commercial real estate loans represented 82.8% of total real estate loans at September 30, 2022 compared to 84.3% at December 31, 2021. The majority of our commercial real estate loan portfolio consists of commercial real estate mortgages, which includes both permanent and intermediate term loans. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Consequently, these loans must undergo the analysis and underwriting process of a commercial and industrial loan, as well as that of a real estate loan. At September 30, 2022, approximately 49.5% of the outstanding principal balance of our commercial real estate loans were secured by owner-occupied properties. 

Consumer Real Estate and Other Consumer Loans. The consumer real estate loan portfolio increased $304.9 million, or 21.6%, from $1.4 billion at December 31, 2021 to $1.7 billion at September 30, 2022. Combined, home equity loans and lines of credit made up 61.9% and 59.8% of the consumer real estate loan total at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. We offer home equity loans up to 80% of the estimated value of the personal residence of the borrower, less the value of existing mortgages and home improvement loans. We have not generally originated 1-4 family mortgage loans since 2000; however, from time to time, we invested in such loans to meet the needs of our customers or for other regulatory compliance purposes. Nonetheless, we expect to begin regular production of 1-4 family mortgage loans for portfolio investment purposes in the first half of 2023. Consumer and other loans increased $25.2 million, or 5.3%, from December 31, 2021. The consumer and other loan portfolio primarily consists of automobile loans, overdrafts, unsecured revolving credit products, personal loans secured by cash and cash equivalents and other similar types of credit facilities. 

Paycheck Protection Program . We have originated loans to qualified small businesses under the PPP administered by the SBA under the provisions of the CARES Act. Loans covered by the PPP may be eligible for loan forgiveness for certain costs incurred related to payroll, group health care benefit costs and qualifying mortgage, rent and utility payments. The remaining loan balance after forgiveness of any amounts is still fully guaranteed by the SBA. Refer to the 2021 Form 10-K for additional details. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recognized approximately $2.6 million in PPP loan related deferred processing fees (net of amortization of related deferred origination costs) as a yield adjustment and this amount is included in interest income on loans. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, we recognized approximately $88.9 million in PPP loan related deferred net processing fees. As a result of the inclusion of these net fees in interest income, the average yields on PPP loans were 3.00% during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, and 6.23% during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the stated interest rate of 1.0% on these loans. PPP related deferred processing fees and deferred origination costs are not expected to significantly impact interest income on loans in future periods. 

Accruing Past Due Loans. Accruing past due loans are presented in the following tables. Also see Note 3 - Loans in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

Accruing past due loans at September 30, 2022 decreased $31.2 million compared to December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily related to decreases in past due non-construction related commercial real estate loans (down $24.4 million), past due commercial and industrial loans (down $8.6 million) and past due PPP loans (down $2.0 million). PPP loans are fully guaranteed by the SBA and we expect to collect all amounts due related to these loans. Excluding PPP loans, accruing past due loans decreased $29.2 million. 

Non-Accrual Loans. Non-accrual loans are presented in the table below. Also see in Note 3 - Loans in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

Non-accrual loans at September 30, 2022 decreased $23.8 million from December 31, 2021 primarily due to decreases in non-accrual commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate partially offset by an increase in non-accrual energy loans. The decreases were primarily related to principal payments, loans returning to accrual and charge offs. 

Generally, loans are placed on non-accrual status if principal or interest payments become 90 days past due and/or management deems the collectibility of the principal and/or interest to be in question, as well as when required by regulatory requirements. Once interest accruals are discontinued, accrued but uncollected interest is charged to current year operations. Subsequent receipts on non-accrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal, and interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured. Classification of a loan as non-accrual does not preclude the ultimate collection of loan principal or interest. There were no non-accrual commercial and industrial loans in excess of $5.0 million at September 30, 2022 or December 31, 2021. Non-accrual energy loans included two credit relationships in excess of $5.0 million totaling $11.8 million at September 30, 2022. One of these credit relationships, which totaled $6.7 million at September 30, 2022, was previously reported as non-accrual with an aggregate balance of $9.6 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease in the aggregate balance of this credit relationship was related to principal payments made by the borrower. Non-accrual real estate loans primarily consist of land development, 1-4 family residential construction credit relationships and loans secured by office buildings and religious facilities. There were no non-accrual commercial real estate loans in excess of $5.0 million at September 30, 2022 or December 31, 2021. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

In the case of loans and securities, allowances for credit losses are contra-asset valuation accounts, calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 326 (&#8220;ASC 326&#8221;) Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, that are deducted from the amortized cost basis of these assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. In the case of off-balance-sheet credit exposures, the allowance for credit losses is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, reported as a component of accrued interest payable and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of each allowance account represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) on these financial instruments considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. While historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions or other relevant factors. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the performance of our portfolios, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets. See our 2021 Form 10-K for additional information regarding our accounting policies related to credit losses. 

Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans. The table below provides, as of the dates indicated, an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan portfolio segment; however, allocation of a portion of the allowance to one segment does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other segments. 

Amount of Allowance Allocated Percent of Loans in Each Category to Total Loans Total Loans Ratio of Allowance Allocated to Loans in Each Category September 30, 2022 Commercial and industrial $ 98,830 32.6 % $ 5,531,820 1.79 % Energy 18,851 5.4 918,125 2.05 Paycheck Protection Program &#8212; 0.3 51,048 &#8212; Commercial real estate 100,607 48.6 8,231,342 1.22 Consumer real estate 8,035 10.1 1,715,736 0.47 Consumer and other 7,992 3.0 502,558 1.59 Total $ 234,315 100.0 % $ 16,950,629 1.38 Excluding PPP loans $ 234,315 $ 16,899,581 1.39 % December 31, 2021 Commercial and industrial $ 72,091 32.9 % $ 5,364,954 1.34 % Energy 17,217 6.6 1,077,792 1.60 Paycheck Protection Program &#8212; 2.6 428,882 &#8212; Commercial real estate 144,936 46.4 7,576,610 1.91 Consumer real estate 6,585 8.6 1,410,790 0.47 Consumer and other 7,837 2.9 477,369 1.64 Total $ 248,666 100.0 % $ 16,336,397 1.52 Excluding PPP loans $ 248,666 $ 15,907,515 1.56 

The allowance allocated to commercial and industrial loans totaled $98.8 million, or 1.79% of total commercial and industrial loans, at September 30, 2022 increasing $26.7 million, or 37.1%, compared to $72.1 million, or 1.34% of total commercial and industrial loans, at December 31, 2021. Modeled expected credit losses increased $10.7 million while qualitative factor (&#8220;Q-Factor&#8221;) and other qualitative adjustments related to commercial and industrial loans increased $25.3 million. Specific allocations for commercial and industrial loans that were evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis decreased $9.3 million from $10.5 million at December 31, 2021 to $1.3 million at September 30, 2022. The decrease in specific allocations for commercial and industrial loans was related to principal payments received and the recognition of charge-offs. 

The allowance allocated to energy loans totaled $18.9 million, or 2.05% of total energy loans, at September 30, 2022 increasing $1.6 million, or 9.5%, compared to $17.2 million, or 1.60% of total energy loans, at December 31, 2021. Modeled expected credit losses related to energy loans increased $2.3 million while Q-Factor and other qualitative adjustments related to energy loans decreased $855 thousand. Specific allocations for energy loans that were evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis totaled $5.7 million at September 30, 2022 increasing $195 thousand compared to $5.5 million on December 31, 2021. 

The allowance allocated to commercial real estate loans totaled $100.6 million, or 1.22% of total commercial real estate loans, at September 30, 2022 decreasing $44.3 million, or 30.6%, compared to $144.9 million, or 1.91% of total commercial real estate loans, at December 31, 2021. Modeled expected credit losses related to commercial real estate loans increased $7.7 million while Q-Factor and other qualitative adjustments related to commercial real estate loans decreased $53.6 million. Specific allocations for commercial real estate loans that were evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis increased from $400 thousand at December 31, 2021 to $1.9 million at September 30, 2022. 

The allowance allocated to consumer real estate loans totaled $8.0 million, or 0.47% of total consumer real estate loans, at September 30, 2022 increasing $1.5 million, or 22.0%, compared to $6.6 million, or 0.47% of total consumer real estate loans, at December 31, 2021. Modeled expected credit losses related to consumer real estate loans increased $1.3 million while Q-Factor and other qualitative adjustments related to consumer real estate loans increased $91 thousand. 

The allowance allocated to consumer loans totaled $8.0 million, or 1.59% of total consumer loans, at September 30, 2022 increasing $155 thousand, or 2.0%, compared to $7.8 million, or 1.64% of total consumer loans, at December 31, 2021. Modeled expected credit losses related to consumer loans decreased $938 thousand while Q-Factor and other qualitative 

adjustments increased $1.1 million, which was primarily due to an increase in the consumer overlay, which is further discussed below. 

As more fully described in our 2021 Form 10-K, we measure expected credit losses over the life of each loan utilizing a combination of models which measure probability of default and loss given default, among other things. The measurement of expected credit losses is impacted by loan/borrower attributes and certain macroeconomic variables. Models are adjusted to reflect current impact of certain macroeconomic variables as well as their expected changes over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. 

In estimating expected credit losses as of September 30, 2022, we utilized the Moody&#8217;s Analytics September 2022 Baseline Scenario (the &#8220;September 2022 Baseline Scenario&#8221;) to forecast the macroeconomic variables used in our models. The September 2022 Baseline Scenario was based on the review of a variety of surveys of baseline forecasts of the U.S. economy. The September 2022 Baseline Scenario projections included, among other things, (i) U.S. Nominal Gross Domestic Product annualized quarterly growth rate of 4.2% in the fourth quarter of 2022 followed by average annualized quarterly growth rates of 4.7% in 2023 and 4.9% through the end of the forecast period in the third quarter of 2024; (ii) average U.S. unemployment rate of 3.7% in the fourth quarter of 2022 followed by average annualized quarterly rates of 3.9% in 2023 and 4.0% through the end of the forecast period in the third quarter of 2024; (iii) average Texas unemployment rate of 4.2% in the fourth quarter of 2022 followed by average annualized quarterly rates of 4.1% in 2023 and 3.9% through the end of the forecast period in the third quarter of 2024; (iv) projected average 10 year Treasury rate of 3.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022, and increasing to 3.5% by the end of the forecast period in the third quarter of 2024. 

In estimating expected credit losses as of December 31, 2021, we utilized the Moody&#8217;s Analytics December 2021 Consensus Scenario (the &#8220;December 2021 Consensus Scenario&#8221;) to forecast the macroeconomic variables used in our models. The December 2021 Consensus Scenario was based on the review of a variety of surveys of baseline forecasts of the U.S. economy. The December 2021 Consensus Scenario projections included, among other things, (i) U.S. Nominal Gross Domestic Product annualized quarterly growth rate of 6.4% in the first quarter of 2022, followed by annualized quarterly growth rates in the range of 3.8% to 5.4% during the remainder of 2022 and an average annualized growth rate of 4.8% through the end of the forecast period in the fourth quarter of 2023; (ii) U.S. unemployment rate of 4.3% in the first quarter of 2022 improving to 3.7% by the end of the forecast period in the fourth quarter of 2023 with Texas unemployment rates slightly higher at those dates; and (iii) projected average 10 year Treasury rate of 1.59% in the first quarter of 2022, increasing to average projected rates of 1.75% during the remainder of 2022 and 2.10% in 2023. 

The overall loan portfolio, excluding PPP loans which are fully guaranteed by the SBA, as of September 30, 2022 increased $992.1 million, or 6.2%, compared to December 31, 2021. This increase included a $654.7 million, or 8.6%, increase in commercial real estate loans; a $304.9 million, or 21.6%, increase in consumer real estate loans; a $166.9 million, or 3.1%, increase in commercial and industrial loans; and a $25.2 million, or 5.3%, increase in consumer and other loans partly offset by a $159.7 million, or 14.8%, decrease in energy loans. 

The weighted average risk grade for commercial and industrial loans increased to 6.41 at September 30, 2022 compared to 6.22 at December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the weighted-average risk grade of pass-grade commercial and industrial loans to 6.25 at September 30, 2022 from 6.01 at December 31, 2021. Commercial and industrial loans graded &#8220;watch&#8221; and &#8220;special mention&#8221; (risk grades 9 and 10) decreased $9.3 million during the first nine months of 2022 while classified commercial and industrial loans decreased $16.8 million. Classified loans consist of loans having a risk grade of 11, 12 or 13. The weighted-average risk grade for energy loans decreased to 5.86 at September 30, 2022 from 6.06 at December 31, 2021. The decrease in the weighted average risk grade was partly related to a $24.0 million decrease in energy loans graded &#8220;watch&#8221; and &#8220;special mention&#8221; (risk grades 9 and 10). Additionally, pass grade energy loans decreased $134.0 million and the weighted-average risk grade of pass grade energy loans decreased from 5.78 at December 31, 2021 to 5.61 at September 30, 2022. The weighted average risk grade for commercial real estate loans decreased to 7.11 at September 30, 2022 from 7.19 at December 31, 2021. Pass grade commercial real estate loans increased $742.4 million while the weighted-average risk grade of such loans decreased from 6.92 at December 31, 2021 to 6.90 September 30, 2022. Commercial real estate loans graded as &#8220;watch&#8221; and &#8220;special mention&#8221; decreased $85.8 million and classified commercial real estate loans decreased $1.9 million. 

As noted above, our credit loss models utilized the economic forecasts in the Moody's September 2022 Baseline Scenario for our estimated expected credit losses as of September 30, 2022 and the Moody's December 2021 Consensus Scenario for our estimate of expected credit losses as of December 31, 2021. We qualitatively adjusted the model results based on these scenarios for various risk factors that are not considered within our modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools. These qualitative factor, or Q-Factor, adjustments are discussed below. 

Q-Factor adjustments are based upon management's judgment and current assessment as to the impact of risks related to changes in lending policies and procedures; economic and business conditions; loan portfolio attributes and credit concentrations; and external factors, among other things, that are not already captured within the modeling inputs, assumptions and other processes. Management assesses the potential impact of such items within a range of severely negative impact to positive impact and adjusts the modeled expected credit loss by an aggregate adjustment percentage based upon the assessment. As a result of this assessment as of September 30, 2022, modeled expected credit losses were adjusted upwards by a weighted-average Q-Factor adjustment of approximately 2.6%, resulting in a $2.6 million total adjustment, compared to 2.3% at December 31, 2021, which resulted in a $1.8 million total adjustment. The weighted-average Q-Factor adjustment at September 30, 2022 was based on a limited negative expected impact on our commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loan portfolios related to changes in loan portfolio concentrations; a limited negative expected impact on all of our loan portfolios related to changes in the volumes and severity of loan delinquencies, changes in risk grades and adverse classifications; a limited negative expected impact on our commercial and consumer real estate portfolios related to the potential deterioration of collateral values (no expected impact related to our commercial and industrial and consumer portfolios); a negative expected impact associated with national, regional and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of loans; a severely negative expected impact from other risk factors associated with our commercial real estate construction and land loan portfolios, particularly the risks related to expected extensions; and limited negative impact to our commercial real estate construction, non-owner occupied and owner occupied loan portfolios, as well as a negative impact to our consumer loan portfolio related to changes in lending policies, procedures, underwriting standards and loan portfolio attributes, among other things. 

We have also provided additional qualitative adjustments, or management overlays, as of September 30, 2022 as management believes there are still significant risks impacting certain categories of our loan portfolio. Q-Factor and other qualitative adjustments as of September 30, 2022 are detailed in the table below. 

Q-Factor Adjustment Model Overlays Office Building Overlays Down-Side Scenario Overlay Credit Concentration Overlays Consumer Overlay Total Commercial and industrial $ 1,152 $ &#8212; $ &#8212; $ 33,344 $ 5,435 $ &#8212; $ 39,931 Energy 173 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 4,346 &#8212; 4,519 Commercial real estate: Owner occupied 445 18,992 &#8212; &#8212; 1,635 &#8212; 21,072 Non-owner occupied 80 10,672 23,590 &#8212; 586 &#8212; 34,928 Construction 587 11,202 5,710 &#8212; 808 &#8212; 18,307 Consumer real estate 156 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 156 Consumer and other 33 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 2,500 2,533 Total $ 2,626 $ 40,866 $ 29,300 $ 33,344 $ 12,810 $ 2,500 $ 121,446 

Model overlays are qualitative adjustments to address the effect of unusually large positive changes in certain economic variables used by our commercial real estate credit loss models. These adjustments are determined based upon minimum reserve ratios for our commercial real estate - owner occupied, commercial real estate - non-owner occupied and commercial real estate - construction loan portfolios. 

Office building overlays are qualitative adjustments to address longer-term concerns over the utilization of commercial office space which could impact the long-term performance of some types of office properties within our commercial real estate loan portfolio. These adjustments are determined based upon minimum reserve ratios for loans within our commercial real estate - non-owner occupied and commercial real estate - construction loan portfolios that have risk grades of 8 or worse. 

The down-side scenario overlay is a qualitative adjustment for our commercial and industrial loan portfolio to address the significant risk of economic recession as a result of inflation; rising interest rates; labor shortages; disruption in financial markets and global supply chains; further oil price volatility; and the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including the current war between Russia and Ukraine, terrorism or other geopolitical events. Factors such as these are outside of our control but nonetheless affect customer income levels and could alter anticipated customer behavior, including borrowing, repayment, investment and deposit practices. To determine this qualitative adjustment, we use an alternative, more pessimistic economic scenario to forecast the macroeconomic variables used in our models. As of September 30, 2022, we used the Moody&#8217;s Analytics August 2022 S3 Alternative Scenario Downside - 90th Percentile (the &#8220;August 2022 S3 Scenario&#8221;). In modeling expected credit losses using this scenario, we also assume each loan within our modeled loan pools is downgraded by one risk grade level. The qualitative adjustment is based upon the amount by which the alternative scenario modeling results exceed those of the primary scenario used in estimating credit loss expense, adjusted based upon management's assessment of the probability that this more pessimistic economic scenario will occur. 

Credit concentration overlays are qualitative adjustments based upon statistical analysis to address relationship exposure concentrations within our loan portfolio. Variations in loan portfolio concentrations over time cause expected credit losses within our existing portfolio to differ from historical loss experience. Given that the allowance for credit losses on loans reflects expected credit losses within our loan portfolio and the fact that these expected credit losses are uncertain as to nature, timing and amount, management believes that segments with higher concentration risk are more likely to experience a high loss event. Due to the fact that a significant portion of our loan portfolio is concentrated in large credit relationships and because of large, concentrated credit losses in recent years, management made the qualitative adjustments detailed in the table above to address the risk associated with such a relationship deteriorating to a loss event. 

The consumer overlay is a qualitative adjustment for our consumer and other loan portfolio to address the risk associated with the level of unsecured loans within this portfolio and other risk factors. Unsecured consumer loans have an elevated risk of loss in times of economic stress as these loans lack a secondary source of repayment in the form of hard collateral. This adjustment was determined by analyzing our consumer loan charge-off trends as well as those of the general banking industry. Management deemed it appropriate to consider an additional overlay to the modeled forecasted losses for the unsecured consumer portfolio. 

As of December 31, 2021, we provided qualitative adjustments, as detailed in the table below. Further information regarding these qualitative adjustments is provided in our 2021 Form 10-K.

We recorded a net credit loss benefit related to loans totaling $2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 while we recorded a net credit loss benefit totaling $7.4 million during the same period in 2021. Net credit loss expense/benefit for each portfolio segment reflects the amount needed to adjust the allowance for credit losses allocated to that segment to the level of expected credit losses determined under our allowance methodology after net charge-offs have been recognized. 

The net credit loss benefit related to loans during the first nine months of 2022 primarily reflects a decrease in expected credit losses associated with commercial real estate loans, primarily related to a decrease in expected credit losses related to certain pandemic impacted industries and a reduction in the minimum reserve ratio for our commercial real estate - owner occupied portfolio. The impact of this decrease was partly offset by an increase in expected credit losses associated with commercial and industrial loans, primarily related to the down-side scenario overlay discussed above, and increases in modeled losses for our commercial and industrial, energy, commercial real estate and consumer real estate portfolios. The ratio of the 

allowance for credit losses on loans to total loans was 1.38% (1.39% excluding PPP loans) at September 30, 2022 compared to 1.52% (1.56% excluding PPP loans) at December 31, 2021. Management believes the recorded amount of the allowance for credit losses on loans is appropriate based upon management&#8217;s best estimate of current expected credit losses within the existing portfolio of loans. Should any of the factors considered by management in making this estimate change, our estimate of current expected credit losses could also change, which could affect the level of future credit loss expense related to loans. 

Allowance for Credit Losses - Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures totaled approximately $52.7 million and $50.3 million at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The level of the allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures depends upon the volume of outstanding commitments, underlying risk grades, the expected utilization of available funds and forecasted economic conditions impacting our loan portfolio. Our policies and methodology used to estimate the allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures are further described in our 2021 Form 10-K. We recognized a net credit loss expense related to off-balance-sheet credit exposures totaling $2.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to a net credit loss expense of $7.5 million during the same period in 2021. 

Capital and Liquidity 

Capital . Shareholders&#8217; equity totaled $2.8 billion and $4.4 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The decrease was primarily related to the accumulated other comprehensive income/loss component of shareholders&#8217; equity which decreased to a net, after-tax, unrealized loss of $1.5 billion at September 30, 2022 from a net, after-tax unrealized gain of $347.3 million at December 31, 2021. The change was primarily due to a $1.9 billion net, after-tax, decrease in the fair value of securities available for sale. Other uses of capital during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 included $158.3 million of dividends paid on preferred and common stock and $996 thousand of treasury stock purchases. Sources of capital during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 included net income of $388.0 million, $11.8 million in proceeds from stock option exercises and $8.7 million related to stock-based compensation. 

Under the Basel III Capital Rules, we have elected to opt-out of the requirement to include most components of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital. Accordingly, amounts reported as accumulated other comprehensive income/loss do not increase or reduce regulatory capital and are not included in the calculation of our regulatory capital ratios. In connection with the adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2020, we also elected to exclude, for a transitional period, the effects of credit loss accounting under CECL in the calculation of our regulatory capital and regulatory capital ratios. Regulatory agencies for banks and bank holding companies utilize capital guidelines designed to measure capital and take into consideration the risk inherent in both on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet items. See Note 7 - Capital and Regulatory Matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 

We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.75, $0.75 and $0.87 per common share during the first, second and third quarters of 2022, respectively, and a quarterly dividend of $0.72, $0.72 and $0.75 per common share during the first, second and third quarters of 2021, respectively. These dividend amounts equate to a common stock dividend payout ratio of 40.0% and 41.7% during the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our ability to declare or pay dividends on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our capital stock may be impacted by certain restrictions described in Note 7 - Capital and Regulatory Matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 

Stock Repurchase Plans. From time to time, our board of directors has authorized stock repurchase plans. In general, stock repurchase plans allow us to proactively manage our capital position and return excess capital to shareholders. Shares purchased under such plans also provide us with shares of common stock necessary to satisfy obligations related to stock compensation awards. On January 26, 2022 our board of directors authorized a $100.0 million stock repurchase program, allowing us to repurchase shares of our common stock over a one-year period from time to time at various prices in the open market or through private transactions. No shares have been repurchased under this plan or under a prior plan during the reported periods. See Note 7 - Capital and Regulatory Matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements and Part II, Item 2 - Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds, each included elsewhere in this report. 

In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the &#8220;IRA&#8221;) was enacted. Among other things, the IRA imposes a new 1% excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchased after December 31, 2022 by publicly traded U.S. corporations. With certain exceptions, the value of stock repurchased is determined net of stock issued in the year, including pursuant to compensatory arrangements. 

Liquidity . As more fully discussed in our 2021 Form 10-K, our liquidity position is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate. Liquidity risk management is an important element in our asset/liability management process. We regularly model liquidity stress scenarios to assess potential liquidity outflows or funding problems resulting from economic disruptions, volatility in the financial markets, unexpected credit events or other significant occurrences deemed problematic by management. These scenarios are incorporated into our contingency funding plan, which provides the basis for the identification of our liquidity needs. Our principal source of funding has been our customer deposits, supplemented by our short-term and long-term borrowings as well as maturities of securities and loan amortization. As of September 30, 2022, we had approximately $12.8 billion held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve. We also have the ability to borrow funds as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;). As of September 30, 2022, based upon available, pledgeable collateral, our total borrowing capacity with the FHLB was approximately $3.4 billion. Furthermore, at September 30, 2022, we had approximately $14.4 billion in securities that were unencumbered by a pledge and could be used to support additional borrowings through repurchase agreements or the Federal Reserve discount window, as needed. 

Since Cullen/Frost is a holding company and does not conduct operations, its primary sources of liquidity are dividends upstreamed from Frost Bank and borrowings from outside sources. Banking regulations may limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by Frost Bank. See Note 7 - Capital and Regulatory Matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report regarding such dividends. At September 30, 2022, Cullen/Frost had liquid assets, including cash and resell agreements, totaling $381.5 million.
