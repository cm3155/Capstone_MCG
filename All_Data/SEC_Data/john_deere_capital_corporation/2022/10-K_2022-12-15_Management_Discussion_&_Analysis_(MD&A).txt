 Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The following Management&#39;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&#38;A) is intended to promote understanding of the Company&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. The MD&#38;A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).

Results of Operations 

Overview 

Organization 

The Company primarily generates revenues and cash by financing John Deere dealers&#8217; sales and leases of new and used production and precision agriculture, small agriculture and turf, and construction and forestry equipment. In addition, the Company also provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment and finances retail revolving charge accounts.

Smart Industrial Operating Model and Leap Ambitions 

John Deere&#8217;s Smart Industrial operating model is focused on making significant investments in strengthening its capabilities in digital, automation, autonomy, and alternative propulsion technologies. These technologies are intended to increase worksite efficiency, improve yields, lower input costs, and ease labor constraints. John Deere&#8217;s Leap Ambitions are goals designed to boost economic value and sustainability for John Deere&#8217;s customers. As an enabling business, the Company is fully integrated with John Deere&#8217;s Smart Industrial operating model and is focused on providing financial solutions to help John Deere achieve its Leap Ambitions. John Deere and the Company anticipate opportunities in this area, as John Deere, the Company, and their customers have a vested interest in sustainable practices.

Trends and Economic Conditions 

The Company&#8217;s volume of Receivables and Leases is largely dependent upon the level of retail sales and leases of John Deere products. The level of John Deere retail sales and leases is responsive to a variety of economic, financial, climatic, legislative, and other factors that influence supply and demand for its products. 

Industry Trends for Fiscal Year 2023 

Industry sales of large agricultural machinery in the U.S. and Canada for 2023 are forecasted to increase 5 to 10 percent compared to 2022. Industry sales of small agricultural and turf equipment in the U.S. and Canada are expected to be flat to down 5 percent in 2023. Industry sales of agricultural machinery in Europe are forecasted to be flat to up 5 percent, while South American industry sales of tractors and combines are expected to be flat to up 5 percent in 2023. Asia industry sales are forecasted to be down moderately in 2023 as the demand in India, the world&#8217;s largest tractor market by unit, stabilizes. On an industry basis, North American construction equipment and compact construction equipment sales are both expected to be flat to up 5 percent in 2023. Global forestry and global roadbuilding industry sales are each expected to be flat.

John Deere and Company Trends 

Customers&#8217; demand for integration of technology into equipment is a market trend underlying John Deere&#8217;s Smart Industrial operating model and Leap Ambitions framework. Customers have sought to improve profitability, productivity, and sustainability through technology. John Deere&#8217;s approach to technology involves hardware and software, guidance, connectivity and digital solutions, automation and machine intelligence, autonomy, and electrification. This technology is incorporated into products within each of John Deere&#8217;s operating segments. Customers continue to adopt technology integrated in the John Deere portfolio of &#8220;smart&#8221; machines, systems, and solutions. The Company expects this trend to persist for the foreseeable future.

Demand for John Deere&#8217;s equipment remains strong, as order books are full through a majority of 2023. Agricultural fundamentals are expected to remain solid into 2023, and retail demand will comprise most of 2023 sales. John Deere expects dealer stock inventory replenishment to occur in 2024. The North American retail customer fleet age remains above average, and dealer inventories are historically low due to the manufacturing and supply chain constraints over the past few years. Crop prices remain favorable to John Deere customers in part due to low stock-to-use ratios for key grains and lower exports from the Black Sea region. John Deere expects to sell more large agricultural equipment in 2023 than 2022 in North America, Europe, and South America. Demand for small agricultural equipment remains stable, while turf and utility equipment product sales are expected to be lower due to the overall U.S. economic conditions. Construction equipment markets are forecasted to be steady. Rental fleets replenishment, the energy industry, and U.S. infrastructure spend will offset moderation in residential home construction. Roadbuilding demand remains strongest in the U.S., largely offset by softening demand in Europe and sluggish demand in Asia.

Strong retail demand of John Deere&#8217;s products in 2023 is favorably impacting forecasted financing volumes, benefiting net income for the Company. Net income for the Company in fiscal 2023 is expected to be slightly higher than fiscal 2022 due to income earned on a higher average portfolio, partially offset by less favorable financing spreads, lower gains on operating lease dispositions, and a higher provision for credit losses.

Additional Trends 

John Deere experienced supply chain disruptions in 2022. Supply chain disruptions impacted many aspects of John Deere&#8217;s business, including parts availability, increased production costs, and more partially completed machines in inventory. Additionally, past due deliveries from suppliers were at elevated levels. Late part deliveries required rework of partially built machines, contributing to production inefficiencies and higher overhead costs. John Deere implemented mitigation efforts to minimize the impact of supply chain disruptions on its ability to meet customer demand. While supply chain disruptions are expected to persist into 2023, John Deere is working diligently to secure the parts and components that customers need to deliver essential food and infrastructure more profitably and sustainably. As the Company&#8217;s volume of Receivables and Leases is largely dependent upon the level of retail sales and leases of John Deere products, supply chain disruptions could impact the Company&#8217;s future volumes. Despite supply chain challenges in 2022, the Company&#8217;s volumes were at historic levels, driven by strong John Deere equipment sales volume.

Interest rates rose in 2022 and further central bank policy interest rate increases are projected in 2023. Most of the Company&#8217;s Customer Receivables are fixed rate, while its wholesale receivables generally earn a floating rate. The Company has both fixed and floating rate borrowings. The Company manages the risk of interest rate fluctuations by balancing the types and amounts of its funding sources to its Receivable and Lease portfolios. Accordingly, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate exposure. The rising interest rate environment in 2022 increased the Company&#8217;s balance sheet derivative positions and generated income statement net gains on its non-designated derivatives (see Note 20). The Company expects to be able to pass the higher interest rates onto its retail and wholesale customers or receive increased compensation from John Deere for reduced or waived interest charges. Historically, rising interest rates impact the Company&#8217;s borrowings sooner than the benefit is realized from the Receivable and Lease portfolio. As a result, the Company&#8217;s financing spread was unfavorably impacted by $42.7 million (after-tax) in 2022 compared to 2021, which reflects spread compression primarily due to rising interest rates, partially offset by the non-designated derivative gains and lower depreciation rates of equipment on operating lease. If interest rates continue to rise, the Company expects to continue experiencing spread compression in 2023.

Inflation was a pervasive feature throughout 2022, and the Company expects inflation to continue in 2023. The Company&#8217;s estimation of credit losses may be negatively impacted in the event customers&#8217; operations are negatively impacted due to inflation or rising interest rates. As part of the process to establish the allowance for credit losses, the Company continues to monitor the economy, including potential impacts of inflation and rising interest rates, among other factors, and qualitative adjustments to the allowance are incorporated, as necessary. As of October 30, 2022, impacts of inflation and interest rates did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s allowance. 

Low dealer inventories, partially due to supply constraints, along with inflation have and may continue to contribute to higher prices on used equipment inventory. Higher used equipment prices have a favorable impact on the Company&#8217;s operating lease portfolio at lease maturity through lower return rates and higher disposition values on returned equipment. The Company reported net gains of $66.9 million in other income during 2022 on operating lease dispositions.

Supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, and rising interest rates are driven by factors outside of the Company&#8217;s control, and as a result, the Company cannot reasonably foresee when these conditions will subside.

For additional information regarding the impact of supply chain disruptions, including mitigation efforts to minimize the impact of potential supply chain disruptions on John Deere&#8217;s ability to meet customer demand, as well as inflationary pressures, refer to the &#8220;Trends and Economic Conditions&#8221; section in Item 7 of the Deere &#38; Company Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 30, 2022.

Items of Concern and Uncertainties 

Other items of concern include global and regional political conditions, economic and trade policies, imposition of new or retaliatory tariffs against certain countries or covering certain products, the ongoing effects of the pandemic, capital market disruptions, changes in demand and pricing for new and used equipment, significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, volatility in the prices of many commodities, and potential recession. These items could impact the Company&#8217;s results. John Deere and the Company are making investments in technology and in strengthening capabilities in digital, automation, autonomy, and electrification. As with most technology investments, marketplace adoption and monetization of these features holds an elevated level of uncertainty.

##TABLE_END Total revenues increased in 2022 primarily due to an average portfolio that was 7 percent higher, partially offset by lower average financing yields of 6.2 percent in 2022 compared to 6.5 percent in 2021. Net income in 2022 was lower than 2021 due to less favorable financing spreads, a higher provision for credit losses, higher selling, administrative, and general expenses, and unfavorable discrete income-tax adjustments. These factors were partially offset by income earned on a higher average portfolio.

##TABLE_END Finance income on retail notes and revolving charge accounts increased in 2022 due to higher average portfolio balances, partially offset by lower average financing rates. Finance income on wholesale receivables increased in 2022 primarily due to higher average financing rates, partially offset by a lower average portfolio. Lease revenues decreased primarily due to lower average financing rates and lower average portfolio balances.

Other income increased in 2022 primarily due to a gain on sale of property, higher interest income on cash and cash equivalents as a result of rising interest rates, and larger gains on operating lease dispositions. These increases were partially offset by lower freestanding credit enhancement recoveries in 2022.

Revenues earned from John Deere totaled $643.1 million in 2022, compared with $613.7 million in 2021. The increase was primarily the result of higher compensation paid by John Deere on wholesale receivables, driven by a higher interest rate environment. This compensation was partially offset by lower subsidies paid by John Deere related to operating leases. Revenues earned from John Deere are included in each of the revenue amounts discussed above.

##TABLE_END The increase in interest expense in 2022 was driven by higher average borrowings and higher average borrowing rates, offset in part by gains on non-designated derivatives.

The depreciation of equipment on operating leases decreased during 2022, primarily due to updated depreciation estimates as a result of improving conditions in the agriculture and construction markets, in addition to lower average balances of equipment on operating leases.

Administrative and operating expenses increased during 2022 primarily due to foreign currency exchange net losses and increases in other general operating expenses.

Fees and interest paid to John Deere increased in 2022 primarily due to higher interest on intercompany borrowings from John Deere driven by higher average borrowing rates, in addition to the remittance of gains on non-designated derivatives that were subsequently assumed by Deere &#38; Company (see Note 7).

The provision for credit losses increased in 2022 compared to 2021, driven by favorable adjustments to the allowance for credit losses in 2021, which did not recur in the current year, in addition to lower net recoveries on revolving charge accounts in 2022.

The higher provision for income taxes in 2022 was primarily related to favorable discrete income-tax adjustments in 2021. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

##TABLE_END Receivables 30 days or more past due continue to accrue finance income. The Company ceases to accrue finance income once Receivables are considered non-performing. An allowance for credit losses is recorded for the estimated credit losses expected over the life of the Receivable portfolio. The Company measures expected credit losses on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Risk characteristics considered by the Company include product category, market, geography, credit risk, and remaining duration. Receivables that do not share risk characteristics with other receivables in the portfolio are evaluated on an individual basis. Non-performing Receivables are included in the estimate of expected credit losses. While the Company believes its allowance is sufficient to provide for losses over the life of its existing Receivable portfolio, different assumptions or changes in economic conditions would result in changes to the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses. See Note 4 for additional information related to the allowance for credit losses.

Deposits held from dealers and merchants amounted to $137.3 million at October 30, 2022, compared with $131.8 million at October 31, 2021. These balances primarily represent the aggregate dealer retail note and lease withholding accounts from individual John Deere dealers to which losses from retail notes and leases originating from the respective dealers can be charged. Recoveries from dealer deposits are recognized in other income when the dealer&#8217;s withholding account is charged. Recoveries from dealer deposits and other freestanding credit enhancements recorded in other income in 2022 and 2021 were $8.5 million and $14.3 million, respectively.

2021 Compared with 2020 

The comparison of the 2021 results with 2020 can be found under the heading &#8220;2021 Compared with 2020&#8221; in the &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; section of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2021 .

Capital Resources and Liquidity 

Sources of Liquidity, Key Metrics, and Balance Sheet Data 

The Company relies on its ability to raise substantial amounts of funds to finance its Receivable and Lease portfolios. The Company has access to most global markets at a reasonable cost. The Company&#8217;s ability to meet its debt obligations is supported in several ways. The assets of the Company are self-liquidating in nature. A solid equity position is available to absorb unusual losses on these assets and all commercial paper is backed by unsecured, committed borrowing lines from various banks. Liquidity is also provided by the Company&#8217;s ability to securitize these assets and through the issuance of term debt in both public and private markets. Additionally, liquidity may be provided through loans from John Deere. The Company closely monitors its liquidity sources against the cash requirements and expects to have sufficient sources of global funding and liquidity to meet its funding needs in the short-term (next 12 months) and long-term (beyond 12 months).

Key metrics and certain balance sheet data are provided in the following table as of October 30, 2022, October 31, 2021, and November 1, 2020, in millions of dollars:

##TABLE_END &#8203; 

Net cash used by investing activities increased during 2022 primarily due to growth in the Receivable portfolio, which was funded primarily through external borrowings and cash provided by operating activities.

&#8203; 

Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities Held by Foreign Subsidiaries 

The amount of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $217.2 million and $158.0 million at October 30, 2022 and October 31, 2021, respectively.

Borrowings 

Total borrowings increased $4,536.2 million in 2022, corresponding with the level of the Receivable and Lease portfolios. During 2022, the Company issued $9,255.3 million and retired $5,754.4 million of long-term external borrowings, which primarily consisted of medium-term notes. During 2022, the Company also issued $4,084.5 million and retired $2,964.8 million of retail note securitization borrowings and maintained an average commercial paper balance of $2,364.0 million. The Company&#8217;s funding profile may be altered to reflect such factors as relative costs of funding sources, assets available for securitizations, and capital market accessibility.

The Company has a revolving warehouse facility to utilize bank conduit facilities to securitize retail notes (see Note 5). At October 30, 2022, the revolving credit agreement had a total capacity, or &#8220;financing limit,&#8221; of $1,000.0 million of secured financings at any time. $948.2 million of short-term securitization borrowings were outstanding under the agreement at October 30, 2022. At the end of the contractual revolving period, unless the banks and the Company agree to renew, the Company would liquidate the secured borrowings over time as payments on the retail notes are collected. The agreement was renewed in November 2022 with an expiration in November 2023 and a capacity of $1,500.0 million.

Dividends 

Capital Corporation declared and paid cash dividends to JDFS of $370.0 million in 2022 and $485.0 million in 2021. In turn, JDFS paid comparable dividends to Deere &#38; Company.

Lines of Credit 

The Company has access to bank lines of credit with various banks throughout the world. Some of the lines are available to both the Company and Deere &#38; Company. Worldwide lines of credit totaled $8,089.2 million at October 30, 2022, $3,283.9 million of which were unused. For the purpose of computing the unused credit lines, commercial paper and short-term bank borrowings of the Company and John Deere, excluding secured borrowings and the current portion of long-term external borrowings, were considered to constitute utilization. See Note 8 for more information.

Debt Ratings 

The Company&#8217;s ability to obtain funding is affected by its debt ratings, which are closely related to the outlook for and the financial condition of John Deere, and the nature and availability of support facilities, such as the Company&#8217;s lines of credit and the support agreement from Deere &#38; Company.

To access public debt capital markets, the Company relies on credit rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings to the Company&#8217;s securities as an indicator of credit quality for fixed income investors. A security rating is not a recommendation by the rating agency to buy, sell, or hold the Company&#8217;s securities. A credit rating agency may change or withdraw Company ratings based on its assessment of the Company&#8217;s current and future ability to meet interest and principal repayment obligations. Each agency&#8217;s rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs, including costs of derivative transactions, and reduced access to debt capital markets.

The senior long-term and short-term debt ratings and outlook currently assigned to unsecured Company debt securities by the rating agencies engaged by the Company are the same as those for John Deere and are as follows:

Contractual Obligations and Cash Requirements 

The Company&#8217;s material cash requirements from contractual and other cash obligations relate to borrowings, including securitization borrowings. As of October 30, 2022, the Company had $15,814.4 million of principal payments on borrowings and securitization borrowings payable in the next 12 months, along with interest payments of $1,008.4 million. The securitization borrowing payments are based on the expected liquidation of the related retail notes securitized. The Company&#8217;s borrowings will likely be replaced with new borrowings to finance the Receivables and Leases portfolio. See Notes 5, 7, and 9 for further detail regarding future contractual payments on securitization borrowings, intercompany borrowings, and long-term external borrowings.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant effect on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies below are those management believes are the most critical to the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. The Company&#8217;s other accounting policies are described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of the Company&#8217;s Receivable portfolio. The allowance is measured on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Risk characteristics considered by the Company include product category, market, geography, credit risk, and remaining duration. Receivables that do not share risk characteristics with other receivables in the portfolio are evaluated on an individual basis. Non-performing Receivables are included in the estimate of expected credit losses.

The Company utilizes loss forecast models, which are selected based on the size and credit risk of the underlying pool of receivables, to estimate expected credit losses. Transition matrix models are used for large and complex Customer Receivable pools, while weighted-average remaining maturity models are used for smaller and less complex Customer Receivable pools. Expected credit losses on wholesale receivables are based on historical loss rates, with consideration of current economic conditions and dealer financial risk. The modeled expected credit losses are adjusted based on reasonable and supportable forecasts, which may include economic indicators such as commodity prices, industry equipment sales, unemployment rates, and housing starts. Management reviews each model&#8217;s output quarterly, and qualitative adjustments are incorporated as necessary. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

In 2021, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13, which revised the measurement of credit losses from an incurred loss to an expected loss methodology. Upon adoption, the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses increased $19.7 million with an offset to retained earnings. The allowance for credit losses at November 1, 2020 was not restated under the expected loss methodology. The total allowance for credit losses at October 30, 2022, October 31, 2021, and November 1, 2020 was $128.4 million, $129.0 million, and $129.1 million, respectively. The allowance decreased slightly in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to continued positive agricultural market conditions, which are having favorable impacts on the allowance and are offsetting increases due to higher portfolio balances. Strong recovery rates, driven by higher prices on used equipment inventory, are also benefiting the allowance for credit losses (see Note 4). The allowance decreased in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to lower expected losses in the construction and forestry market, continued improvement in the agriculture and turf market, and better than expected performance of accounts granted payment relief due to the economic effects of COVID. These decreases in 2021 were largely offset by the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13, as previously mentioned.

The assumptions used in evaluating the Company&#8217;s exposure to credit losses involve estimates and significant judgment. While the Company believes its allowance is sufficient to provide for losses over the life of its existing Receivables portfolio, different assumptions or changes in economic conditions would result in changes to the allowance for credit losses. Historically, changes in economic conditions have had limited impact on credit losses within the Company&#8217;s wholesale receivable portfolio. Within the Customer Receivables portfolio, credit loss estimates are dependent on a number of factors, including historical portfolio performance, current delinquency levels, and estimated recoveries 

on defaulted accounts. The Company&#8217;s transition matrix models, which are utilized to estimate credit losses for more than 90 percent of Customer Receivables, use historical portfolio performance and current delinquency levels to forecast future defaults. Estimated recovery rates are applied to the estimated default balance to calculate the expected credit losses. Holding all other factors constant, a 10 percent increase in the transition matrix models&#8217; forecasted defaults as a result of elevated levels of delinquencies, deteriorating roll rates, or otherwise, and a simultaneous 10 percent decrease in recovery rates would have resulted in an increase to the allowance for credit losses of approximately $30 million at October 30, 2022.

Operating Lease Residual Values 

The carrying value of equipment on operating leases is affected by the estimated fair values of the equipment at the end of the lease (residual values). Upon termination of the lease, the equipment is either purchased by the lessee or sold to a third party, in which case the Company may record a gain or a loss for the difference between the estimated residual value and the sale price. The Company estimates residual values at the inception of the lease based on several factors, including lease term, expected hours of usage, historical wholesale sale prices, return experience, intended use of the equipment, market dynamics and trends, and third-party residual guarantees. The Company reviews residual value estimates during the lease term and tests the carrying value of its operating lease assets for impairment when events or circumstances necessitate. Changes in residual value assumptions would affect the amount of depreciation expense and the amount of investment in equipment on operating leases. Depreciation is adjusted prospectively on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term if residual value estimates are revised. The total operating lease residual values at October 30, 2022, October 31, 2021, and November 1, 2020 were $3,366.7 million, $3,547.6 million, and $3,826.3 million, respectively. The decreases in 2022 and 2021 were primarily due to a lower operating lease portfolio.

Estimates used in determining end-of-lease market values for equipment on operating leases significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense. Hypothetically, if future market values for this equipment were to decrease 10 percent from the Company&#8217;s present estimates and all the equipment on operating leases were returned to the Company for remarketing at the end of the lease term, the total impact would be to increase the Company&#8217;s annual depreciation for equipment on operating leases by approximately $40 million, after consideration of dealer residual value guarantees. 

Forward-Looking Statements 

Certain statements contained herein, including in the section entitled &#8220;Overview&#8221; relating to future events, expectations, and trends constitute &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve factors that are subject to change, assumptions, risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.

Forward-looking statements are based on currently available information and current assumptions, expectations, and projections about future events and should not be relied upon. Further information concerning the Company and its business, including factors that could materially affect the Company&#8217;s financial results, is included in the Company&#8217;s other filings with the SEC (including, but not limited to, the factors discussed in Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q).

The Company&#8217;s business is closely related to John Deere&#8217;s business. Further information, including factors that could materially affect the Company&#8217;s and John Deere&#8217;s financial results, is included in the Deere &#38; Company Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 30, 2022 (including, but not limited to, the factors discussed in Item 1A., &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of the Annual Report on Form 10-K) and other Deere &#38; Company and Capital Corporation filings with the SEC.

In addition, the Company&#8217;s business and its results are affected by general global macroeconomic conditions, including but not limited to inflation, slower growth or recession, higher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, which could adversely affect the U.S. dollar and customer confidence, customer access to capital, and overall demand for John Deere products, credit application volumes, financing and repayment practices, and the number of and size of customer delinquencies and defaults, which could materially impact the Company&#8217;s write-offs and provision for credit losses; government spending and taxing; actions of banks, financing and leasing companies, and other lenders that compete with the Company for customers; changes in weather and climate patterns; the political and social stability of the markets in 

which the Company operates; the effects of, or response to, wars and other conflicts, including the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine; natural disasters; and the spread of major epidemics or pandemics (including the COVID pandemic).

The liquidity and ongoing profitability of the Company depend on timely access to capital to meet future cash flow requirements, and to fund operations, costs, and finance customer purchases of John Deere products. If general economic conditions deteriorate further or capital markets become more volatile, funding could be unavailable or insufficient. Significant changes in market liquidity conditions, changes in the Company&#8217;s credit ratings, and any failure to comply with financial covenants in credit agreements could also impact the Company&#8217;s access to or terms of future funding, which could reduce the Company&#8217;s earnings and cash flows. A debt crisis in Europe (including the recent volatility of the United Kingdom&#8217;s bond market), Latin America, or elsewhere could negatively impact currencies, global financial markets, funding sources and costs, asset and obligation values, customers, demand for John Deere equipment, and Company operations and results. The Company&#8217;s operations could be impaired by changes in the equity, bond, and other financial markets, which would negatively affect earnings.

Additional factors that could materially affect the Company&#8217;s operations, financial condition, and results include changes in governmental trade, banking, monetary, and fiscal policies, including financial regulatory reform and its effects on the consumer finance industry, derivatives, funding costs, governmental programs, and policies and tariffs for the benefit of certain industries or sectors; actions by central banks and by financial and securities regulators, including increases to benchmark interest rates, which may affect the costs and expenses of financing the Company and the financing rates it is able to offer; actions by environmental, health, and safety regulatory agencies, including those related to the effects of climate change; changes to accounting standards; changes to and compliance with privacy, banking, and other regulations; changes to and compliance with economic sanctions and export controls laws and regulations (including those in place for Russia); and compliance with evolving U.S. and foreign laws when expanding to new markets and otherwise. 

Other factors that could materially affect the Company&#8217;s results and operations include security breaches, cybersecurity attacks, technology failures, and other disruptions to the information technology infrastructure of the Company and John Deere dealers; events that damage the Company&#8217;s reputation or brand; significant investigations, claims, lawsuits, or other legal proceedings; the success or failure of new product initiatives or business strategies; changes in product preferences and take rates of products; oil and energy prices, supplies, and volatility; customer profitability; housing starts and supply; the levels of public and non-residential construction; infrastructure investment; real estate values; consumable input costs; demand for agricultural products; world grain stocks; soil conditions; harvest yields; prices for commodities and livestock; availability and cost of fertilizer; availability of transport for crops; the growth and sustainability of non-food uses for some crops (including ethanol and biodiesel production); availability of technological innovations; John Deere dealers&#8217; ability to support and service precision technology solutions; available acreage for farming; changes in government farm programs and policies; changes in and effects of crop insurance programs; changes in environmental regulations and their impact on farming practices; animal diseases and their effects on poultry, beef, and pork consumption and prices on livestock feed demand; crop pests and diseases; actions of competitors; changes in demand and pricing for used equipment and resulting impacts on lease residual values; labor relations and contracts, including work stoppages and other disruptions; and changes in the ability to attract, develop, engage, and retain qualified personnel.
