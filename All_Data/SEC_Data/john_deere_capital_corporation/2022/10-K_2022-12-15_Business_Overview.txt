The Company 

John Deere Capital Corporation (Capital Corporation) and its subsidiaries are collectively called the Company. John Deere Financial Services, Inc. (JDFS), a wholly-owned finance holding subsidiary of Deere &#38; Company, owns all of the outstanding common stock of Capital Corporation. See &#8220;Relationships of the Company with John Deere&#8221; for additional information regarding agreements between the Company and Deere &#38; Company. The Company conducts business in Australia, New Zealand, the United States (U.S.), and in several countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America, including Argentina and Mexico. Capital Corporation was incorporated under the laws of Delaware and commenced operations in 1958.

The Company provides and administers financing for retail purchases of new equipment manufactured by Deere &#38; Company&#8217;s production and precision agriculture operations, small agriculture and turf operations, and construction and forestry operations and used equipment taken in trade for this equipment. References to &#8220;agriculture and turf&#8221; include both production and precision agriculture and small agriculture and turf. The Company generally purchases retail installment sales and loan contracts (retail notes) from Deere &#38; Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively called John Deere). John Deere generally acquires these retail notes through independent John Deere retail dealers. The Company also purchases and finances a limited amount of non-John Deere retail notes. In addition, the Company finances and services revolving charge accounts, in most cases acquired from and offered through merchants in the agriculture and turf, and construction and forestry markets (revolving charge accounts). The Company also provides wholesale financing to dealers of John Deere agriculture and turf equipment, and construction and forestry equipment, primarily to finance inventories of equipment for those dealers (wholesale receivables). Further, the Company leases John Deere equipment and a limited amount of non-John Deere equipment to retail customers (financing and operating leases). The Company also offers credit enhanced international export financing to select customers and dealers, which primarily involves John Deere products. Retail notes, revolving charge accounts, and financing leases are collectively called &#8220;Customer Receivables.&#8221; Customer Receivables and wholesale receivables are collectively called &#8220;Receivables.&#8221; Receivables and equipment on operating leases are collectively called &#8220;Receivables and Leases.&#8221; The Company generally secures its Receivables, other than certain revolving charge accounts, by retaining as collateral security in the goods associated with those Receivables or with the use of other collateral.

Business of John Deere 

John Deere&#8217;s operations are categorized into four business segments:

The production and precision agriculture segment defines, develops, and delivers global equipment and technology solutions to unlock customer value for production-scale growers of large grains, small grains, cotton, and 

sugarcane. The segment&#8217;s main products include large and certain mid-size tractors, combines, cotton pickers, sugarcane harvesters and loaders, and soil preparation, seeding, application, and crop care equipment. 

The small agriculture and turf segment defines, develops, and delivers global equipment and technology solutions to unlock customer value for dairy and livestock producers, high-value crop producers, and turf and utility customers. The segment&#8217;s primary products include certain mid-size and small tractors, as well as hay and forage equipment, riding and commercial lawn equipment, golf course equipment, and utility vehicles.

The construction and forestry segment defines, develops, and delivers a broad range of machines and technology solutions to unlock customer value on job sites, including earthmoving, forestry, and roadbuilding production systems. The segment&#8217;s primary products include crawler dozers and loaders, four-wheel-drive loaders, excavators, skid-steer loaders, milling machines, and log harvesters. 

The products and services produced by the segments above are marketed primarily through independent retail dealer networks and major retail outlets and, as it relates to roadbuilding products in certain markets outside the U.S. and Canada, primarily through John Deere-owned sales and service subsidiaries.

The financial services segment includes the operations of the Company (described herein), and additional operations in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, China, India, Russia, and Thailand. John Deere suspended shipments to Russia on February 24, 2022 and no new financing has been offered. The segment primarily finances sales and leases by John Deere dealers of new and used production and precision agriculture, small agriculture and turf, and construction and forestry equipment. In addition, the financial services segment provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment, finances retail revolving charge accounts, and offers extended equipment warranties.

John Deere&#8217;s worldwide production and precision agriculture operations, small agriculture and turf operations, and construction and forestry operations are sometimes collectively referred to as the &#8220;equipment operations.&#8221; The financial services segment is sometimes referred to as the &#8220;financial services operations.&#8221; Receivables and Leases managed by the Company are evaluated by market (agriculture and turf or construction and forestry). 

For fiscal 2022, worldwide net income attributable to Deere &#38; Company was $7.131 billion, or $23.28 per share, compared with $5.963 billion, or $18.99 per share, in fiscal 2021.

Deere &#38; Company&#8217;s consolidated net sales and revenues increased 19 percent to $52.577 billion in 2022, compared with $44.024 billion in 2021. Net sales of the equipment operations increased in fiscal 2022 to $47.917 billion, compared with $39.737 billion last year, due to higher shipment volumes and price realization, partially offset by the negative effects of currency translation.

The financial services operations reported net income of $880 million for fiscal 2022 compared with $881 million in fiscal 2021. Net income in 2022 was roughly the same mainly due to income earned on a higher average portfolio, partially offset by less favorable financing spreads and unfavorable discrete income tax adjustments. In addition, financial services&#8217; provision for credit losses increased in 2022, primarily due to economic uncertainty in Russia. The financial services operations received an intercompany benefit from the equipment operations, as the equipment operations guarantees financial services&#8217; investments in certain international markets, including Russia.

Smart Industrial Operating Model and Leap Ambitions 

In fiscal year 2020, John Deere began implementing the Smart Industrial operating model. The Smart Industrial operating model is focused on making significant investments in strengthening John Deere&#8217;s capabilities in digital, automation, autonomy, and alternative propulsion technologies. These technologies are intended to increase worksite efficiency, improve yields, lower input costs, and ease labor constraints. Building upon the Smart Industrial operating model, John Deere announced its Leap Ambitions framework in fiscal year 2022. The Leap Ambitions are goals that measure John Deere&#8217;s Smart Industrial operating model and are designed to boost economic value and sustainability for John Deere&#8217;s customers. As an enabling business, the Company is fully integrated with John Deere&#8217;s Smart Industrial operating model and is focused on providing financial solutions to help John Deere achieve its Leap Ambitions. For additional information regarding John Deere&#8217;s Smart Industrial operating model and Leap Ambitions, refer to the &#8220;Smart 

Industrial Operating Model and Leap Ambitions&#8221; section in Item 1 of the Deere &#38; Company Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 30, 2022.

Market Conditions 

Agriculture and Turf. Industry sales of large agricultural machinery in the U.S. and Canada are forecasted to increase 5 to 10 percent compared to 2022. Industry sales of small agricultural and turf equipment in the U.S. and Canada are expected to be flat to down 5 percent in 2023. Industry sales of agricultural machinery in Europe are forecasted to be flat to up 5 percent, while South American industry sales of tractors and combines are forecasted to be flat to up 5 percent in 2023. Asia industry sales are forecasted to be down moderately in 2023 as the demand in India, the world&#8217;s largest tractor market by unit, stabilizes.

Construction and Forestry. On an industry basis, North American construction equipment and compact construction equipment sales are each expected to be flat to up 5 percent in 2023. Global forestry and global roadbuilding industry sales are each expected to be flat.

Financial Services, including the Company. Results for the full-year fiscal 2023 are expected to be slightly higher due to income earned on a higher average portfolio, partially offset by less favorable financing spreads and lower gains on operating lease dispositions. Excluding financial services&#8217; portfolio in Russia, a higher provision for credit losses is forecasted in 2023.

Relationships of the Company with John Deere 

The results of operations of the Company are affected by its relationships with John Deere, including, among other items, the terms on which the Company acquires Receivables and borrows funds from John Deere, the reimbursement for interest waiver and low-rate finance programs from John Deere, the compensation paid by John Deere in connection with the Company&#8217;s purchase of trade receivables from John Deere, and the payment to John Deere for various expenses applicable to the Company&#8217;s operations. In addition, John Deere and the Company have joint access to certain lines of credit.

The Company&#8217;s volume of Receivables and Leases is largely dependent upon the level of retail sales and leases of John Deere products. The level of John Deere retail sales and leases is responsive to a variety of economic, financial, geopolitical, climatic, legislative, and other factors that influence supply and demand for its products. The majority of the Company&#8217;s businesses are affected by changes in interest rates, demand for credit, and competition.

The Company bears substantially all of the credit risk (net of recovery from withholdings from certain John Deere dealers and merchants) associated with its holding of Receivables and Leases. A small portion of the Receivables and Leases held (less than 5 percent) is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of Deere &#38; Company. The Company also performs substantially all servicing and collection functions. Servicing and collection functions for a small portion of the Receivables and Leases held (less than 5 percent) are provided by John Deere. John Deere is reimbursed for staff and other administrative services at estimated cost and for credit lines provided to the Company based on utilization of those lines.

The terms and the basis on which the Company acquires retail notes and certain wholesale receivables from John Deere are governed by agreements with John Deere, generally terminable by either John Deere or the Company on 30 days&#8217; notice. As provided in these agreements, the Company agrees to the terms and conditions for purchasing the retail notes and wholesale receivables from John Deere. Under these agreements, John Deere is not obligated to sell notes to the Company, and the Company is obligated to purchase notes from John Deere only if the notes comply with the terms and conditions set by the Company.

The basis on which John Deere acquires retail notes and wholesale receivables from John Deere dealers is governed by agreements with those dealers, which may be terminated in accordance with their terms and applicable law. In acquiring these notes from dealers, the terms and conditions, as set forth in agreements with the dealers, conform with the terms and conditions adopted by the Company in determining the acceptability of retail and certain wholesale notes to be purchased from John Deere. The dealers are not obligated to sell these notes to John Deere and John Deere is not obligated to accept these notes from the dealers. In practice, retail and wholesale notes are acquired from dealers only if the terms of these notes and the creditworthiness of the customers are acceptable to the Company. The Company acts on 

behalf of both itself and John Deere in determining the acceptability of the notes and in acquiring acceptable notes from dealers.

The basis on which the Company enters into leases with retail customers through John Deere dealers is governed by agreements between those dealers and the Company. Leases are accepted based on the terms and conditions, the lessees&#8217; creditworthiness, the anticipated residual values of the equipment, and the intended use of the equipment.

Deere &#38; Company has an agreement with Capital Corporation pursuant to which it has agreed to continue to own, directly or through one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries, at least 51 percent of the voting shares of capital stock of Capital Corporation and to maintain the Company&#8217;s consolidated tangible net worth at not less than $50.0 million. This agreement also obligates Deere &#38; Company to make payments to Capital Corporation such that its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges is not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter. Deere &#38; Company&#8217;s obligations to make payments to Capital Corporation under the agreement are independent of whether the Company is in default on its indebtedness, obligations, or other liabilities. Further, Deere &#38; Company&#8217;s obligations under the agreement are not measured by the amount of the Company&#8217;s indebtedness, obligations, or other liabilities. Deere &#38; Company&#8217;s obligations to make payments under this agreement are expressly stated not to be a guarantee of any specific indebtedness, obligation, or liability of the Company and are enforceable only by or in the name of Capital Corporation. No payments were required under this agreement during the periods included in the consolidated financial statements. At October 30, 2022, Deere &#38; Company indirectly owned 100 percent of the voting shares of Capital Corporation&#8217;s capital stock and Capital Corporation&#8217;s consolidated tangible net worth was $4,803.4 million.

The Company purchases certain wholesale trade receivables from John Deere. These trade receivables arise from John Deere&#8217;s sales of goods to independent dealers. Under the terms of the sales to dealers, interest is primarily charged to dealers on outstanding balances from the earlier of the date when goods are sold to retail customers by the dealer or the expiration of certain interest-free periods granted at the time of the sale to the dealer, until payment is received by the Company. Dealers cannot cancel purchases after John Deere recognizes a sale and are responsible for payment even if the equipment is not sold to retail customers. The interest-free periods are determined based on the type of equipment sold and the time of year of the sale. These periods range from one to twelve months for most equipment. Interest-free periods may not be extended. Interest charged may not be forgiven and the past due interest rates exceed market rates. The Company receives compensation from John Deere at approximate market interest rates for these interest-free periods. The Company computes the compensation from John Deere for interest-free periods based on the Company&#8217;s estimated funding costs, administrative and operating expenses, credit losses, and required return on equity.

A portion of finance income earned by the Company arises from financing of retail sales of John Deere equipment on which finance charges are waived or reduced by John Deere for a period from the date of the retail sale to a specified subsequent date. The Company receives compensation from John Deere equal to competitive market interest rates for periods during which finance charges have been waived or reduced. The Company computes the compensation from John Deere for waived or reduced finance charges based on the Company&#8217;s estimated funding costs, administrative and operating expenses, credit losses, and required return on equity. The financing rate following the waiver or interest reduction period is not significantly different from the compensation rate from John Deere.

Description of Receivables and Leases 

Receivables and Leases arise mainly from retail and wholesale sales and leases of John Deere products and used equipment accepted in trade for them, and from retail sales of equipment of unrelated manufacturers. Receivables and Leases also include revolving charge accounts receivable. At October 30, 2022 and October 31, 2021, at least 90 percent of the Receivables and Leases administered by the Company were for financing that facilitated the purchase or lease of John Deere products.

John Deere Financial, f.s.b. (Thrift) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Capital Corporation. It holds a federal thrift charter and is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The U.S. Federal Reserve Board has oversight of the Company, as the owner of the Thrift. The Thrift is headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin and offers revolving charge products including John Deere Financial Multi-Use Account, PowerPlan &#226; , and John Deere Financial Revolving Plan throughout the U.S. The John Deere Financial Multi-Use Account is used by farmers and ranchers to finance their purchases of production inputs from agribusiness merchants, including seed, fertilizer, and crop protection. 

The John Deere Financial Multi-Use Account is also used by agriculture and turf customers to finance the purchase of parts and service from John Deere dealers. PowerPlan &#226; is primarily used by construction and forestry customers to finance the purchase of equipment parts, equipment rentals, and service work performed at John Deere construction and forestry dealers. The John Deere Financial Revolving Plan is used primarily by retail customers of John Deere dealers to finance purchases of turf and utility equipment. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under &#8220;Revolving Charge Accounts Receivable.&#8221;

The Company provides wholesale financing to John Deere dealers, primarily to finance agriculture and turf and construction and forestry equipment inventories. A large portion of the wholesale financing is provided by the Company to dealers from whom it also purchases agriculture and turf and construction and forestry retail notes. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under &#8220;Wholesale Receivables.&#8221;

The Company generally requires that theft and physical damage insurance be carried on all goods leased or securing retail notes and wholesale receivables. In certain markets, the customer may, at the customer&#8217;s own expense, have the Company or the seller of the goods purchase this insurance or obtain it from other sources. Insurance is not required for goods purchased under revolving charge accounts.

Receivables and Leases are eligible for acceptance if they conform to prescribed finance and lease plan terms. Guidelines relating to down payments and contract terms on retail notes and leases are described in Note 3 and Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In limited circumstances, Receivables and Leases may be accepted even though they do not conform in all respects to the established guidelines. The Company determines whether Receivables and Leases should be accepted and how they should be serviced. Acceptance of these Receivables and Leases is dependent on having one or more risk mitigation enhancements that may include larger down payments or advance lease payments, additional co-borrowers or guarantors, the pledge of additional collateral as security, the assignment of specific earnings to the Company, or the acceptance of accelerated payment schedules. Officers of the Company are responsible for establishing policies and reviewing the performance of the Company in accepting and collecting Receivables and Leases. The Company performs substantially all of its own routine collections, settlements, and repossessions on Receivables and Leases.

John Deere retail notes and wholesale receivables are generally supported by perfected security interests in goods financed under laws such as the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), certain federal statutes, and state motor vehicle laws in the U.S. and by security in goods or other security under applicable laws in other countries and jurisdictions. UCC financing statements are also prepared and filed on leases; however, these filings for operating leases are made for informational purposes only.

Finance Rates on Retail Notes 

As of October 30, 2022 and October 31, 2021, over 95 percent of the retail notes held by the Company bore a fixed finance rate. A portion of the finance income earned by the Company arises from reimbursements from John Deere in connection with financing the retail sales of John Deere equipment on which finance charges are waived or reduced by John Deere for a period from the date of sale to a specified subsequent date. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Average Original Term and Average Actual Life of Retail Notes and Leases 

Due to prepayments (often from trade-ins and refinancing), the average actual life of retail notes and leases is considerably shorter than the average original term. The following table shows the average original term for retail notes 

and leases acquired during the year and the average actual life for retail notes and leases liquidated during the year (in months):

##TABLE_END Allowance for Credit Losses 

Receivables 30 days or more past due continue to accrue finance income. The Company ceases to accrue finance income once Receivables are considered non-performing. An allowance for credit losses is recorded for the estimated credit losses expected over the life of the Receivable portfolio. The Company measures expected credit losses on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Risk characteristics considered by the Company include product category, market, geography, credit risk, and remaining duration. Receivables that do not share risk characteristics with other receivables in the portfolio are evaluated on an individual basis. Non-performing Receivables are included in the 

estimate of expected credit losses. See Note 4 for additional information related to the allowance for credit losses.

The total allowance for credit losses, by product, at October 30, 2022 and October 31, 2021 (in millions of dollars), and the portfolio, by product, as a percent of total portfolio are presented below:

##TABLE_END &#8203; 

The Receivables portfolio continued to perform strongly in 2022 as evidenced by the 30 days or more past due and non-performing Receivables as a percentage of the total Receivables portfolio. The allowance for credit losses as a percent of total portfolio was favorable in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to continued positive agricultural market conditions. In addition, strong recovery rates, driven by higher prices on used equipment inventory, also benefited the allowance for credit losses.

&#8203; 

Competition 

The businesses in which the Company is engaged are highly competitive. The Company primarily competes for customers with commercial banks and finance and leasing companies based upon its service, finance rates charged, and other finance terms. In addition, the competitive landscape is evolving as technology is unlocking new capabilities for traditional competitors and enabling new digital entrants that could be either technology partners or potential competitors. The proportion of John Deere equipment retail sales and leases financed by the Company is influenced by conditions prevailing in the agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment markets, in the financial markets, and in business generally. The Company financed a significant portion of John Deere equipment retail sales and leases in many of the countries in which the Company operated during 2022 and 2021.

The Company emphasizes convenient service to customers and endeavors to offer terms desired in its specialized markets, such as seasonal schedules of repayment and rentals. The Company&#8217;s retail finance rates and lease rates are generally believed to be in the range offered by other sales finance and leasing companies, although not as low as those of some banks and other lenders and lessors.

Regulation 

In several U.S. states, state law limits the maximum finance rate on receivables. The present state limitations have not significantly limited variable-rate finance charges or the fixed-rate finance charges established by the Company. However, if interest rate levels should increase significantly, maximum state rates could affect the Company by preventing the variable rates on outstanding variable-rate retail notes from increasing above the maximum state rate and by limiting the fixed rates on new notes. In some states, the Company may be able to qualify new retail notes for a higher maximum rate limit by using retail installment sales contracts (rather than loan contracts) or by using fixed-rate rather than variable-rate contracts.

In addition to rate regulation, various U.S. state and federal laws and regulations apply to some Receivables and Leases, principally retail notes for goods sold for personal, family, or household use and John Deere Financial Revolving Plan, John Deere Financial Multi-Use Account, and PowerPlan &#226; products and receivables. To date, these laws and regulations have not had a significant adverse effect on the Company.

The Thrift holds a federal thrift charter and is subject to regulation and examination by the OCC. The U.S. Federal Reserve Board has oversight of the Company, as the owner of the Thrift.

The manner in which the Company offers financing outside the U.S. is affected by a variety of country specific laws, regulations, and customs, including those governing property rights and debtor obligations, which are subject to change and that may introduce greater risk to the Company.

In fiscal year 2022, compliance with the regulations applicable to the Company did not have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. The Company does not expect to incur material capital expenditures related to compliance with regulations during fiscal year 2023. Additional information about the impact of government regulations on the Company&#8217;s business is included in Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; under the headings &#8220;Strategic Risks&#8221; and &#8220;Legal and Compliance Risks.&#8221;

Human Capital 

Higher Purpose 

The Company&#8217;s employees, its human capital, are guided by John Deere&#8217;s higher purpose: We run so life can leap forward. Employees are further guided by John Deere&#8217;s Code of Business Conduct (Code), which helps them to uphold and strengthen the standards of honor and integrity that have defined John Deere since its founding. Our world and business may change, but our core values&#8212;integrity, quality, commitment and innovation&#8212;remain constant in everything we do. Our values have shaped and guided John Deere&#8217;s vision since 1837.

Employees 

At October 30, 2022, the Company had 1,488 full-time and part-time employees. The Company also retains consultants, independent contractors, and temporary workers.

Code of Business Conduct 

John Deere and the Company are committed to conducting business in accordance with the highest ethical standards. This means how we conduct ourselves and our global work is more than just a matter of policy and law; it reflects our core values. The Code provides specific guidance to all John Deere employees, outlining how they can and must uphold and strengthen the integrity that has defined John Deere since its founding. The Company&#8217;s policy requires all employees to complete Code training and, where permitted by law, also requires the employees to certify each year that they will comply with the Code. The Company maintains a global compliance hotline to allow for concerns to be brought forward.

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) 

The Company believes that a diverse workforce is essential to its long-term success and it strives to foster a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture where all voices are heard, valued, and included. The Company embraces employees&#8217; differences in race, color, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or expression, marital or partnership status, family status, citizenship, genetic information, national origin, ancestry, geographic background, military or veteran status, disability (mental or physical), and any other characteristics that make our employees unique. 

The Company&#8217;s global DEI strategy focuses on embedding DEI into world-wide business operations and people processes. The Company believes that sustainable DEI requires rigor and long-term investment to realize lasting benefits to the business. The Company&#8217;s DEI strategic framework consists of four DEI pillars that reflect our areas of focus&#8212;people, leadership, business strategy, and community. 

The Company&#8217;s leadership team works to set a consistent and transparent tone on DEI issues and strategy. The Company creates spaces for open conversations and learning through its DEI speaker series, micro-learnings, and online forum panel series, &#8216;Let&#8217;s Talk Series&#8217;. Additionally, the Company works to provide immersive learning experiences to improve workplace equity and inclusion. DEI expectations are integrated into the Company&#8217;s global performance management program. To help managers with development and team building, the Company measures inclusiveness as part of its periodic internal employee experience survey. 

John Deere and the Company proudly partner with several professional organizations to support our diversity recruitment strategy, including Anita B.org. &#8211; a global organization for women in technology, Minorities in Agriculture Natural Resources and Related Sciences, the National Association of Black Accountants, Inc., the National Black MBA Association, Inc., the National Society of Black Engineers, Prospanica &#8211; the Association of Hispanic Professionals, the Society of Women Engineers, the Thurgood Marshall College Fund Leadership Institute, and the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers.

John Deere&#8217;s 13 Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), in which employees of the Company participate, are Company sponsored organizations run by employees, and are a key driver of inclusion at John Deere and a critical component of our global DEI strategy. ERGs build organization-wide networks that help enable employees with shared interests to come together and are open to all employees. The global chapters work with local teams to support our efforts to attract, retain, and develop the best talent.

Compensation and Benefits 

The Company&#8217;s total rewards are intended to be competitive, meet the varied needs of our global workforce, and reinforce our values. The Company is committed to providing comprehensive and competitive pay and benefits to its employees. The Company has invested, and continues to invest, in its employees through growth and development and well-being initiatives. 

The Company&#8217;s work environment is designed to promote innovation and well-being and reward performance. The Company&#8217;s total rewards for employees include a variety of components that aim to support sustainable employment and the ability to build a strong financial future, including competitive market-based pay and comprehensive benefits. In addition to earning base pay, eligible employees are compensated for their contributions to the Company&#8217;s goals with both short-term and long-term cash incentives and long-term equity-based incentives.

Eligible full-time employees in the U.S. have access to medical, dental, and vision plans; savings and retirement plans; parental leave and paid time off; and other resources, such as the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), which provides mental health and wellness services. The Company also offers a variety of working arrangements to eligible employees, including flexible schedules, telecommuting, and job sharing, to help employees manage home and work-life situations. Programs and benefits differ internationally for a variety of reasons, such as local legal requirements, market practices, and negotiations with works councils, and other employee representative bodies.

Training and Development 

The Company provides training and development opportunities for employees at all stages of their careers to empower them to reach their full potential. Employees are critical to the long-term success of the Company&#8217;s business. We encourage employees to identify the paths that can build the skills, experience, knowledge, and competencies needed for career advancement. The Company supports employees by creating purpose-driven work opportunities, comprehensive performance reviews and development plans, mentoring opportunities, and professional and personal development opportunities. 

The Company encourages employees to provide feedback across the enterprise through our internal voluntary employee experience survey, ad-hoc &#8220;pulse&#8221; surveys, and new-hire and exit surveys. Reports from these surveys help equip the Company to address needs across the employee lifecycle to improve the overall experience and engagement of our workforce. 

In terms of learning and development, the Company continues to invest in technology and content providers that strengthen our commitment to prepare a future-ready workforce. We offer training, upskilling, and development opportunities at all stages of an employee&#8217;s career, empowering them to reach their full potential.

The Company&#8217;s training programs, which are tailored to different geographic regions and job functions, include among other topics, relationships with customers and dealers, the Company&#8217;s culture and values, compliance with the Code, compliance with anti-bribery/corruption laws and policies, compliance with management of private data and cybersecurity, regulatory compliance, conflicts of interest, discrimination and workplace harassment policies, sexual harassment policies, and leadership development.

Human Rights 

The Company honors human rights and respects the individual dignity of all persons globally. The Company&#8217;s commitment to human rights requires that we understand and carry out our responsibilities consistent with Company values and practices. The Company strives to ensure that human rights are upheld for our employees and employees of John Deere dealers. Our commitment to human rights is defined in the Code, the John Deere dealer Code of Conduct, related policies and procedures, and &#8220;Support of Human Rights in our Business Practice,&#8221; each of which is available on John Deere&#8217;s website under &#8220;Governance.&#8221; These documents establish clear guidelines for our employees and John Deere dealers while helping to inform our business decisions. We do not tolerate human rights abuses, such as forced labor, unlawful child labor, or human trafficking. We are proud to contribute to the places where we work and support the residents of these places.
