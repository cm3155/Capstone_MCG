The Company 

John Deere Capital Corporation (Capital Corporation) and its subsidiaries are collectively called the Company. John Deere Financial Services, Inc. (JDFS), a wholly-owned finance holding subsidiary of Deere &#38; Company, owns all of the outstanding common stock of Capital Corporation. See &#8220;Relationships of the Company with John Deere&#8221; for additional information regarding agreements between the Company and Deere &#38; Company. The Company conducts business in Australia, New Zealand, the United States (U.S.), and in several countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America, including Argentina and Mexico. Capital Corporation was incorporated under the laws of Delaware and commenced operations in 1958.

The Company provides and administers financing for retail purchases of new equipment manufactured by Deere &#38; Company&#8217;s production and precision agriculture operations, small agriculture and turf operations, and construction and forestry operations and used equipment taken in trade for this equipment. References to &#8220;agriculture and turf&#8221; include both production and precision agriculture and small agriculture and turf. The Company generally purchases retail installment sales and loan contracts (retail notes) from Deere &#38; Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively called John Deere). John Deere generally acquires these retail notes through John Deere retail dealers. The Company also purchases and finances a limited amount of non-John Deere retail notes. The Company also finances and services revolving charge accounts, in most cases acquired from and offered through merchants in the agriculture and turf and construction and forestry markets (revolving charge accounts). Additionally, the Company provides wholesale financing to dealers of John Deere agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment (wholesale receivables), primarily to finance inventories of equipment for those dealers. In addition, the Company leases John Deere equipment and a limited amount of non-John Deere equipment to retail customers (financing and operating leases). The Company also offers credit enhanced international export financing to select customers and dealers, which primarily involves John Deere products. Retail notes, revolving charge accounts, and financing leases are collectively called &#8220;Customer Receivables.&#8221; Customer Receivables and wholesale receivables are collectively called &#8220;Receivables.&#8221; Receivables and equipment on operating leases are collectively called &#8220;Receivables and Leases.&#8221;

Business of John Deere 

In fiscal year 2021, John Deere implemented a new operating model and reporting structure. With this change, John Deere&#8217;s agriculture and turf operations were divided into two new segments: production and precision agriculture and small agriculture and turf. There were no reporting changes for the construction and forestry and financial services segments. As a result, John Deere&#8217;s operations are now categorized into four major business segments:

The production and precision agriculture segment defines, develops, and delivers global equipment and technology solutions to unlock customer value for production-scale growers of large grains, small grains, cotton, and sugar. 

The segment&#8217;s main products include large and certain mid-size tractors, combines, cotton pickers, sugarcane harvesters and loaders, and soil preparation, seeding, application, and crop care equipment. 

The small agriculture and turf segment defines, develops, and delivers global equipment and technology solutions to unlock customer value for dairy and livestock producers, high-value crop producers, and turf and utility customers. The segment&#8217;s primary products include certain mid-size and small tractors, as well as hay and forage equipment, riding and commercial lawn equipment, golf course equipment, and utility vehicles.

The construction and forestry segment defines, develops, and delivers a broad range of machines and technology solutions organized along the earthmoving, forestry, and roadbuilding production systems. The segment&#8217;s primary products include crawler dozers and loaders, four-wheel-drive loaders, excavators, skid-steer loaders, milling machines, and log harvesters. 

The products and services produced by the segments above are marketed primarily through independent retail dealer networks and major retail outlets, and, as it relates to roadbuilding products in certain markets outside the U.S. and Canada, primarily through John Deere-owned sales and service subsidiaries.

The financial services segment includes the operations of the Company (described herein), and additional operations in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, China, India, Russia, and Thailand. The segment primarily finances sales and leases by John Deere dealers of new and used production and precision agriculture, small agriculture and turf, and construction and forestry equipment. In addition, the financial services segment provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment, finances retail revolving charge accounts, and offers extended equipment warranties.

John Deere&#8217;s worldwide production and precision agriculture operations, small agriculture and turf operations, and construction and forestry operations are sometimes collectively referred to as the &#8220;equipment operations.&#8221; The financial services segment is sometimes referred to as the &#8220;financial services operations.&#8221; While the implementation of John Deere&#8217;s new operating model in fiscal year 2021 resulted in new operating segments for John Deere, Receivables and Leases managed by the Company continue to be evaluated by market (agriculture and turf or construction and forestry). 

For fiscal 2021, worldwide net income attributable to Deere &#38; Company was $5.963 billion, or $18.99 per share, compared with $2.751 billion, or $8.69 per share, in fiscal 2020. 

Deere and Company&#8217;s consolidated net sales and revenues increased 24 percent to $44.024 billion in 2021, compared with $35.540 billion in 2020. Net sales of the equipment operations increased in fiscal 2021 to $39.737 billion, compared with $31.272 billion last year. 

Production and precision agriculture, small agriculture and turf, and construction and forestry sales increased during 2021 due to higher shipment volumes and price realization. 

The financial services operations reported net income of $881 million for fiscal 2021 compared with $566 million in fiscal 2020. The increase was mainly due to improvements on operating lease residual values, a lower provision for credit losses, more favorable financing spreads, and income earned on a higher average portfolio.

Market Conditions 

Agriculture and Turf. Industry sales of large agricultural machinery in the U.S. and Canada are forecasted to increase approximately 15 percent compared to 2021. Industry sales of small agricultural and turf equipment in the U.S. and Canada are expected to be flat in 2022. Industry sales of agricultural machinery in Europe are forecasted to be about 5 percent higher, while South American industry sales of tractors and combines are forecasted to be roughly 5 percent higher in 2022. Asia industry sales are forecasted to be nearly the same in 2022 as in 2021.

Construction and Forestry. On an industry basis, North American construction equipment and compact construction equipment sales are both expected to be 5 to 10 percent higher in 2022. Global forestry industry sales are projected to increase 10 to 15 percent.

Financial Services, including the Company. Results for the full-year fiscal 2022 are expected to be slightly lower due to a higher provision for credit losses, lower gains on operating lease residual values, and higher selling, general, and administrative expenses. These factors are expected to be partially offset by income earned on a higher average portfolio.

Relationships of the Company with John Deere 

The results of operations of the Company are affected by its relationships with John Deere, including, among other items, the terms on which the Company acquires Receivables and Leases and borrows funds from John Deere, the reimbursement for interest waiver and low-rate finance programs from John Deere, the compensation paid by John Deere in connection with the Company&#8217;s purchase of trade receivables from John Deere, and the payment to John Deere for various expenses applicable to the Company&#8217;s operations. In addition, John Deere and the Company have joint access to certain lines of credit.

The Company&#8217;s acquisition volume of Receivables and Leases is largely dependent upon the level of retail sales and leases of John Deere products. The level of John Deere retail sales and leases is responsive to a variety of economic, financial, climatic, legislative, and other factors that influence demand for its products. The majority of the Company&#8217;s businesses are affected by changes in interest rates, demand for credit, and competition.

The Company bears substantially all of the credit risk (net of recovery from withholdings from certain John Deere dealers and merchants) associated with its holding of Receivables and Leases. A small portion of the Receivables and Leases held (less than 5 percent) is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of Deere &#38; Company. The Company also performs substantially all servicing and collection functions. Servicing and collection functions for a small portion of the Receivables and Leases held (less than 5 percent) are provided by John Deere. John Deere is reimbursed for staff and other administrative services at estimated cost and for credit lines provided to the Company based on utilization of those lines.

The terms and the basis on which the Company acquires retail notes and certain wholesale receivables from John Deere are governed by agreements with John Deere, generally terminable by either John Deere or the Company on 30 days notice. As provided in these agreements, the Company agrees to the terms and conditions for purchasing the retail notes and wholesale receivables from John Deere. Under these agreements, John Deere is not obligated to sell notes to the Company, and the Company is obligated to purchase notes from John Deere only if the notes comply with the terms and conditions set by the Company.

The basis on which John Deere acquires retail notes and wholesale receivables from John Deere dealers is governed by agreements with those dealers, which may be terminated in accordance with their terms and applicable law. In acquiring these notes from dealers, the terms and conditions, as set forth in agreements with the dealers, conform with the terms and conditions adopted by the Company in determining the acceptability of retail and certain wholesale notes to be purchased from John Deere. The dealers are not obligated to sell these notes to John Deere and John Deere is not obligated to accept these notes from the dealers. In practice, retail and wholesale notes are acquired from dealers only if the terms of these notes and the creditworthiness of the customers are acceptable to the Company. The Company acts on behalf of both itself and John Deere in determining the acceptability of the notes and in acquiring acceptable notes from dealers.

The basis on which the Company enters into leases with retail customers through John Deere dealers is governed by agreements between dealers and the Company. Leases are accepted based on the terms and conditions, the lessees&#8217; creditworthiness, the anticipated residual values of the equipment, and the intended use of the equipment.

Deere &#38; Company has an agreement with Capital Corporation pursuant to which it has agreed to continue to own, directly or through one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries, at least 51 percent of the voting shares of capital stock of Capital Corporation and to maintain the Company&#8217;s consolidated tangible net worth at not less than $50.0 million. This agreement also obligates Deere &#38; Company to make payments to Capital Corporation such that its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges is not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter. Deere &#38; Company&#8217;s obligations to make payments to Capital Corporation under the agreement are independent of whether the Company is in default on its indebtedness, obligations, or other liabilities. Further, Deere &#38; Company&#8217;s obligations under the agreement are not measured by the amount of the Company&#8217;s indebtedness, obligations, or other liabilities. Deere &#38; Company&#8217;s obligations to make payments under this agreement are expressly stated not to be a guaranty of any specific indebtedness, obligation, or liability of the Company and are enforceable only by or in the name of Capital Corporation. No payments were required 

under this agreement during the periods included in the consolidated financial statements. At October 31, 2021, Deere &#38; Company indirectly owned 100 percent of the voting shares of Capital Corporation&#8217;s capital stock and Capital Corporation&#8217;s consolidated tangible net worth was $4,524.4 million.

The Company purchases certain wholesale trade receivables from John Deere. These trade receivables arise from John Deere&#8217;s sales of goods to independent dealers. Under the terms of the sales to dealers, interest is primarily charged to dealers on outstanding balances, from the earlier of the date when goods are sold to retail customers by the dealer or the expiration of certain interest-free periods granted at the time of the sale to the dealer, until payment is received by the Company. Dealers cannot cancel purchases after John Deere recognizes a sale and are responsible for payment even if the equipment is not sold to retail customers. The interest-free periods are determined based on the type of equipment sold and the time of year of the sale. These periods range from one to twelve months for most equipment. Interest-free periods may not be extended. Interest charged may not be forgiven and the past due interest rates exceed market rates. The Company receives compensation from John Deere at approximate market interest rates for these interest-free periods. The Company computes the compensation from John Deere for interest-free periods based on the Company&#8217;s estimated funding costs, administrative and operating expenses, credit losses, and required return on equity.

Description of Receivables and Leases 

Receivables and Leases arise mainly from retail and wholesale sales and leases of John Deere products and used equipment accepted in trade for them, and from retail sales of equipment of unrelated manufacturers. Receivables and Leases also include revolving charge accounts receivable. At October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, at least 90 percent of the Receivables and Leases administered by the Company were for financing that facilitated the purchase or lease of John Deere products.

John Deere Financial, f.s.b. (Thrift) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Capital Corporation. It holds a federal thrift charter and is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The U.S. Federal Reserve Board has oversight of the Company, as the owner of the Thrift. The Thrift is headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin and offers revolving charge products including John Deere Financial Multi-Use Account, PowerPlan &#226; , and John Deere Financial Revolving Plan throughout the U.S. The John Deere Financial Multi-Use Account is used by farmers and ranchers to finance their purchases of production inputs from agribusiness merchants, including seed, fertilizer, and crop protection. The John Deere Financial Multi-Use Account is also used by agriculture and turf customers to finance the purchase of parts and service from John Deere dealers. PowerPlan &#226; is primarily used by construction and forestry customers to finance the purchase of equipment parts, equipment rentals, and service work performed at John Deere construction and forestry dealers. The John Deere Financial Revolving Plan is used primarily by retail customers of John Deere dealers to finance purchases of turf and utility equipment. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under &#8220;Revolving Charge Accounts Receivable.&#8221;

The Company provides wholesale financing to John Deere dealers, primarily to finance agriculture and turf and construction and forestry equipment inventories. A large portion of the wholesale financing is provided by the Company to dealers from whom it also purchases agriculture and turf and construction and forestry retail notes. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under &#8220;Wholesale Receivables.&#8221;

The Company generally requires that theft and physical damage insurance be carried on all goods leased or securing retail notes and wholesale receivables. In certain markets, the customer may, at the customer&#8217;s own expense, have the Company or the seller of the goods purchase this insurance or obtain it from other sources. Insurance is not required for goods purchased under revolving charge accounts.

Receivables and Leases are eligible for acceptance if they conform to prescribed finance and lease plan terms. Guidelines relating to down payments and contract terms on retail notes and leases are described in Note 4 and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In limited circumstances, Receivables and Leases may be accepted and acquired even though they do not conform in all respects to the established guidelines. The Company determines whether Receivables and Leases should be accepted and how they should be serviced. Acceptance of these Receivables and Leases is dependent on having one or more risk mitigation enhancements that may include the pledge of additional collateral as security, the assignment of specific earnings to the Company, or the acceptance of accelerated payment schedules. Officers of the Company are responsible 

for establishing policies and reviewing the performance of the Company in accepting and collecting Receivables and Leases. The Company performs substantially all of its own routine collections, settlements, and repossessions on Receivables and Leases.

John Deere retail notes and wholesale receivables are generally supported by perfected security interests in goods financed under laws such as the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), certain federal statutes, and state motor vehicle laws in the U.S. and by security in goods or other security under applicable laws in other countries and jurisdictions. UCC financing statements are also prepared and filed on leases; however, these filings for operating leases are made for informational purposes only.

Finance Rates on Retail Notes 

As of October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, over 95 percent of the retail notes held by the Company bore a fixed finance rate. A portion of the finance income earned by the Company arises from reimbursements from John Deere in connection with financing the retail sales of John Deere equipment on which finance charges are waived or reduced by John Deere for a period from the date of sale to a specified subsequent date. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Average Original Term and Average Actual Life of Retail Notes and Leases 

Due to prepayments (often from trade-ins and refinancing), the average actual life of retail notes and leases is considerably shorter than the average original term. The following table shows the average original term for retail notes and leases acquired during the year and the average actual life for retail notes and leases liquidated during the year (in months):

##TABLE_END Due to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID), the Company provided short-term payment relief to dealers and retail customers during 2020, and to a much lesser extent in 2021. The delinquency status of Receivables granted relief due to COVID is based on the modified payment schedule (see Note 5). During the first quarter of 2019, the Company amended the timing in which finance income and lease revenue is generally suspended on retail notes, revolving charge accounts, and finance lease accounts from 120 days delinquent to 90 days delinquent. This change in estimate was made on a prospective basis and did not have a significant effect on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management&#8217;s methodology to determine the collectability of delinquent accounts was not affected by the change.

##TABLE_END * Excludes provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments of $.1 million for 2021.

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of the Receivable portfolio. The allowance is measured on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Risk characteristics considered by the Company include product category, market, geography, credit risk, and remaining duration. Receivables that do not share risk characteristics with other receivables in the portfolio are evaluated on an individual basis. The Company utilizes loss forecast models, which are selected based on the size and credit risk of the underlying pool of receivables, to estimate expected credit losses. Transition matrix models are used for large and complex Customer Receivable pools, while weighted average remaining maturity models are used for smaller and less complex Customer Receivable pools. Expected credit losses on wholesale receivables are based on historical loss rates, with consideration of current economic conditions and dealer financial risk. The modeled expected credit losses are adjusted based on reasonable and supportable forecasts, which may include economic indicators such as commodity prices, industry equipment sales, unemployment rates, and housing starts. Management reviews each model&#8217;s output quarterly, and qualitative adjustments are incorporated as necessary. Receivables are written off to the allowance when the account is considered uncollectible. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

The total allowance for credit losses, by product, at October 31, 2021, November 1, 2020, November 3, 2019, October 28, 2018, and October 29, 2017 (in millions of dollars), and the portfolio, by product, as a percent of total portfolio are presented below:

##TABLE_END As a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13, the allowance for credit losses increased $19.7 million at the beginning of 2021. Subsequent to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13, the allowance decreased $19.8 million, primarily due to a reduction in the allowance on construction and forestry retail notes and financing leases and a lower allowance on revolving charge accounts. The allowance on construction and forestry retail notes and financing leases decreased due to improving market conditions and better than expected performance of accounts granted payment relief due to the economic effects of COVID, while the allowance on revolving charge accounts was favorably impacted by strong payment performance due to continued improvements in the agriculture and turf market. These decreases were partially offset by growth in the retail notes and financing leases portfolio. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

The total allowance for credit losses, by geographic area, at October 31, 2021, November 1, 2020, November 3, 2019, October 28, 2018, and October 29, 2017 (in millions of dollars), and the portfolio, by geographic area, as a percent of total portfolio, are presented below:

##TABLE_END &#8203; 

Competition 

The businesses in which the Company is engaged are highly competitive. The Company primarily competes for customers with commercial banks and finance and leasing companies based upon its service, finance rates charged, and other finance terms. In addition, the competitive landscape is evolving as technology is unlocking new capabilities for traditional competitors and enabling new digital entrants that could be either technology partners or potential competitors. The proportion of John Deere equipment retail sales and leases financed by the Company is influenced by conditions prevailing in the agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment industries, in the financial markets, and in business generally. The Company financed a significant portion of John Deere equipment retail sales and leases in many of the countries in which the Company operated during 2021 and 2020.

The Company emphasizes convenient service to customers and endeavors to offer terms desired in its specialized markets, such as seasonal schedules of repayment and rentals. The Company&#8217;s retail finance rates and lease rates are generally believed to be in the range offered by other sales finance and leasing companies, although not as low as those of some banks and other lenders and lessors.

Regulation 

In several U.S. states, state law limits the maximum finance rate on receivables. The present state limitations have not, thus far, significantly limited variable-rate finance charges or the fixed-rate finance charges established by the 

Company. However, if interest rate levels should increase significantly, maximum state rates could affect the Company by preventing the variable rates on outstanding variable-rate retail notes from increasing above the maximum state rate and by limiting the fixed rates on new notes. In some states, the Company may be able to qualify new retail notes for a higher maximum rate limit by using retail installment sales contracts (rather than loan contracts) or by using fixed-rate rather than variable-rate contracts.

In addition to rate regulation, various U.S. state and federal laws and regulations apply to some Receivables and Leases, principally retail notes for goods sold for personal, family, or household use and John Deere Financial Revolving Plan, John Deere Financial Multi-Use Account, and PowerPlan &#226; accounts receivable. To date, these laws and regulations have not had a significant adverse effect on the Company.

The Thrift holds a federal thrift charter and is subject to regulation and examination by the OCC. The U.S. Federal Reserve Board has oversight of the Company, as the owner of the Thrift.

The manner in which the Company offers financing outside the U.S. is affected by a variety of country specific laws, regulations, and customs, including those governing property rights and debtor obligations, that are subject to change and that may introduce greater risk to the Company.

In fiscal year 2021, compliance with the regulations applicable to the Company did not have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. The Company does not expect to incur material capital expenditures related to compliance with regulations during fiscal year 2022. Additional information about the impact of government regulations on the Company&#39;s business is included in Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; under the headings Geopolitical Uncertainties; Data Security and Privacy Risks; Environmental, Climate and Weather Risks; and Legal and Regulatory Risks. 

Human Capital 

Higher Purpose 

As a wholly-owned subsidiary of Deere &#38; Company, the Company&#8217;s employees, its human capital, are guided by John Deere&#8217;s higher purpose: We run so life can leap forward. Employees are further guided by John Deere&#8217;s code of business conduct (Code), which helps them to uphold and strengthen the standards of honor and integrity that have defined John Deere since its founding. Our world and business may change, but our core values&#8212;integrity, quality, commitment and innovation&#8212;are a constant in everything we do. Our values have shaped and guided John Deere&#8217;s vision since 1837.

Employees 

At October 31, 2021, the Company had 1,470 full-time and part-time employees. The Company also retains consultants, independent contractors, and temporary workers.

Code of Business Conduct 

John Deere and the Company are committed to conducting business in accordance with the highest ethical standards. This means how we conduct ourselves and our global work is more than just a matter of policy and law; it&#39;s a reflection of our core values. The Code, refreshed in 2021, provides specific guidance to all John Deere employees, outlining how we can and must uphold and strengthen the integrity that has defined John Deere since its founding. All employees must complete Code training and, where permitted by law, must also certify each year that they will comply with the Code. The Company maintains a global compliance hotline to allow for concerns to be brought forward.

Health and Safety 

John Deere and the Company have taken and continue to take extraordinary measures to protect their workforce in response to COVID. Safety protocols continue to be in place for employees who work onsite, including enhanced cleaning and sanitation. Where possible, the Company has supported flexible work arrangements for employees throughout the pandemic, including by deploying new technologies to strengthen virtual connectivity. The Company also provided financial support for employees who struggled to provide childcare during the pandemic. The Company continues to strive 

to be agile in addressing employee needs in the quickly evolving environment while also being transparent across the workforce.

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) 

In order to ensure that each of our employees can bring their full selves to work, John Deere and the Company strive to foster a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace where all voices are heard and included. John Deere continues to champion policies, practices, and behaviors that amplify innovation on behalf of people, community, and planet. Diversity, equity, and inclusion are critical to our success as an organization. Incorporating DEI into our business practices enhances innovation and enables our best talent to thrive in an environment where diverse perspectives are celebrated. This requires deliberate intention and action on the part of every employee and leader. We will continue to push forward on the path to a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture with our colleagues, customers, and dealers. In doing so, experience tells us we will be more engaged, innovative, and successful.

The Company&#8217;s leadership sets a consistent and transparent tone on diversity and inclusion. Leadership training focuses on building an inclusive environment and driving positive behavioral change. To help managers with development and team building, we measure inclusiveness as part of our employee experience survey. We are working to further weave DEI into all aspects of how we lead and do business. In addition to regional councils, we have formed a global diversity and inclusion council with senior leaders who own our DEI journey. This journey is a collective effort that involves every level of our organization. As part of the annual sustainability report available on John Deere&#8217;s website, John Deere has publicly disclosed the number of women and minorities in leadership positions throughout the organization, which includes the Company, and continues to launch initiatives to increase representation of minorities in the workforce.

John Deere and the Company proudly partner with several professional organizations to support our diversity recruitment strategy, including the National Black MBA Association, Inc., the Society of Women Engineers, the Thurgood Marshall College Fund Leadership Institute, the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, and Minorities in Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Related Sciences.

John Deere-sponsored employee resource groups (ERGs), in which Company employees participate, are employee-run organizations formed around a common dimension of diversity, interest, or experience that affects the workplace. ERGs bring together individuals with shared interests while serving as resources to our business. The efforts of our ERGs address three key focus areas &#8211; employee development, community involvement, and business alignment. John Deere has 12 ERGs and the Company has approximately 700 employees engaged in these ERGs globally.

Compensation and Benefits 

To attract and retain talent, the Company offers competitive compensation and non-financial benefits everywhere we operate. These benefits are tailored to the specific markets in which our employees are located. The non-compensation benefits we offer focus on all aspects of employee well-being, including physical, social, community, and career. We conduct regular surveys of the market rates for jobs to ensure our compensation is competitive. We offer a variety of working arrangements, including flexible schedules, telecommuting, and job sharing, to help employees manage home and work-life situations.

Training and Development 

The Company provides training and development opportunities for employees at all stages of their careers to empower them to reach their full potential. Employees are critical to the long-term success of the Company&#8217;s business. We encourage employees to identify the paths that can build the skills, experience, knowledge, and competencies needed for career advancement. The Company supports employees by creating purpose-driven work opportunities, comprehensive performance reviews and development plans, mentoring opportunities, and professional and personal development opportunities. The Company provided approximately 20.3 training hours per full-time equivalent administrative/professional employee globally in fiscal year 2021. The Company&#8217;s training programs, which are tailored to different geographic regions and job functions, include among other topics: relationships with customers and dealers, the Company&#8217;s culture and values, compliance with the Code, compliance with anti-bribery/corruption laws and policies, compliance with management of private data and cybersecurity, compliance with conflicts of interest, discrimination and workplace harassment policies, and sexual harassment policies.

Human Rights 

The Company honors human rights and respects the individual dignity of all persons globally. Our commitment to human rights requires that we understand and carry out our responsibilities consistent with Company values and practices. We strive to ensure that human rights are upheld for our employees and employees of John Deere dealers. Our commitment to human rights is defined in the Code, the John Deere dealer code of conduct, and related policies and practices, which establish clear guidelines for our employees and John Deere dealers while helping to inform our business decisions. We do not tolerate human rights abuses, such as forced labor, unlawful child labor, or human trafficking. We are proud to contribute to the places where we work and support the residents of these places.
