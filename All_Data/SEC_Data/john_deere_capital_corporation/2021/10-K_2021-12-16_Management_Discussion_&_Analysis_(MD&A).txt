 Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The following Management&#39;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&#38;A) is intended to promote understanding of the financial condition and results of operations. The MD&#38;A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).

Results of Operations 

Overview 

Organization 

The Company primarily generates revenues and cash by financing John Deere dealers&#8217; sales and leases of new and used production and precision agriculture, small agriculture and turf, and construction and forestry equipment. In addition, the Company also provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment and finances retail revolving charge accounts.

Trends and Economic Conditions 

The Company&#8217;s acquisition volume of Receivables and Leases is largely dependent upon the level of retail sales and leases of John Deere products. The level of John Deere retail sales and leases is responsive to a variety of economic, financial, climatic, legislative, and other factors that influence demand for its products. 

John Deere&#8217;s production and precision agriculture equipment and small agriculture and turf equipment sales both increased 27 percent in 2021. Industry sales of large agricultural machinery in the U.S. and Canada for 2022 are forecasted to increase approximately 15 percent compared to 2021. Industry sales of small agricultural and turf equipment in the U.S. and Canada are expected to be flat in 2022. Industry sales of agricultural machinery in Europe are forecasted to be about 5 percent higher. South American industry sales of tractors and combines are forecasted to be roughly 5 percent higher in 2022. Asia industry sales are forecasted to be nearly the same in 2022 as in 2021. John Deere&#8217;s construction and forestry sales increased 27 percent in 2021. On an industry basis, North American construction equipment and compact construction equipment sales are both expected to be 5 to 10 percent higher in 2022. Global forestry industry sales are projected to increase 10 to 15 percent. Results for the full-year fiscal 2022 for financial services, including the Company, are expected to be slightly lower due to a higher provision for credit losses, lower gains on operating lease residual values, and higher selling, general, and administrative expenses. These factors are expected to be partially offset by income earned on a higher average portfolio.

Items of concern that could affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations and liquidity and capital resources include uncertainty of the effectiveness of governmental and private sector actions to address COVID, trade agreements, the uncertainty of the results of monetary and fiscal policies, the impact of elevated levels of sovereign and state debt, capital market disruptions, changes in demand and pricing for new and used equipment, geopolitical events, and the other items discussed in the &#8220;Safe Harbor Statement&#8221; below. Significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and volatility in the price of many commodities could also impact John Deere&#8217;s and the Company&#8217;s results. The future financial effects of COVID continue to be unknown due to many factors. As a result of these uncertainties, predicting the Company&#8217;s forecasted financial performance is subject to many assumptions.

John Deere&#8217;s 2021 full-year performance reflects strong end-market demand and the ability of John Deere&#8217;s dedicated employees, dealers, and suppliers throughout the world, who have helped safely maintain operations, manage supply-chain challenges, and continue to serve customers throughout the COVID pandemic. Demand for farm and construction equipment is expected to continue to benefit from positive fundamentals, including favorable crop prices, economic growth, and increased investment in infrastructure. While supply-chain pressures are expected to persist into at least the early part of fiscal year 2022, John Deere is working closely with key suppliers to secure the parts and components that customers need in order to deliver essential food and infrastructure more profitably and sustainably. 

COVID Effects and Actions 

During 2020 and to a lesser extent in 2021, the effects of COVID and the related actions of governments and other authorities to contain COVID affected and continue to affect the Company&#8217;s operations, results, cash flows, and forecasts. 

The Company&#8217;s first priority in addressing the effects of COVID continues to be the health, safety, and overall welfare of its employees. The Company effectively activated previously established business continuity plans and proactively implemented health and safety measures at its operations around the world. 

The Company continued to work closely with its customers, including John Deere dealers and retail customers, in 2021 in connection with short-term payment relief on obligations owed to the Company. Receivables and Leases granted relief since the beginning of the pandemic that remained outstanding at October 31, 2021 represented approximately 2 percent of the Receivable and Lease portfolio (see Notes 5 and 7).

2021 Compared with 2020 

The total revenues and net income attributable to the Company were as follows (in millions of dollars):

##TABLE_END Total revenues decreased in 2021 primarily due to lower average financing rates, partially offset by a higher average portfolio and net gains on operating lease dispositions in the current year. Net income in 2021 was higher than in 2020 due to improvements on operating lease residual values, a lower provision for credit losses, favorable financing spreads, and income earned on a higher average portfolio. 2020 results also included impairments on lease residual values (see Note 7).

##TABLE_END Finance income on retail notes increased slightly in 2021 due to a higher average portfolio, partially offset by lower average financing rates. Finance income on revolving charge accounts and wholesale receivables decreased in 2021 primarily due to lower average financing rates and lower average portfolios. Lease revenues decreased primarily due to lower average portfolio balances.

Revenues earned from John Deere totaled $613.7 million in 2021, compared with $669.5 million in 2020. The decrease was primarily the result of lower compensation paid by John Deere for waived or reduced finance charges on wholesale receivables due to lower average financing rates and a lower average portfolio. Revenues earned from John Deere are included in the revenue amounts discussed above and in other income.

Other income increased in 2021 primarily due to net gains on operating lease residual values, which had been revised downward over the term of the leases. Better than expected conditions in the agriculture and turf and the construction and forestry markets led to favorable results when the matured lease equipment was sold. The Company recognized net losses on operating lease dispositions in 2020, which were recorded in administrative and operating expenses. In addition, 2021 benefited from freestanding credit enhancement recoveries (see Note 5), partially offset by lower interest income.

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

##TABLE_END The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower average borrowing rates.

The depreciation of equipment on operating leases decreased primarily due to updated depreciation estimates and lower average balances of equipment on operating leases.

The decrease in administrative and operating expenses was primarily due to losses and impairments on operating lease residual values recorded in 2020 (see Note 7). In 2021, the Company recognized net gains on the sale of operating lease equipment in other income. 2020 was also impacted by employee-separation expenses (see Note 22).

Fees paid to John Deere increased in 2021 primarily due to higher interest on intercompany borrowings from John Deere as a result of higher average borrowings and higher interest rates in certain international markets, in addition to higher corporate support fees.

The provision (credit) for credit losses decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to lower expected losses on retail notes and financing leases caused by improving conditions in the construction and forestry market and better than expected performance of accounts granted payment relief due to the economic effects of COVID. The provision 

(credit) for credit losses also decreased on revolving charge accounts in 2021, reflecting strong payment performance due to continued improvements in the agriculture and turf market. In addition to the factors noted above, the 2020 provision also included an increase in the allowance for credit losses related to the negative economic effects of COVID and other macroeconomic issues. The provision for credit losses, as a percentage of the total average balance of Receivables financed, was zero for 2021 and .27 percent for 2020.

The higher provision for income taxes in 2021 was primarily related to higher pretax income in the current year, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Receivables and Leases Acquired and Held 

For the fiscal years ended October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, Receivable and Lease (excluding wholesale) acquisition volumes and balances held were as follows (in millions of dollars):

##TABLE_END * The delinquency status of Receivables granted relief due to COVID is based on the modified payment schedule (see Note 5).

Receivables 30 days or more past due continue to accrue finance income. The Company ceases to accrue finance income once Receivables are considered non-performing. An allowance for credit losses is recorded for the estimated credit losses expected over the life of the Receivable portfolio. The Company measures expected credit losses on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Risk characteristics considered by the Company include product category, market, geography, credit risk, and remaining duration. Receivables that do not share risk characteristics with other receivables in the portfolio are evaluated on an individual basis. While the Company believes its allowance is sufficient to provide for losses over the life of its existing Receivable portfolio, different assumptions or changes in economic conditions would result in changes to the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses. See Note 5 for additional information related to the allowance for credit losses.

Deposits withheld from dealers and merchants amounted to $131.8 million at October 31, 2021, compared with $114.8 million at November 1, 2020. These balances primarily represent the aggregate dealer retail note and lease withholding accounts from individual John Deere dealers to which losses from retail notes and leases originating from the respective dealers can be charged. Upon the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13, recoveries from dealer deposits are recognized in other income when the dealer&#8217;s withholding account is charged.

During 2021, $14.3 million was recorded in other income related to recoveries from dealer deposits and other freestanding credit enhancements. Prior to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13, the benefit of credit losses recovered from freestanding credit enhancements, such as dealer deposits, was recognized in the provision for credit losses based on estimated recoveries.

2020 Compared with 2019 

The comparison of the 2020 results with 2019 can be found under the heading &#8220;2020 Compared with 2019&#8221; in the &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; section of the Company&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K .

Capital Resources and Liquidity 

The cash provided by operating and financing activities was used primarily to fund Receivables and Leases. Cash provided by operating activities was $1,365.9 million in 2021. Cash provided by financing activities totaled $2,026.2 million, resulting primarily from a net increase in total external borrowings of $2,152.1 million and a net increase in notes payables to John Deere of $392.8 million, partially offset by dividends paid of $485.0 million. Cash used for investing activities totaled $3,391.7 million in 2021, primarily due to the cost of Receivables acquired (excluding wholesale) exceeding the collections of Receivables (excluding wholesale) by $4,290.6 million, and the cost of equipment on operating leases acquired exceeding the proceeds from sales of equipment on operating leases by $276.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in net wholesale receivables of $1,197.1 million. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased $3.4 million during 2021.

Over the last three years, operating activities have provided $4,576.2 million in cash. In addition, an increase in total borrowings of $5,178.6 million provided cash inflows. These amounts have been used mainly to fund Receivable and Lease acquisitions, which exceeded collections of Receivables and proceeds from sale of equipment on operating leases by $8,212.2 million, and to pay $1,090.0 million in dividends. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased $61.0 million over the three-year period.

The Company relies on its ability to raise substantial amounts of funds to finance its Receivable and Lease portfolios. The Company has access to most global markets at reasonable costs and expects to have sufficient sources of global funding and liquidity to meet its funding needs in the short term and long term. The Company&#8217;s ability to meet its debt obligations is supported in several ways. The assets of the Company are self-liquidating in nature. A solid equity position is available to absorb unusual losses on these assets and all commercial paper is backed by unsecured, committed borrowing lines from various banks. Liquidity is also provided by the Company&#8217;s ability to securitize these assets and through the issuance of term debt. Additionally, liquidity may be provided through loans from John Deere. The Company&#8217;s commercial paper outstanding at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 was $662.9 million and $125.0 million, respectively, while the total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities position was $679.1 million and $676.8 million, respectively. The amount of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $158.0 million and $163.7 million at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, respectively.

The Company has a revolving credit agreement to utilize bank conduit facilities to securitize retail notes (see Note 6). At October 31, 2021, the revolving credit agreement had a total capacity, or &#8220;financing limit,&#8221; of $2,000.0 million of secured financings at any time. $1,572.3 million of short-term securitization borrowings were outstanding under the agreement at October 31, 2021. At the end of the contractual revolving period, unless the banks and the Company agree to renew, the Company would liquidate the secured borrowings over time as payments on the retail notes are collected. The agreement was renewed in November 2021 with an expiration in November 2022 and a capacity of $1,000.0 million. As a result of the reduced capacity, $511.1 million of outstanding short-term securitization borrowings were repurchased by the Company in November 2021, in addition to the normal monthly liquidations as a result of payments collected on the retail notes.

During 2021, the Company issued $7,418.3 million and retired $5,710.4 million of long-term external borrowings, which primarily consisted of medium-term notes. During 2021, the Company also issued $2,800.8 million and retired $2,861.5 million of retail note securitization borrowings and maintained an average commercial paper balance of $902.1 million. At October 31, 2021, the Company&#8217;s funding profile included $678.9 million of commercial paper and other notes payable, $4,595.2 million of securitization borrowings, $5,619.4 million of notes payable to John Deere, $26,426.4 million of unsecured term debt, and $4,526.2 million of equity capital. The Company&#8217;s funding profile may be altered to reflect such factors as relative costs of funding sources, assets available for securitizations, and capital market accessibility.

Total interest-bearing indebtedness amounted to $37,319.9 million at October 31, 2021, compared with $35,145.9 million at November 1, 2020. Total external short-term indebtedness amounted to $11,093.2 million at October 31, 2021, compared with $10,585.3 million at November 1, 2020. Total external long-term indebtedness amounted to $20,607.3 million at October 31, 2021, compared with $19,311.1 million at November 1, 2020. Total notes payable to John Deere amounted to $5,619.4 million at October 31, 2021, compared with $5,249.5 million at November 1, 2020. The ratio of total interest-bearing debt, including securitization indebtedness, to stockholder&#8217;s equity was 8.2 to 1 at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020.

Stockholder&#8217;s equity was $4,526.2 million at October 31, 2021, compared with $4,298.2 million at November 1, 2020. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to net income attributable to the Company of $710.6 million, a change in the cumulative translation adjustment of $15.0 million, and unrealized gains on derivatives of $13.5 million, partially offset by dividend payments of $485.0 million and reductions resulting from the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 of $26.2 million.

Capital Corporation declared and paid cash dividends to JDFS of $485.0 million in 2021 and $275.0 million in 2020. In turn, JDFS paid comparable dividends to Deere &#38; Company.

Contractual Obligations and Cash Requirements 

The Company&#8217;s material contractual cash obligations relate to borrowings, including securitization borrowings. As of October 31, 2021, the Company had $14,081.3 million of principal payments on borrowings and securitization borrowings payable in the next year, along with interest payments of $428.0 million. The securitization borrowing payments are based on the expected liquidation of the related retail notes securitized as well as the repurchase due to the reduced facility capacity (see Note 25). The Company&#8217;s borrowings will likely be replaced with new borrowings to finance the Receivables and Leases portfolio. See Notes 8, 9, and 10 for further detail regarding future contractual payments on intercompany borrowings, securitization borrowings, and long-term external borrowings.

Lines of Credit 

The Company has access to bank lines of credit with various banks throughout the world. Some of the lines are available to both the Company and Deere &#38; Company. Worldwide lines of credit totaled $8,016.0 million at October 31, 2021, $5,770.3 million of which were unused. For the purpose of computing the unused credit lines, commercial paper and short-term bank borrowings, excluding secured borrowings and the current portion of long-term external borrowings, of the Company and John Deere were considered to constitute utilization. Included in the total credit lines at October 31, 2021 was a 364-day credit facility agreement of $3,000.0 million, expiring in fiscal April 2022. In addition, total credit lines included long-term credit facility agreements of $2,500.0 million, expiring in fiscal April 2025, and $2,500.0 million, expiring in fiscal March 2026. The agreements are mutually extendable and the annual facility fees are not significant. These credit agreements require the Company to maintain its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges at not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter and its ratio of senior debt, excluding securitization indebtedness, to capital base (total subordinated debt and stockholder&#8217;s equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) at not more than 11 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. All of the requirements of the credit agreements have been met during the periods included in the consolidated financial statements.

Debt Ratings 

The Company&#8217;s ability to obtain funding is affected by its debt ratings, which are closely related to the outlook for and the financial condition of John Deere, and the nature and availability of support facilities, such as its lines of credit and the support agreement with Deere &#38; Company.

To access public debt capital markets, the Company relies on credit rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings to the Company&#8217;s securities as an indicator of credit quality for fixed income investors. A securities rating is not a recommendation by the rating agency to buy, sell, or hold the Company&#8217;s securities. A credit rating agency may change or withdraw Company ratings based on its assessment of the Company&#8217;s current and future ability to meet interest and principal repayment obligations. Each agency&#8217;s rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs, including costs of derivative transactions, and reduced access to debt capital markets.

The senior long-term and short-term debt ratings and outlook currently assigned to unsecured Company debt securities by the rating agencies engaged by the Company are the same as those for John Deere. Those ratings are as follows:

##TABLE_END Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant effect on the financial statements. The accounting policies below are those management believes are the most critical to the preparation of the Company&#8217;s financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. The Company&#8217;s other accounting policies are described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of the Company&#8217;s Receivable portfolio. The allowance is measured on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Risk characteristics considered by the Company include product category, market, geography, credit risk, and remaining duration. Receivables that do not share risk characteristics with other receivables in the portfolio are evaluated on an individual basis. Non-performing Receivables are included in the estimate of expected credit losses.

The Company utilizes loss forecast models, which are selected based on the size and credit risk of the underlying pool of receivables, to estimate expected credit losses. Transition matrix models are used for large and complex Customer Receivable pools, while weighted-average remaining maturity models are used for smaller and less complex Customer Receivable pools. Expected credit losses on wholesale receivables are based on historical loss rates, with consideration of current economic conditions and dealer financial risk. The modeled expected credit losses are adjusted based on reasonable and supportable forecasts, which may include economic indicators such as commodity prices, industry equipment sales, unemployment rates, and housing starts. Management reviews each model&#8217;s output quarterly, and qualitative adjustments are incorporated as necessary. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

In 2021, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13, which revised the measurement of credit losses from an incurred loss to an expected loss methodology. Upon adoption, the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses increased $19.7 million with an offset to retained earnings (see Note 3). The allowance for credit losses at November 1, 2020 and November 3, 2019 were not restated under the expected loss methodology. The total allowance for credit losses at October 31, 2021, November 1, 2020, and November 3, 2019 was $129.0 million, $129.1 million, and $100.6 million, respectively. Subsequent to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13, the allowance decreased $19.8 million during 2021, primarily due to lower expected losses in the construction and forestry market, continued improvement in the agriculture 

and turf market, and better than expected performance of accounts granted payment relief due to the economic effects of COVID. These decreases were partially offset by growth in the retail notes and financing leases portfolio (see Note 5). The allowance increase in 2020 was primarily due to the negative economic effects related to COVID and other macroeconomic issues, which significantly affected certain retail borrowers, particularly of construction equipment.

The assumptions used in evaluating the Company&#8217;s exposure to credit losses involve estimates and significant judgment. While the Company believes its allowance is sufficient to provide for losses over the life of its existing Receivables portfolio, different assumptions or changes in economic conditions would result in changes to the allowance for credit losses. Historically, changes in economic conditions have had limited impact on credit losses within the Company&#8217;s wholesale receivable portfolio. Within the Customer Receivables portfolio, credit loss estimates are dependent on a number of factors, including historical portfolio performance, current delinquency levels, and estimated recoveries on defaulted accounts. The Company&#8217;s transition matrix models, which are utilized to estimate credit losses for more than 90 percent of Customer Receivables, use historical portfolio performance and current delinquency levels to forecast future defaults. Estimated recovery rates are applied to the estimated default balance to calculate the expected credit losses. Holding all other factors constant, a 10 percent increase in the transition matrix models&#8217; forecasted defaults as a result of elevated levels of delinquencies, deteriorating roll rates, or otherwise, and a simultaneous 10 percent decrease in recovery rates would have resulted in an increase to the allowance for credit losses of approximately $30 million at October 31, 2021.

Operating Lease Residual Values 

The carrying value of equipment on operating leases is affected by the estimated fair values of the equipment at the end of the lease (residual values). Upon termination of the lease, the equipment is either purchased by the lessee or sold to a third party, in which case the Company may record a gain or a loss for the difference between the estimated residual value and the sale price. The Company estimates residual values at the inception of the lease based on several factors, including lease term, expected hours of usage, historical wholesale sale prices, return experience, intended use of the equipment, market dynamics and trends, and third-party residual guarantees. The Company reviews residual value estimates during the lease term and tests the carrying value of its operating lease assets for impairment when events or circumstances necessitate. Changes in residual value assumptions would affect the amount of depreciation expense and the amount of investment in equipment on operating leases. Depreciation is adjusted prospectively on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term if residual value estimates are revised. The total operating lease residual values at October 31, 2021, November 1, 2020, and November 3, 2019 were $3,547.6 million, and $3,826.3 million, and $3,876.5 million, respectively. The decrease in 2021 was primarily due to a lower operating lease portfolio.

Estimates used in determining end-of-lease market values for equipment on operating leases significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense. Hypothetically, if future market values for this equipment were to decrease 10 percent from the Company&#8217;s present estimates and all the equipment on operating leases were returned to the Company for remarketing at the end of the lease term, the total impact would be to increase the Company&#8217;s annual depreciation for equipment on operating leases by approximately $75 million, after consideration of dealer residual value guarantees. 

Safe Harbor Statement 

Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: Statements under &#8220;Business&#8221; (including under &#8220;Market Conditions&#8221;), &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; (including under &#8220;Overview&#8221; and &#8220;Trends and Economic Conditions&#8221;), and other forward-looking statements herein that relate to future events, expectations, and trends involve factors that are subject to change, and risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. 

Factors that could materially affect the Company&#8217;s operations, access to capital, expenses, and results include changes in, uncertainty surrounding, and the impact of governmental trade, banking, monetary, and fiscal policies, including financial regulatory reform and its effects on the consumer finance industry, derivatives, funding costs, and other areas. Actions by central banks and financial and securities regulators may affect the costs and expenses of financing the Company and the financing rates it is able to offer. The Company&#8217;s business is affected by general economic conditions in the global markets in which the Company operates because deteriorating economic conditions and political instability can result in decreased customer confidence, lower demand for equipment, higher credit losses, and greater currency risk. 

The Company&#8217;s business is also affected by changes in demand and pricing for used equipment and resulting impacts on lease residual values; actions of banks, financing and leasing companies, and other lenders that compete with the Company for customers; capital market disruptions; significant changes in capital market liquidity and associated funding costs; interest rates (including the availability of IBOR reference rates) and foreign currency exchange rates and their volatility; changes to accounting standards; changes in tax rates, estimates, laws, and regulations and Company actions related thereto; changes to and compliance with privacy, banking, and other regulations; changes to and compliance with economic sanctions and export controls laws and regulations; compliance with U.S. and foreign laws when expanding to new markets and otherwise; actions by other regulatory bodies; governmental programs, policies, and tariffs for the benefit of certain industries or sectors; sanctions in particular jurisdictions; retaliatory actions to such changes in trade, banking, monetary, and fiscal policies; the potential default of the U.S. federal government if Congress fails to pass a 2022 budget resolution; the political and social stability of the global markets in which the Company operates; changes in weather and climate patterns; the effects of, or response to, terrorism and security threats; wars and other conflicts; natural disasters; the spread of major epidemics or pandemics (including the COVID pandemic) and government and industry responses to epidemics or pandemics, such as travel restrictions and extended shut downs of businesses; events that damage the Company&#8217;s reputation or brand; significant investigations, claims, lawsuits or other legal proceedings; success of business strategies; labor relations and contracts, including work stoppages and other disruptions; changes in the ability to attract, develop, engage, and retain qualified personnel; the implementation of the smart industrial operating model and other organizational changes; the failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits of cost reduction, productivity, or efficiency efforts; difficulties related to the conversion and implementation of the Company&#8217;s information technology systems; and security breaches, cybersecurity attacks, technology failures and other disruptions to the information technology infrastructure of the Company and John Deere dealers.

Continued uncertainties related to the magnitude, duration, and persistent effects of the COVID pandemic may significantly adversely affect John Deere&#8217;s and the Company&#8217;s business and outlook. These uncertainties include, among other things: the duration and impact of the resurgence in COVID cases in any country, state, or region; the emergence, contagiousness, and threat of new and different strains of virus; the availability, acceptance, and effectiveness of vaccines; additional closures as mandated or otherwise made necessary by governmental authorities; disruptions in the supply chain, including those caused by industry capacity constraints, material availability, and global logistics delays and constraints arising from, among other things, the transportation capacity of ocean shipping containers and a prolonged delay in resumption of operations by one or more of John Deere&#8217;s key suppliers, or the failure of any key suppliers; an increasingly competitive labor market due to a sustained labor shortage or increased turnover caused by the COVID pandemic; additional operating costs due to continued remote working arrangements, adherence to social distancing guidelines, and other COVID-related challenges; increased risk of cyberattacks on network connections used in remote working arrangements; increased privacy-related risks due to processing health-related personal information; legal claims related to alleged exposure to COVID on Company premises; absence of employees due to illness; and the impact of the pandemic on the Company&#8217;s customers and on John Deere dealers. The sustainability of the economic recovery observed in 2021 remains unclear and significant volatility could continue for a prolonged period. These factors, and others that are currently unknown or considered immaterial, could materially and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, liquidity, results of operations, and financial position.

Significant changes in market liquidity conditions, changes in the Company&#8217;s credit ratings, and any failure to comply with financial covenants in credit agreements could impact access to funding and funding costs, which could reduce the Company&#8217;s earnings and cash flows. Financial market conditions could also negatively impact customer access to capital for purchases of John Deere&#8217;s products and customer confidence and purchase decisions, financing and repayment practices, and the number and size of customer delinquencies and defaults. A debt crisis in Europe, Latin America, or elsewhere could negatively impact currencies, global financial markets, social and political stability, funding sources and costs, asset and obligation values, customers, and Company operations and results. The Company&#8217;s operations could be impaired by changes in the equity, bond, and other financial markets, which would negatively affect earnings.

Continued effects of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union could adversely affect business activity, political stability, and economic conditions in the United Kingdom, the European Union, and elsewhere. The economic conditions and outlook could be further adversely affected by (i) uncertainty regarding any new or modified trade arrangements between the United Kingdom and the European Union and/or other countries, (ii) the risk that one or more other European Union countries could come under increasing pressure to leave the European Union, or (iii) the risk 

that the euro as the single currency of the eurozone could cease to exist. Any of these developments could affect the Company&#8217;s businesses, liquidity, results of operations, and financial position.

The liquidity and ongoing profitability of the Company depend largely on timely access to capital in order to meet future cash flow requirements, and to fund operations, costs, and purchases of John Deere&#8217;s products. If general economic conditions deteriorate or capital markets become more volatile, funding could be unavailable or insufficient. Additionally, customer confidence levels may result in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could materially impact the Company&#8217;s write-offs and provision for credit losses.

The Company&#8217;s forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions relating to the factors described above, which are sometimes based upon estimates and data prepared by government agencies. Such estimates and data are often revised. The Company, except as required by law, undertakes no obligation to update or revise its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. In addition, the Company&#8217;s business is closely related to John Deere&#8217;s business. Further information, including factors that could materially affect the Company&#8217;s and John Deere&#8217;s financial results, is included in the most recent Deere &#38; Company Annual Report on Form 10-K (including, but not limited to, the factors discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors of the Annual Report on Form 10-K) and other Deere &#38; Company and Capital Corporation quarterly and other filings with the SEC.
