 Item 2.&#8194;&#8194;&#8197; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . 

Results of Operations 

Overview 

Organization 

The Company primarily generates revenues and cash by financing John Deere dealers&#8217; sales and leases of new and used production and precision agriculture, small agriculture and turf, and construction and forestry equipment. In addition, the Company also provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment and finances retail revolving charge accounts. 

Smart Industrial Operating Model and Leap Ambitions 

John Deere&#8217;s Smart Industrial operating model is focused on making significant investments in strengthening its capabilities in digital, automation, autonomy, and alternative propulsion technologies. These technologies are intended to increase worksite efficiency, improve yields, lower input costs, and ease labor constraints. John Deere&#8217;s Leap Ambitions are goals designed to boost economic value and sustainability for John Deere&#8217;s customers. As an enabling business, the Company is fully integrated with John Deere&#8217;s Smart Industrial operating model and is focused on providing financial solutions to help John Deere achieve its Leap Ambitions. John Deere and the Company anticipate opportunities in this area, as John Deere, the Company, and their customers have a vested interest in sustainable practices.

In February 2023, John Deere released its 2022 Sustainability Report, available at JohnDeere.com/sustainability. This report identifies important progress on John Deere&#8217;s Leap Ambitions in fiscal year 2022. The information in John Deere&#8217;s 2022 Sustainability Report is not incorporated by reference into, and does not form a part of, this Form 10-Q.

Trends and Economic Conditions 

The Company&#8217;s volume of Receivables and Leases is largely dependent upon the level of retail sales and leases of John Deere products. The level of John Deere retail sales and leases is responsive to a variety of economic, financial, climatic, legislative, and other factors that influence supply and demand for its products.

Industry Trends for Fiscal Year 2023 

Industry sales of large agricultural machinery in the U.S. and Canada for 2023 are forecasted to increase 5 to 10 percent compared to 2022. Industry sales of small agricultural and turf equipment in the U.S. and Canada are expected to be down about 5 percent in 2023. Industry sales of agricultural machinery in Europe are forecasted to be flat to up 5 percent, while South American industry sales of tractors and combines are expected to be flat to up 5 percent in 2023. Asia industry sales are forecasted to be down moderately in 2023. On an industry basis, North American construction equipment and compact construction equipment sales are both expected to be flat to up 5 percent in 2023. Global forestry and global roadbuilding industry sales are each expected to be flat.

John Deere Trends 

Customers&#8217; demand for integration of technology into equipment is a market trend underlying John Deere&#8217;s Smart Industrial operating model and Leap Ambitions framework. Customers have sought to improve profitability, productivity, and sustainability through technology. John Deere&#8217;s approach to technology involves hardware and software, guidance, connectivity and digital solutions, automation and machine intelligence, autonomy, and alternative propulsion technologies. This technology is incorporated into products within each of John Deere&#8217;s operating segments. Customers continue to adopt technology integrated in the John Deere portfolio of &#8220;smart&#8221; machines, systems, and solutions. The Company expects this trend to persist for the foreseeable future.

Demand for John Deere&#8217;s equipment remains strong, as order books are full through a majority of 2023. Agricultural fundamentals are expected to remain solid into 2023, and retail demand will comprise most of 2023 

&#8203; 

sales. The North American retail customer fleet age of combines and large tractors remains above average, and dealer inventories are historically low due to the manufacturing and supply chain constraints over the past few years. John Deere expects the replenishment of dealer stock inventory to occur in 2024. Crop prices remain favorable to John Deere customers in part due to low stock-to-use ratios for key grains. John Deere expects to sell more large agricultural equipment in 2023 than 2022 in North America, Europe, and South America. Demand for small agricultural equipment remains stable, while turf and utility equipment product sales are expected to be lower due to the overall U.S. economic conditions. Construction equipment markets are forecasted to be steady. Rental fleets replenishment, the energy industry, and U.S. infrastructure spend are expected to offset moderation in residential home construction. Roadbuilding demand remains strongest in the U.S., largely offset by softening demand in Europe and parts of Asia.

John Deere experienced supply chain disruptions in 2022, which continued into 2023. Supply chain disruptions impacted many aspects of John Deere&#8217;s business, including parts availability, increased production costs, and higher inventory levels. Past due deliveries from suppliers were at elevated levels during 2022. Although past due deliveries remain elevated, John Deere experienced improvement during the first quarter of 2023. The reduction in supply chain disruptions contributed to higher levels of production. John Deere implemented mitigation efforts to minimize the impact of supply chain disruptions on its ability to meet customer demand. While supply chain disruptions are expected to persist into 2023, John Deere is working diligently to secure the parts and components that customers need to deliver essential food and infrastructure more profitably and sustainably. Although John Deere experienced some improvement in this area during the first quarter of 2023, concerns remain, and this issue could impact John Deere&#8217;s ability to meet customer demand in the remainder of 2023.

Company Trends 

Net income for the Company in fiscal 2023 is expected to be lower than fiscal 2022 primarily due to less favorable financing spreads, higher selling, administrative, and general expenses, and lower gains on operating lease dispositions. These factors are expected to be partially offset by income earned on a higher average portfolio, driven by strong demand of John Deere&#8217;s products in 2023, which is favorably impacting forecasted financing volumes.

Central bank policy interest rates increased in the first quarter of 2023 and are projected to continue to increase during 2023, but at a moderating pace compared to 2022. Most of the Company&#8217;s Customer Receivables are fixed rate, while its wholesale receivables generally earn a floating rate. The Company has both fixed and floating rate borrowings. The Company manages the risk of interest rate fluctuations by balancing the types and amounts of its funding sources to its Receivable and Lease portfolios. Accordingly, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate exposure. Historically, rising interest rates impact the Company&#8217;s borrowings sooner than the benefit is realized from the Receivable and Lease portfolio. As a result, the Company&#8217;s financing spread was unfavorably impacted by $50.0 million (after-tax) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. The Company expects spread compression to persist during 2023.

Inflation was a pervasive feature throughout 2022, and the Company expects inflation to continue in 2023. The Company&#8217;s estimation of credit losses may be negatively impacted in the event customers&#8217; operations are negatively impacted due to inflation or rising interest rates. As part of the process to establish the allowance for credit losses, the Company continues to monitor the economy, including potential impacts of inflation and rising interest rates, among other factors, and qualitative adjustments to the allowance are incorporated as necessary. As of January 29, 2023, impacts of inflation and interest rates did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s allowance. 

As the Company&#8217;s volume of Receivables and Leases is largely dependent upon the level of retail sales and leases of John Deere products, supply chain disruptions could impact the Company&#8217;s future volumes. Despite supply chain challenges, the Company&#8217;s volumes are forecast to grow in 2023, driven by strong demand for John Deere equipment. 

Supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, and rising interest rates are driven by factors outside of the Company&#8217;s control, and as a result, the Company cannot reasonably foresee when these conditions will subside. 

&#8203; 

For additional information regarding the impact of supply chain disruptions, including mitigation efforts to minimize the impact of potential supply chain disruptions on John Deere&#8217;s ability to meet customer demand, as well as inflationary pressures, refer to Item 2. &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212;Trends and Economic Conditions&#8221; included in Deere &#38; Company&#8217;s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended January 29, 2023.

Items of Concern and Uncertainties 

Other items of concern include global and regional political conditions, economic and trade policies, imposition of new or retaliatory tariffs against certain countries or covering certain products, post-pandemic effects, capital market disruptions, changes in demand and pricing for new and used equipment, significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and volatility in the prices of many commodities. These items could impact the Company&#8217;s results. John Deere and the Company are making investments in technology and in strengthening capabilities in digital, automation, autonomy, and alternative propulsion technologies. As with most technology investments, marketplace adoption and monetization of these features holds an elevated level of uncertainty.

Total revenues increased for the first quarter of 2023 primarily due to a 16% increase in average portfolio balances, in addition to higher average financing rates compared to the same period last year. Net income for the first quarter was lower compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to less favorable financing spreads, higher selling, administrative, and general expenses, and lower gains on operating lease dispositions, partially offset by income earned on higher average portfolio balances.

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

Finance income earned on retail notes, revolving charge accounts, and wholesale receivables increased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, due to higher average financing rates and higher average portfolio balances. Lease revenues were about the same for each period.

Other income decreased in the first quarter of 2023 due to lower gains on operating lease dispositions. While demand for used equipment remains strong, lease gains declined in the first quarter as end-of-lease book values are now more closely aligned with equipment sale proceeds. This decrease was partially offset by higher interest earned on the Company&#8217;s cash and cash equivalents.

Revenues earned from John Deere totaled $208.2 million for the first quarter of 2023, compared with $138.7 million for the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to increased compensation paid by John Deere on wholesale receivables and retail notes, driven by a higher interest rate environment, in addition to higher average portfolio balances. Revenues earned from John Deere are included in each of the revenue amounts discussed above.

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

The increase in interest expense for the first quarter of 2023 was primarily due to higher average borrowing rates and higher average borrowings. 

Depreciation of equipment on operating leases for the first quarter of 2023 decreased slightly due to lower average balances of equipment on operating leases.

Administrative and operating expenses increased in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher dealer incentive program costs and higher employment costs, including incentive compensation.

Fees and interest paid to John Deere increased in 2023 primarily due to higher interest on intercompany borrowings from John Deere driven by higher average borrowing rates.

&#8203; 

The provision (credit) for credit losses increased slightly in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period last year, primarily due to net recoveries on revolving charge accounts in the prior year period, which did not recur this year. The annualized provision (credit) for credit losses, as a percentage of the average balance of total Receivables, was .03 percent for the first quarter of 2023, compared with (.01) percent for the same period last year.

The provision for income taxes decreased during the first quarter of 2023 primarily due to lower pretax income in the current quarter.

Customer Receivables increased $3,486.2 million compared to one year ago due to strong John Deere retail sales. Wholesale receivables increased $1,347.6 million in the first three months of 2023 and $3,440.1 million compared to one year ago due to higher shipment volumes of John Deere equipment.

Receivables 30 days or more past due continue to accrue finance income. The Company ceases to accrue finance income once Receivables are considered non-performing. An allowance for credit losses is recorded for the estimated credit losses expected over the life of the Receivable portfolio. The Company measures expected credit losses on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Risk characteristics considered by the Company include product category, market, geography, credit risk, and remaining duration. Receivables that do not share risk characteristics with other receivables in the portfolio are evaluated on an individual basis. Non-performing Receivables are included in the estimate of expected credit losses. While the Company believes its allowance is sufficient to provide for losses over the life of its existing Receivable portfolio, different assumptions or changes in economic conditions would result in changes to the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses. See Note 4 for additional information related to the allowance for credit losses.

Deposits held from dealers and merchants amounted to $127.8 million at January 29, 2023, compared with $137.3 million at October 30, 2022 and $126.1 million at January 30, 2022. These balances primarily represent the aggregate dealer retail note and lease withholding accounts from individual John Deere dealers to which losses from retail notes and leases originating from the respective dealers can be charged. Recoveries from dealer deposits are recognized in other income when the dealer&#8217;s withholding account is charged. Recoveries from dealer deposits and other freestanding credit enhancements recorded in other income were $2.0 million in the first quarter of 2023, compared with $1.1 million for the same period last year.

Write-offs and recoveries of Receivables, by product, and as an annualized percentage of average balances held during the period, were as follows (in millions of dollars):

Critical Accounting Estimates 

See the Company&#8217;s critical accounting estimates discussed in Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Company&#8217;s most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to these estimates. 

Capital Resources and Liquidity 

For additional information on the Company&#8217;s dependence on, and relationship with, Deere &#38; Company, see the Company&#8217;s most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Sources of Liquidity, Key Metrics and Balance Sheet Data 

The Company relies on its ability to raise substantial amounts of funds to finance its Receivable and Lease portfolios. The Company has access to most global markets at a reasonable cost. The Company&#8217;s ability to meet its debt obligations is supported in several ways. The assets of the Company are self-liquidating in nature. A solid equity position is available to absorb unusual losses on these assets, and all commercial paper is backed by unsecured, committed borrowing lines from various banks. Liquidity is also provided by the Company&#8217;s ability to securitize its retail notes and through the issuance of term debt in both public and private markets. Additionally, liquidity may be provided through loans from John Deere. The Company closely monitors its liquidity sources against the cash requirements and expects to have sufficient sources of global funding and liquidity to meet its funding needs in the short-term (next 12 months) and long-term (beyond 12 months).

Key metrics and certain balance sheet data are provided in the following table, in millions of dollars:

&#8203; 

Net cash was used for investing activities during the first three months of 2023 primarily due to growth in wholesale receivables and notes receivable from John Deere, partially offset by a seasonal decrease in revolving charge account receivables. Net cash used by investing activities was funded primarily through external borrowings and cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by a reduction in borrowings from John Deere.

&#8203; 

Borrowings 

Total borrowings increased $635.3 million in the first three months of 2023 and increased $6,472.1 million compared to a year ago, generally corresponding with the level of the Receivable and Lease portfolios, as well as the level of cash and cash equivalents. During the first three months of 2023, the Company issued $2,298.9 million and retired $1,618.5 million of long-term external borrowings, which primarily consisted of medium-term notes. During the first three months of 2023, the Company also retired $849.3 million of retail note securitization borrowings and maintained an average commercial paper balance of $3,331.5 million. The Company&#8217;s funding profile may be altered to reflect such factors as relative costs of funding sources, assets available for securitizations, and capital market accessibility.

The Company has a revolving warehouse facility to utilize bank conduit facilities to securitize retail notes (see Note 5). The facility was renewed in November 2022 with an expiration in November 2023 and increased the total capacity or &#8220;financing limit&#8221; from $1,000.0 million to $1,500.0 million. At January 29, 2023, $786.0 million of securitization borrowings were outstanding under the facility. At the end of the contractual revolving period, unless the banks and the Company agree to renew, the Company would liquidate the secured borrowings over time as payments on the retail notes are collected.

Lines of Credit 

The Company has access to bank lines of credit with various banks throughout the world. Some of the lines are available to both the Company and Deere &#38; Company. Worldwide lines of credit totaled $8,029.0 million at January 29, 2023, $1,580.5 million of which were unused. For the purpose of computing the unused credit lines, commercial paper and short-term bank borrowings of the Company and John Deere, excluding secured borrowings and the current portion of long-term external borrowings, were considered to constitute utilization. Included in the total credit lines at January 29, 2023 was a 364-day credit facility agreement of $3,000.0 million, expiring in the second quarter of 2023. In addition, total credit lines included long-term credit facility agreements of $2,500.0 million, expiring in the second quarter of 2026, and $2,500.0 million, expiring in the second quarter of 2027. The Company expects to extend the terms of these credit facilities. These credit agreements require the Company to maintain its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges at not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter and its ratio of senior debt, excluding securitization indebtedness, to capital base (total subordinated debt and stockholder&#8217;s equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) at not more than 11 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. All of these credit agreement requirements have been met during the periods included in the consolidated financial statements.

Debt Ratings 

The Company&#8217;s ability to obtain funding is affected by its debt ratings, which are closely related to the outlook for and the financial condition of John Deere, and the nature and availability of support facilities, such as the Company&#8217;s lines of credit and the support agreement from Deere &#38; Company.

To access public debt capital markets, the Company relies on credit rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings to the Company&#8217;s securities as an indicator of credit quality for fixed income investors. A security rating is not a recommendation by the rating agency to buy, sell, or hold the Company&#8217;s securities. A credit rating agency may change or withdraw ratings based on its assessment of the Company&#8217;s current and future ability to meet interest and principal repayment obligations. Each agency&#8217;s rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs, including costs of derivative transactions, and reduced access to debt capital markets. 

&#8203; 

The senior long-term and short-term debt ratings and outlook currently assigned to unsecured Company debt securities by the rating agencies engaged by the Company are the same as those for John Deere. Those ratings are as follows:
