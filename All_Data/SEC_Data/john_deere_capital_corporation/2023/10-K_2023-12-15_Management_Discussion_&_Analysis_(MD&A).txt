 Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The MD&#38;A is intended to promote understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The MD&#38;A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For comparison of 2022 to 2021 results, refer to the &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis&#8221; section of our 2022 Form 10-K.

Results of Operations 

Overview 

Organization 

We provide financial solutions that enable John Deere customers and dealers to advance their lives and livelihoods. Through our offering of retail notes, leases, and revolving charge accounts, customers are able to finance new and used John Deere equipment, as well as parts, services, and other input costs needed to run their operations. We also provide wholesale financing to John Deere dealers.

Smart Industrial Operating Model and Leap Ambitions 

John Deere announced the Smart Industrial Operating Model in 2020. This operating model is based on three focus areas: 

##TABLE_START (a) Production systems: A strategic alignment of products and solutions around John Deere customers&#8217; operations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (b) Technology stack: Investments in technology, as well as research and development, that deliver intelligent solutions to John Deere customers through digital capabilities, automation, autonomy, and alternative power technologies. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (c) Lifecycle solutions: The integration of John Deere&#8217;s aftermarket and support capabilities to more effectively manage customer equipment, service, and technology needs across the full lifetime of a John Deere product. ##TABLE_END 

John Deere&#8217;s Leap Ambitions were launched in 2022. These ambitions are designed to boost economic value and sustainability. The ambitions align across the production systems of John Deere customers, seeking to optimize their operations to deliver better outcomes with fewer resources. As an enabling business, we are fully integrated with John Deere&#8217;s Smart Industrial Operating Model and are focused on providing financial solutions to help John Deere achieve its Leap Ambitions. 

Trends and Economic Conditions 

Our volume of Receivables and Leases is largely dependent upon the level of retail sales and leases of John Deere products. The level of John Deere retail sales and leases is responsive to a variety of economic, financial, climatic, legislative, and other factors that influence supply and demand for its products. 

Industry Sales Outlook for Fiscal Year 2024 

John Deere Trends 

Customers seek to improve profitability, productivity, and sustainability through technology. Integration of technology into equipment is a persistent market trend. John Deere&#8217;s Smart Industrial Operating Model and Leap Ambitions are intended to capitalize on this market trend. The technologies that are the focus of John Deere&#8217;s operating model are incorporated into products within each of John Deere&#8217;s operating segments. We expect this trend to persist for the foreseeable future.

Agriculture and Turf Outlook for 2024 

##TABLE_START &#9679; John Deere expects large agricultural equipment sales to decline in 2024 in North America, Europe, and South America. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Demand for small agricultural equipment is expected to moderate in Europe. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Turf and utility equipment product sales are expected to be lower due to the overall U.S. economic condition and elevated interest rates. ##TABLE_END &#8203; 

Market Conditions:

##TABLE_START &#9679; Agricultural fundamentals are expected to moderate in 2024 due to lower commodity prices and elevated interest rates, offset by declining input costs and improved customer financials. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; The dairy and livestock sector continues to benefit from elevated protein and hay prices. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Farm input costs in Europe are declining. Grain prices vary from favorable in Western Europe to depressed in Eastern Europe due to the Russia/Ukraine war. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; The fleet average age is older than in prior business cycles. Combines are in line with the historical average age, while tractors are slightly older than historical averages. ##TABLE_END 

Construction and Forestry Outlook for 2024 

Market Conditions:

##TABLE_START &#9679; Construction equipment industry sales are forecasted to be down from 2023 levels. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Benefits from rental fleet replenishment, the energy industry, and U.S. infrastructure spending are expected to partially offset moderation in residential home, office, and retail construction. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Roadbuilding demand remains strong similar to 2023 in the U.S., largely offset by softening demand in Europe. ##TABLE_END 

Company Trends 

Our net income in fiscal year 2024 is expected to be higher due to income earned on a higher average portfolio and lower dealer financing incentives, partially offset by less favorable financing spreads and lower gains on operating lease dispositions.

Central bank policy interest rates increased in 2022 and 2023. Most of our receivables and leases with retail customers are fixed rate, while our wholesale receivables generally are variable rate. This Receivable and Lease portfolio is financed with fixed and variable rate borrowings. We manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations by matching the interest rate characteristics of our portfolio with our funding sources. We also enter into interest rate swap agreements to match our interest rate exposure. 

Rising interest rates have historically impacted our borrowings sooner than the benefit is realized from our Receivable and Lease portfolio. As a result, we experienced $152.6 (after-tax) less favorable financing spreads in 2023 compared to 2022. If interest rates continue to rise, we expect to continue experiencing spread compression in 2024. 

Rising interest rates are driven by factors outside of our control, and as a result, we cannot reasonably foresee when this condition will subside.

Other Items of Concern and Uncertainties 

Other items that could impact our results are: 

##TABLE_START &#9679; global and regional political conditions, including the war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; economic, tax, and trade policies, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; new or retaliatory tariffs, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; capital market disruptions, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; foreign currency and capital control policies, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; regulations and legislation regarding right to repair, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; weather conditions, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; marketplace adoption and monetization of technologies we have invested in, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; John Deere&#8217;s and our ability to strengthen our digital capabilities, automation, autonomy, and alternative power technologies, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; changes in demand and pricing for new and used equipment, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; volatility in the prices of many commodities, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; slower economic growth or possible recession. ##TABLE_END 

Financing Incentives 

In the second quarter of 2023, we corrected the accounting treatment for financing incentives offered to John Deere dealers. Refer to Note 1, Note 2, and Note 23 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information. While prior period amounts have been restated for comparability, the impact of the correction in periods prior to the quarter ended April 30, 2023 was not material to our consolidated financial statements in any of the impacted periods.

##TABLE_END Total revenues increased in 2023 primarily due to a 22 percent increase in average Receivable balances and higher average financing rates on Receivables of 6.3 percent in 2023 compared to 4.5 percent in 2022. Net income in 2023 was lower than 2022 due to less favorable financing spreads, a higher provision for credit losses, unfavorable derivative market valuation 

adjustments (presented in Other in the bar below), lower gains on operating lease dispositions, and higher selling, administrative, and general expenses. These factors were partially offset by income earned on a higher average portfolio.

&#8203; 

##TABLE_END Higher average financing rates and higher average portfolio balances drove increased revenues across all products during 2023. The change was most pronounced within wholesale receivables, due to a 67 percent increase in average portfolio balances and an increase in the average financing rate from 4.9 percent in 2022 to 7.7 percent in 2023. The majority of wholesale receivables earn a variable rate of interest. Lease revenues were up only slightly, driven by a relatively stable operating lease portfolio, with average balances up 1 percent over 2022.

Other income increased in 2023 primarily due to higher interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and intercompany receivables from John Deere, partially offset by lower gains on operating lease dispositions. While demand for used equipment remains strong, lease gains were lower during 2023 as end-of-lease values are now more closely aligned with equipment sale proceeds.

Revenues earned from John Deere totaled $1,027.9 in 2023, compared with $643.1 in 2022. The increase was primarily the result of higher compensation paid by John Deere on wholesale receivables and retail notes, driven by a higher interest rate environment and higher average portfolio balances. Revenues earned from John Deere are included in each of the revenue amounts discussed above.

&#8203; 

##TABLE_END The increase in interest expense in 2023 was primarily due to higher average borrowing rates due to rising interest rates and higher average borrowings to fund a larger portfolio.

Administrative and operating expenses increased during 2023 due to higher dealer financing incentive program costs driven by increased finance volumes, in addition to higher employment costs, including incentive compensation.

Fees and interest paid to John Deere increased in 2023 primarily due to higher interest on intercompany borrowings from John Deere driven by higher average borrowing rates. This was partially offset by a one-time payment to Deere &#38; Company in 2022 that did not recur in 2023, related to unrealized gains on certain non-designated derivatives assumed by Deere &#38; Company.

The provision for credit losses increased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to higher write-offs on retail notes and revolving charge accounts, an increase in allowance driven by growth in the retail notes and financing lease portfolios, and higher expected losses on turf and construction customer accounts.

The lower provision for income taxes in 2023 was primarily due lower pretax income.

##TABLE_END We monitor the credit quality of Receivables based on delinquency status. Receivables 30 days or more past due continue to accrue finance income. We stop accruing finance income once Receivables are considered non-performing, which generally occurs once Receivables are 90 days past due. An allowance for credit losses is recorded for the estimated credit losses expected over the life of the Receivable portfolio.

Deposits held from dealers and merchants amounted to $138.4 at October 29, 2023, compared with $137.3 at October 30, 2022. These balances primarily represent the aggregate dealer retail note and lease withholding accounts from individual John Deere dealers to which losses from retail notes and leases originating from the respective dealers can be charged. Recoveries from dealer deposits are recognized in &#8220;Other income&#8221; when the dealer&#8217;s withholding account is charged. Recoveries from dealer deposits and other freestanding credit enhancements recorded in other income in 2023 and 2022 were $17.0 and $8.5, respectively.

Capital Resources and Liquidity 

Sources of Liquidity, Key Metrics, and Balance Sheet Data 

We rely on our ability to raise substantial amounts of funds to finance our Receivable and Lease portfolios. We have access to most global markets at a reasonable cost and our ability to meet our debt obligations is supported in several ways. Sources of liquidity include: 

##TABLE_START &#9679; cash and cash equivalents, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; the issuance of commercial paper and term debt, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; the securitization of retail notes, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; intercompany loans from John Deere, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; our Receivable and Lease portfolio, which is self-liquidating in nature, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; bank lines of credit. ##TABLE_END 

We closely monitor our liquidity sources against our cash requirements and expect to have sufficient sources of global funding and liquidity to meet our funding needs in the short-term (next 12 months) and long-term (beyond 12 months).

Key metrics and certain balance sheet data are provided in the following table as of October 29, 2023, October 30, 2022, and October 31, 2021:

##TABLE_END &#8203; 

Net cash used for investing activities increased during 2023 primarily due to growth in the Receivable portfolio, which was funded primarily through external borrowings, cash provided by operating activities, and capital investments from John Deere, partially offset by a reduction in borrowings from John Deere.

&#8203; 

Borrowings 

Total borrowings increased $8,658.4 in 2023, corresponding with the level of the Receivable and Lease portfolios. During 2023, we issued $11,184.2 and retired $5,972.1 of long-term external borrowings, which primarily consisted of medium-term notes. During 2023, we also issued $4,479.6 and retired $3,194.5 of retail note securitization borrowings and maintained an average commercial paper balance of $4,910.9. Our funding profile may be altered to reflect such factors as relative costs of funding sources, assets available for securitizations, and capital market accessibility.

We have a revolving credit agreement to securitize retail notes (see Note 5). At October 29, 2023, the revolving credit agreement had a total capacity, or &#8220;financing limit,&#8221; of $1,500.0 of secured financings at any time. $1,281.4 of short-term securitization borrowings were outstanding under the agreement at October 29, 2023. At the end of the contractual revolving period, unless we and the banks agree to renew, we would liquidate the secured borrowings over time as payments on the retail notes are collected. The agreement was renewed in November 2023 with an expiration in November 2024 and a capacity of $2,000.0.

Capital Investments and Dividends 

During 2023, Deere &#38; Company increased its capital investment in JDFS by $810.0. JDFS, in turn, increased its capital investment in Capital Corporation by the same amount. The capital investments were made to maintain targeted leverage ratios and were driven by growth in total Receivables and corresponding borrowings. There were no capital investments during 2022.

Capital Corporation declared and paid cash dividends to JDFS of $165.0 in 2023 and $370.0 in 2022. In turn, JDFS paid comparable dividends to Deere &#38; Company.

Lines of Credit 

We have access to bank lines of credit with various banks throughout the world. Some of the lines are available to both us and Deere &#38; Company. Worldwide lines of credit totaled $10,215.7 at October 29, 2023, $841.2 of which were unused. For the purpose of computing the unused credit lines, commercial paper and short-term bank borrowings of us and John Deere were considered to constitute utilization. See Note 8 for more information.

Debt Ratings 

Our ability to obtain funding is affected by our debt ratings, which are closely related to the outlook for and the financial condition of John Deere, and the nature and availability of support facilities, such as our lines of credit and the support agreement from Deere &#38; Company.

To access debt markets, we rely on credit rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings to our debt. These ratings are an indicator of credit quality for fixed income investors. A debt rating is not a recommendation by the rating agency to buy, sell, or hold. A credit rating agency may change or withdraw ratings based on its assessment of our current and future ability to meet interest and principal repayment obligations. Lower credit ratings or negative changes to 

ratings outlooks generally result in higher borrowing costs, including costs of derivative transactions, and reduced access to debt capital markets, and may adversely impact our liquidity.

The senior long-term and short-term debt ratings and outlook currently assigned to our unsecured debt securities by the rating agencies engaged by us are the same as those for John Deere and are as follows:

##TABLE_END Contractual Obligations and Cash Requirements 

Our material cash requirements from contractual and other cash obligations relate to borrowings, including securitization borrowings. As of October 29, 2023, we had $18,865.9 of principal payments on borrowings and securitization borrowings payable in the next 12 months, along with interest payments of $1,612.4. The securitization borrowing payments are based on the expected liquidation of the related retail notes securitized. Our borrowings will likely be replaced with new borrowings to finance the Receivables and Leases portfolio. See Notes 5, 7, and 9 for further detail regarding future contractual payments on securitization borrowings, intercompany borrowings, and long-term external borrowings.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The timely preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Those estimates affect reported amounts in these financial statements. Changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements. The following estimates are the most critical to our consolidated financial statements:

##TABLE_START &#9679; allowance for credit losses, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; operating lease residual values, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; income taxes. ##TABLE_END 

These items require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. Our accounting policies are described primarily in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of our Receivable portfolio. The allowance is measured on a collective basis for receivables with similar risk characteristics. Receivables that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Risk characteristics include: 

##TABLE_START &#9679; product category, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; market, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; geography, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; credit risk, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; remaining balance. ##TABLE_END 

We utilize the following loss forecast models to estimate expected credit losses:

##TABLE_START &#9679; Transition matrix models are used for large and complex Customer Receivable pools. These models are used for more than 90 percent of Customer Receivables. Historical portfolio performance and current delinquency levels are used to forecast future defaults. Estimated recovery rates are applied to the estimated default balance to calculate the expected credit losses. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Weighted-average remaining maturity (WARM) models are used for smaller and less complex Customer Receivable pools. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Historical loss rate models are used for wholesale receivables, with consideration of current economic conditions and dealer financial risk. ##TABLE_END 

The model output is adjusted for forecasted economic conditions which may include the following economic indicators: 

##TABLE_START &#9679; commodity prices, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; industry equipment sales, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; unemployment rates, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; housing starts. ##TABLE_END 

Management reviews each model&#8217;s output quarterly, and qualitative adjustments are incorporated as necessary. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

The allowance for credit losses at October 29, 2023, October 30, 2022, and October 31, 2021 was $146.4, $128.4, and $129.0, respectively. The allowance for credit losses increased in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily driven by growth in the retail notes and financing lease portfolios and higher expected losses on turf and construction customer accounts.

While we believe our allowance is sufficient to provide for losses over the life of our existing Receivables portfolio, different assumptions would result in changes to the allowance for credit losses, specifically:

##TABLE_START &#9679; For the wholesale receivable portfolio : Changes in economic conditions have historically had limited impact on credit losses. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Within the Customer Receivables portfolio : Credit loss estimates are dependent on a number of factors, including historical portfolio performance, current delinquency levels, and estimated recoveries on defaulted accounts. ##TABLE_END 

Holding all other factors constant, a 10 percent increase in the transition matrix models&#8217; forecasted defaults as a result of elevated levels of delinquencies, deteriorating roll rates, or otherwise, and a simultaneous 10 percent decrease in recovery rates would have resulted in an increase to the allowance for credit losses of approximately $40 at October 29, 2023.

Operating Lease Residual Values 

Equipment on operating leases is depreciated to the estimated residual value over the lease term. The residual values are based on several factors, including:

##TABLE_START &#9679; lease term, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; expected hours of usage, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; historical wholesale sale prices, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; return experience, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; intended equipment use, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; market dynamics and trends, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; dealer residual value guarantees. ##TABLE_END 

We review residual value estimates during the lease term. Depreciation is adjusted over the remaining lease term if residual value estimates are revised. Impairments are recorded when events or circumstances necessitate. 

At the end of the majority of leases, the equipment is disposed in the following sequence: 

##TABLE_START &#9679; The lessee has the option to purchase the equipment for the contractual residual value. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; The dealer has the option to purchase the equipment. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; The equipment is sold to a third party at the equipment&#8217;s fair value. In this situation, we may record a gain or loss for the difference between the residual value and the sale price. ##TABLE_END 

The total operating lease residual values at October 29, 2023, October 30, 2022, and October 31, 2021 were $3,538.3, $3,366.7, and $3,547.6, respectively. The increase in 2023 was primarily due to a higher operating lease portfolio.

Hypothetically, if (a) future market values for equipment on operating leases were to decrease 10 percent from our present estimates and (b) all the equipment on operating leases were returned to us for remarketing at the end of the lease term, the total unfavorable impact after consideration of dealer residual value guarantees would be approximately $80. This amount would be recognized as higher depreciation expense over the remaining term of the operating leases, or potentially as an impairment. 

Income Taxes 

We are subject to federal, state, and foreign income taxes. These tax laws can be complex. Significant judgment and interpretation is required to implement them. Changes in tax laws could materially affect our consolidated financial statements. We record our tax positions in the following categories:

##TABLE_START &#9679; current taxes, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; deferred taxes, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; uncertain tax positions. ##TABLE_END 

Deferred income taxes represent temporary differences between the tax and the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities. This will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. Loss carryforwards and tax credits are significant components of deferred tax asset balances. These assets are reviewed regularly for the following:

##TABLE_START &#9679; the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; tax planning strategies. ##TABLE_END 

Valuation allowances are established when we determine that the deferred tax benefit may not be realized. The recoverability analysis requires significant judgment and relies on estimates. Changes in foreign income tax laws, income for certain jurisdictions, or our tax structure could impact the valuation allowance balance. 

Some tax positions contain significant uncertainties. These positions may be challenged or disallowed by taxing authorities. If it is likely the position will be disallowed, no tax benefit is recorded. If it is likely the position will be sustained, a tax benefit is recognized. The ultimate resolution could take many years. This may result in a payment that is significantly different from the original estimate. 

See Note 14 for further information on income taxes.
