Rate/Volume Analysis 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2022/June 30, 2022 (in millions) Increase Due to Rate Increase (Decrease) Due to Volume (a) Net Increase Interest Income: Loans $ 130 $ 13 $ 143 Investment securities 4 15 19 Interest-bearing deposits with banks 42 (32) 10 Other short-term investments 1 &#8212; 1 Total interest income 177 (4) 173 Interest Expense: Interest-bearing deposits 13 (1) 12 Short-term borrowings &#8212; 1 1 Medium- and long-term debt 11 3 14 Total interest expense 24 3 27 Net interest income $ 153 $ (7) $ 146 

(a) Impact of additional days and interest rate swaps reflected as part of rate impact, rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume. 

Net interest income was $707 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, an increase of $146 million compared to $561 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The increase in net interest income was driven by higher short-term rates (including the impact of interest rate swaps) and growth in loans and investment securities, partially offset by a decrease in deposits with the Federal Reserve. Net interest margin was 3.50 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2022, an increase of 80 basis points from 2.70 percent for the three months ended June 30, 2022, primarily driven by higher short-term rates and the decrease in lower-yielding deposits with the Federal Reserve. 

Average earning assets decreased $3.1 billion, driven by a $5.7 billion decrease in interest-bearing deposits with banks, partially offset by increases of $1.5 billion in investment securities and $1.1 billion in loans. Average interest-bearing sources decreased $2.2 billion due to a $2.5 billion decrease in interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a $310 million increase in purchased funds. 

For further discussion of the effects of market rates on net interest income, refer to the "Market and Liquidity Risk" section of this financial review. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses, which includes the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments, increased $18 million to $28 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, compared to $10 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022, reflecting loan growth, continued strong credit metrics and an uncertain economic environment. Net loan charge-offs were $13 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, compared to none for the three months ended June 30, 2022, with an increase of $19 million in general Middle Market net charge-offs partially offset by a decrease of $7 million in Technology and Life Sciences net charge-offs. Provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was relatively stable compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022. 

An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and a summary of nonperforming assets are presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review. 

Noninterest Income 

Three Months Ended (in millions) September 30, 2022 June 30, 2022 Card fees $ 67 $ 69 Fiduciary income 58 62 Service charges on deposit accounts 50 50 Derivative income 35 29 Commercial lending fees 29 30 Bank-owned life insurance 12 12 Letter of credit fees 10 9 Brokerage fees 6 4 Other noninterest income (a) 11 3 Total noninterest income $ 278 $ 268 

(a) The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income. 

Noninterest income increased $10 million to $278 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, reflecting increases in other noninterest income, derivative income and brokerage fees, partially offset by decreases in fiduciary income and card fees. The increase in other noninterest income was primarily due to reduced losses on deferred compensation assets, which are offset in noninterest expenses. Higher derivative income was mostly due to energy, while growth in money market revenue drove the increase in brokerage fees. Fiduciary income was impacted by a seasonal decline in tax fees and reduced market performance, partially offset by higher money market rates. 

The following table presents certain categories included in other noninterest income on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 

Three Months Ended (in millions) September 30, 2022 June 30, 2022 Securities trading income $ 4 $ 2 Insurance commissions 3 4 Investment banking fees 1 1 Principal investing and warrant-related income 1 2 Deferred compensation asset returns (a) (3) (14) All other noninterest income 5 8 Other noninterest income $ 11 $ 3 

(a) Compensation deferred by the Corporation's officers and directors is invested based on investment selections of the officers and directors. Income earned on these assets is reported in other noninterest income and the offsetting change in deferred compensation plan liabilities is reported in salaries and benefits expense. 

Noninterest Expenses 

Three Months Ended (in millions) September 30, 2022 June 30, 2022 Salaries and benefits expense $ 307 $ 294 Outside processing fee expense 64 62 Occupancy expense 44 40 Software expense 40 41 Equipment expense 12 13 Advertising expense 9 8 FDIC insurance expense 8 8 Other noninterest expenses 18 16 Total noninterest expenses $ 502 $ 482 

Noninterest expenses increased $20 million to $502 million, driven primarily by increases in salaries and benefits expense, occupancy expense and outside processing fee expense. Salaries and benefits expense included increases in deferred compensation expense (offset in other noninterest income and disclosed above), performance-based compensation and staff insurance, partially offset by a seasonal decrease in 401K expense. Other noninterest expenses included an increase in impairment and loss on sale of assets as well as a favorable state tax ruling recorded in the second quarter, partially offset by decreases in litigation-related expenses and consulting fees. For third quarter 2022, expenses for certain modernization initiatives related to transformation of the retail banking delivery model, alignment of corporate facilities and optimization of technology platforms totaled $7 million, comprised of transitional real estate costs (reported in occupancy expense), asset impairments and consulting fees (reported in other noninterest expenses) and contract labor (reported in salaries and benefits 

expense). Third quarter 2022 expenses for modernization initiatives were consistent with those recorded in second quarter 2022. The Corporation estimates these expenses to be up to $25 million for fourth quarter 2022. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021

Net income decreased $139 million to $801 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to $940 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, driven by a $386 million increase in the provision for credit losses resulting from an elevated benefit recorded throughout 2021 as the U.S. economy recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by an increase in net interest income, reflecting higher short-term rates and growth in investment securities. Net income per diluted common share decreased $0.79 to $5.88 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to $6.67 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021.

(a) Impact of additional days and interest rate swaps reflected as part of rate impact, rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume. 

Net interest income was $1.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, an increase of $341 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase in net interest income reflected higher short-term rates (including the impact of interest rate swaps) and growth in investment securities, partially offset by the net impact of PPP loans and lower deposits with the Federal Reserve. Net interest margin was 2.78 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, an increase of 51 basis points compared to 2.27 percent for the comparable period in 2021. The increase in net interest margin was primarily driven by higher short-term rates. 

Average earning assets decreased $1.4 billion, due to a decrease of $5.3 billion in interest bearing deposits with banks, partially offset by increases of $3.6 billion in investment securities and $307 million in loans. Average interest-bearing sources decreased $1.6 billion, reflecting decreases of $1.3 billion in interest-bearing deposits and $357 million in medium- and long-term debt. 

For further discussion of the effects of market rates on net interest income, refer to the "Market and Liquidity Risk" section of this financial review. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses was an expense of $27 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to a benefit of $359 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, which primarily reflected an elevated benefit recorded throughout the 2021 period as the U.S. economy began to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Net loan charge-offs increased $27 million to $21 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to net recoveries of $6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Energy net recoveries for the 2021 period totaled $29 million, compared to $3 million of Energy net charge-offs recorded in the 2022 period. Additionally, Technology and Life Sciences net charge-offs increased $8 million, partially offset by decreases of $7 million in Corporate Banking and $5 million in Business Banking. Provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments increased $32 million to $18 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. 

An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets is presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review. 

Noninterest Income 

Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2022 2021 Card fees $ 205 $ 227 Fiduciary income 178 171 Service charges on deposit accounts 148 145 Derivative income 86 72 Commercial lending fees 81 76 Bank-owned life insurance 37 32 Letter of credit fees 28 30 Brokerage fees 14 11 Other noninterest income (a) 13 70 Total noninterest income $ 790 $ 834 

(a) The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income. 

Noninterest income decreased $44 million to $790 million, which included a decrease in card fees, partially offset by increases in derivative income, fiduciary income, syndication agent fees (a component of commercial lending fees) and bank-owned life insurance. Th e decrease in card fees reflected elevated activity from stimulus payments during 2021, while the increase in fiduciary income was driven by institutional trust fees. The decrease in other noninterest income was driven by declines in deferred compensation asset returns (offset in noninterest expense), warrant-related income mostly due to elevated gains on monetization in the 2021 period and lower investment banking income, partially offset by higher securities trading income. 

The following table presents certain categories included in other noninterest income on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2022 2021 Insurance commissions $ 10 $ 9 Securities trading income 9 5 Investment banking fees 3 9 Principal investing and warrant-related income (a) (3) 18 Deferred compensation asset returns (b) (24) 9 All other noninterest income 18 20 Other noninterest income $ 13 $ 70 

(a) Includes changes in value of shares obtained through monetization of warrants, previously reported in securities trading income. 

(b) Compensation deferred by the Corporation's officers and directors is invested based on investment selections of the officers and directors. Income earned on these assets is reported in other noninterest income and the offsetting change in deferred compensation plan liabilities is reported in salaries and benefits expense. 

Noninterest Expenses 

Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2022 2021 Salaries and benefits expense $ 890 $ 841 Outside processing fee expense 188 200 Occupancy expense 122 117 Software expense 120 117 Equipment expense 36 38 Advertising expense 24 25 FDIC insurance expense 24 17 Other noninterest expenses 53 20 Total noninterest expenses $ 1,457 $ 1,375 

Noninterest expenses increased $82 million to $1.5 billion, due to increases in salaries and benefits expense, FDIC insurance expense, occupancy expense and software expense, partially offset by a decrease in outside processing fee expense. The increase in salaries and benefits expense was driven by the impact of annual merit increases, as well as higher technology-related contract labor, performance-based compensation and stock-based compensation, partially offset by lower deferred compensation expense (offset in other noninterest income). Other noninterest expenses included increases in operational losses, travel and entertainment expense, consulting fees and loss on sale of assets, partially offset by decreases in non-salary pension expense, litigation-related expense as well as the impact of a favorable state tax ruling. The decrease in outside processing fee 

expense was driven by lower volumes of government card transactions (tied to card fee revenue). For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, expenses for certain modernization initiatives related to transformation of the retail banking delivery model, alignment of corporate facilities and optimization of technology platforms totaled $20 million, comprised of transitional real estate costs (reported in occupancy expense), asset impairments and consulting fees (reported in other noninterest expenses), as well as severance costs and contract labor (reported in salaries and benefits). 

STRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESS 

The Corporation has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments: the Commercial Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, the Finance Division is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes items not directly associated with the business segments or the Finance segment. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of the business segments for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. 

The Corporation's management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. These methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines. Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation's 2021 Annual Report describes the Corporation's segment reporting methodology. 

Net interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities plus the net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing (FTP). The FTP methodology allocates credits to each business segment for deposits and other funds provided as well as charges for loans and other assets being funded. FTP crediting rates on deposits and other funds provided reflect the long-term value of deposits and other funding sources based on their implied maturities. Due to the longer-term nature of implied maturities, FTP crediting rates are generally less volatile than changes in interest rates observed in the market. FTP charge rates for funding loans and other assets reflect a matched cost of funds based on the pricing and duration characteristics of the assets. As a result of applying matched funding, interest revenue for each segment resulting from loans and other assets is generally not impacted by changes in interest rates. Therefore, net interest income for each segment primarily reflects the volume of loans and other earning assets at the spread over the matched cost of funds, as well as the volume of deposits at the associated FTP crediting rates. Generally, in periods of rising interest rates, FTP charge rates for funding loans and FTP crediting rates on deposits will increase, with FTP crediting rates for deposits typically repricing at a slower pace than FTP charge rates for funding loans. 

Business Segments 

The following sections present a summary of the performance of each of the Corporation's business segments for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. 

Commercial Bank 

Nine Months Ended September 30, Percent Change (dollar amounts in millions) 2022 2021 Change Earnings summary: Net interest income $ 1,232 $ 1,189 $ 43 4 % Provision for credit losses 1 (325) 326 n/m Noninterest income 461 495 (34) (7) Noninterest expenses 713 641 72 11 Provision for income taxes 229 307 (78) (25) Net income $ 750 $ 1,061 $ (311) (29) % Net credit-related charge-offs (recoveries) $ 17 $ (6) $ 23 n/m Selected average balances: Loans (a) $ 42,928 $ 42,087 $ 841 2 % Deposits 43,733 43,844 (111) &#8212; 

(a) Included PPP loans with average balances of $126 million and $2.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

n/m - not meaningful 

Average loans increased $841 million, including a $2.1 billion decline in PPP loans. Excluding the impact of PPP loans, average loans increased $2.9 billion due to increases in Corporate Banking, general Middle Market, Equity Fund Services and Environmental Services, partially offset by decreases in Mortgage Banker Finance and Business Banking. Average deposits decreased $111 million, primarily reflecting decreases in money market and time deposits, partially offset by an increase in noninterest-bearing deposits. The Commercial Bank's net income decreased $311 million. Net interest income increased $43 million due to an increase in loan income, partially offset by higher allocated net FTP charges and a decline in loan fees. The provision for credit losses increased $326 million, reflecting increases in Energy, Commercial Real Estate, Business Banking, Technology and Life Sciences and general Middle Market. Net credit-related charge-offs increased $23 million to $17 million, primarily due to a reduction in Energy net recoveries as well as an increase in Technology and Life Sciences net charge-offs, partially offset by net recoveries in Corporate Banking and Business Banking. Noninterest income decreased $34 million, driven by decreases in principal investing and warrant-related income, card fees (due to higher activity in 2021 from stimulus payments) and investment banking fees, partially offset by increases in derivative income and commercial lending fees. Noninterest expenses increased $72 million, primarily reflecting increases in salaries and benefits expense, corporate overhead, operational losses and litigation-related expenses, partially offset by a decrease in outside processing fee expense. 

Retail Bank

Average loans decreased $452 million due to a $494 million decline in PPP loans. Average deposits increased $1.6 billion, reflecting increases in all deposit categories with the exception of time deposits. The Retail Bank's net income decreased $7 million to $30 million, including a $13 million increase in the provision for credit losses. Net interest income increased $37 million primarily due to higher FTP crediting rates on deposits. Noninterest income was relatively stable, while noninterest expenses increased $26 million, primarily due to increases in corporate overhead and operational losses, partially offset by a decrease in litigation-related expenses.

Average loans decreased $99 million due to a $136 million decline in PPP loans, while average deposits increased $473 million, reflecting increases in all deposit categories. Wealth Management's net income decreased $29 million to $71 million. Net interest income increased $13 million mostly due to an increase in loan income, partially offset by an increase in allocated net FTP charges. Provision for credit losses increased $40 million to an expense of $11 million, while noninterest income increased $19 million due to increases in fiduciary income, investment fees and derivative income. Noninterest expenses increased $27 million, primarily reflecting increases in salaries and benefits expense and corporate overhead.

Average deposits, which primarily consist of brokered and reciprocal deposits, decreased $418 million. Net loss for the Finance and Other category decreased $208 million to $50 million. Net interest expense decreased $248 million to $110 million, primarily reflecting an increase in net FTP revenue as a result of higher rates charged to the business segments under the Corporation's internal FTP methodology. Noninterest income decreased $28 million to $14 million, driven by a decrease in securities trading income, partially offset by an increase in bank-owned life insurance. Noninterest expenses decreased $43 million, primarily reflecting an increase in corporate overhead allocated to other lines of business, partially offset by salaries and benefits expense.

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Third Quarter 2022 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2021 

Period-End Balances 

Total assets decreased $10.5 billion to $84.1 billion driven by a $17.2 billion decrease in interest-bearing deposits with banks (primarily deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank), which declined from the elevated levels seen at December 31, 2021 and was partially offset by increases of $2.5 billion in investment securities due to deployment of excess liquidity and $2.4 billion in loans. The increase in loans included growth of $798 million in Corporate Banking, $768 million in National Dealer Services and $569 million in general Middle Market, partially offset by a $1.2 billion decrease in Mortgage Banker Finance. 

Total liabilities decreased $7.6 billion to $79.1 billion, reflecting decreases of $5.8 billion and $3.5 billion in interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits, respectively, partially offset by increases of $508 million in short-term borrowings and $220 million in medium- and long-term debt. The decline in deposits was broad-based, reflecting strategic deposit management and customers utilizing balances to fund business activities. The growth in short-term borrowings reflected Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances, while the increase in medium- and long-term debt reflected the issuance of $500 million in subordinated notes during the third quarter 2022. Total shareholders' equity decreased $2.8 billion, primarily due to the net impact of unrealized losses on investment securities available-for-sale. 

Average Balances 

Total assets decreased $11.3 billion to $85.4 billion driven by a $20.1 billion decrease in interest-bearing deposits with banks, which was partially offset by increases of $3.9 billion in investment securities and $3.3 billion in loans. The following table provides information about the change in the Corporation's average loan portfolio by loan type. 

Three Months Ended Percent Change (dollar amounts in millions) September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Change Commercial loans (a) $ 30,573 $ 27,925 $ 2,648 9 % Real estate construction loans 2,457 2,968 (511) (17) Commercial mortgage loans 12,180 11,212 968 9 Lease financing 690 634 56 9 International loans 1,234 1,177 57 5 Residential mortgage loans 1,761 1,810 (49) (3) Consumer loans 2,218 2,099 119 6 Total loans $ 51,113 $ 47,825 $ 3,288 7 % 

(a) Included PPP loans of $67 million and $689 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

The $3.3 billion increase in loans, which included a $622 million decline in PPP loans, was primarily driven by increases of $897 million in general Middle Market, $864 million in Corporate Banking, $820 million in National Dealer Services, $500 million in Equity Fund Services, $409 million in Environmental Services and $241 million in Commercial Real Estate, which was partially offset by a $786 million decrease in Mortgage Banker Finance. 

Total liabilities decreased $9.8 billion to $79.1 billion, primarily reflecting broad-based decreases of $6.4 billion and $4.2 billion in interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits, respectively. Total shareholders' equity decreased $1.5 billion, primarily due to the net impact of unrealized losses on investment securities available-for-sale.

(a) Maximum number of shares that may be repurchased under the publicly announced plans or programs. 

(b) Includes approximately 26,000 shares purchased pursuant to deferred compensation plans and shares purchased from employees to pay for taxes related to restricted stock vesting under the terms of an employee share-based compensation plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. These transactions are not considered part of the Corporation's repurchase program. 

The Corporation continues to target a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio of approximately 10 percent with active capital management. At September 30, 2022, the Corporation's estimated CET1 capital ratio was 9.92 percent, down from 10.13 percent at December 31, 2021, primarily due to loan growth. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in 2010, a total of 97.2 million shares have been authorized for repurchase. There is no expiration date for the share repurchase program. The timing and actual amount of share repurchases are subject to various factors, including the Corporation's earnings generation, capital needs to fund future loan growth and market conditions. 

The following table presents the minimum ratios required. 

Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 4.5 % Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 6.0 Total capital to risk-weighted assets 8.0 Capital conservation buffer (a) 2.5 Tier 1 capital to adjusted average assets (leverage ratio) 4.0 

(a) In addition to the minimum risk-based capital requirements, the Corporation is required to maintain a minimum capital conservation buffer, in the form of common equity, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses. 

The Corporation's capital ratios exceeded minimum regulatory requirements as follows: 

September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 (dollar amounts in millions) Capital/Assets Ratio Capital/Assets Ratio Common equity tier 1 (a), (b) $ 7,616 9.92 % $ 7,064 10.13 % Tier 1 risk-based (a), (b) 8,010 10.44 7,458 10.70 Total risk-based (a) 9,512 12.40 8,608 12.35 Leverage (a) 8,010 9.20 7,458 7.74 Common shareholders' equity 4,675 5.55 7,503 7.93 Tangible common equity (b) 4,030 4.82 6,857 7.30 Risk-weighted assets (a) 76,736 69,708 

(a) September 30, 2022 capital, risk-weighted assets and ratios are estimated. 

(b) See Supplemental Financial Data section for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and regulatory ratios. 

The common shareholders' equity ratio decreased 238 basis points to 5.55 percent at September 30, 2022 primarily due to the change in unrealized losses in the Corporation's investment securities portfolio and, to a lesser extent, its cash flow hedge portfolio. The unrealized losses in the Corporation's available-for-sale investment security portfolio are due to market valuations since the time of initial acquisition which, in substantially all cases, are not expected to be realized. The tangible common equity ratio, which excludes goodwill and other intangible assets, decreased 248 basis points to 4.82 percent for the same reasons. The impact of cumulative unrealized losses recorded within other comprehensive loss at September 30, 2022 to both ratios was approximately 430 basis points. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

The following updated information should be read in conjunction with the "Risk Management" section on pages F-17 through F-33 in the Corporation's 2021 Annual Report. 

Credit Risk 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses increased $6 million from $618 million at December 31, 2021 to $624 million at September 30, 2022. As a percentage of total loans, the allowance for credit losses was 1.21 percent at September 30, 2022, compared to 1.26 percent at December 31, 2021. The allowance for credit losses covered 2.4 times and 2.3 times total nonperforming loans at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

The following table presents metrics of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming loans. 

September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans 1.21 % 1.26 % Allowance for credit losses as a multiple of total nonaccrual loans 2.4x 2.3x Allowance for credit losses as a multiple of total nonperforming loans 2.4x 2.3x 

The economic forecasts informing the current expected credit loss (CECL) model primarily reflected continued strong credit quality, a tight labor market and strong demand for goods and services. Excess savings and pent-up demand from consumers, as well as robust labor markets, have supported growth in the broader U.S. economy. However, there are increasing downside risks from the impacts of inflationary pressures, future monetary policy actions and the slowing housing market. Foreign developments also pose additional headwinds, including the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, China's lockdowns, ongoing supply chain issues and economic challenges in Europe. 

These factors shaped the 2-year reasonable and supportable forecasts used by the Corporation in its CECL estimate at September 30, 2022. The U.S. economy is projected to continue to grow in fourth quarter 2022, with the pace of expansion slowing significantly in 2023 before returning to longer-term growth rates in 2024. Certain economic variables, like oil prices, are expected to normalize over the forecast period while others, like the unemployment rate, are projected to remain stable. Interest rates are forecasted to increase through late 2023 and then gradually decline, consistent with the Federal Reserve's projections, while corporate bond spreads are expected to reflect normalized default risk. The following table summarizes select variables representative of the economic forecasts used to develop the allowance for credit losses estimate at September 30, 2022. 

Economic Variable Base Forecast Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth Growth peaks at 2.5 percent in fourth quarter 2022 before slowing to under 1 percent through 2023, subsequently re-accelerating to an expected longer-term growth rate in 2024. Unemployment rate Expected to increase from current levels to 4 percent by first quarter 2023, remaining stable for the remainder of the forecast period. Corporate BBB bond to 10-year Treasury bond spreads Projected to reflect a normalized level of default risk throughout the forecast period. Oil Prices Prices steadily decline from current levels to below $75 per barrel by the end of the forecast period. 

Due to the high level of uncertainty regarding significant assumptions, the Corporation evaluated a range of economic scenarios, including more benign and more severe economic forecasts. In a more severe scenario, real GDP is expected to contract through fourth quarter 2023, subsequently improving to a growth rate of 1.9 percent by the end of the forecast period. Other key economic variables follow a similar pattern of short-term deterioration followed by a recovery. Selecting the more severe forecast would result in an increase in the quantitative calculation of allowance for credit losses of approximately $182 million as of September 30, 2022. However, factoring in model overlays and qualitative adjustments could result in a materially different estimate under a more severe scenario. The Corporation monitors evolving economic conditions for impacts to the allowance for credit losses. 

Allowance for Loan Losses 

The allowance for loan losses represents management&#8217;s estimates of current expected credit losses in the Corporation&#8217;s loan portfolio. Pools of loans with similar risk characteristics are collectively evaluated, while loans that no longer share risk characteristics with loan pools are evaluated individually. The allowance for loan losses decreased $12 million to $576 million at September 30, 2022, compared to $588 million at December 31, 2021. 

Collective loss estimates are determined by applying reserve factors, designed to estimate current expected credit losses, to amortized cost balances over the remaining contractual life of the collectively evaluated portfolio. Loans with similar risk characteristics are aggregated into homogeneous pools. The allowance for loan losses also includes qualitative adjustments to bring the allowance to the level management believes is appropriate based on factors that have not otherwise been fully accounted for, including adjustments for foresight risk, input imprecisions and model imprecision. Credit losses for loans that no longer share risk characteristics with the loan pools are estimated on an individual basis. Individual credit loss estimates are typically performed for nonaccrual loans and modified loans classified as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) and are based on one of several methods, including the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, observable market value of similar debt or the present value of expected cash flows. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Lending-Related Commitments 

The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments estimates current expected credit losses on collective pools of letters of credit and unused commitments to extend credit based on reserve factors, determined in a manner similar to business loans, multiplied by a probability of draw estimate based on historical experience and credit risk, applied to commitment amounts. 

For additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses, refer to the "Critical Accounting Estimates" section and pages F-51 through F-52 in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation's 2021 Annual Report. 

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, TDRs which have been renegotiated to less than the original contractual rates (reduced-rate loans) and foreclosed assets. TDRs include performing and nonperforming loans, with nonperforming TDRs on either nonaccrual or reduced-rate status. In accordance with the provisions of the CARES Act, the Corporation elected not to consider qualifying COVID-19-related modifications, primarily deferrals, as TDRs and did not designate such loans as past due or nonaccrual at December 31, 2021. The temporary relief provided under the CARES Act applied to modifications made from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic through December 31, 2021. For additional information regarding the Corporation's accounting policies for the CARES Act, refer to page F-50 in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation's 2021 Annual Report. 

The following table presents a summary of nonperforming assets and past due loans. 

(dollar amounts in millions) September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Nonaccrual loans 259 264 Reduced-rate loans 3 4 Total nonperforming loans 262 268 Foreclosed property &#8212; 1 Total nonperforming assets $ 262 $ 269 Nonaccrual loans as a percentage of total loans 0.50 % 0.54 % Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans 0.51 0.54 Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and foreclosed property 0.51 0.55 Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing $ 72 $ 27 

Nonperforming assets decreased $7 million to $262 million at September 30, 2022, from $269 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease in nonperforming assets was primarily due to a decrease of $28 million in nonaccrual business loans, partially offset by a $23 million increase in nonaccrual retail loans, as temporary legislative relief for COVID-19-related deferrals ended on December 31, 2021. Nonperforming loans were 0.51 percent of total loans at September 30, 2022, compared to 0.54 percent at December 31, 2021. For further information regarding the composition of nonaccrual loans, refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.

Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest generally represent loans that are well-collateralized and in the process of collection. Loans past due 90 days or more increased $45 million to $72 million at September 30, 2022, compared to $27 million at December 31, 2021. Loans past due 30-89 days increased $262 million to $415 million at September 30, 2022, compared to $153 million at December 31, 2021. Loans past due 30 days or more and still accruing interest as a percentage of total loans were 0.94 percent and 0.36 percent at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. An aging analysis of loans included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements provides further information about the balances comprising past due loans. 

The following table presents a summary of total criticized loans. The Corporation's criticized list is consistent with the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful categories defined by regulatory authorities. Criticized loans with balances of $2 million or more on nonaccrual status or loans with balances of $1 million or more whose terms have been modified in a TDR are individually subjected to quarterly credit quality reviews, and the Corporation may establish specific allowances for such loans. A table of loans by credit quality indicator included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements provides further information about the balances comprising total criticized loans. 

(dollar amounts in millions) September 30, 2022 June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Total criticized loans $ 1,626 $ 1,534 $ 1,573 As a percentage of total loans 3.1 % 3.0 % 3.2 % 

The $53 million increase in criticized loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 included increases of $139 million in Technology and Life Sciences, $84 million in Environmental Services and $51 million in general Middle Market, partially offset by decreases in $80 million in Business Banking, $72 million in Entertainment Lending, $35 million in Corporate Banking and $29 million in Energy. 

Concentrations of Credit Risk 

Concentrations of credit risk may exist when a number of borrowers are engaged in similar activities, or activities in the same geographic region, and have similar economic characteristics that would cause them to be similarly impacted by changes in economic or other conditions. The Corporation has concentrations of credit risk with the commercial real estate and automotive industries. All other industry concentrations, as defined by management, individually represented less than 10 percent of total loans at September 30, 2022. 

Commercial Real Estate Lending 

At September 30, 2022, the Corporation's commercial real estate portfolio represented 29 percent of total loans. The following table summarizes the Corporation's commercial real estate loan portfolio by loan category.

(a) Primarily loans to real estate developers. 

(b) Primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate. 

The Corporation limits risk inherent in its commercial real estate lending activities by monitoring borrowers directly involved in the commercial real estate markets and adhering to conservative policies on loan-to-value ratios for such loans. Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $15.1 billion at September 30, 2022. Of the total, $6.1 billion, or 41 percent, were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which includes loans to real estate developers, an increase of $394 million compared to December 31, 2021. Commercial real estate loans in other business lines totaled $8.9 billion, or 59 percent, at September 30, 2022, an increase of $458 million compared to December 31, 2021. These loans consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages, which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans. Generally, loans previously reported as real estate construction are classified as commercial mortgage loans upon receipt of a certificate of occupancy. 

The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-tenured customers with satisfactory completion experience. There were no criticized real estate construction loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line at both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. In other business lines, criticized real estate construction loans totaled $4 million at September 30, 2022, compared to $35 million at December 31, 2021. 

The following table summarizes net charge-offs related to the Corporation's commercial real estate loan portfolio.

Commercial mortgage loans are loans where the primary collateral is a lien on any real property and are primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate. Real property is generally considered primary collateral if the value of that collateral represents more than 50 percent of the commitment at loan approval. Loans in the commercial mortgage portfolio generally mature within three to five years. Criticized commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $18 million and $29 million at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. In other business lines, $154 million and $219 million of commercial mortgage loans were criticized at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. There were no commercial mortgage loan net charge-offs during the three months ended September 30, 2022 and June 30, 2022, or in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. 

Automotive Lending - Dealer 

The following table presents a summary of dealer loans. 

September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 (in millions) Loans Outstanding Percent of Total Loans Loans Outstanding Percent of Total Loans Dealer: Floor plan $ 1,059 $ 681 Other 3,872 3,481 Total dealer $ 4,931 9.5 % $ 4,162 8.4 % 

Substantially all dealer loans are in the National Dealer Services business line and primarily include floor plan financing and other loans to automotive dealerships. Floor plan loans, included in commercial loans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, totaled $1.1 billion at September 30, 2022, an increase of $378 million compared to $681 million at December 31, 2021, as an imbalance in supply and demand impacted by a shortage in microchips used in automotive production continues to depress floor plan loan balances below pre-pandemic levels. Other loans to automotive dealers in the 

National Dealer Services business line totaled $3.9 billion, including $2.2 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans at September 30, 2022 and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2021, respectively. 

There were no nonaccrual dealer loans at both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Additionally, there were no net charge-offs of dealer loans during three months ended September 30, 2022 and June 30, 2022, or in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.

Residential real estate loans, which consist of traditional residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit, totaled $3.5 billion at September 30, 2022. The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation's primary geographic markets. Substantially all residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more are placed on nonaccrual status, and substantially all junior lien home equity loans that are current or less than 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual status if full collection of the senior position is in doubt. At no later than 180 days past due, such loans are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell. 

Residential mortgages totaled $1.8 billion at September 30, 2022, and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the $1.8 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, $56 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2022, an increase of $20 million as temporary legislative relief for COVID-19-related deferrals ended on December 31, 2021. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.7 billion at September 30, 2022, of which 97 percent was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit, 2 percent were in amortizing status and 1 percent were closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.7 billion of home equity 

loans outstanding, $14 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2022. A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens at September 30, 2022. 

Energy Lending 

The Corporation has a portfolio of Energy loans that are included entirely in commercial loans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Customers in the Corporation's Energy business line are engaged in three segments of the oil and gas business: exploration and production (E&#38;P), midstream and energy services. E&#38;P generally includes such activities as searching for potential oil and gas fields, drilling exploratory wells and operating active wells. Commitments to E&#38;P borrowers are generally subject to semi-annual borrowing base re-determinations based on a variety of factors including updated prices (reflecting market and competitive conditions), energy reserve levels and the impact of hedging. The midstream sector is generally involved in the transportation, storage and marketing of crude and/or refined oil and gas products. The Corporation's legacy energy services customers provide products and services primarily to the E&#38;P segment.

Leveraged Loans 

Certain loans in the Corporation's commercial portfolio are considered leveraged transactions. These loans are typically used for mergers, acquisitions, business recapitalizations, refinancing and equity buyouts. To help mitigate the risk associated with these loans, the Corporation focuses on middle market companies with highly capable management teams, strong sponsors and solid track records of financial performance. Industries prone to cyclical downturns and acquisitions with a high degree of integration risk are generally avoided. Other considerations include the sufficiency of collateral, the level of balance sheet leverage and the adequacy of financial covenants. During the underwriting process, cash flows are stress-tested to evaluate the borrowers' abilities to handle economic downturns and an increase in interest rates. 

The FDIC defines higher-risk commercial and industrial (HR C&#38;I) loans for assessment purposes as loans generally with leverage of four times total debt to earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation (EBITDA) as well as three times senior debt to EBITDA, excluding certain collateralized loans. 

The following tables summarize information about HR C&#38;I loans, which represented 6 percent of total loans at both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Market and Liquidity Risk 

Market risk represents the risk of loss due to adverse movement in prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. Liquidity risk represents the risk that the Corporation does not have sufficient access to funds to maintain its normal operations at all times or does not have the ability to raise or borrow funds at a reasonable cost at all times. 

The Asset and Liability Policy Committee (ALCO) of the Corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities. ALCO meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the Corporation, including treasury, finance, economics, lending, deposit gathering and risk management. Corporate Treasury mitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of ALCO through the actions it takes to manage the Corporation's market, liquidity and capital positions. 

The Corporation performs monthly liquidity stress testing to evaluate its ability to meet funding needs in hypothetical stressed environments. Such environments cover a series of scenarios, including both idiosyncratic and market-wide in nature, which vary in terms of duration and severity. The evaluation as of September 30, 2022 projected that sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events. 

In addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis, Corporate Treasury also monitors the parent company's liquidity and has established liquidity coverage requirements for meeting expected obligations without the support of additional dividends from subsidiaries. ALCO's policy on liquidity risk management requires the parent company to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet expected cash obligations over a period of no less than 12 months. The Corporation had liquid assets of $1.7 billion on an unconsolidated basis at September 30, 2022. 

Corporate Treasury and the Enterprise Risk Division support ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks. Key activities encompass: (i) providing information and analyses of the Corporation's balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks; (ii) monitoring and reporting of the Corporation's positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines; (iii) developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions; (iv) reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval; and (v) monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks. 

Interest Rate Risk 

Net interest income is the primary source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities, primarily through the Corporation's core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by core deposits. Including the impact of interest rate swaps converting floating-rate loans to fixed, the Corporation's loan composition at September 30, 2022 was 47 percent 30-day or less rate (primarily LIBOR and BSBY), 39 percent fixed-rate, 9 percent prime and 5 percent comprised of 90-day and greater rates. The composition of the loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the faster repricing of the floating-rate loan portfolio versus deposit products. In addition, the growth and/or contraction in the Corporation's loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing fixed-rate investment securities, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest rate sensitivity, as well as hedging with interest rate swaps and options. Other mitigating factors include interest rate floors on a portion of the loan portfolio. 

The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity. The Corporation is currently targeting low single digit net interest income at risk to a 100 basis point gradual decline in interest rates. 

Since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives, a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk. These techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve utilizing multiple simulation analyses. Simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors, including, but not limited 

to, the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, regulatory impacts and management strategies. 

Sensitivity of Net Interest Income to Changes in Interest Rates 

The analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is management's principal risk management technique. Management models a base-case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment using a static balance sheet and generates sensitivity scenarios by changing certain model assumptions. Each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth, investment security prepayment levels, depositor behavior and overall balance sheet mix and growth which are in line with historical patterns. Changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis. Model assumptions in the sensitivity scenarios at September 30, 2022 included for the rising rate scenario, a modest increase in loan balances and a moderate decrease in deposit balances, and for the declining rate scenario, a modest decrease in loan balances and a moderate increase in deposit balances. In addition, both scenarios assumed loan spreads held at current levels, an incremental interest-bearing deposit beta of approximately 25%, no reinvestment of securities portfolio cash flows and no additions to interest rate swaps. 

The average balance of the securities portfolio included in the analysis was $20.5 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022 with an average yield of 2.08% and effective duration of 5.3 years. 

The table below details components of the cash flow hedge portfolio at September 30, 2022.

(a) Years to maturity calculated from a starting date of September 30, 2022. 

(b) Includes forward starting swaps of $7.2 billion starting in fourth quarter 2022 and $3.6 billion starting in 2023 and beyond. Excluding forward starting swaps, the weighted average yield was 2.20 %. 

The analysis also includes interest rate swaps that convert $3.2 billion of fixed-rate medium- and long-term debt to variable rates through fair value hedges. Additionally, included in this analysis are $13.7 billion of loans that were subject to an average interest rate floor of 58 basis points at September 30, 2022. This base-case net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which short-term rates rise or decline 100 basis points (with a floor of zero percent) in a linear, parallel fashion from the base case over 12 months, resulting in an average change of 50 basis points over the period. 

The table below, as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above. 

Estimated Annual Change September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 (dollar amounts in millions) Amount % Amount % Change in Interest Rates: Change in Interest Rates: Rising 100 basis points $ 37 1 % Rising 100 basis points 

$ 205 12 % (50 basis points on average) (50 basis points on average) Declining 100 basis points (93) (3) Declining to zero percent 

(46) (3) (50 basis points on average) 

Sensitivity to declining interest rates increased from December 31, 2021 to September 30, 2022 primarily due to increases in the federal funds rate to 325 basis points, allowing for a full 100 basis point repricing of the balance sheet. This was partially offset by additional cash flow hedges and investment securities added during 2022 and non-maturity deposit runoff. Sensitivity to rising interest rates decreased due to increased cash flow hedges and non-maturity deposit runoff but was partially offset by the increased repricing potential of floating-rate loans as they moved above their contractual floor rates. 

Sensitivity of Economic Value of Equity to Changes in Interest Rates 

In addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income, an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position. The economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the Corporation's financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period, and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements. The Corporation primarily monitors the percentage change on the base-case economic value of equity. The economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel 100 basis point shock with a floor of zero percent. 

The table below, as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above. 

September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 (dollar amounts in millions) Amount % Amount % Change in Interest Rates: Change in Interest Rates: Rising 100 basis points $ (446) (3 %) Rising 100 basis points $ 1,353 9 % Declining 100 basis points 492 3 Declining to zero percent (446) (3) 

The sensitivity of the economic value of equity to rising rates changed from an increase as of December 31, 2021 to a reduction as of September 30, 2022 due to additional receive-fixed cash flow swaps, growth of fixed-rate securities and deposit runoff. Sensitivity to declining rates now increases economic value of equity due to the same factors. 

LIBOR Transition 

On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. Effective March 2021, the FCA confirmed that certain LIBOR tenors will no longer be supported after December 31, 2021 and that the remaining tenors, including those most commonly used by the Corporation, will cease to be supported after June 30, 2023. The Corporation has substantial exposure to LIBOR-based products, including loans and derivatives, and is preparing for a transition from LIBOR toward alternative rates. 

The Corporation ceased originating LIBOR-based products in the fourth quarter of 2021 and has reduced LIBOR exposure by approximately 39 percent since December 31, 2021. As of September 30, 2022, the Corporation estimates that approximately 23 percent of its LIBOR-based commercial loans have maturity dates prior to the cessation of LIBOR. Of the remaining loans with maturity dates beyond the cessation date, the Corporation estimates that 43 percent incorporate fallback language and is confident that it will achieve timely remediation of all other loans. Cessation planning for consumer loans is in process, as the Corporation has completed a review of the fallback terms for residential adjustable-rate mortgages and identified alternate benchmarks for other smaller portfolio segments. 

In addition to remediation activity on LIBOR-based loans, the Corporation has enacted the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) protocols related to derivatives. Once events occur that trigger a fallback, the reference rate for the variable leg of the swap will fall back from LIBOR to the ISDA Fallback Rate, which is the daily SOFR plus a spread. 

The Corporation's enterprise transition timelines are closely aligned with recommendations from the Alternative Reference Rates Committee for both best practices and recommended objectives. The Corporation will continue to align with industry and regulatory guidelines regarding the cessation of LIBOR as well as monitor market developments for transitioning to alternative reference rates. For a discussion of the various risks facing the Corporation in relation to the transition away from LIBOR, see the market risk discussion within &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; beginning on page 13 of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Sources of Liquidity 

The Corporation maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately satisfy its financial obligations while taking into account potential commitment draws and deposit run-off that may occur in the normal course of business. The majority of the Corporation's balance sheet is funded by customer deposits. Cash flows from loan repayments, increases in deposit accounts, activity in the securities portfolio and the purchased funds market serve as the Corporation's primary liquidity sources. 

The Corporation satisfies incremental liquidity needs with either liquid assets or external funding sources. The Corporation had access to liquid assets of $20.6 billion and $35.3 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, which included cash on deposit with the Federal Reserve and the portion of the investment securities portfolio that the Corporation can sell without third-party consent. 

In addition, the Corporation may access external funding sources when necessary, which include FHLB advances, federal funds, reverse repurchase agreements, brokered deposits and Corporation-issued bonds. The Corporation maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission from which it may issue debt and equity securities. 

Purchased funds increased $479 million to $529 million at September 30, 2022, compared to $50 million at December 31, 2021, reflecting an increase in short-term FHLB advances. At September 30, 2022, the Bank had pledged loans totaling $24.4 billion which provided for up to $19.5 billion of available collateralized borrowing with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB). The Bank is also a member of the FHLB of Dallas, Texas, which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related loans, certain government agency-backed securities and other eligible assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral pledged to the FHLB. At September 30, 2022, $ 17.9 billion of real estate-related loans were pledged to the FHLB as collateral for $ 500 million in short-term advances and providing an additional $ 9.6 billion for potential future borrowings. 

The ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise funds at competitive rates is impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity, capital, earnings and other relevant factors related to the Corporation and the Bank. As of September 30, 2022, the three major rating agencies had assigned the following ratings to long-term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

The Corporation&#8217;s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation's 2021 Annual Report. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation&#8217;s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2021, the most critical of these estimates related to the allowance for credit losses, fair value measurement, goodwill, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These estimates were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully on pages F-34 through F-37 in the Corporation's 2021 Annual Report. As of the date of this report, there have been no significant changes to the Corporation's critical accounting estimates except for the updates to the goodwill critical accounting policy outlined below. 

The Corporation performed the annual goodwill impairment test in third quarter 2022, resulting in the following updates to the critical accounting policy on page F-36 of the Corporation's 2021 Annual Report. 

Goodwill 

Goodwill is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level, equivalent to a business segment or one level below. The Corporation has three reporting units: the Commercial Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, goodwill totaled $635 million, including $473 million allocated to the Commercial Bank, $101 million allocated to the Retail Bank and $61 million allocated to Wealth Management. 

The annual test of goodwill impairment was performed as of the beginning of the third quarter 2022. The Corporation first assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. Qualitative factors included economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, regulatory developments and performance of the Corporation&#8217;s stock, among other events and circumstances. At the conclusion of the qualitative assessment in third quarter 2022, the Corporation determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. 

Analyzing goodwill includes consideration of various factors that continue to rapidly evolve and for which significant 

uncertainty remains, including the impacts of inflationary pressures, monetary policy actions, a slowing housing market and foreign developments . Further weakening in the economic environment, such as a decline in the performance of the reporting units, could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below their carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. New legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management's expectations could have similar impacts. Any impairment charge would not affect the Corporation's regulatory capital ratios, tangible equity ratio or liquidity position. 

SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATA 

The Corporation believes non-GAAP measures are meaningful because they reflect adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and our performance trends. Tangible common equity is used by the Corporation to measure the quality of capital and the return relative to balance sheet risk. 

Common equity tier 1 capital ratio removes preferred stock from the Tier 1 capital ratio as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank regulations. The tangible common equity ratio removes the effect of intangible assets from capital and total assets. Tangible common equity per share of common stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders' equity per share of common stock. The Corporation believes that the presentation of tangible common equity adjusted for the impact of accumulated other comprehensive loss provides a greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhances comparability with prior periods. 

The following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and regulatory ratios used in this financial review with financial measures defined by GAAP.
