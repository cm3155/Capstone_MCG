RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

In accordance with Item 303(c) of Regulation S-K, the Corporation is providing a comparison of the quarter ended March 31, 2022 against the preceding sequential quarter. The Corporation believes providing a sequential discussion of its results of operations provides more relevant information for investors and stakeholders to understand and analyze the business. 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 Compared to Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 

Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was $189 million, compared to $228 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The $39 million decrease in net income was driven by lower noninterest income and higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest expenses. The provision for income taxes decreased $12 million to $49 million due to lower pre-tax income. Net income per diluted common share was $1.37 and $1.66 for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, a decrease of 0.29 per diluted common share.

(a) Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume. 

Net interest income was $456 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, a decrease of $5 million compared to $461 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net interest income was driven by a decline in PPP income, as the majority of PPP loans have been forgiven, and two fewer days in the three months ended March 31, 2022, partially offset by growth in investment securities and non-PPP loans. Net interest margin was 2.19 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2022, an increase of 15 basis points from 2.04 percent for the three months ended December 31, 2021 primarily driven by a $7.6 billion decrease in lower-yielding deposits with the Federal Reserve. 

Average earning assets decreased $6.3 billion, due to a decrease of $7.5 billion in interest-bearing deposits with banks (primarily deposits with the Federal Reserve), partially offset by increases of $721 million in investment securities and $448 million in loans. A decrease in interest-bearing deposits drove a $2.9 billion decrease in average interest-bearing funding sources. 

For further discussion of the effects of market rates on net interest income, refer to the "Market and Liquidity Risk" section of this financial review. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses, which includes the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments, was a benefit of $11 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, compared to a benefit of $25 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, continuing to reflect strong credit quality as well as sustained favorable economic forecasts and continued low levels of charge-offs. Net loan charge-offs increased $12 million to $8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, compared to net recoveries of $4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, driven by a decrease in recoveries. Energy net charge-offs totaled $6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, which consisted of a $6 million charge-off related to legacy energy services. General Middle Market net charge-offs totaled $5 million, compared to $12 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, while Corporate Banking net recoveries totaled $2 million, compared to net charge-offs of $3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments increased $15 million compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. 

An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and a summary of nonperforming assets are presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.

(a) The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income. 

&#160; Noninterest income decreased $45 million to $244 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, reflecting decreases in commercial lending fees and derivative income. The decrease in commercial lending fees was driven by elevated syndication agent activity in fourth quarter 2021, while the decrease in derivative income was largely due to an increase in the credit valuation adjustment as a result of market-driven higher energy-related instruments. Noninterest income was also impacted by a decrease in other noninterest income, as detailed below, driven by lower principal investing and warrant-related income mostly due to elevated gains on monetization in fourth quarter 2021, and deferred compensation asset returns (offset in noninterest expenses). 

The following table presents certain categories included in other noninterest income on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 

Three Months Ended (in millions) March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Securities trading income $ 3 $ 2 Investment banking fees 1 2 Principal investing and warrant-related income (a) (6) 8 Deferred compensation asset returns (b) (7) 5 All other noninterest income 8 12 Other noninterest income $ (1) $ 29 

(a) Includes changes in value of shares obtained through monetization of warrants, previously reported in securities trading income. 

(b) Compensation deferred by the Corporation's officers and directors is invested based on investment selections of the officers and directors. Income earned on these assets is reported in other noninterest income and the offsetting change in deferred compensation plan liabilities is reported in salaries and benefits expense. 

Noninterest Expenses 

Three Months Ended (in millions) March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Salaries and benefits expense $ 289 $ 292 Outside processing fee expense 62 66 Software expense 39 38 Occupancy expense 38 44 Equipment expense 11 12 FDIC insurance expense 8 5 Advertising expense 7 10 Other noninterest expenses 19 19 Total noninterest expenses $ 473 $ 486 

Noninterest expenses decreased $13 million to $473 million, primarily reflecting decreases in occupancy expense, outside processing fee expense, legal fees, salaries and benefits expense and advertising expense, partially offset by increases in operational losses and FDIC insurance expense. Salaries and benefits expense was impacted by significant seasonal items including increases in annual stock-based compensation and payroll taxes, partly offset by lower staff insurance expense, incentive compensation and the impact of two fewer days in the quarter. Lower deferred compensation expense (offset in other noninterest income) also impacted the decrease in noninterest expenses. The first quarter of 2022 included $6 million of expenses for severance costs (reported in salaries and benefits expense) as well as consulting fees and asset impairments (reported in other noninterest expenses) for certain initiatives related to transformation of the retail banking delivery model, alignment of corporate facilities and optimization of technology platforms. 

Table of Contents 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 

Net income decreased $161 million to $189 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, compared to $350 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The decrease was driven by a $171 million increase in the provision for credit losses resulting from an elevated benefit recorded in first quarter 2021 as the U.S. economy recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic. Net income was also impacted by lower noninterest income and higher noninterest expenses, partially offset by an increase in net interest income. The provision for income taxes decreased $49 million from $98 million, driven by lower pre-tax income. Net income per diluted common share decreased $1.06 to $1.37 for the three months ended March 31, 2022, compared to $2.43 for the three months ended March 31, 2021.

(a) Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume. 

Net interest income was $456 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, an increase of $13 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021. The increase in net interest income reflected a higher volume of earning assets as well as a residual value adjustment in the lease portfolio recorded in the first quarter of 2021, partially offset by the net impact of PPP loans and reinvestment in lower-yielding securities. Net interest margin was 2.19 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2022, a decrease of 10 basis points compared to 2.29 percent for the comparable period in 2021. The decrease in net interest margin was primarily driven by a $4.8 billion increase in lower-yielding deposits with the Federal Reserve. 

Average earning assets increased $5.0 billion, due to increases of $4.9 billion and $2.4 billion in interest-bearing deposits with banks and investment securities, respectively, partially offset by a $2.3 billion decrease in loans. Average interest-bearing funding sources increased $809 million, reflecting a $1.7 billion increase in interest-bearing deposits, which was offset by an $842 million decrease in medium- and long-term debt. 

For further discussion of the effects of market rates on net interest income, refer to the "Market and Liquidity Risk" section of this financial review. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $11 million compared to a benefit of $182 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The increase in provision for credit losses primarily reflected an elevated benefit recorded in first quarter 2021 as the U.S. economy began to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Net loan charge-offs increased $5 million to $8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, compared to $3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, largely driven by increases of $7 million in Energy and $4 million in general Middle Market, partially offset by a decrease of $7 million in Corporate Banking. 

An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets is presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.

(a) The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income. 

&#160; Noninterest income decreased $26 million to $244 million, driven by decreases in principal investing and warrant-related income, deferred compensation asset returns (offset in noninterest expense) and derivative income, partially offset by higher fiduciary income and commercial lending fees. The decreases in principal investing and warrant-related income, derivative income and deferred compensation asset returns were largely due to unfavorable market-driven valuation adjustments, while increased hedging activity from higher energy prices partially offset the decline in derivative income. Increases in fiduciary income and commercial lending fees were driven by higher personal trust fees and elevated syndication agent activity, respectively. 

The following table presents certain categories included in other noninterest income on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

Noninterest expenses increased $26 million to $473 million, due to increases in other noninterest expenses and salaries and benefits expense, as well as smaller increases in various categories. The increase in salaries and benefits expense was driven by higher accrued expenses for performance-related compensation, including stock-based compensation, and the impact of annual merit increases, partially offset by lower deferred compensation expense (offset in other noninterest income). The increase in other noninterest expenses was primarily due to higher operational losses and an increase in consulting fees.

STRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESS 

The Corporation has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments: the Commercial Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, the Finance Division is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes items not directly associated with the business segments or the Finance segment. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of the business segments for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. 

The Corporation's management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. These methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines. Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation's 2021 Annual Report describes the Corporation's segment reporting methodology. 

Net interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities plus the net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing (FTP). The FTP methodology allocates credits to each business segment for deposits and other funds provided as well as charges for loans and other assets being funded. FTP crediting rates on deposits and other funds provided reflect the long-term value of deposits and other funding sources based on their implied maturities. Due to the longer-term nature of implied maturities, FTP crediting rates are generally less volatile than changes in interest rates observed in the market. FTP charge rates for funding loans and other assets reflect a matched cost of funds based on the pricing and duration characteristics of the assets. As a result of applying matched funding, interest revenue for each segment resulting from loans and other assets is generally not impacted by changes in interest rates. Therefore, net interest income for each segment primarily reflects the volume of loans and other earning assets at the spread over the matched cost of funds, as well as the volume of deposits at the associated FTP crediting rates. Generally, in periods of rising interest rates, FTP charge rates for funding loans and FTP crediting rates on deposits will increase, with FTP crediting rates for deposits typically repricing at a slower pace than FTP charge rates for funding loans. 

Business Segments

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

First Quarter 2022 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2021 

Period-End Balances 

Total assets decreased $5.5 billion to $89.2 billion, driven by a decrease of $9.4 billion in interest-bearing deposits with banks (primarily deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank) which declined from the elevated level seen at December 31, 2021 and was partially offset by increases of $1.8 billion in investment securities, as excess liquidity was deployed into investment securities to reduce asset sensitivity as rates increase, and $1.6 billion in accrued income and other assets, primarily from increases in the receivable positions related to customer energy derivatives. Loans increased by $278 million, including increases of $320 million in Corporate Banking, $303 million in Equity Fund Services, $269 million in general Middle Market and $253 million in National Dealer Services, partially offset by a decline of $822 million in Mortgage Banker Finance. 

Total liabilities decreased $4.6 billion to $82.1 billion, primarily reflecting decreases of $3.1 billion and $1.6 billion in noninterest-bearing deposits and interest-bearing deposits, respectively. The decline in deposits reflected decreases in nearly every business line as customers utilized balances to fund business activities. The decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits also included a $1.1 billion decrease in National Card Services primarily due to the timing of deposits by the U.S. Treasury, which typically fund a government card program on the first day of each month. The January funding was received a day early in the fourth quarter of 2021 due to the New Year's holiday, leading to a timing difference between periods. Total shareholders' equity decreased $861 million, primarily due to the net impact of valuation changes in investment securities. 

Average Balances 

Total assets decreased $5.5 billion to $91.2 billion driven by a decrease of $7.5 billion in interest-bearing deposits with banks, which was partially offset by increases of $721 million in investment securities and a $448 million increase in loans. The following table provides information about the change in the Corporation's average loan portfolio by loan type.

(a) Included PPP loans of $335 million and $689 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

The increase in loans, which included a $354 million decline in PPP loans, was primarily driven by increases of $423 million in general Middle Market, $407 million in Corporate Banking, $363 million in Equity Fund Services and $199 million in National Dealer Services, partially offset by a decrease of $852 million in Mortgage Banker Finance. 

Total liabilities decreased $5.5 billion to $83.4 billion, primarily reflecting decreases of $2.9 billion and $2.6 billion in interest-bearing deposits and noninterest-bearing deposits, respectively. The decline in total deposits also included seasonal declines in general Middle Market, Technology and Life Sciences and Wealth Management, as well as a decrease in Corporate Banking.

RISK MANAGEMENT 

The following updated information should be read in conjunction with the "Risk Management" section on pages F-17 through F-33 in the Corporation's 2021 Annual Report. 

Credit Risk 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. As a percentage of total loans, the allowance for credit losses was 1.21 percent at March 31, 2022, compared to 1.26 percent at December 31, 2021. The allowance for credit losses covered 2.2 times and 2.3 times total nonperforming loans at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

The allowance for credit losses decreased $19 million from $618 million at December 31, 2021 to $599 million at March 31, 2022, primarily reflecting strong credit quality and a sustained recovery by the U.S. economy from the COVID-19 pandemic. Strong business and consumer spending, as well as robust labor markets, supported growth in the broader U.S. economy. However, there continues to be considerable uncertainty related to the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, supply chain constraints, future monetary and fiscal policy actions and inflationary pressures. 

These factors shaped the 2-year reasonable and supportable forecasts used by the Corporation in its CECL estimate at March 31, 2022. The U.S. economy is expected to continue to grow at a moderate pace through the first half of 2022 before normalizing into historical growth rates. Forecasts for other key economic variables, including the unemployment rate, are generally in line with GDP projections, while oil prices are expected to decrease throughout the forecast period. Interest rates are expected to increase, reflecting the Federal Reserve's expectations, while corporate bond spreads reflect normalized default risk. The following table summarizes select economic variables representative of the economic forecasts used to develop the allowance for credit losses estimate at March 31, 2022. 

Economic Variable Base Forecast Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth Growth near 5 percent in second quarter 2022 normalizes to under 3.5 percent for remainder of forecast period. Unemployment rate Current levels decrease to below 3.5 percent by fourth quarter 2022 with minimal subsequent movement. Corporate BBB bond to 10-year Treasury bond spreads Remain stable at below 2 percent. Oil Prices Prices steadily decline from $100 per barrel in second quarter 2022 to below $62 per barrel by the end of the forecast period. 

Due to the high level of uncertainty regarding significant assumptions, the Corporation evaluated a range of economic scenarios, including more benign and more severe economic forecasts. In the more severe scenario, real GDP is expected to contract through fourth quarter 2022, gradually improving to a growth rate of 4.1 percent by the end of the forecast period. Other key economic variables follow a similar pattern of short-term contractions followed by a gradual recovery. Selecting the more severe forecast would result in an increase in the quantitative calculation of allowance for credit losses by approximately $120 million as of March 31, 2022. However, factoring in model overlays and qualitative adjustments could result in a materially different estimate under a more severe scenario.

Allowance for Loan Losses 

The allowance for loan losses represents management&#8217;s estimates of current expected credit losses in the Corporation&#8217;s loan portfolio. Pools of loans with similar risk characteristics are collectively evaluated, while loans that no longer share risk characteristics with loan pools are evaluated individually. 

Collective loss estimates are determined by applying reserve factors, designed to estimate current expected credit losses, to amortized cost balances over the remaining contractual life of the collectively evaluated portfolio. Loans with similar risk characteristics are aggregated into homogeneous pools. The allowance for loan losses also includes qualitative adjustments to bring the allowance to the level management believes is appropriate based on factors that have not otherwise been fully accounted for, including adjustments for foresight risk, input imprecisions and model imprecision. Credit losses for loans that no longer share risk characteristics with the loan pools are estimated on an individual basis. Individual credit loss estimates are typically performed for nonaccrual loans and modified loans classified as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) and are based on one of several methods, including the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, observable market value of similar debt or the present value of expected cash flows. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Lending-Related Commitments 

The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments estimates current expected credit losses on collective pools of letters of credit and unused commitments to extend credit based on reserve factors, determined in a manner similar to business loans, multiplied by a probability of draw estimate based on historical experience and credit risk, applied to commitment amounts. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments increased $15 million to $45 million at March 31, 2022, compared to $30 million at December 31, 2021. 

The following table presents metrics of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming loans. 

March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans 1.21 % 1.26 % Allowance for credit losses as a multiple of total nonaccrual loans 2.2x 2.3x Allowance for credit losses as a multiple of total nonperforming loans 2.2x 2.3x 

For additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses, refer to the "Critical Accounting Estimates" section and pages F-51 through F-52 in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation's 2021 Annual Report. 

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, TDRs which have been renegotiated to less than the original contractual rates (reduced-rate loans) and foreclosed assets. TDRs include performing and nonperforming loans, with nonperforming TDRs on either nonaccrual or reduced-rate status. In accordance with the provisions of the CARES Act, the Corporation elected not to consider qualifying COVID-19-related modifications, primarily deferrals, as TDRs and did not designate such loans as past due or nonaccrual at December 31, 2021. The temporary relief provided under the CARES Act applied to modifications made from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic through December 31, 2021. For additional information regarding the Corporation's accounting policies for the CARES Act, refer to page F-50 in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation's 2021 Annual Report. 

The following table presents a summary of nonperforming assets and past due loans.

Table of Contents 

Nonperforming assets increased $5 million to $274 million at March 31, 2022, from $269 million at December 31, 2021. The increase in nonperforming assets was primarily due to an increase of $22 million in nonaccrual retail loans, as temporary legislative relief for COVID-19-related deferrals ended on December 31, 2021, partially offset by a $17 million decrease in nonaccrual business loans. Nonperforming loans were 0.55 percent of total loans at March 31, 2022, compared to 0.54 percent at December 31, 2021. For further information regarding the composition of nonaccrual loans, refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.

Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest generally represent loans that are well-collateralized and in the process of collection. Loans past due 90 days or more decreased $1 million to $26 million at March 31, 2022, compared to $27 million at December 31, 2021. Loans past due 30-89 days increased $51 million to $204 million at March 31, 2022, compared to $153 million at December 31, 2021. Loans past due 30 days or more and still accruing interest as a percentage of total loans were 0.46 percent and 0.36 percent at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. An aging analysis of loans included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements provides further information about the balances comprising past due loans. 

The following table presents a summary of total criticized loans. The Corporation's criticized list is consistent with the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful categories defined by regulatory authorities. Criticized loans with balances of $2 million or more on nonaccrual status or loans with balances of $1 million or more whose terms have been modified in a TDR are individually subjected to quarterly credit quality reviews, and the Corporation may establish specific allowances for such loans. A table of loans by credit quality indicator included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements provides further information about the balances comprising total criticized loans. 

(dollar amounts in millions) March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Total criticized loans $ 1,647 $ 1,573 As a percentage of total loans 3.3 % 3.2 % 

The $74 million increase in criticized loans during the three months ended March 31, 2022 included increases of $99 million in general Middle Market and $38 million in Environmental Services, partially offset by a $58 million decrease in Entertainment. 

Concentrations of Credit Risk 

Concentrations of credit risk may exist when a number of borrowers are engaged in similar activities, or activities in the same geographic region, and have similar economic characteristics that would cause them to be similarly impacted by changes in economic or other conditions. The Corporation has concentrations of credit risk with the commercial real estate and automotive industries. All other industry concentrations, as defined by management, individually represented less than 10 percent of total loans at March 31, 2022. 

Commercial Real Estate Lending 

At March 31, 2022, the Corporation's commercial real estate portfolio represented 29 percent of total loans. The following table summarizes the Corporation's commercial real estate loan portfolio by loan category. 

March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (in millions) Commercial Real Estate business line (a) Other (b) Total Commercial Real Estate business line (a) Other (b) Total Real estate construction loans $ 1,775 $ 526 $ 2,301 $ 2,391 $ 557 $ 2,948 Commercial mortgage loans 3,779 8,213 11,992 3,338 7,917 11,255 Total commercial real estate $ 5,554 $ 8,739 $ 14,293 $ 5,729 $ 8,474 $ 14,203 

(a) Primarily loans to real estate developers. 

(b) Primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate. 

The Corporation limits risk inherent in its commercial real estate lending activities by monitoring borrowers directly involved in the commercial real estate markets and adhering to conservative policies on loan-to-value ratios for such loans. Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $14.3 billion at March 31, 2022. Of the total, $5.6 billion, or 39 percent, were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which includes loans to real estate developers, a decrease of $175 million compared to December 31, 2021. Commercial real estate loans in other business lines totaled $8.7 billion, or 61 percent, at March 31, 2022, an increase of $265 million compared to December 31, 2021. These loans consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages, which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans. Generally, loans previously reported as real estate construction are classified as commercial mortgage loans upon receipt of a certificate of occupancy. 

The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-tenured customers with satisfactory completion experience. There were no criticized real estate construction loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line at both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. In other business lines, criticized real estate construction loans totaled $13 million at March 31, 2022, compared to $35 million at December 31, 2021. Real estate construction loan charge-offs were $1 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022, compared to zero for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and for the three months ended March 31, 2021.

Commercial mortgage loans are loans where the primary collateral is a lien on any real property and are primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate. Real property is generally considered primary collateral if the value of that collateral represents more than 50 percent of the commitment at loan approval. Loans in the commercial mortgage portfolio generally mature within three to five years. Criticized commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $29 million at both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. In other business lines, $222 million and $219 million of commercial mortgage loans were criticized at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. There were no commercial mortgage loan net charge-offs during the three months ended March 31, 2022, compared to $2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and zero for the three months ended March 31, 2021. 

Automotive Lending - Dealer 

The following table presents a summary of dealer loans. 

March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (in millions) Loans Outstanding Percent of Total Loans Loans Outstanding Percent of Total Loans Dealer: Floor plan $ 743 $ 681 Other 3,659 3,481 Total dealer $ 4,402 8.9 % $ 4,162 8.4 % 

Substantially all dealer loans are in the National Dealer Services business line and primarily include floor plan financing and other loans to automotive dealerships. Floor plan loans, included in commercial loans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, totaled $743 million at March 31, 2022, an increase of $62 million compared to $681 million at December 31, 2021, as an imbalance in supply and demand impacted by a shortage in microchips used in automotive production continues to depress floor plan loan balances. Other loans to automotive dealers in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $3.7 billion, including $2.1 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans at March 31, 2022 and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2021, respectively. 

There were no nonaccrual dealer loans at both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Additionally, there were no net charge-offs of dealer loans during the three months ended March 31, 2022, the three months ended December 31, 2021, or the three months ended March 31, 2021.

Residential real estate loans, which consist of traditional residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit, totaled $3.3 billion at March 31, 2022. The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation's primary geographic markets. Substantially all residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more are placed on nonaccrual status, and substantially all junior lien home equity loans that are current or less than 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual status if full collection of the senior position is in doubt. At no later than 180 days past due, such loans are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell. 

Residential mortgages totaled $1.8 billion at March 31, 2022, and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the $1.8 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, $53 million were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2022, an increase of $17 million as temporary legislative relief for COVID-19-related deferrals ended on December 31, 2021. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.5 billion at March 31, 2022, of which 96 percent was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit, 3 percent were in amortizing status and 1 percent were closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.5 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $14 million were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2022. A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens at March 31, 2022. 

Energy Lending 

The Corporation has a portfolio of Energy loans that are included entirely in commercial loans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Customers in the Corporation's Energy business line are engaged in three segments of the oil and gas business: exploration and production (E&#38;P), midstream and energy services. E&#38;P generally includes such activities as searching for potential oil and gas fields, drilling exploratory wells and operating active wells. Commitments to E&#38;P borrowers are generally subject to semi-annual borrowing base re-determinations based on a variety of factors including updated prices (reflecting market and competitive conditions), energy reserve levels and the impact of hedging. The midstream sector is generally involved in the transportation, storage and marketing of crude and/or refined oil and gas products. The Corporation's legacy energy services customers provide products and services primarily to the E&#38;P segment. 

The following table summarizes information about loans in the Corporation's Energy business line.

Leveraged Loans 

Certain loans in the Corporation's commercial portfolio are considered leveraged transactions. These loans are typically used for mergers, acquisitions, business recapitalizations, refinancing and equity buyouts. To help mitigate the risk associated with these loans, the Corporation focuses on middle market companies with highly capable management teams, strong sponsors and solid track records of financial performance. Industries prone to cyclical downturns and acquisitions with a high degree of integration risk are generally avoided. Other considerations include the sufficiency of collateral, the level of balance sheet leverage and the adequacy of financial covenants. During the underwriting process, cash flows are stress-tested to evaluate the borrowers' abilities to handle economic downturns and an increase in interest rates. 

The FDIC defines higher-risk commercial and industrial (HR C&#38;I) loans for assessment purposes as loans generally with leverage of four times total debt to earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation (EBITDA) as well as three times senior debt to EBITDA, excluding certain collateralized loans. 

The following table summarizes information about HR C&#38;I loans, which represented 7 percent and 6 percent of total loans at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

Market and Liquidity Risk 

Market risk represents the risk of loss due to adverse movement in prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. Liquidity risk represents the risk that the Corporation does not have sufficient access to funds to maintain its normal operations at all times or does not have the ability to raise or borrow funds at a reasonable cost at all times. 

The Asset and Liability Policy Committee (ALCO) of the Corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities. ALCO meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the Corporation, including treasury, finance, economics, lending, deposit gathering and risk management. Corporate Treasury mitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of ALCO through the actions it takes to manage the Corporation's market, liquidity and capital positions. 

The Corporation performs monthly liquidity stress testing to evaluate its ability to meet funding needs in hypothetical stressed environments. Such environments cover a series of scenarios, including both idiosyncratic and market-wide in nature, which vary in terms of duration and severity. The evaluation as of March 31, 2022 projected that sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events. 

In addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis, Corporate Treasury also monitors the parent company's liquidity and has established liquidity coverage requirements for meeting expected obligations without the support of additional dividends from subsidiaries. ALCO's policy on liquidity risk management requires the parent company to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet expected cash obligations over a period of no less than 12 months. The Corporation had liquid assets of $1.3 billion on an unconsolidated basis at March 31, 2022. 

Corporate Treasury and the Enterprise Risk Division support ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks. Key activities encompass: (i) providing information and analyses of the Corporation's balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks; (ii) monitoring and reporting of the Corporation's positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines; (iii) developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions; (iv) reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval; and (v) monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks. 

Interest Rate Risk 

Net interest income is the primary source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities, primarily through the 

Table of Contents 

Corporation's core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by core deposits. Including the impact of interest rate swaps converting floating-rate loans to fixed, the Corporation's loan composition at March 31, 2022 was 61 percent 30-day rate (primarily LIBOR), 22 percent fixed-rate, 12 percent prime and 5 percent comprised of 90-day and greater rates. Additionally, 32 percent of total loans had non-zero interest rate floors protecting against future rate declines. The composition of the loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the faster repricing of the floating-rate loan portfolio versus deposit products. In addition, the growth and/or contraction in the Corporation's loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing fixed-rate investment securities, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest rate sensitivity, as well as hedging with interest rate swaps and options. Other mitigating factors include interest rate floors on a portion of the loan portfolio. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity. Based on the current rising rate environment, the Corporation anticipates it will continue to add fixed-rate investment securities and cash flow hedges over time to manage its interest rate risk by reducing its sensitivity to rate movements and to pull the benefit of future rate increases forward. 

Since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives, a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk. These techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve utilizing multiple simulation analyses. Simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors, including, but not limited to, the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, regulatory impacts and management strategies. 

Sensitivity of Net Interest Income to Changes in Interest Rates 

The analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is management's principal risk management technique. Management models a base-case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment. Model assumptions in this base case at March 31, 2022 included a modest increase in loan balances, loan spreads held at current levels, a moderate decrease in deposit balances and the securities portfolio held at existing levels. The average balance of the securities portfolio was $17.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022 with an average yield of 1.74 percent and average duration of 4.6 years, including $3.6 billion purchased during the first quarter of 2022 with an average yield of 2.51 percent and average duration of 6.2 years. At March 31, 2022, derivative instruments were comprised of interest rate swaps that convert $2.7 billion of fixed-rate medium- and long-term debt to variable rates through fair value hedges and convert $11.2 billion of variable-rate loans to fixed rates through cash flow hedges, which had an average rate and time to maturity of 1.78 percent and 3.2 years, respectively, including $3.5 billion entered into during the first quarter of 2022 at an average rate and duration of 2.02 percent and 5.7 years, respectively. 

As of April 25, 2022, $1.5 billion of securities with an average yield of 3.40 percent and average duration of 8.1 years were purchased in the second quarter of 2022. In addition, during this same period, cash flow hedges to convert $2.5 billion of variable-rate loans to fixed rates were entered into which had an average rate and duration of 2.65 percent and 6.3 years, respectively, and varying start dates through October 2022. The second quarter 2022 purchased securities and cash flow hedges are not included in the interest rate sensitivity model assumptions. 

Additionally, included in this analysis are $15.8 billion of loans that were subject to an average interest rate floor of 59 basis points at March 31, 2022. This base-case net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which short-term rates rise or decline 100 basis points (with a floor of zero percent) in a linear, non-parallel fashion from the base case over 12 months, resulting in an average change of 50 basis points over the period while long-term rates increase or decrease to a lesser degree. 

Each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth, investment security prepayment levels, depositor behavior, yield curve changes, loan and deposit pricing, and overall balance sheet mix and growth which are in line with historical patterns. However, in this low-rate environment, depositors have maintained a higher level of liquidity and their historical behavior may be less indicative of future trends. Changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis. 

Table of Contents 

The table below, as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above. 

Estimated Annual Change March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (dollar amounts in millions) Amount % Amount % Change in Interest Rates: Change in Interest Rates: Rising 100 basis points $ 160 8 % Rising 100 basis points 

$ 205 12 % (50 basis points on average) (50 basis points on average) Declining to zero percent (91) (5) Declining to zero percent 

(46) (3) 

Sensitivity to declining interest rates increased from December 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022 primarily due to the March increase in the federal funds rate, allowing for greater balance sheet repricing before reaching the assumed zero percent lower bound. The rate increase was partially offset by additional cash flow hedges and investment securities added during the first quarter of 2022. Sensitivity to rising interest rates decreased due to cash flow hedges and non-maturity deposit runoff, partially offset by the higher repricing potential of floating-rate loans as they move above their contractual floor rates. 

Based on the balance sheet composition and interest rate hedges in existence at March 31, 2022, using management's expectations for loan and deposit activity and assuming a 50 basis point increase in the federal funds rate following the May 2022 Federal Open Market Committee meeting, management expects that net interest income for full-year 2022 will increase by more than 13 percent compared to the prior year, with net interest income for the second quarter 2022 increasing approximately 15 percent compared to the first quarter 2022. Additionally, assuming the implied forward rates as of March 31, 2022, including a federal funds rate of 2.25% to 2.50% by the end of 2022, net interest income for full-year 2022 would be projected to approximate $2.3 billion, a 23 percent increase compared to the prior year. The Corporation believes securities acquired and cash flow hedges entered into during the second quarter would increase these 2022 net interest income estimates. 

Sensitivity of Economic Value of Equity to Changes in Interest Rates 

In addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income, an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position. The economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the Corporation's financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period, and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements. The Corporation primarily monitors the percentage change on the base-case economic value of equity. The economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel 100 basis point shock with a floor of zero percent. 

The table below, as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above. 

March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (dollar amounts in millions) Amount % Amount % Change in Interest Rates: Change in Interest Rates: Rising 100 basis points $ 610 4 % Rising 100 basis points $ 1,353 9 % Declining to zero percent (424) (3) Declining to zero percent (446) (3) 

The sensitivity of the economic value of equity to rising rates decreased from December 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022 primarily due to additional cash flow hedges, growth in the securities portfolio and deposit runoff, which also led to decreased sensitivity to declining rates (limited by the assumption of a zero percent rate floor.) 

LIBOR Transition 

On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. Effective March 2021, the FCA confirmed that certain LIBOR tenors will no longer be supported after December 31, 2021 and that the remaining tenors, including those most commonly used by the Corporation, will cease to be supported after June 30, 2023. The Corporation has substantial exposure to LIBOR-based products, including loans and derivatives, and is preparing for a transition from LIBOR toward alternative rates. 

As of July 1, 2021, the Corporation was operationally ready to issue new Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)-based cash and derivative products. Additionally, as of September 30, 2021, the Corporation was operationally ready to issue new Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index (BSBY)-based cash and derivative products. The Corporation ceased originating LIBOR-based products in the fourth quarter of 2021, while communications and learning activities to support customers and colleagues are ongoing. As of March 31, 2022, the Corporation estimates that approximately 45 percent of its LIBOR-based 

Table of Contents 

commercial loans have maturity dates prior to the cessation of LIBOR. Of the remaining loans with maturity dates beyond the cessation date, the Corporation estimates that 41 percent incorporate fallback language and is confident that it will achieve timely remediation of all other loans. In addition to remediation activity on LIBOR-based loans, the Corporation has enacted the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) protocols related to derivatives. Once events occur that trigger a fallback, the reference rate for the variable leg of the swap will fall back from LIBOR to the ISDA Fallback Rate, which is the daily SOFR plus a spread. 

The Corporation's enterprise transition timelines are closely aligned with recommendations from the Alternative Reference Rates Committee for both best practices and recommended objectives. The Corporation will continue to align with industry and regulatory guidelines regarding the cessation of LIBOR as well as monitor market developments for transitioning to alternative reference rates. For a discussion of the various risks facing the Corporation in relation to the transition away from LIBOR, see the market risk discussion within &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; beginning on page 13 of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Sources of Liquidity 

The Corporation maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately satisfy its financial obligations while taking into account potential commitment draws and deposit run-off that may occur in the normal course of business. The majority of the Corporation's balance sheet is funded by customer deposits. Cash flows from loan repayments, increases in deposit accounts, activity in the securities portfolio and the purchased funds market serve as the Corporation's primary liquidity sources. 

The Corporation satisfies incremental liquidity needs with either liquid assets or external funding sources. The Corporation had access to liquid assets of $27.8 billion and $35.3 billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, which included cash on deposit with the Federal Reserve and the portion of the investment securities portfolio that the Corporation can sell without third-party consent. 

In addition, the Corporation may access external funding sources when necessary, which include FHLB advances, federal funds, reverse repurchase agreements, brokered deposits and Corporation-issued bonds. The Corporation maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission from which it may issue debt and equity securities. 

Purchased funds decreased to $31 million at March 31, 2022 compared to $50 million at December 31, 2021. At March 31, 2022, the Bank had pledged loans totaling $22.7 billion which provided for up to $19.2 billion of available collateralized borrowing with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB). The Bank is also a member of the FHLB of Dallas, Texas, which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related loans, certain government agency-backed securities and other eligible assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral pledged to the FHLB. At March 31, 2022, $ 17.8 billion of real estate-related loans were pledged to the FHLB as collateral providing $ 9.9 billion for potential future borrowings. 

The ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise funds at competitive rates is impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity, capital, earnings and other relevant factors related to the Corporation and the Bank. As of March 31, 2022, the three major rating agencies had assigned the following ratings to long-term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

The Corporation&#8217;s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation's 2021 Annual Report. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation&#8217;s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2021, the most critical of these estimates related to the allowance for credit losses, fair value measurement, goodwill, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These estimates were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully on pages F-34 through F-37 in the Corporation's 2021 Annual Report. As of the date of this report, there have been no significant changes to the Corporation's critical accounting estimates.

SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATA 

The Corporation believes non-GAAP measures are meaningful because they reflect adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and our performance trends. Tangible common equity is used by the Corporation to measure the quality of capital and the return relative to balance sheet risk. 

Common equity tier 1 capital ratio removes preferred stock from the Tier 1 capital ratio as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank regulations. The tangible common equity ratio removes the effect of intangible assets from capital and total assets. Tangible common equity per share of common stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders' equity per share of common stock. 

The following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and regulatory ratios used in this financial review with financial measures defined by GAAP.
