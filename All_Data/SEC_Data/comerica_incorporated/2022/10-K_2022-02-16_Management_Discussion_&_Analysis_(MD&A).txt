2021 OVERVIEW

Comerica Incorporated (the Corporation) is a financial holding company headquartered in Dallas, Texas. The Corporation's major business segments are
the Commercial Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. Information about the activities of the Corporation's business segments is provided in Note 22 to
the consolidated financial statements.

As a financial institution, the Corporation's principal activity is lending to and accepting deposits from businesses and individuals. The primary source of
revenue is net interest income, which is principally derived from the difference between interest earned on loans and investment securities and interest paid on
deposits  and  other  funding  sources.  The  Corporation  also  provides  other  products  and  services  that  meet  the  financial  needs  of  customers  which  generate
noninterest  income,  the  Corporation's  secondary  source  of  revenue.  Growth  in  loans,  deposits  and  noninterest  income  is  affected  by  many  factors,  including
economic conditions in the markets the Corporation serves, the financial requirements and economic health of customers, and the ability to add new customers
and/or increase the number of products used by current customers. Success in providing products and services depends on the financial needs of customers and the
types of products desired.

The accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation and its subsidiaries conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United
States (U.S.). The Corporation's consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are
described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. When necessary, the Corporation uses reasonable assumptions to develop estimates that affect the
consolidated results of operations. The most critical of these estimates are discussed in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of this financial review.

Full-Year 2021 compared to Full-Year 2020

• Net  income  increased  $671  million  to  $1.2  billion,  driven  by  a  benefit  in  the  provision  for  credit  losses  as  credit  metrics  and  the  economic  outlook
improved from the height of the pandemic in 2020. Net income was also impacted by record noninterest income, partially offset by higher noninterest
expenses driven by increased performance-related compensation and lower net interest income related to the continued low rate environment. Diluted net
income per common share was $8.35 in 2021 compared to $3.43 in 2020.

• Average  loans  decreased  $2.5  billion,  or  5  percent,  to  $49.1  billion,  reflecting  declines  in  National  Dealer  Services,  Energy,  Technology  and  Life
Sciences, Mortgage Banker Finance and general Middle Market, partially offset by increases in Equity Fund Services, Entertainment and Environmental
Services. Average Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, which are reported within lines of business, decreased $200 million to $2.3 billion. Period-
end PPP loans were $459 million at December 31, 2021, a decrease of $3.0 billion compared to $3.5 billion at December 31, 2020.

• Average  securities  increased  $2.3  billion,  or  17  percent,  to  $15.7  billion,  reflecting  investment  of  a  portion  of  excess  liquidity  into  mortgage-backed

securities.

• Average deposits increased $12.6 billion, or 19 percent, to a record $77.7 billion, driven by customer profitability and capital markets activity, as well as

the liquidity injected into the economy through fiscal and monetary actions.

• Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $8.4 billion, or 25 percent, while average interest-bearing deposits increased $4.3 billion, or 13 percent.
•

Net interest income decreased $67 million to $1.8 billion, and the net interest margin decreased 33 basis points to 2.21 percent, primarily reflecting lower
interest rates, partially offset by an increase in PPP income.
The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $384 million, compared to an expense of $537 million in 2020, reflecting strong credit quality and the
economy re-opening as well as improvements in the economic forecast and in the Energy portfolio since the onset of the pandemic in 2020.

•

• Noninterest income increased $122 million to $1.1 billion, reflecting increases in derivative income, card fees, commercial lending fees, fiduciary income

and service charges on deposit accounts, partially offset by a decrease in brokerage fees.

• Noninterest expenses increased $107 million to $1.9 billion, primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits expense, outside processing fee expense,
consulting  fees  and  litigation-related  expenses,  partially  offset  by  decreases  in  non-salary  pension  expense,  operational  losses  and  FDIC  insurance
expense.
The  provision  for  income  taxes  increased  $198  million  to  $322  million,  primarily  due  to  higher  pre-tax  income,  partially  offset  by  higher  discrete  tax
benefits.
The Corporation repurchased approximately 9.5 million shares of common stock and declared common dividends of $2.72 per share. Altogether, $1.1
billion was returned to common shareholders. Additionally, the Corporation declared $23 million in preferred dividends.

(a) Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume.

Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities. Gains and losses related to risk management interest
rate  swaps  that  convert  fixed  rate  debt  to  a  floating  rate  and  qualify  as  fair  value  hedges  are  included  in  interest  expense  on  medium-  and  long-term  debt.
Additionally, the portion of gains and losses on risk management interest rate swaps that convert variable-rate loans to fixed rates through cash flow hedges that
relate  to  the  earnings  effect  of  the  hedged  loans  during  the  period  are  included  in  loan  interest  income.  Refer  to  the  Analysis  of  Net  Interest  Income  and  the
Rate/Volume Analysis tables above for an analysis of net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 and details of the components of
the change in net interest income for 2021 compared to 2020 as well as 2020 compared to 2019.

Net interest income was $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $67 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.
The decrease in net interest income reflected lower yields on earning assets and a decrease in loan balances, partially offset by an increase in PPP income and
lower rates paid on deposits and debt. Net interest margin was 2.21 percent for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of 33 basis points compared to 2.54
percent for the comparable period in 2020. The decrease in net interest margin reflected the decline in the average 30-day LIBOR, from 0.52 percent for the year
ended December 31, 2020 to 0.10 percent for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Average  earning  assets  increased  $8.3  billion,  due  to  increases  of  $8.5  billion  in  interest-bearing  deposits  with  banks  and  $2.3  billion  in  investment
securities, partially offset by a $2.5 billion decrease in loans. Average interest-bearing funding sources increased $429 million, primarily reflecting a $4.3 billion
increase in interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a $3.5 billion decrease in medium- and long-term debt.

The  Corporation  utilizes  various  asset  and  liability  management  strategies  to  manage  net  interest  income  exposure  to  interest  rate  risk.  Refer  to  the
“Market and Liquidity Risk” section of this financial review for additional information regarding the Corporation's asset and liability management policies and the
“Balance Sheet and Capital Funds Analysis” section for further discussion on changes in earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

Provision for Credit Losses

The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $384 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to an expense of $537 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020. The change in provision for credit losses reflected strong credit quality and the re-opening of the economy as well as improvements in
the economic forecast and in the Energy portfolio since the onset of the pandemic in 2020. Net loan recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $10
million, or 0.02 percent of average total loans, compared to net charge-offs of $196 million, or 0.38 percent of average total loans, for the year ended December 31,
2020. This decline was largely driven by a decrease of $173 million in Energy net charge-offs to $48 million in net loan recoveries for the year ended December
31, 2021.

An  analysis  of  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  and  a  summary  of  nonperforming  assets  are  presented  under  the  "Credit  Risk"  subheading  in  the  "Risk

Management" section of this financial review. Further information about the adoption of CECL is presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

(a) Beginning in first quarter 2021, the Corporation reported customer derivative income, previously a component of other noninterest income, and foreign exchange income as a
combined item captioned by derivative income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Prior periods have been adjusted to conform to this presentation, and the changes in
presentation do not impact total noninterest income.

(b) The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income.

Noninterest  income  increased  $122  million  to  $1.1  billion.  Increases  in  derivative  income,  card  fees,  commercial  lending  fees,  fiduciary  income  and
service charges on deposit accounts were partially offset by a decrease in brokerage fees. Noninterest income was also impacted by an increase in other noninterest
income, driven by higher income from principal investing and warrants, partially offset by market valuation adjustments recorded in securities trading income.

Card fees consist primarily of interchange and other fee income earned on government prepaid card, commercial card, debit/Automated Teller Machine
(ATM) card and merchant payment processing services. Card fees increased $28 million, or 10 percent, driven by volume increases in both merchant payment
processing services and government cards mostly related to additional stimulus payments resulting in higher interchange revenue. Additionally, both commercial
and consumer card volumes increased as social distancing restrictions were relaxed.

Fiduciary income, consisting of fees and commissions from asset management, custody, recordkeeping, investment advisory and other services provided
primarily to personal and institutional trust customers, increased $22 million, or 11 percent. The increase was driven by new sales and higher market-based fees as
well as increased investment advisory fees, partially offset by decreased institutional trust fees related to lower rates.

Service charges on deposit accounts consist primarily of charges on retail and business accounts, including fees for treasury management services. Service

charges on deposit accounts increased $10 million, or 6 percent, as volume returned to pre-pandemic levels, leading to increased commercial activity.

Commercial  lending  fees  include  fees  assessed  on  the  unused  portion  of  lines  of  credit  (unused  commitment  fees),  syndication  agent  fees  and  loan
servicing fees. These fees increased $27 million, or 35 percent, reflecting higher syndication agent fees due to growth in the average size and number of deals, as
well as increased loan commitment fees related to lower utilization rates on lines of credit.

Derivative  income  consists  of  net  gains  and  losses  recognized  on  customer-initiated  derivative  instruments,  net  of  the  impact  of  offsetting  positions.
Derivative income increased $32 million, or 47 percent, primarily due to favorable credit valuation adjustments, partially offset by a decrease in interest rate swap
activity.

Brokerage fees are commissions earned for facilitating securities transactions for customers as well as other brokerage services provided. Brokerage fees
decreased  $7  million,  or  33  percent,  primarily  due  to  lower  money  market  funds  fee  revenue  as  spreads  remained  compressed  resulting  from  a  decline  in  the
federal funds rate since 2020.

Other noninterest income increased $8 million, or 8 percent, as detailed below, driven by higher income from principal investing and warrants related to

warrant exercises, partially offset by lower securities trading income due to fair value adjustments on previously converted warrants.

(a) The  years  ended  December  31,  2020  and  2019  have  been  recast  to  reflect  the  retrospective  application  of  the  Corporation's  election  to  change  the  accounting  method  for
certain components of expense related to the defined benefit pension plan, resulting in a decrease of $30 million and $6 million, respectively. See Note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements for further information and impacts of the change in accounting policy.

Noninterest  expenses  increased  $107  million  to  $1.9  billion,  primarily  due  to  higher  salaries  and  benefits  expense,  outside  processing  fee  expense,

consulting fees and litigation-related expenses, partially offset by decreases in non-salary pension expense, operational losses and FDIC insurance expense.

Salaries and benefits expense increased $114 million, or 11 percent, reflecting higher performance-based incentive compensation (including share-based

compensation) driven by strong financial results, staff insurance expense and technology-related contract labor.

Outside processing fee expense increased $24 million, or 10 percent, primarily due to data processing support for PPP loans and volume-related increases

in merchant payment and government card processing expenses, which are tied to card fee revenue.

FDIC insurance expense decreased $11 million, or 33 percent, primarily due to lower risk-based assessment fees.

Other  noninterest  expenses  decreased  $27  million,  or  41  percent,  driven  by  declines  of  $34  million  in  non-salary  pension  expense  and  $18  million  in
operational losses related to several one-time events in 2020, partially offset by increases of $14 million in consulting fees and $10 million in litigation-related
expenses.

Income Taxes and Related Items

The provision for income taxes was $322 million in 2021, compared to $124 million in 2020. The $198 million increase in the provision for income taxes
primarily reflected higher pre-tax income partially offset by a $7 million increase in tax benefits resulting from adjustments to annual federal filings, resolution of
certain state matters and employee stock transactions.

Net  deferred  tax  assets  were  $9  million  at  December  31,  2021,  compared  to  $3  million  at  December  31,  2020.  Refer  to  Note  18  to  the  consolidated
financial statements for information about the components of net deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets of $344 million were evaluated for realization and it was
determined  that  a  valuation  allowance  of  $5  million  for  federal  foreign  tax  credits  and  certain  state  net  operating  loss  (NOL)  carryforwards  was  needed  at
December 31, 2021, compared to a valuation allowance of $3 million for certain state NOL carryforwards at December 31, 2020. For further information on the
Corporation’s valuation policy for deferred tax assets, refer to Note 1.

STRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESS

The  Corporation  has  strategically  aligned  its  operations  into  three  major  business  segments:  the  Commercial  Bank,  the  Retail  Bank  and  Wealth
Management. These business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided. In addition to the three
major business segments, the Finance Division is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes items not directly associated with the business segments
or the Finance segment. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable
with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not
indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements describes the Corporation's
segment reporting methodology as well as the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of the business segments for the years
ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.

The Corporation's management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies, which
are  regularly  reviewed  and  refined.  These  methodologies  may  be  modified  as  the  management  accounting  system  is  enhanced  and  changes  occur  in  the
organizational structure and/or product lines.

Net interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities plus the
net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing (FTP). The FTP methodology allocates credits to each business segment for deposits and other funds
provided  as  well  as  charges  for  loans  and  other  assets  being  funded.  FTP  crediting  rates  on  deposits  and  other  funds  provided  reflect  the  long-term  value  of
deposits and other funding sources based on their implied maturities. Due to the longer-term nature of implied maturities, FTP crediting rates are generally less
volatile than changes in interest rates observed in the market. FTP charge rates for funding loans and other assets reflect a matched cost of funds based on the
pricing and duration characteristics of the assets. As a result of applying matched funding, interest revenue for each segment resulting from loans and other assets
is generally not impacted by changes in interest rates. Therefore, net interest income for each segment primarily reflects the volume of loans and other earning
assets at the spread over the matched cost of funds, as well as the volume of deposits at the associated FTP crediting rates. Due to the impact of lower interest
rates, business segments, particularly those focused on generating deposits, were impacted by lower FTP crediting rates on deposits compared to the prior year.
Similarly, FTP charges for funding loans decreased in 2021.

The following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.

Average loans decreased $2.3 billion, reflecting decreases in National Dealer Services related to supply chain issues resulting in lower inventory levels
and in Energy related to reduced production activity, as well as declines in Technology and Life Sciences, Mortgage Banker Finance and general Middle Market,
partially offset by growth in Equity Fund Services, Entertainment and Environmental Services. Average deposits increased $9.0 billion, reflecting increases in all
deposit categories due to customers' solid profitability and capital markets activity. The Commercial Bank's net income increased $661 million to $1.3 billion. Net
interest income decreased slightly, while the provision for credit losses decreased $841 million to a benefit of $346 million, reflecting strong credit quality and the
economy re-opening as well as improvements in economic forecasts and in the Energy portfolio since the onset of the pandemic in 2020. Net credit-related charge-
offs decreased $204 million to $12 million in net recoveries, primarily due to a reduction of $173 million in Energy net charge-offs. Noninterest income increased
$108  million,  driven  by  higher  derivative  income,  warrant  income,  commercial  lending  fees  and  card  fees,  partially  offset  by  a  decrease  in  securities  trading
income. Noninterest expenses increased $58 million, primarily reflecting increases in corporate overhead, salaries and benefits expense and outside processing fee
expense, partially offset by decreases in FDIC insurance and litigation-related expenses.

Average  total  loans  decreased  $2.5  billion  to  $49.1  billion  in  2021,  compared  to  $51.6  billion  in  2020.  Middle  Market  business  lines  generally  serve
customers with annual revenue between $30 million and $500 million. Within the Middle Market business lines, the largest changes were decreases in National
Dealer  Services  and  Energy.  National  Dealer  Services  provides  floor  plan  inventory  financing  and  commercial  mortgages  to  auto  dealerships.  The  $1.6  billion
decrease in National Dealer Services loans reflected the impact of supply chain issues resulting in lower inventory levels. Customers in the Energy business line
are primarily engaged in the oil and gas businesses. The $645 million decrease in Energy loans reflected reduced production activity. For more information on
Energy loans, refer to "Energy Lending" in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.

average basis, investment securities increased $2.3 billion to $15.7 billion in 2021, compared to $13.4 billion in 2020 as excess liquidity was invested in mortgage-
backed securities.

Interest-Bearing Deposits with Banks and Other Short-Term Investments

Interest-bearing deposits with banks primarily include deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) and also include deposits with banks in developed
countries or international banking facilities of foreign banks located in the United States. Interest-bearing deposits with banks are mostly used to manage liquidity
requirements of the Corporation. On a period-end basis, interest-bearing deposits with banks increased $6.7 billion to $21.4 billion at December 31, 2021, resulting
from growth in relationship-based deposits due to continued customer profitability and capital markets activity. On an average basis, interest-bearing deposits with
banks increased $8.5 billion to $18.7 billion in 2021.

Other short-term investments include federal funds sold, trading securities, money market investments and loans held-for-sale. Substantially all trading
securities are deferred compensation plan assets. Loans held-for-sale typically represent residential mortgage loans originated with management's intention to sell
and, from time to time, other loans that are transferred

to  held-for-sale.  On  a  period-end  basis,  other  short-term  investments  increased  $25  million  to  $197  million  at  December  31,  2021.  On  an  average  basis,  other
short-term investments increased $30 million to $183 million in 2021.

Deposits and Borrowed Funds

On a period-end basis, total deposits were $82.3 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of $9.5 billion, or 13 percent, compared to $72.9 billion at
December 31, 2020, reflecting increases of $6.4 billion, or 16 percent, in noninterest-bearing deposits and $3.1 billion, or 9 percent, in interest-bearing deposits.

Average deposits increased $12.6 billion to $77.7 billion in 2021, compared to $65.0 billion in 2020, reflecting increases of $8.4 billion in noninterest-
bearing and $4.3 billion in interest-bearing deposits. The increases were primarily the result of customers' solid profitability and capital markets activity as well as
liquidity injected into the economy through fiscal and monetary actions.

Uninsured deposits are defined as the portion of deposit accounts in U.S. offices that exceed the FDIC insurance limit and amounts in any other uninsured
investment or deposit account that are classified as deposits and are not subject to any federal or state deposit insurance regimes. Total uninsured deposits were
$71.8 billion and $52.0 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, as calculated per regulatory guidance. The portion of domestic time deposits in excess
of insurance limits was $554 million and $524 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Time deposits otherwise uninsured, which consist of foreign
office time deposits, totaled $50 million at December 31, 2021 and all mature in three months or less.

On a period-end basis, there were no short-term borrowings at both December 31, 2021, and 2020. Short-term borrowings primarily include federal funds
purchased, short-term Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Average short-term borrowings were $314
million in 2020, which primarily consisted of short-term FHLB advances, which the Corporation settled in full during the first half of 2020.

The  Corporation  uses  medium-  and  long-term  debt,  which  includes  long-term  FHLB  advances,  medium-  and  long-term  senior  notes  as  well  as
subordinated  notes,  to  provide  funding  for  earning  assets,  liquidity  and  regulatory  capital.  On  a  period-end  basis,  total  medium-  and  long-term  debt  at
December  31,  2021  decreased  $2.9  billion  to  $2.8  billion,  compared  to  $5.7  billion  at  December  31,  2020,  which  reflected  the  repayment  of  $2.8  billion  in
floating-rate FHLB advances during the first quarter of 2021. Average medium- and long-term debt decreased $3.5 billion, or 54 percent, to $3.0 billion in 2021,
compared to $6.5 billion in 2020.

Further information on medium- and long-term debt is provided in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.

vesting  under  the  terms  of  an  employee  share-based  compensation  plan  during  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021.  These  transactions  are  not  considered  part  of  the
Corporation's repurchase program.

On April 27, 2021 the Corporation's Board of Directors approved the authorization to repurchase up to an additional 10 million shares of its outstanding
common stock, including an Accelerated Share Repurchase transaction (ASR) effected in the second quarter of 2021. Since the inception of the share repurchase
program in 2010, a total of 97.2 million shares have been authorized for repurchase. There is no expiration date for the share repurchase program. The timing and
actual  amount  of  additional  share  repurchases  are  subject  to  various  factors,  including  the  Corporation's  earnings  generation,  capital  needs  to  fund  future  loan
growth and market conditions.

The  Corporation  continues  to  target  a  Common  Equity  Tier  1  (CET1)  capital  ratio  of  approximately  10  percent  with  active  capital  management.  At

December 31, 2021, the Corporation's CET1 capital ratio was 10.13 percent, a decrease of 21 basis points compared to December 31, 2020.

The Corporation is subject to the capital adequacy standards under the Basel III regulatory framework (Basel III). This regulatory framework establishes
comprehensive methodologies for calculating regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets (RWA). Basel III also set minimum capital ratios as well as overall capital
adequacy standards.

Under Basel III, regulatory capital comprises CET1 capital, additional Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. CET1 capital predominantly includes common
shareholders'  equity,  less  certain  deductions  for  goodwill,  intangible  assets  and  deferred  tax  assets  that  arise  from  net  operating  losses  and  tax  credit  carry-
forwards. Additionally, the Corporation has elected to permanently exclude capital in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) related to debt and equity
securities classified as available-for-sale as well as for cash flow hedges and defined benefit postretirement plans from CET1, an option available to standardized
approach entities under Basel III. Tier 1 capital incrementally includes noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital includes Tier 1 capital as well as
subordinated debt qualifying as Tier 2 and qualifying allowance for credit losses. In 2020, the Corporation elected regulatory relief to defer the impact of adopting
the CECL model for measuring credit losses on regulatory capital. The deferred amounts were zero at December 31, 2021 and $72 million at December 31, 2020.
For further information about the adoption of CECL, refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

The  Corporation  computes  RWA  using  the  standardized  approach.  Under  the  standardized  approach,  RWA  is  generally  based  on  supervisory  risk-
weightings which vary by counterparty type and asset class. Under the Basel III standardized approach, capital is required for credit risk RWA, to cover the risk of
unexpected  losses  due  to  failure  of  a  customer  or  counterparty  to  meet  its  financial  obligations  in  accordance  with  contractual  terms;  and  if  trading  assets  and
liabilities exceed certain thresholds, capital is also required for market risk RWA, to cover the risk of losses due to adverse market movements or from position-
specific factors.

The following table presents the minimum ratios required.

capitalized” by the standards developed under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991. Refer to Note 20 to the consolidated financial
statements  for  further  discussion  of  regulatory  capital  requirements,  capital  ratio  calculations  and  restrictions  on  the  ability  of  the  Corporation's  banking

RISK MANAGEMENT

The Corporation assumes various types of risk as a result of conducting business in the normal course. The Corporation's enterprise risk management
framework  provides  a  process  for  identifying,  measuring,  controlling  and  managing  these  risks.  This  framework  incorporates  a  risk  assessment  process,  a
collection  of  risk  committees  that  manage  the  Corporation's  major  risk  elements  and  a  risk  appetite  statement  that  outlines  the  levels  and  types  of  risks  the
Corporation  accepts.  The  Corporation  continuously  enhances  its  enterprise  risk  framework  with  additional  processes,  tools  and  systems  designed  to  not  only
provide management with deeper insight into the various existing and emerging risks in accordance with its appetite for risk, but also to improve the Corporation's
ability to control those risks and ensure that appropriate consideration is received for the risks taken.

The Corporation’s front line employees, the first line of defense, are responsible for the day-to-day management and ownership of risks, including the
identification, assessment, measurement and control of risks encountered as a part of the normal course of business. Each of the major risk categories are further
monitored  and  measured  by  specialized  risk  managers  in  the  second  line  of  defense  within  the  Enterprise  Risk  Division,  who  provide  oversight  as  well  as
independent  and  effective  challenge  and  guidance  for  the  risk  management  activities  of  the  organization.  The  Enterprise  Risk  Division,  led  by  the  Chief  Risk
Officer,  is  responsible  for  designing  and  managing  the  Corporation’s  enterprise  risk  management  framework  and  ensures  effective  risk  management  oversight.
Risk management committees serve as a point of review and escalation for those risks which may have risk interdependencies or where risk levels may be nearing
the limits outlined in the Corporation’s risk appetite statement. These committees comprise senior and executive management that represent views from both the
lines of business and risk management. Internal Audit, the third line of defense, monitors and assesses the overall effectiveness of the risk management framework
on  an  ongoing  basis  and  provides  an  independent,  objective  assessment  of  the  Corporation’s  ability  to  manage  and  control  risk  to  management  and  the  Audit
Committee of the Board.

F-17

Table of Contents

The Enterprise Risk and Return Committee (formerly known as the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Committee), chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, is
established by the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Board and responsible for governance over the risk management framework, providing oversight in managing
the  Corporation's  aggregate  risk  position  and  reporting  on  the  comprehensive  portfolio  of  risks  as  well  as  the  potential  impact  these  risks  can  have  on  the
Corporation's risk profile and resulting capital level. Capital provides the primary buffer for risk and also serves as a measuring tool when evaluating risk. The
Enterprise Risk and Return Committee is principally composed of senior officers and executives representing the different risk areas and business units who are
appointed by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation.

The  Board's  Enterprise  Risk  Committee  meets  quarterly  and  is  chartered  to  assist  the  Board  in  promoting  the  best  interests  of  the  Corporation  by
overseeing policies and risk practices relating to enterprise-wide risk and ensuring compliance with bank regulatory obligations. Members of the Enterprise Risk
Committee are selected such that the committee comprises individuals whose experiences and qualifications can lead to broad and informed views on risk matters
facing  the  Corporation  and  the  financial  services  industry.  These  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  existing  and  emerging  risk  matters  related  to  credit,  market,
liquidity, operational, technology, compliance and strategic conditions. A comprehensive risk report is submitted to the Enterprise Risk Committee each quarter
providing management's view of the Corporation's aggregate risk position.

Further  discussion  and  analyses  of  each  major  risk  area  are  included  in  the  following  sub-sections  of  the  Risk  Management  section  in  this  financial

review.

Credit Risk

Credit risk represents the risk of loss due to failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its financial obligations in accordance with contractual terms.
Credit risk is found in all activities where success depends on counterparty, issuer or borrower performance. It arises any time funds are extended, committed,
invested or otherwise exposed, whether reflected on or off the balance sheet. The governance structure is administered through the Strategic Credit Committee.
The Strategic Credit Committee is chaired by the Chief Credit Officer and approves recommendations to address credit risk matters through credit policy, credit
risk management practices and required credit risk actions. The Strategic Credit Committee also ensures a comprehensive reporting of credit risk levels and trends,
including exception levels, along with identification and mitigation of emerging risks. In order to facilitate the corporate credit risk management process, various
other corporate functions provide the resources for the Strategic Credit Committee to carry out its responsibilities. The Corporation manages credit risk through
underwriting  and  periodically  reviewing  and  approving  its  credit  exposures  in  accordance  with  established  credit  policies  and  guidelines.  Additionally,  the
Corporation manages credit risk through loan portfolio diversification, limiting exposure to any single industry, customer or guarantor, and selling participations
and/or syndicating credit exposures above those levels it deems prudent to third parties.

The Credit Division manages credit policy and provides the resources to manage the line of business transactional credit risk, assuring that all exposure is
risk  rated  according  to  the  requirements  of  the  credit  risk  rating  policy  and  providing  business  segment  reporting  support  as  necessary.  The  Enterprise  Risk
Division provides credible and well-documented challenge of overall portfolio credit risk, and other credit-related attributes of the Corporation's loan portfolios,
with a particular emphasis on all attendant modeled results. The Corporation's Asset Quality Review function, a division of Internal Audit, audits the accuracy of
internal risk ratings that are assigned by the lending and credit groups. The Special Assets Group is responsible for managing the recovery process on distressed or
defaulted loans and loan sales.

Portfolio Risk Analytics, within the Credit Division, provides comprehensive reporting on portfolio credit risk levels and trends, continuous assessment
and verification of risk rating models, quarterly calculation of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments
and calculations of both expected and unexpected loss.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The  allowance  for  credit  losses  includes  both  the  allowance  for  loan  losses  and  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  on  lending-related  commitments.  As  a
percentage of total loans, the allowance for credit losses was 1.26 percent at December 31, 2021, compared to 1.90 percent at December 31, 2020. Excluding PPP
loans, which are guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, the allowance for credit losses was 1.27 percent of total loans at December 31, 2021, compared
to  2.03  percent  at  December  31,  2020.  The  allowance  for  credit  losses  covered  2.3  times  and  2.8  times  total  nonperforming  loans  at  December  31,  2021  and
December 31, 2020, respectively.

The allowance for credit losses decreased by $374 million from $992 million at December 31, 2020 to $618 million at December 31, 2021, primarily
reflecting  strong  credit  quality,  a  sustained  recovery  by  the  U.S.  economy  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  benefits  of  mitigating  actions  by  the  U.S.
government. In addition to $2.8 trillion of stimulus spending approved by Congress between December 2020 and March 2021, the rollout of the COVID vaccine,
strong business spending and improved labor markets contributed to an overall improved economic outlook. However, there continues to be uncertainty related to
the impact of emerging COVID-19 variants and vaccine efficacy, supply chain constraints, future monetary and fiscal support and inflationary pressures.

These factors shaped the 2-year reasonable and supportable forecast used by the Corporation in its CECL modeled estimate at December 31, 2021. The
U.S.  economy  is  expected  to  grow  at  a  moderate  pace  through  the  first  half  of  2022  before  normalizing  into  historical  growth  rates.  Forecasts  for  other  key
economic variables, including the unemployment rate, are generally in line with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) projections. Oil prices are expected to decrease
from  current  elevated  levels.  Interest  rates  are  expected  to  increase,  reflecting  the  Federal  Reserve's  revised  expectations,  while  corporate  bond  spreads  reflect
normalized  default  risk.  The  following  table  summarizes  select  economic  variables  representative  of  the  economic  forecasts  used  to  develop  the  allowance  for
credit losses estimate at December 31, 2021.

Base Forecast
Gradually  normalizes  to  a  long-term  growth  rate  of  2  to  3  percent  by  third

quarter 2022.

Current  levels  decrease  to  4  percent  by  second  quarter  2022,  remaining

between 3.5 percent and 4 percent through the remainder of the forecast period.
Spreads remain below 2 percent throughout the forecast period.
Prices gradually decline from current levels to $62 by second quarter 2023.

Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the ultimate economic consequence of the pandemic, management considered other economic scenarios

to make appropriate qualitative adjustments for certain sectors of its lending portfolio, including more benign and more severe forecasts.

Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses.

Allowance for Loan Losses

The allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimates of current expected credit losses in the Corporation’s loan portfolio. Pools of loans with

similar risk characteristics are collectively evaluated, while loans that no longer share risk characteristics with loan pools are evaluated individually.

Collective loss estimates are determined by applying reserve factors, designed to estimate current expected credit losses, to amortized cost balances over
the remaining contractual life of the collectively evaluated portfolio. Loans with similar risk characteristics are aggregated into homogeneous pools. The allowance
for  loan  losses  also  includes  qualitative  adjustments  to  bring  the  allowance  to  the  level  management  believes  is  appropriate  based  on  factors  that  have  not
otherwise been fully accounted for, including adjustments for foresight risk, input imprecisions and model imprecision. Credit losses for loans that no longer share
risk  characteristics  with  the  loan  pools  are  estimated  on  an  individual  basis.  Individual  credit  loss  estimates  are  typically  performed  for  nonaccrual  loans  and
modified loans classified as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) and are based on one of several methods, including the estimated fair value of the underlying
collateral, observable market value of similar debt or the present value of expected cash flows.    

Allowance for Credit Losses on Lending-Related Commitments

The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments estimates current expected credit losses on collective pools of letters of credit and unused
commitments to extend credit based on reserve factors, determined in a manner similar to business loans, multiplied by a probability of draw estimate based on
historical experience and credit risk, applied to commitment amounts. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments totaled $30 million and $44
million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

Table of Contents

nonperforming TDRs on either nonaccrual or reduced-rate status. In accordance with the provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act
(CARES Act), the Corporation elected not to consider qualifying COVID-19-related modifications, primarily deferrals, as TDRs and did not designate such loans
as past due or nonaccrual. The temporary relief provided under the CARES Act applied to modifications made from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic through
December 31, 2021. For additional information regarding the Corporation's accounting policies for the CARES Act, refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements.

Nonperforming  assets  decreased  $90  million  to  $269  million  at  December  31,  2021,  from  $359  million  at  December  31,  2020.  The  decrease  in
nonperforming assets primarily reflected a $100 million decrease in nonperforming Energy loans, which are a component of commercial loans. Nonperforming
loans were 0.54 percent of total loans at December 31, 2021, compared to 0.67 percent at December 31, 2020. For further information regarding the composition
of nonaccrual loans, refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.

As of December 31, 2021, COVID-19-related payment deferrals, which consisted of residential mortgages, totaled $22 million, or 0.04 percent of total
loans, compared to $141 million, or 0.27 percent of total loans, as of December 31, 2020, reflecting expiration of initial deferrals and nominal new requests as the
economy recovers from the pandemic. Loans with COVID-19-related deferred payments on a third deferral, primarily residential mortgages, totaled $22 million at
December 31, 2021 and would generally be considered TDRs if not for the provisions in the CARES Act.

Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest generally represent loans that are well collateralized and in the process of collection. Loans past
due 90 days or more decreased $18 million to $27 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $45 million at December 31, 2020. Loans past due 30-89 days
decreased $251 million to $153 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $404 million at December 31, 2020. Loans past due 30 days or more and still accruing
interest as a percentage of total loans were 0.36 percent and 0.86 percent at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. An aging analysis of loans
included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements provides further information about the balances comprising past due loans.

The following table presents a summary of total criticized loans. The Corporation's criticized list is consistent with the Special Mention, Substandard and

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Concentrations of credit risk may exist when a number of borrowers are engaged in similar activities, or activities in the same geographic region, and
have  similar  economic  characteristics  that  would  cause  them  to  be  similarly  impacted  by  changes  in  economic  or  other  conditions.  The  Corporation  has
concentrations of credit risk with the commercial real estate and automotive industries. All other industry concentrations, as defined by management, individually
represented less than 10 percent of total loans at December 31, 2021.

Commercial Real Estate Lending

At  December  31,  2021,  the  Corporation's  commercial  real  estate  portfolio  represented  29  percent  of  total  loans.  The  following  table  summarizes  the

The  Corporation  limits  risk  inherent  in  its  commercial  real  estate  lending  activities  by  monitoring  borrowers  directly  involved  in  the  commercial  real
estate markets and adhering to conservative policies on loan-to-value ratios for such loans. Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and
commercial mortgage loans, totaled $14.2 billion at December 31, 2021. Of the total, $5.7 billion, or 40 percent, were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate
business line, which includes loans to real estate developers, a decrease of $201 million compared to December 31, 2020. Commercial real estate loans in other
business  lines  totaled  $8.5  billion,  or  60  percent,  at  December  31,  2021,  an  increase  of  $410  million  compared  to  December  31,  2020.  These  loans  consisted
primarily  of  owner-occupied  commercial  mortgages,  which  bear  credit  characteristics  similar  to  non-commercial  real  estate  business  loans.  Generally,  loans
previously reported as real estate construction are classified as commercial mortgage loans upon receipt of a certificate of occupancy. In 2021, the Corporation
performed an in-depth review of the status of these loans which resulted in $1.2 billion of loans previously reported as real estate construction to be classified as
commercial mortgage loans as of December 31, 2021.

The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-time customers with satisfactory completion experience. There were no
criticized real estate construction loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line at December 31, 2021, compared to $27 million at December 31, 2020. In
other business lines, criticized real estate construction loans totaled $35 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $20 million at December 31, 2020. There were
no real estate construction loan charge-offs in either of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Commercial mortgage loans are loans where the primary collateral is a lien on any real property and are primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real
estate. Real property is generally considered primary collateral if the value of that collateral represents more than 50 percent of the commitment at loan approval.
Loans  in  the  commercial  mortgage  portfolio  generally  mature  within  three  to  five  years.  Criticized  commercial  mortgage  loans  in  the  Commercial  Real  Estate
business  line  totaled  $29  million  and  $73  million  at  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  respectively.  In  other  business  lines,  $219  million  and  $440  million  of
commercial mortgage loans were criticized at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Commercial mortgage loan net charge-offs were $2 million in 2021,
compared to net recoveries of $3 million in 2020.

Substantially all dealer loans are in the National Dealer Services business line and primarily include floor plan financing and other loans to automotive
dealerships. Floor plan loans, included in commercial loans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, totaled $681 million at December 31, 2021, a decrease of $1.7
billion  compared  to  $2.3  billion  at  December  31,  2020,  due  to  an  imbalance  in  supply  and  demand  impacted  by  a  shortage  in  microchips  used  in  automotive
production. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, other loans in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $3.5 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, including
$2.0 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans at both December 31, 2021 and 2020.

There were no nonaccrual dealer loans at both December 31, 2021, and 2020. Additionally, there were no net charge-offs of dealer loans in either of the

years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Loans to borrowers involved with automotive production, primarily Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers, totaled $1.1 billion at both December 31, 2021 and 2020.
These borrowers have faced, and could face in the future, financial difficulties due to disruptions in auto production as well as their supply chains and logistics
operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, management continues to monitor this portfolio.

There were no nonaccrual loans to borrowers involved with automotive production at December 31, 2021, compared to $7 million at December 31, 2020.
Criticized automotive production loans were 15 percent of the automotive production portfolio at December 31, 2021, compared to 24 percent at December 31,
2020. Automotive production loan net charge-offs totaled $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $2 million for the same period in 2020.

Residential  real  estate  loans,  which  consist  of  traditional  residential  mortgages  and  home  equity  loans  and  lines  of  credit,  totaled  $3.3  billion  at
December 31, 2021. The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation's primary geographic markets. Substantially all residential
real estate loans past due 90 days or more are placed on

nonaccrual status, and substantially all junior lien home equity loans that are current or less than 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual status if full collection
of the senior position is in doubt. At no later than 180 days past due, such loans are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell.

Residential mortgages totaled $1.8 billion at December 31, 2021, and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain
private banking relationship customers. Of the $1.8 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, $36 million were on nonaccrual status at December 31, 2021.
The home equity portfolio totaled $1.5 billion at December 31, 2021, of which 96 percent was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity
lines of credit, 3 percent were in amortizing status and 1 percent were closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.5 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $12
million were on nonaccrual status at December 31, 2021. A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens at December 31, 2021.

Energy Lending

The  Corporation  has  a  portfolio  of  Energy  loans  that  are  included  entirely  in  commercial  loans  in  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  Customers  in  the
Corporation's Energy business line (approximately 120 relationships) are engaged in three segments of the oil and gas business: exploration and production (E&P),
midstream and energy services. E&P generally includes such activities as searching for potential oil and gas fields, drilling exploratory wells and operating active
wells.  Commitments  to  E&P  borrowers  are  generally  subject  to  semi-annual  borrowing  base  re-determinations  based  on  a  variety  of  factors  including  updated
prices  (reflecting  market  and  competitive  conditions),  energy  reserve  levels  and  the  impact  of  hedging.  The  midstream  sector  is  generally  involved  in  the
transportation,  storage  and  marketing  of  crude  and/or  refined  oil  and  gas  products.  The  Corporation's  energy  services  customers  provide  products  and  services
primarily to the E&P segment.

December 31, 2020. Total exposure, including unused commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, was $2.9 billion (a utilization rate of 39 percent) and $3.1
billion at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

Net credit-related Energy recoveries were $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to net charge-offs of $125 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020. Nonaccrual Energy loans decreased $100 million to $14 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $114 million at December 31,
2020. Criticized loans decreased $538 million to $58 million, or 4 percent of total criticized loans, at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020.

Leveraged Loans

Certain loans in the Corporation's commercial portfolio are considered leveraged transactions. These loans are typically used for mergers, acquisitions,
business  recapitalizations,  refinancing  and  equity  buyouts.  To  help  mitigate  the  risk  associated  with  these  loans,  the  Corporation  focuses  on  middle  market
companies with highly capable management teams, strong sponsors and solid track records of financial performance. Industries prone to cyclical downturns and
acquisitions  with  a  high  degree  of  integration  risk  are  generally  avoided.  Other  considerations  include  the  sufficiency  of  collateral,  the  level  of  balance  sheet
leverage  and  the  adequacy  of  financial  covenants.  During  the  underwriting  process,  cash  flows  are  stress-tested  to  evaluate  the  borrowers'  abilities  to  handle
economic downturns and an increase in interest rates.

The FDIC defines higher-risk commercial and industrial (HR C&I) loans for assessment purposes as loans generally with leverage of four times total debt

to earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation (EBITDA) as well as three times senior debt to EBITDA, excluding certain collateralized loans.

The following table summarizes information about HR C&I loans, which represented 6 percent and 5 percent of total loans at December 31, 2021 and

Other Sectors Most at Risk due to Economic Stress Resulting from COVID-19 Impacts

As the economy recovers, aided by additional stimulus packages and the rollout of the COVID vaccine, the Corporation has continued to monitor the
lingering impacts of the pandemic on its customers. In addition to the energy, automotive production and leveraged loan portfolios, the Corporation considers the
following  sectors  of  its  loan  portfolio  to  be  most  vulnerable  to  financial  risks  from  business  disruptions  caused  by  the  pandemic  spread  mitigation  efforts.  For
further discussion, see Item 1.A "Risk Factors" on page 13 of this report.

Market and Liquidity Risk

Market risk represents the risk of loss due to adverse movement in prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity
prices. Liquidity risk represents the risk that the Corporation does not have sufficient access to funds to maintain its normal operations at all times, or does not
have the ability to raise or borrow funds at a reasonable cost at all times.

The Asset and Liability Policy Committee (ALCO) of the Corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to
market and liquidity risk management activities. ALCO meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies and consists of
executive and senior management from various areas of the Corporation, including treasury, finance, economics, lending, deposit gathering and risk management.
Corporate Treasury mitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of ALCO through the actions it takes to manage the Corporation's market, liquidity and
capital positions.

The  Corporation  performs  monthly  liquidity  stress  testing  to  evaluate  its  ability  to  meet  funding  needs  in  hypothetical  stressed  environments.  Such
environments cover a series of scenarios, including both idiosyncratic and market-wide in nature, which vary in terms of duration and severity. The evaluation as
of December 31, 2021 projected that sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events.

In  addition  to  assessing  liquidity  risk  on  a  consolidated  basis,  Corporate  Treasury  also  monitors  the  parent  company's  liquidity  and  has  established
liquidity coverage requirements for meeting expected obligations without the support of additional dividends from subsidiaries. ALCO's policy on liquidity risk
management  requires  the  parent  company  to  maintain  sufficient  liquidity  to  meet  expected  cash  obligations  over  a  period  of  no  less  than  12  months.  The
Corporation had liquid assets of $1.1 billion on an unconsolidated basis at December 31, 2021.

Corporate Treasury and the Enterprise Risk Division support ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market
risks. Key activities encompass: (i) providing information and analyses of the Corporation's balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other
market  risks;  (ii)  monitoring  and  reporting  of  the  Corporation's  positions  relative  to  established  policy  limits  and  guidelines;  (iii)  developing  and  presenting
analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions; (iv) reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval; and (v) monitoring of industry trends and
analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks.

Interest Rate Risk

Net interest income is the primary source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the
repricing  and  cash  flow  characteristics  of  assets  and  liabilities,  primarily  through  the  Corporation's  core  business  activities  of  extending  loans  and  acquiring
deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by core deposits. Including the impact of interest rate swaps
converting floating-rate loans to fixed, the Corporation's loan composition at December 31, 2021 was 60 percent 30-day rate (primarily LIBOR), 22 percent fixed-
rate, 13 percent prime, and 5 percent comprised of 60-and 90-day rates. Additionally, 30 percent of total loans had non-zero interest rate floors protecting against
future rate declines. The composition of the loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the faster repricing of the
floating-rate  loan  portfolio  versus  deposit  products.  In  addition,  the  growth  and/or  contraction  in  the  Corporation's  loans  and  deposits  may  lead  to  changes  in
sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing fixed-rate investment securities, which provide
liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest rate sensitivity, as well as hedging with interest rate swaps and options. Other mitigating
factors include interest rate floors on a portion of the loan portfolio. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective
of  optimizing  net  interest  income  and  the  economic  value  of  equity  while  operating  within  acceptable  limits  established  for  interest  rate  risk  and  maintaining
adequate levels of funding and liquidity.

Since  no  single  measurement  system  satisfies  all  management  objectives,  a  combination  of  techniques  is  used  to  manage  interest  rate  risk.  These
techniques  examine  the  impact  of  interest  rate  risk  on  net  interest  income  and  the  economic  value  of  equity  under  a  variety  of  alternative  scenarios,  including
changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve utilizing multiple simulation analyses. Simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income as
the  assumptions  used  are  inherently  uncertain.  Actual  results  may  differ  from  simulated  results  due  to  many  factors,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  the  timing,
magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, regulatory impacts and management strategies.

Sensitivity of Net Interest Income to Changes in Interest Rates

The  analysis  of  the  impact  of  changes  in  interest  rates  on  net  interest  income  under  various  interest  rate  scenarios  is  management's  principal  risk
management technique. Management models a base-case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment. Model assumptions in this base case at
December 31, 2021 included a modest increase in loan balances, loan spreads held at current levels, a moderate decrease in deposit balances and the securities
portfolio held at existing

F-27

Table of Contents

levels.  Existing  derivative  instruments  entered  into  for  risk  management  purposes  as  of  the  balance  sheet  dates  are  included  in  the  analysis,  but  no  additional
hedging is forecasted. At December 31, 2021, these derivative instruments comprise interest rate swaps that convert $2.7 billion of fixed-rate medium- and long-
term debt to variable rates through fair value hedges and convert $5.1 billion of variable-rate loans to fixed rates through cash flow hedges. During the fourth
quarter of 2021, $3.0 billion of forward starting cash flow hedges were added. Additionally, included in this analysis are $14.9 billion of loans that were subject to
an average interest rate floor of 0.6 percent at December 31, 2021. This base-case net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which
short-term rates rise or decline 100 basis points (with a floor of zero percent) in a linear, non-parallel fashion from the base case over 12 months, resulting in an
average change of 50 basis points over the period while long-term rates increase or decrease to a lesser degree.

As of February 15, 2022, cash flow hedges to convert $1.8 billion of variable-rate loans to fixed rates were entered into during the first quarter of 2022
which had an average rate and duration of 1.84% and 5.5 years, respectively, and varying start dates through April 2022. The first quarter 2022 cash flow hedges
are not included in the interest rate sensitivity model assumptions.

Each  scenario  includes  assumptions  such  as  loan  growth,  investment  security  prepayment  levels,  depositor  behavior,  yield  curve  changes,  loan  and
deposit  pricing,  and  overall  balance  sheet  mix  and  growth  which  are  in  line  with  historical  patterns.  However,  in  this  low  rate  environment,  depositors  have
maintained a higher level of liquidity and their historical behavior may be less indicative of future trends. Changes in actual economic activity may result in a
materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis.

The table below, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base

case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above.

Sensitivity to declining interest rates increased from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 due to higher deposit volumes, partially offset by growth
in  floating-rate  loans  with  floors  and  the  securities  portfolio.  There  is  limited  remaining  potential  for  downward  movement  in  rates  before  hitting  zero  percent
floors. Sensitivity to rising interest rates increased due to higher deposit volumes and forgiveness of fixed-rate PPP loans, partially offset by growth in floating-rate
loans with floors and the securities portfolio.

Sensitivity of Economic Value of Equity to Changes in Interest Rates

In addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income, an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk
position. The economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the Corporation's financial assets, liabilities and off-balance
sheet  instruments,  derived  through  discounting  cash  flows  based  on  actual  rates  at  the  end  of  the  period,  and  the  estimated  economic  value  after  applying  the
estimated impact of rate movements. The Corporation primarily monitors the percentage change on the base-case economic value of equity. The economic value of
equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel 100 basis point shock with a floor of zero percent.

The table below, as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate

scenario described above.

The  sensitivity  of  the  economic  value  of  equity  to  rising  rates  decreased  from  December  31,  2020  to  December  31,  2021  primarily  due  to  duration
extension and balance growth in the securities portfolio. Sensitivity to declining rates also decreased due to the increase in the securities portfolio and is limited by
the assumption of a zero percent rate floor.

The Corporation uses investment securities and derivative instruments as asset and liability management tools with the overall objective of managing the

volatility of net interest income from changes in interest rates. These tools assist management in achieving the desired interest rate risk management objectives.
Activity related to derivative instruments currently involves interest rate swaps effectively converting fixed-rate medium- and long-term debt to a floating rate as
well as variable rate loans to a fixed rate.

(a) $3.0 billion of forward starting receive fixed interest rate swaps that will become effective on their contractual start dates in 2022 and 2023.

The notional amount of risk management interest rate swaps totaled $10.7 billion at December 31, 2021, which included fair value hedging strategies that
convert $2.7 billion of fixed-rate medium- and long-term debt to a floating rate as well as cash flow hedging strategies that convert $8.1 billion of variable-rate
loans to a fixed rate. Risk management interest rate swaps generated $163 million and $121 million of net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2021
and December 31, 2020, respectively.

In addition to interest rate swaps, the Corporation employs various other types of derivative instruments as offsetting positions to mitigate exposures to

foreign currency risks associated with specific assets and liabilities (e.g., customer loans or

F-29

deposits  denominated  in  foreign  currencies).  Such  instruments  may  include  foreign  exchange  spot  and  forward  contracts  as  well  as  foreign  exchange  swap
agreements.

The Corporation sells and purchases interest rate caps and floors and enters into foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and energy derivative
contracts to accommodate the needs of customers requesting such services. Changes in the fair value of customer-initiated and other derivatives are recognized in
earnings  as  they  occur.  To  limit  the  market  risk  of  these  activities,  the  Corporation  generally  takes  offsetting  positions  with  dealers.  The  notional  amounts  of
offsetting  positions  are  included  in  the  table  above.  Customer-initiated  and  other  notional  activity  represented  73  percent  and  75  percent  of  total  interest  rate,
energy and foreign exchange contracts at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Further information regarding customer-initiated and other derivative instruments is provided in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

LIBOR Transition

On  July  27,  2017,  the  United  Kingdom’s  Financial  Conduct  Authority  (FCA),  which  regulates  LIBOR,  publicly  announced  that  it  intends  to  stop
persuading  or  compelling  banks  to  submit  LIBOR  rates  after  2021.  Effective  March  2021,  the  FCA  confirmed  that  certain  LIBOR  tenors  will  no  longer  be
supported after December 31, 2021 and that the remaining tenors, including those most commonly used by the Corporation, will cease to be supported after June
30,  2023.  The  Corporation  has  substantial  exposure  to  LIBOR-based  products,  including  loans  and  derivatives,  and  is  preparing  for  a  transition  from  LIBOR
toward alternative rates.

As of July 1, 2021, the Corporation was operationally ready to issue new Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)-based cash and derivative products.
Additionally, as of September 30, 2021, the Corporation was operationally ready to issue new Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index (BSBY)-based cash and
derivative  products.  The  Corporation  ceased  originating  LIBOR-based  products  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  while  communications  and  learning  activities  to
support customers and colleagues are ongoing. As of December 31, 2021, the Corporation estimates that approximately half of its LIBOR-based commercial loans
have maturity dates prior to the cessation of LIBOR. Of the remaining loans with maturity dates beyond the cessation date, the Corporation estimates that 40%
incorporate fallback language and is confident that it will achieve timely remediation of all other loans. In addition to remediation activity on LIBOR-based loans,
the Corporation has enacted the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) protocols related to derivatives. Once events occur that trigger a fallback,
the reference rate for the variable leg of the swap will fall back from LIBOR to the ISDA Fallback Rate, which is the daily SOFR plus a spread.

The Corporation's enterprise transition timelines are closely aligned with recommendations from the Alternative Reference Rates Committee for both best
practices and recommended objectives. The Corporation will continue to align with industry and regulatory guidelines regarding the cessation of LIBOR as well as
monitor market developments for transitioning to alternative reference rates. For a discussion of the various risks facing the Corporation in relation to the transition
away from LIBOR, see the market risk discussion within “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Sources of Liquidity

The  Corporation  maintains  a  liquidity  position  that  it  believes  will  adequately  satisfy  its  financial  obligations  while  taking  into  account  potential
commitment draws and deposit run-off that may occur in the normal course of business. The majority of the Corporation's balance sheet is funded by customer
deposits. Cash flows from loan repayments, increases in

F-30

Table of Contents

deposit accounts, activity in the securities portfolio and the purchased funds market serve as the Corporation's primary liquidity sources.

The Corporation satisfies incremental liquidity needs with either liquid assets or external funding sources. The Corporation had access to liquid assets of
$35.3  billion  at  December  31,  2021,  which  included  cash  on  deposit  with  the  Federal  Reserve  and  the  portion  of  the  investment  securities  portfolio  that  the
Corporation can sell without third-party consent.

In  addition,  the  Corporation  may  access  external  funding  sources  when  necessary,  which  include  FHLB  advances,  federal  funds,  reverse  repurchase
agreements,  brokered  deposits  and  Corporation-issued  bonds.  The  Corporation  maintains  a  shelf  registration  statement  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission from which it may issue debt and equity securities. In April 2021, the Bank terminated a $15.0 billion note program, under which the Bank had the
ability to issue up to $13.5 billion of debt at the time of termination. The termination of the program does not impact outstanding notes issued under the program or
the Bank's ability to issue notes in the future.

Purchased funds decreased to $50 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $66 million at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021, the Bank had
pledged loans totaling $21.2 billion which provided for up to $17.0 billion of available collateralized borrowing with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB). The Bank
is also a member of the FHLB of Dallas, Texas, which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related
loans, certain government agency-backed securities and other eligible assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral pledged to the
FHLB.  At  December  31,  2021,  $18.3  billion  of  real  estate-related  loans  were  pledged  to  the  FHLB  as  collateral  providing  $10.2  billion  for  potential  future
borrowings.

The ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise funds at competitive rates is impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity, capital,
earnings and other relevant factors related to the Corporation and the Bank. As of December 31, 2021, the three major rating agencies had assigned the following
ratings to long-term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and
may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

Since many of these commitments expire without being fully drawn, and each customer must continue to meet the conditions established in the contract,
the  total  amount  of  these  commercial  commitments  does  not  necessarily  represent  the  future  cash  requirements  of  the  Corporation.  Refer  to  Note  8  to  the
consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these commercial commitments.

Other Market Risks

Market risk related to the Corporation's trading instruments is not significant, as trading activities are limited. Certain components of the Corporation's
noninterest income, primarily fiduciary income, are at risk to fluctuations in the market values of underlying assets, particularly equity and debt securities. Other
components of noninterest income, primarily brokerage fees, are at risk to changes in the volume of market activity.

Operational Risk

Operational risk represents the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and people, or from external events, excluding in most
cases  those  driven  by  technology  (see  Technology  Risk  below).  The  Corporation's  definition  of  operational  risk  includes  fraud;  employment  practice  and
workplace safety; clients, products and business practice; business continuity or disaster recovery; execution, delivery, and process management; third party and
model risks. The definition does not include strategic or reputational risks. Although operational losses are experienced by all companies and are routinely incurred
in business operations, the Corporation recognizes the need to identify and control operational losses and seeks to limit losses to a level deemed appropriate by
management,  as  outlined  in  the  Corporation’s  risk  appetite  statement.  The  appropriate  risk  level  is  determined  through  consideration  of  the  nature  of  the
Corporation's  business  and  the  environment  in  which  it  operates,  in  combination  with  the  impact  from,  and  the  possible  impact  on,  other  risks  faced  by  the
Corporation. Operational risk is mitigated through a system of internal controls that are designed to keep operating risks at appropriate levels. The Operational
Risk  Management  Committee  monitors  risk  management  techniques  and  systems.  The  Corporation  has  developed  a  framework  that  includes  a  centralized
operational risk reporting function in the Enterprise Risk Division and business/support unit risk liaisons responsible for managing operational risk specific to the
respective business lines.

Technology Risk

    Technology risk represents the risk of loss or adverse outcomes arising from the people, processes, applications and infrastructure that support the technology
environment.  The  Corporation's  definition  of  technology  risk  includes  technology  delivery  risk,  technology  investment  risk,  cybersecurity  risk,  information
security risk and information management risk. Technology risk is inclusive of the risks associated with the execution of technology processes and activities by
third-party

F-32

Table of Contents

contractors and suppliers to the Corporation. Other risk types may materialize in the event of a technology risk event, such as the risk of a financial reporting error
or regulatory non-compliance, and the impact of such risks are highly interdependent with operational risk.

        The  Technology  Risk  Management  Committee,  comprising  senior  and  executive  business  unit  managers,  as  well  as  managers  responsible  for  technology,
cybersecurity,  information  security  and  enterprise  risk  management,  oversees  technology  risk.  The  Technology  Risk  Management  Committee  also  ensures  that
appropriate actions are implemented in business units to mitigate risk to an acceptable level.

Compliance Risk

Compliance risk represents the risk of sanctions or financial loss resulting from the Corporation's failure to comply with all applicable laws, regulations
and standards of good banking practice. The impact of such risks is highly interdependent with strategic risk, as the reputational impact from compliance breaches
can  be  severe.  Activities  which  may  expose  the  Corporation  to  compliance  risk  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  those  dealing  with  the  prevention  of  money
laundering,  privacy  and  data  protection,  community  reinvestment  initiatives,  fair  lending,  consumer  protection,  employment  and  tax  matters,  over-the-counter
derivative activities and other regulated activities.

The Enterprise-Wide Compliance Committee, comprising senior and executive business unit managers, as well as managers responsible for compliance,
audit and overall risk, oversees compliance risk. This enterprise-wide approach provides a consistent view of compliance across the organization. The Enterprise-
Wide Compliance Committee also ensures that appropriate actions are implemented in business units to mitigate risk to an acceptable level.

Strategic Risk

Strategic risk represents the risk of inadequate returns or possible losses due to impairment of reputation, failure to fully develop and execute business
plans, failure to assess current and new opportunities in business, markets and products, failure to determine appropriate consideration for risks accepted, and any
other event not identified in the defined risk categories of credit, market and liquidity, operational, technology or compliance risks. Mitigation of the various risk
elements that represent strategic risk is achieved through numerous metrics and initiatives to help the Corporation better understand, measure and report on such
risks.  The  Executive  Strategic  and  Pricing  Committee,  comprised  of  senior  managers,  oversees  strategic  risk  and  ensures  that  strategic  risk  is  mitigated  to
appropriate levels.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The  Corporation’s  consolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  based  on  the  application  of  accounting  policies,  the  most  significant  of  which  are
described  in  Note  1.  These  policies  require  numerous  estimates  and  strategic  or  economic  assumptions,  which  may  prove  inaccurate  or  subject  to  variations.
Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation’s future financial condition and results of operations. At
December 31, 2021, the most critical of these estimates related to the allowance for credit losses, fair value measurement, goodwill, pension plan accounting and
income taxes. These estimates were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully below.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

In  accordance  with  CECL,  the  allowance  for  credit  losses,  which  includes  both  the  allowance  for  loan  losses  and  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  on
lending-related commitments, is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve for current expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life of the
portfolio. The Corporation uses loss factors, based on estimated probability of default for internal risk ratings and loss given default, to determine the allowance for
credit losses for the majority of its portfolio. Management applies loss factors to pools of loans and lending-related commitments with similar risk characteristics,
calibrates these factors using economic forecasts and incorporates qualitative adjustments. For further discussion of the methodology used in the determination of
the allowance for credit losses, refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. For further discussion on the economic forecast incorporated into the 2021
model, refer to the “Risk Management” section of this financial review.

Management's determination of the appropriateness of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio, lending-related commitments,
current  as  well  as  forecasted  economic  factors  and  other  relevant  information.  The  calculation  is  inherently  subjective  and  requires  management  to  exercise
significant judgment in developing assumptions for the estimate, the most significant of which are the loan risk rating process, development of economic forecasts
and application of qualitative adjustments. Sensitivities are disclosed to demonstrate how changes in loan risk ratings and economic forecast scenarios may impact
the allowance for credit losses. Sensitivities only consider changes to each specific assumption in isolation and their impact to the quantitative modeled results.
They do not contemplate impacts to the qualitative framework.

Loan Risk Rating Process

Reserve factors are applied to pools of loans based on risk characteristics, including the Corporation's internal risk rating system; therefore, loss estimates
are  highly  dependent  on  the  accuracy  of  the  risk  rating  assigned  to  each  loan.  The  inherent  imprecision  in  the  risk  rating  system  resulting  from  inaccuracy  in
assigning  and/or  entering  risk  ratings  in  the  loan  accounting  system  is  monitored  by  the  Corporation's  asset  quality  review  function.  Changes  to  internal  risk
ratings, beyond the forecasted migration inherent in the credit models, would result in a different estimated allowance for credit losses. To illustrate, if 5 percent of
the  individual  risk  ratings  were  adjusted  down  by  one  rating  across  all  pools,  the  allowance  for  loan  losses  as  of  December  31,  2021  would  change  by
approximately $3 million.

Forecasted Economic Variables

Management selects models through which historical reserve factor estimates are calibrated to economic forecasts over the reasonable and supportable
forecast period based on the projected performance of specific economic variables that statistically correlate with the probability of default and loss given default
pools. Loss estimates revert to historical loss experience for contractual lives beyond the forecast period. Management selects economic variables it believes to be
most relevant based on the composition of the loan portfolio and customer base, including forecasted levels of employment, gross domestic product, corporate
bond and treasury spreads, industrial production levels, consumer and commercial real estate price indices as well as housing statistics.

The allowance for credit losses is highly sensitive to the economic forecasts used to develop the estimate. Due to the high level of uncertainty regarding
significant assumptions, such as the ultimate impact of the global pandemic, the Corporation evaluated a range of economic scenarios, including a more severe
economic forecast scenario, with varying responses to current economic risks. The following table summarizes the more severe forecast scenario for the economic
variables that are most impactful.

More Severe Forecast
Contracts through third quarter 2022, followed by a gradual improvement to a growth
rate above 4 percent by the end of the forecast period.
Current levels increase to nearly 9 percent by first quarter 2023, gradually decreasing to
7 percent by the end of the forecast period.
Spreads  widen  to  above  3  percent  in  the  near  term,  gradually  normalizing  to  below  2
percent by second quarter 2023.
Decline below $33 per barrel part-way through the forecast period before improving to
$48 per barrel by fourth quarter 2023.

Selecting a different forecast in the current environment could result in a significantly different estimated allowance for credit losses. To illustrate, absent
model overlays and other qualitative adjustments that are part of the quarterly reserving process, if the Corporation selected the more severe scenario to inform its
models,  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  as  of  December  31,  2021  would  increase  by  approximately  $148  million.  However,  factoring  in  model  overlays  and
qualitative adjustments could result in a materially different estimate under a more severe scenario.

Qualitative Adjustments and Model Overlays

The Corporation includes qualitative adjustments, as appropriate, intended to capture the impact of uncertainties not reflected in the quantitative estimate,
including  foresight  risk,  model  imprecisions  and  input  imprecisions.  Qualitative  adjustments  for  foresight  risk  reflect  the  inherent  imprecision  in  economic
forecasts and may be included based on management’s evaluation of different forecast scenarios, ranging from more benign to more severe, and known recent
events impacting the Corporation’s portfolio. Model imprecision adjustments and model overlays may be included to mitigate known limitations in the quantitative
models. Input imprecision includes adjustments for portfolios where recent historical losses exceed expected losses or known recent events are expected to alter
risk ratings once evidence is acquired, as well as a qualitative assessment of the lending environment, including underwriting standards, current economic and
political conditions, and other factors affecting credit quality. Qualitative reserves at December 31, 2021 primarily included adjustments for uncertainties related to
forecasted economic variables.

Other Considerations

To  the  extent  actual  outcomes  differ  from  management  estimates,  additional  provision  for  credit  losses  may  be  required  that  would  adversely  impact
earnings in future periods. The allowance is assigned to business segments, and any earnings impact resulting from actual outcomes differing from management
estimates would primarily affect the Commercial Bank segment.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

Investment  securities  available-for-sale,  derivatives  and  deferred  compensation  plan  assets  and  associated  liabilities  are  recorded  at  fair  value  on  a
recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, other assets and liabilities may be recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, such as impaired loans that have
been measured based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, other real estate (primarily foreclosed property), nonmarketable equity securities and certain
other  assets  and  liabilities.  Nonrecurring  fair  value  adjustments  typically  involve  write-downs  of  individual  assets  or  application  of  lower  of  cost  or  fair  value
accounting.

Fair value is an estimate of the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction (i.e., not a
forced  transaction,  such  as  a  liquidation  or  distressed  sale)  between  market  participants  at  the  measurement  date  and  is  based  on  the  assumptions  market
participants  would  use  when  pricing  an  asset  or  liability.  Fair  value  measurement  and  disclosure  guidance  establishes  a  three-level  hierarchy  for  disclosure  of
assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements include information about the fair value hierarchy, the extent to
which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities, as well as the valuation methodologies and key inputs used.

At December 31, 2021, assets and liabilities measured using observable inputs that are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 represented 99 percent and 99
percent  of  total  assets  and  liabilities  recorded  at  fair  value,  respectively.  Valuations  generated  from  model-based  techniques  that  use  at  least  one  significant
assumption not observable in the market are considered Level 3 and reflect estimates of assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
The valuation of Level 3 assets and liabilities are considered critical accounting estimates.

GOODWILL

Goodwill is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is subsequently
evaluated at least annually for impairment. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level, equivalent to a business segment or one level
below. The Corporation has three reporting units: the Commercial Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. At December 31, 2021, goodwill totaled $635
million, including $473 million allocated to the Commercial Bank, $101 million allocated to the Retail Bank and $61 million allocated to Wealth Management.

The  Corporation  performs  its  annual  evaluation  of  goodwill  impairment  in  the  third  quarter  of  each  year  and  may  elect  to  perform  a  quantitative
impairment analysis or first conduct a qualitative analysis to determine if a quantitative analysis is necessary. Additionally, the Corporation evaluates goodwill
impairment on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate additional testing may be warranted to determine if goodwill
might be impaired.

The annual goodwill impairment test was performed as of the beginning of third quarter 2021. The Corporation assessed qualitative factors to determine
whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. Qualitative factors included
economic  conditions,  industry  and  market  considerations,  cost  factors,  overall  financial  performance,  regulatory  developments  and  performance  of  the
Corporation’s stock, among other events and circumstances. At the conclusion of the qualitative assessment in third quarter 2021, the Corporation determined that
it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.

Analyzing goodwill includes consideration of various factors that continue to rapidly evolve and for which significant uncertainty remains, including the
impact of the coronavirus global pandemic to the economy. Further weakening in the economic environment, such as continued decline in the performance of the
reporting  units  or  other  factors,  could  cause  the  fair  value  of  one  or  more  of  the  reporting  units  to  fall  below  their  carrying  value,  resulting  in  a  goodwill
impairment charge. Additionally, new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management's expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of
the  reporting  units  to  fall  below  the  carrying  value,  resulting  in  a  goodwill  impairment  charge.  Any  impairment  charge  would  not  affect  the  Corporation's
regulatory capital ratios, tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position.

PENSION PLAN ACCOUNTING

The Corporation has a qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plan. Effective January 1, 2017, benefits are calculated using a cash balance
formula based on years of service, age, compensation and an interest credit based on the 30-year Treasury rate. Participants under age 60 as of December 31, 2016
are eligible to receive a frozen final average pay benefit in addition to amounts earned under the cash balance formula. Participants age 60 or older as of December
31, 2016 continue to be eligible for a final average pay benefit. The Corporation makes assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and
timing of required benefit payments, funding requirements and defined benefit pension expense. The major assumptions are the discount rate used in determining
the current benefit obligation, the long-term rate of return expected on plan assets, mix of assets within the portfolio and the projected mortality rate.

The  discount  rate  is  determined  by  matching  the  expected  cash  flows  of  the  pension  plans  to  a  portfolio  of  high  quality  corporate  bonds  as  of  the
measurement date, December 31. The long-term rate of return expected on plan assets is set after considering both long-term returns in the general market and
long-term returns experienced by the assets in the plan. The current target asset allocation model for the plans is provided in Note 17 to the consolidated financial
statements.  The  expected  returns  on  these  various  asset  categories  are  blended  to  derive  one  long-term  return  assumption.  The  assets  are  primarily  invested  in
certain collective investment funds, common stocks, U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government agency securities, as well as corporate and municipal bonds and
notes. Mortality rate assumptions are based on mortality tables published by third-parties such as the Society of Actuaries, considering other available information
including historical data as well as studies and publications from reputable sources.

The Corporation reviews its pension plan assumptions on an annual basis with its actuarial consultants to determine if the assumptions are reasonable and
adjusts the assumptions to reflect changes in future expectations. The major assumptions used to calculate 2022 and 2021 defined benefit plan pension expense
(benefit) were as follows:

Long-term rate of return on plan assets

Defined benefit plan benefit is expected to increase $8 million to approximately $87 million in 2022, compared to a benefit of $79 million in 2021. This

includes service cost expense of $40 million and a benefit from other components of $127

million. Service costs are included in salaries and benefits expense, while the benefit from other components are included in other noninterest expenses on the
Consolidated Statements of Income.

The  Corporation’s  pension  plan  is  most  sensitive  to  changes  in  discount  rate  and  long-term  rate  of  return.  A  change  to  the  discount  rate  implies  a
corresponding change in interest rates that affect the value of the plan’s fixed income assets. An increase of 25 basis points to the discount rate, including the effect
of higher interest rates on the plan’s fixed income assets, would result in a net increase to pension expense of $11 million, while a decrease of 25 basis points
would reduce pension expense by $11 million. Increasing the long-term rate of return by 25 basis points would reduce pension expense by $8 million, while a
decrease of 25 basis points would increase pension expense by $8 million.

Due to the long-term nature of pension plan assumptions, actual results may differ significantly from the actuarial-based estimates. Differences resulting
in actuarial gains or losses are required to be recorded in shareholders' equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss and amortized to defined benefit
pension expense in future years. Refer to Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.

INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes due for the current year and deferred taxes. Deferred taxes arise from temporary differences
between the income tax basis and financial accounting basis of assets and liabilities. Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received
from  taxing  jurisdictions,  currently  or  in  the  future,  and  are  included  in  accrued  income  and  other  assets  or  accrued  expenses  and  other  liabilities  on  the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Included in net deferred taxes are deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for realization based on available evidence of projected future
reversals  of  existing  taxable  temporary  differences,  assumptions  made  regarding  future  events  and,  when  applicable,  state  loss  carryback  capacity.  A  valuation
allowance is provided when it is more-likely-than-not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Determining whether deferred tax assets are
realizable is subjective and requires the use of significant judgment.

The Corporation assesses the relative risks and merits of tax positions for various transactions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent
and other available information and maintains tax accruals consistent with these assessments. This assessment is complex and requires judgment. The Corporation
is subject to audit by taxing authorities that could question and/or challenge the tax positions taken by the Corporation. Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes
occur  due  to  changes  in  tax  law,  interpretations  of  existing  tax  laws,  new  judicial  or  regulatory  guidance,  and  the  status  of  examinations  conducted  by  taxing
authorities that impact the relative risks and merits of tax positions taken by the Corporation. These changes, when they occur, impact the estimate of accrued taxes
and  could  be  significant  to  the  operating  results  of  the  Corporation.  For  further  information  on  tax  accruals  and  related  risks,  see  Note  18  to  the  consolidated
financial statements.

SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATA

The Corporation believes non-GAAP measures are meaningful because they reflect adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators
and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and our performance trends. Tangible common equity is used by the Corporation to measure the quality of
capital and the return relative to balance sheet risk.

Common equity tier 1 capital ratio removes preferred stock from the Tier 1 capital ratio as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank regulations.
The  tangible  common  equity  ratio  removes  the  effect  of  intangible  assets  from  capital  and  total  assets.  Tangible  common  equity  per  share  of  common  stock
removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders' equity per share of common stock.

The following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and regulatory ratios used in this financial review with financial measures

defined by GAAP.
