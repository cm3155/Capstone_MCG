SERVING CUSTOMERS, COLLEAGUES AND COMMUNITIES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 

The COVID-19 outbreak has affected countless people world-wide and continues to negatively impact the global economy. While the full effects of the pandemic remain unknown, the Corporation is committed to supporting its customers, colleagues and communities during this difficult time. The Corporation offers hardship relief assistance to customers, including the consideration of various loan payment deferral and fee waiver options, and encourages customers to reach out for assistance to support their individual circumstances. As a Small Business Administration preferred lender, the Corporation was well positioned to assist business customers in accessing funds available through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and other lending initiatives. Through June 30, 2020, the Corporation funded $3.9 billion of PPP loans, granted payment deferrals for $4.5 billion in loans (primarily commercial), including $57 million of loans on their second deferral, and waived overdraft, late payment, ATM and other customer fees. The Corporation has continued to serve customers at banking center drive-throughs and offer lobby hours by appointment while adhering to social distancing standards. 

In response to the pandemic, the Corporation activated its disaster recovery protocol, successfully avoiding significant disruptions to internal and external functions. The Corporation has supported colleagues through additional compensation and benefits to those most impacted by the pandemic, as well as awarded bonuses for extraordinary service in support of the PPP process. 

The Corporation and the Comerica Charitable Foundation have pledged $8 million to support business needs and community service organizations that care for and provide critical services to our communities. 

OUTLOOK FOR THIRD QUARTER 2020 COMPARED TO SECOND QUARTER 2020 

Based on current management expectations for recessionary conditions: 

&#8226; Decline in average loans reflects lending to small businesses with a full quarter benefit of PPP, more than offset by decreases in Mortgage Banker Finance, Large Corporate and National Dealer Services. 

&#8226; Average deposits relatively stable as customers utilize economic stimulus proceeds. 

&#8226; Decrease in net interest income resulting from a $10 million to $15 million net impact of lower interest rates (assumes one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) of 17 basis points and interest-bearing deposit cost of 20 basis points). Lower loan balances expected to be offset by lower wholesale debt and one additional day. 

&#8226; Provision for credit losses reflective of economic environment, including the effects resulting from the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

&#8226; Decline in noninterest income due to reduced card fees related to transaction activity and lower market-based investment banking and derivative fees, partially offset by higher service charges on deposit accounts due to increased activity. Higher securities trading income and deferred compensation levels in second quarter 2020 not expected to repeat. 

&#8226; Increase in noninterest expenses, reflecting technology and occupancy projects as well as higher charitable contributions and seasonal impacts of marketing and staff insurance expenses, mostly offset by continued expense discipline and reduction in COVID-19-related costs. 

&#8226; Capital reflects declaration of first preferred stock dividend and a focus on supporting customers' financing needs, as well as maintaining an attractive common dividend. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Net income for the three months ended June 30, 2020 was $113 million, a decrease of $185 million compared to $298 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019. The decrease in net income reflected the net impact of lower short-term rates. Results for the three months ended June 30, 2020 were also impacted by an increase in the provision for credit losses, calculated using the current expected credit loss (CECL) model, which continues to reflect the forecasted impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and continued pressures on the Energy portfolio. Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2020 was $48 million, a decrease of $589 million compared to $637 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. The decrease in net income was driven by an increase in the provision for credit losses as well as the net impact of lower short-term rates. 

Net income per diluted common share was $0.80 and $1.94 for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of $1.14 per diluted common share. Net income per diluted common share was $0.34 and $4.06 for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of $3.72 per diluted common share.

Rate/Volume Analysis 

Three Months Ended June 30, 2020/June 30, 2019 (in millions) Decrease Due to Rate Increase Due to Volume (a) Net Decrease Interest Income: Loans $ (221) &#160; $ 20 &#160; $ (201) &#160; Investment securities (2) &#160; 1 &#160; (1) &#160; Interest-bearing deposits with banks (16) &#160; 2 &#160; (14) &#160; Total interest income (239) &#160; 23 &#160; (216) &#160; Interest Expense: Interest-bearing deposits (49) &#160; 2 &#160; (47) &#160; Short-term borrowings (5) &#160; &#8212; &#160; (5) &#160; Medium- and long-term debt (34) &#160; 2 &#160; (32) &#160; Total interest expense (88) &#160; 4 &#160; (84) &#160; Net interest income $ (151) &#160; $ 19 &#160; $ (132) &#160; 

(a) Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume. 

Net interest income was $471 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, a decrease of $132 million compared to $603 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019. The decrease in net interest income primarily reflected the impact of lower short-term rates partially offset by the impact of a $2.5 billion increase in average loans, primarily PPP loans. The decline in rates led to the 116 basis point decrease in the net interest margin, to 2.50 percent for the three months ended June 30, 2020 from 3.66 percent for the three months ended June 30, 2019. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses, which includes the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments, was $138 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, compared to $44 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019. The provision for credit losses for the three months ended June 30, 2020, which was calculated under the CECL model, increased primarily due to the forecasted impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the economic impacts of social distancing, and sustained pressures on the Energy portfolio. Net loan charge-offs increased $17 million to $50 million, or 0.37 percent of average total loans for the three months ended June 30, 2020, compared to $33 million, or 0.26 percent of average total loans for the three months ended June 30, 2019. The increase was driven by a $20 million increase in net charge-offs of Energy loans. 

An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and a summary of nonperforming assets are presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review. Further information about the adoption of CECL, which resulted in a $17 million decrease to the allowance for credit losses as of January 1, 2020, is presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. 

Noninterest Income 

Three Months Ended June 30, (in millions) 2020 2019 Card fees $ 68 &#160; $ 65 &#160; Fiduciary income 52 &#160; 52 &#160; Service charges on deposit accounts 42 &#160; 51 &#160; Commercial lending fees 17 &#160; 21 &#160; Foreign exchange income 9 &#160; 11 &#160; Bank-owned life insurance 9 &#160; 11 &#160; Letter of credit fees 9 &#160; 10 &#160; Brokerage fees 5 &#160; 7 &#160; Net securities gains 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Other noninterest income (a) 35 &#160; 22 &#160; Total noninterest income $ 247 &#160; $ 250 &#160; 

(a) The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income. 

&#160; Noninterest income decreased $3 million to $247 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, including a reduction in service charges on deposit accounts reflecting the impacts of social distancing, syndication agent fees (a component of commercial lending fees) and smaller decreases in other categories, partially offset by higher securities trading income and customer derivative income (both included in other noninterest income and detailed below), as well as an increase in card fees. 

The following table presents certain categories included in other noninterest income on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 

Three Months Ended June 30, (in millions) 2020 2019 Customer derivative income $ 10 &#160; $ 6 &#160; Securities trading income 10 &#160; 2 &#160; Investment banking fees 4 &#160; 1 &#160; Deferred compensation asset returns (a) 2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Income from principal investing and warrants &#8212; &#160; 2 &#160; All other noninterest income 9 &#160; 11 &#160; Other noninterest income $ 35 &#160; $ 22 &#160; 

(a) Compensation deferred by the Corporation's officers and directors is invested based on investment selections of the officers and directors. Income earned on these assets is reported in other noninterest income and the offsetting change in deferred compensation plan liabilities is reported in salaries and benefits expense. 

Noninterest Expenses 

Three Months Ended June 30, (in millions) 2020 2019 Salaries and benefits expense $ 249 &#160; $ 245 &#160; Outside processing fee expense (a) 62 &#160; 65 &#160; Occupancy expense 37 &#160; 37 &#160; Software expense (a) 39 &#160; 28 &#160; Equipment expense 12 &#160; 12 &#160; Advertising expense 8 &#160; 9 &#160; FDIC insurance expense 8 &#160; 6 &#160; Other noninterest expenses 25 &#160; 22 &#160; Total noninterest expenses $ 440 &#160; $ 424 &#160; 

(a) Amounts reported for the three months ended June 30, 2020 included an $8 million classification adjustment for costs incurred in cloud computing arrangements, reducing outside processing fee expense and increasing software expense due to the prospective adoption of ASU No. 2018-15, effective January 1, 2020. 

Noninterest expenses increased $16 million to $440 million. Excluding the $8 million classification adjustment for the prospective adoption of ASU No. 2018-15, the increase in noninterest expenses primarily reflected higher outside processing fee expense, salaries and benefits expense and software expense. The increase in salaries and benefits expense was driven by annual merit increases and the payment of COVID-19-related stipends, partially offset by lower technology-related labor costs.

(a) Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume. 

Net interest income was $984 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, a decrease of $225 million compared to $1.2 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2019. Net interest margin was 2.77 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2020, a decrease of 96 basis points compared to 3.73 percent for the comparable period in 2019. The decrease in net interest income and margin reflected the impact of lower short-term rates partially offset by the impact of a $1.2 billion increase in average loans, primarily from PPP loans. 

For further discussion of the effects of market rates on net interest income, refer to the "Market and Liquidity Risk" section of this financial review. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses, which includes both the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments, was $549 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, compared to $31 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. The provision for credit losses for the six months ended June 30, 2020, which was calculated under the CECL model, increased primarily due to the forecasted impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the economic impacts of social distancing, and sustained pressures on the Energy portfolio. Net loan charge-offs increased $90 million to $134 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, compared to $44 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, driven by a $79 million increase in net charge-offs of Energy loans. 

An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets is presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.

(a) The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income. 

&#160; Noninterest income decreased $4 million to $484 million, including a reduction in service charges on deposit accounts and syndication agent fees (included in commercial lending fees), as well as smaller decreases in other categories. These declines were partially offset by higher fiduciary income as well as increases included in other noninterest income and detailed 

below, primarily in securities trading income, customer derivative income, investment banking fees, and the impact of losses related to securities repositioning during the six-month period ended June 30, 2019. 

The following table presents certain categories included in other noninterest income on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 

Six Months Ended June 30, (in millions) 2020 2019 Customer derivative income (a) $ 19 &#160; $ 13 &#160; Securities trading income 12 &#160; 4 &#160; Investment banking fees 7 &#160; 3 &#160; Income from principal investing and warrants &#8212; &#160; 3 &#160; Deferred compensation asset returns (b) (1) &#160; 2 &#160; All other noninterest income 18 &#160; 22 &#160; Other noninterest income $ 55 &#160; $ 47 &#160; 

(a) Customer derivative income included unfavorable valuation adjustments of $16 million and $5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

(b) Compensation deferred by the Corporation's officers and directors is invested based on investment selections of the officers and directors. Income earned on these assets is reported in other noninterest income and the offsetting change in deferred compensation plan liabilities is reported in salaries and benefits expense. 

Noninterest Expenses 

Six Months Ended June 30, (in millions) 2020 2019 Salaries and benefits expense $ 491 &#160; $ 510 &#160; Outside processing fee expense (a) 119 &#160; 128 &#160; Occupancy expense 74 &#160; 74 &#160; Software expense (a) 76 &#160; 57 &#160; Equipment expense 24 &#160; 24 &#160; Advertising expense 15 &#160; 14 &#160; FDIC insurance expense 16 &#160; 11 &#160; Other noninterest expenses 50 &#160; 39 &#160; Total noninterest expenses $ 865 &#160; $ 857 &#160; 

(a) Amounts reported for the six months ended June 30, 2020 included a $15 million classification adjustment for costs incurred in cloud computing arrangements, reducing outside processing fee expense and increasing software expense due to the prospective adoption of ASU No. 2018-15, effective January 1, 2020. &#160; 

Noninterest expenses increased $8 million to $865 million. Excluding the $15 million classification adjustment for the prospective adoption of ASU No. 2018-15, the increase in noninterest expenses primarily reflected higher operational losses (included in other noninterest expenses), outside processing fee expense and FDIC insurance expense, partially offset by a decrease in salaries and benefits expense. The decline in salaries and benefits expense included lower incentive and annual stock-based compensation, as well as a reduction in technology-related contingent labor costs, partially offset by annual merit increases and the payment of COVID-19-related stipends. 

STRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESS AND MARKETS 

The Corporation has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments: the Commercial Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, the Finance Division is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes items not directly associated with these business segments or the Finance segment. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Market segment results are also provided for the Corporation's three primary geographic markets: Michigan, California and Texas. In addition to the three primary geographic markets, Other Markets is also reported as a market segment. Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of the business and market segments for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. 

The Corporation's management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. These methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines. Note 22 to 

the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation's 2019 Annual Report describes the Corporation's segment reporting methodology. 

Net interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities plus the net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing (FTP). The FTP methodology allocates credits to each business segment for deposits and other funds provided as well as charges for loans and other assets being funded. FTP crediting rates for deposits and other funds provided reflect the long-term value of deposits and other funding sources based on their implied maturities. FTP charge rates for funding loans and other assets reflect a matched cost of funds based on the pricing and duration characteristics of the assets. Therefore, net interest income for each segment primarily reflects the volume and associated FTP impacts of loan and deposit levels. As overall interest rates decreased, business segments, particularly those focused on generating deposits, were impacted by lower FTP crediting rates on deposits in the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year. Similarly, FTP charges for funding loans decreased in the six months ended June 30, 2020, compared to the same period in the prior year.

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Second Quarter 2020 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2019 

Period-End Balances 

Total assets increased $11.0 billion to $84.4 billion, primarily due to increases of $7.4 billion in interest-bearing deposits with banks and $3.1 billion in loans. The growth in interest-bearing deposits with banks (primarily deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank) resulted from increased liquidity in the banking system from stimulus programs. The increase in loans reflected growth in Mortgage Banker Finance due to seasonality and elevated refinancing activity as well as increases in Business Banking, Commercial Real Estate, general Middle Market, Retail Banking (small businesses) and Corporate Banking, partially offset by decreases in National Dealer Services and Equity Fund Services. At June 30, 2020, PPP loans totaled $3.8 billion, driving the growth in general Middle Market, Business Banking and Retail Banking (small businesses). 

Total liabilities increased $10.5 billion to $76.6 billion, reflecting increases of $8.2 billion and $2.2 billion in noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits, respectively, as customers conserved liquidity as described in the asset discussion above. Total shareholders' equity increased $475 million, including net proceeds of $395 million from the issuance of preferred stock in May 2020. 

Average Balances 

Total assets increased $8.5 billion to $81.6 billion, primarily due to increases of $4.9 billion in interest-bearing deposits with banks and $3.0 billion in loans.

(a) Includes PPP loans of $2.6 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2020. 

The increase in loans reflected growth in Corporate Banking, Commercial Real Estate, general Middle Market, Mortgage Banker Finance (due to seasonality and elevated refinancing activity) and Business Banking, partially offset by a decrease in National Dealer Services and Energy. The average balance of PPP loans for the three months ended June 30, 2020 was $2.6 billion, driving the growth in general Middle Market and Business Banking. 

Total liabilities increased $8.1 billion to $74.1 billion, reflecting increases of $5.7 billion and $1.4 billion in noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits, respectively. Total shareholders' equity increased $355 million to $7.6 billion, resulting primarily from the same reasons as described in the period-end discussion above.

(a) Maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under the publicly announced plans or programs. 

(b) Includes approximately 101,000 shares purchased pursuant to deferred compensation plans and shares purchased from employees to pay for taxes related to restricted stock vesting under the terms of an employee share-based compensation plan during the six months ended June 30, 2020. These transactions are not considered part of the Corporation's repurchase program. 

In March 2020, the Corporation suspended its share repurchase program, with a focus on deploying capital to meet customers' growing financing requirements, resulting in no share repurchases under the program during second quarter 2020. The Corporation will continue to assess the resumption of repurchases subject to various factors including financial performance, capital needs and market conditions. Since its inception in 2010, a total of 87.2 million shares have been authorized for repurchase. There is no expiration date for the share repurchase program. 

In May 2020, the Corporation issued $400 million of 5.625% non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, which yielded $395 million in proceeds net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the terms of the preferred stock. 

The Corporation is prepared to continue using capital and liquidity in a responsible way to assist customers impacted by the COVID-19 crisis with a target of attaining and maintaining a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio of approximately 10 percent. At June 30, 2020, the Corporation's estimated CET1 capital ratio was 9.97 percent, a decrease of 16 thousand basis points compared to December 31, 2019. In 2020, the Corporation elected regulatory relief to defer the impact of adopting the CECL model for measuring credit losses on regulatory capital, which resulted in a cumulative 13-basis-point benefit to the estimated CET1 capital ratio at June 30, 2020. Also in 2020, the Corporation adopted capital rules issued by federal banking agencies that simplified certain regulatory capital rules, including the capital treatment of mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets, investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions and minority interests. 

The following table presents the minimum ratios required. 

Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 4.5 % Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 6.0 &#160; Total capital to risk-weighted assets 8.0 &#160; Capital conservation buffer (a) 2.5 &#160; Tier 1 capital to adjusted average assets (leverage ratio) 4.0 &#160; 

(a) In addition to the minimum risk-based capital requirements, the Corporation is required to maintain a minimum capital conservation buffer, in the form of common equity, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses. 

The Corporation's capital ratios exceeded minimum regulatory requirements as follows:

RISK MANAGEMENT 

The following updated information should be read in conjunction with the "Risk Management" section on pages F-20 through F-33 in the Corporation's 2019 Annual Report. 

Credit Risk 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. Effective January 1, 2020, the allowance for credit losses reflected the adoption of Topic 326, which requires companies to estimate credit losses using the CECL framework. As a percentage of total loans, the allowance for credit losses was 1.99 percent at June 30, 2020, compared to 1.33 percent at December 31, 2019. Excluding $3.8 billion in PPP loans, which are guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, the allowance for credit losses was 2.15 percent of total loans at June 30, 2020. The allowance for credit losses covered 3.9 times and 3.3 times total nonperforming loans at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. 

At adoption on January 1, 2020, the scope and severity of the economic crisis resulting from the eventual COVID-19 pandemic were unknown. As such, the economic scenario used by the Corporation to develop its estimate of CECL as of the adoption date reflected a continued moderate U.S. economic expansion compared to 2019 levels and a stable interest rate environment, with the federal funds rate remaining in the 1.50- to 1.75-percent range. Other assumptions included resolution of trade tensions, a calmer global economy and a strong U.S. dollar, all of which supported modest industrial production growth and stable oil prices. The economic scenario also assumed strong labor market conditions to support the consumer sector. Management also considered the level of uncertainty regarding its economic assumptions as part of the qualitative adjustment. The adoption of CECL resulted in a $17 million day-one decrease in the allowance for credit losses, from $668 million at December 31, 2019 under the incurred loss model. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the adoption of CECL. 

The allowance for credit losses increased by $415 million from adoption date to $1.1 billion at June 30, 2020, primarily reflecting the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the response by domestic and global governmental authorities, including quarantines and other social distancing policies aimed at fighting the spread of the virus. Energy markets, which were experiencing already reduced capital market activity prior to the pandemic, showed continued stress through the first half of 2020. The U.S. economy contracted into a recession with unusual speed and force, ending the longest expansionary period in U.S. history. The U.S. government and the Federal Reserve responded to the pandemic with unprecedented measures. In addition to the Federal Reserve reducing the target federal funds rate to zero to 0.25 percent, Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) that included an estimated $2 trillion stimulus package. During second quarter 2020, states across the U.S. began loosening social distancing policies, stimulating economic activity. While economic conditions showed signs of improvement toward the end of the second quarter 2020, there continues to be uncertainty regarding the impact to the U.S. economy from a secondary wave of COVID-19 cases as jurisdictions begin to reopen across the country and the mitigating impacts of government intervention. These developments shaped the 2-year 

reasonable and supportable forecast used by the Corporation in its calculation of the CECL estimate at June 30, 2020. After a sharp decline in GDP in second quarter 2020, the forecast reflects growth through the end of 2020, normalizing to historical growth rates by the end of the forecast period. Forecasts for other key economic variables, including the unemployment rate, oil prices and industrial production levels, are generally in line with GDP projections. Interest rates remain low, reflecting the Federal Reserve's expectation that rates will remain at current levels in the near-to mid-term, while corporate bond rates reflect decreasing default risk as the economy recovers. The following table summarizes the forecasts for the economic variables most impactful to the allowance for credit losses estimate at June 30, 2020. 

Economic Variable Base Forecast Real GDP growth Grows by 24 percent in third quarter 2020, normalizing into a long-term growth rate of 2 percent by the end of the forecast period. Unemployment rate Remaining above 10 percent through third quarter 2020, gradually decreasing to 7 percent by the end of the forecast period. Corporate BBB bond to 10-year Treasury bond spreads Third quarter 2020 spread of 3 percent reflects residual impacts of economic uncertainty, followed by a sharp, short-term decline then normalizing to a rate of 2 percent by the end of the forecast period. Oil Prices Prices below $30 per barrel in third quarter, increase in line with GDP through the forecast period, stabilizing at $50 per barrel by first quarter 2022. 

Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the ultimate economic consequences of the pandemic, as well as the effectiveness of the government's stimulus packages, management also considered other economic scenarios to make appropriate qualitative adjustments for certain sectors of its lending portfolio, including more benign and more severe forecasts. 

Allowance for Loan Losses 

The allowance for loan losses represents management&#8217;s estimates of current expected credit losses in the Corporation&#8217;s loan portfolio. Pools of loans with similar risk characteristics are collectively evaluated, while loans that no longer share risk characteristics with loan pools are evaluated individually. 

Collective loss estimates are determined by applying reserve factors, designed to estimate current expected credit losses, to amortized cost balances over the remaining contractual life of the collectively evaluated portfolio. Loans with similar risk characteristics are aggregated into homogeneous pools. The allowance for loan losses also includes qualitative adjustments to bring the allowance to the level management believes is appropriate based on factors that have not otherwise been fully accounted for, including adjustments for foresight risk, input imprecisions and model imprecision. Credit losses for loans that no longer share risk characteristics with the loan pools are estimated on an individual basis. Individual credit loss estimates are typically performed for nonaccrual loans and modified loans classified as TDRs and are based on one of several methods, including the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, observable market value of similar debt or the present value of expected cash flows. 

As a percentage of total loans, the allowance for loan losses was 1.88 percent at June 30, 2020, compared to 1.27 percent at December 31, 2019. Excluding PPP loans, the allowance for loan losses was 2.03 percent of total loans at June 30, 2020. The allocation of reserves for Energy loans remains above 10 percent in response to sustained pressures on the Energy portfolio. Nonperforming loans were 0.51 percent of total loans at June 30, 2020, compared to 0.40 percent at December 31, 2019, and the allowance covered 3.7 times and 3.1 times total nonperforming loans at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Lending-Related Commitments 

The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments estimates current expected credit losses on collective pools of letters of credit and unused commitments to extend credit based on reserve factors, determined in a manner similar to business loans, multiplied by a probability of draw estimate based on historical experience and credit risk, applied to commitment amounts. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments totaled $59 million and $31 million at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. 

For additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses, refer to the "Critical Accounting Policies" section and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. 

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, TDRs which have been renegotiated to less than the original contractual rates (reduced-rate loans) and foreclosed property. TDRs include performing and nonperforming loans, with nonperforming TDRs on either nonaccrual or reduced-rate status. Certain provisions within the CARES Act encourage financial institutions to practice prudent efforts to work with borrowers impacted by COVID-19. Under these provisions, modifications 

deemed to be COVID-19-related would not be considered a TDR if the loan was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019 and the deferral was executed between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of 60 days after the date of termination of the COVID-19 national emergency or December 31, 2020. The banking regulators issued similar guidance, which also clarified that a COVID-19-related modification should not be considered a TDR if the borrower was current on payments at the time the underlying loan modification program was implemented and if the modification was considered to be short-term. Modifications are first evaluated for eligibility under the CARES Act, then the interagency guidance if they do not qualify for the CARES Act relief. Modifications that are not eligible for either program continue to follow the Corporation&#8217;s established TDR policy. For loans not otherwise reportable as past due or nonaccrual, financial institutions are generally not expected to designate loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 as past due or nonaccrual. As of June 30, 2020, the Corporation granted payment deferrals for approximately 2,100 obligors with an aggregate loan balance of $4.5 billion, which primarily consisted of commercial loans, including $57 million of loans on their second deferral. 

The following table presents a summary of nonperforming assets and past due loans.

Nonperforming assets increased $67 million to $282 million at June 30, 2020, from $215 million at December 31, 2019. The increase in nonperforming assets primarily reflected a $59 million increase in nonperforming Energy loans, which are a component of commercial loans. 

The following table presents a summary of TDRs at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The table does not include loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

(b) Consumer, excluding residential mortgage and certain personal purpose nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs, are included in the Other category. 

Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest, which generally are well collateralized and in the process of collection, increased $15 million to $41 million at June 30, 2020, compared to $26 million at December 31, 2019. Loans past due 30-89 days and still accruing interest increased $80 million to $207 million at June 30, 2020, compared to $127 million at December 31, 2019. Loans past due 30 days or more and still accruing interest as a percentage of total loans were 0.46 percent and 0.30 percent at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. An aging analysis of loans included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements provides further information about the balances comprising past due loans. 

The following table presents a summary of total criticized loans. The Corporation's criticized list is consistent with the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful categories defined by regulatory authorities. Risk ratings are adjusted as appropriate based on dialogue with borrowers and review of current and projected financial performance, including liquidity and cash flow forecasts as well as receivable and inventory levels. Criticized loans with balances of $2 million or more on nonaccrual status or loans with balances of $1 million or more whose terms have been modified in a TDR are individually subjected to quarterly credit quality reviews, and the Corporation may establish specific allowances for such loans. A table of loans by credit quality indicator included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements provides further information about the balances comprising total criticized loans. 

(dollar amounts in millions) June 30, 2020 March 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Total criticized loans $ 3,379 &#160; $ 2,457 &#160; $ 2,120 &#160; As a percentage of total loans 6.3 % 4.6 % 4.2 % 

The $1.3 billion increase in criticized loans during the six months ended June 30, 2020 included increases of $564 million in general Middle Market and $475 million in Energy. 

Concentrations of Credit Risk 

Concentrations of credit risk may exist when a number of borrowers are engaged in similar activities, or activities in the same geographic region, and have similar economic characteristics that would cause them to be similarly impacted by changes in economic or other conditions. The Corporation has concentrations of credit risk with the automotive and commercial real estate industries. All other industry concentrations, as defined by management, individually represented less than 10 percent of total loans at June 30, 2020.

June 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 (in millions) Loans Outstanding Percent of Total Loans Loans Outstanding Percent of Total Loans Dealer: Floor plan $ 1,971 &#160; $ 3,967 &#160; Other 3,077 &#160; 3,447 &#160; Total dealer $ 5,048 &#160; 9.4 % $ 7,414 &#160; 14.7 % 

Substantially all dealer loans are in the National Dealer Services business line and primarily include floor plan financing and other loans to automotive dealerships. Floor plan loans, included in commercial loans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, totaled $2.0 billion at June 30, 2020, a decrease of $2.0 billion compared to $4.0 billion at December 31, 2019 due to lower automotive inventory precipitated by the interruption in automotive production. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, other loans to automotive dealers in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $3.1 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, including $2.0 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans at both June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. 

Nonaccrual dealer loans totaled $1 million at June 30, 2020 and $9 million at December 31, 2019. Dealer loan net charge-offs totaled $1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, compared to none for the six months ended June 30, 2019. 

Automotive Lending- Production: 

The following table presents a summary of loans to borrowers involved with automotive production. 

June 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 (in millions) Loans Outstanding Percent of Total Loans Loans Outstanding Percent of Total Loans Production: Domestic $ 1,040 &#160; $ 963 &#160; Foreign 432 &#160; 286 &#160; Total production $ 1,472 &#160; 2.8 % $ 1,249 &#160; 2.5 % 

Loans to borrowers involved with automotive production, primarily Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers, totaled $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. These borrowers could face financial difficulties due to disruptions in auto production as well as their supply chains and logistics operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, management prudently continued to increase allocated reserves for this portfolio as of June 30, 2020. 

Nonaccrual loans to borrowers involved with automotive production totaled $9 million at June 30, 2020 and $10 million at December 31, 2019. Criticized automotive production loans were 21 percent of the automotive production portfolio at June 30, 2020, compared to 15 percent at December 31, 2019. Automotive production loan net charge-offs totaled $2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2020, compared to net recoveries of $1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019. 

Commercial Real Estate Lending 

The following table summarizes the Corporation's commercial real estate loan portfolio by loan category. 

June 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 (in millions) Commercial Real Estate business line (a) Other (b) Total Commercial Real Estate business line (a) Other (b) Total Real estate construction loans $ 3,547 &#160; $ 405 &#160; $ 3,952 &#160; $ 3,044 &#160; $ 411 &#160; $ 3,455 &#160; Commercial mortgage loans 2,292 &#160; 7,633 &#160; 9,925 &#160; 2,176 &#160; 7,383 &#160; 9,559 &#160; Total commercial real estate $ 5,839 &#160; $ 8,038 &#160; $ 13,877 &#160; $ 5,220 &#160; $ 7,794 &#160; $ 13,014 &#160; 

(a) Primarily loans to real estate developers. 

(b) Primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate. 

The Corporation limits risk inherent in its commercial real estate lending activities by monitoring borrowers directly involved in the commercial real estate markets and adhering to conservative policies on loan-to-value ratios for such loans. Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $13.9 billion at June 30, 2020, an increase of $863 million compared to December 31, 2019, of which $5.8 billion, or 42 percent, were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, including loans to real estate developers. The remaining $8.0 billion, or 58 percent, of commercial real estate loans in other business lines consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages, which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans. 

The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-tenured customers with satisfactory completion experience. Criticized real estate construction loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $17 million and $31 million at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. In other business lines, there were $14 million criticized real estate construction loans at June 30, 2020, compared to none at December 31, 2019. There were no real estate construction loan charge-offs in either of the six-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. 

Commercial mortgage loans are loans where the primary collateral is a lien on any real property and are primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate. Real property is generally considered primary collateral if the value of that collateral represents more than 50 percent of the commitment at loan approval. Loans in the commercial mortgage portfolio generally mature within three to five years. Criticized commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $54 million and $55 million at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. In other business lines, $422 million and $242 million of commercial mortgage loans were criticized at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Commercial mortgage loan net recoveries were $2 million for both the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. 

Residential Real Estate Lending 

Residential real estate loans, which consist of traditional residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit, totaled $3.6 billion, or 7 percent of total loans, at June 30, 2020. The following table summarizes the Corporation's residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolios by geographic market. 

June 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 (dollar amounts in millions) Residential Mortgage Loans % of Total Home Equity Loans % of Total Residential Mortgage Loans % of Total Home Equity Loans % of Total Geographic market: Michigan $ 440 &#160; 23 % $ 570 &#160; 34 % $ 412 &#160; 22 % $ 603 &#160; 35 % California 953 &#160; 51 &#160; 700 &#160; 42 &#160; 932 &#160; 51 &#160; 699 &#160; 41 &#160; Texas 260 &#160; 14 &#160; 338 &#160; 20 &#160; 275 &#160; 15 &#160; 346 &#160; 20 &#160; Other Markets 233 &#160; 12 &#160; 61 &#160; 4 &#160; 226 &#160; 12 &#160; 63 &#160; 4 &#160; Total $ 1,886 &#160; 100 % $ 1,669 &#160; 100 % $ 1,845 &#160; 100 % $ 1,711 &#160; 100 % 

The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation's primary geographic markets. Substantially all residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more are placed on nonaccrual status, and substantially all junior lien home equity loans that are current or less than 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual status if full collection of the senior position is in doubt. At no later than 180 days past due, such loans are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell. 

Residential mortgages totaled $1.9 billion at June 30, 2020, and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the $1.9 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, $24 million were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2020. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.7 billion at June 30, 2020, of which $1.6 billion was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit, $88 million were in amortizing status and $20 million were closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.7 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $21 million were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2020. A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens at June 30, 2020. 

Energy Lending 

The Corporation has a portfolio of Energy loans included in commercial loans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Customers in the Corporation's Energy line of business (approximately 140 relationships) are engaged in three segments of the oil and gas business: exploration and production (E&#38;P), midstream and energy services. E&#38;P generally includes such activities as searching for potential oil and gas fields, drilling exploratory wells and operating active wells. Commitments to E&#38;P borrowers are generally subject to semi-annual borrowing base re-determinations based on a variety of factors including updated pricing (reflecting market and competitive conditions), energy reserve levels and the impact of hedging. The midstream sector is generally involved in the transportation, storage and marketing of crude and/or refined oil and gas products. The Corporation's energy services customers provide products and services primarily to the E&#38;P segment. 

The following table summarizes information about loans in the Corporation's Energy business line. 

June 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 (dollar amounts in millions) Outstandings Nonaccrual Criticized (a) Outstandings Nonaccrual Criticized (a) Exploration and production (E&#38;P) $ 1,662 &#160; 80 % $ 102 &#160; $ 750 &#160; $ 1,741 &#160; 78 % $ 43 &#160; $ 289 &#160; Midstream 374 &#160; 18 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 57 &#160; 432 &#160; 20 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 63 &#160; Services 50 &#160; 2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 34 &#160; 48 &#160; 2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 14 &#160; Total Energy business line $ 2,086 &#160; 100 % $ 102 &#160; $ 841 &#160; $ 2,221 &#160; 100 % $ 43 &#160; $ 366 &#160; As a percentage of total Energy loans 

5 % 40 % 2 % 16 % 

(a) Includes nonaccrual loans. 

Loans in the Energy business line totaled $2.1 billion, or 4 percent of total loans at June 30, 2020, and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $135 million. Total exposure, including unused commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, was $3.4 billion and $4.3 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. 

The decrease in total exposure in the Energy business line primarily reflected reduced borrowing bases as a result of lower oil and gas prices. At June 30, 2020, the Corporation had completed approximately 90 percent of the Spring borrowing base re-determinations, resulting in an average reduction to the borrowing bases of 20 percent. Utilization increased to 60 percent primarily as a result of the reduction in exposure at June 30, 2020. The value and coverage benefit of hedging contracts are dependent upon the oil/gas price in each contract, as well as the operational costs, which are different for each borrower. As of June 30, 2020, 73 percent of the Corporation's E&#38;P customers had at least 50 percent of their oil and/or gas production hedged up to one year and 37 percent of customers had at least 50 percent of production hedged for two years or more. 

The Corporation's allowance methodology considers the various risk elements within the loan portfolio. When merited, the Corporation may incorporate a qualitative reserve component for Energy loans. The allocation of reserves for Energy loans remained over 10 percent of the Energy portfolio at June 30, 2020 in response to oil market supply/demand imbalances as well as reduced capital market activity. The supply/demand imbalance has been exacerbated by the economic impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, further stressing the Energy portfolio. Net credit-related Energy charge-offs were $45 million and $112 million for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2020, respectively, compared to $25 million and $33 million for the same periods in 2019. Nonaccrual Energy loans increased $59 million to $102 million at June 30, 2020, compared to December 31, 2019. Criticized Energy loans increased $475 million to $841 million, or 25 percent of total criticized loans, at June 30, 2020. 

Leveraged Loans 

Certain loans in the Corporation's commercial portfolio are considered leveraged transactions. These loans are typically used for mergers, acquisitions, business recapitalizations, refinancing and equity buyouts. To help mitigate the risk associated with these loans, the Corporation focuses on middle market companies with highly capable management teams, strong sponsors and solid track records of financial performance. Industries prone to cyclical downturns and acquisitions with a high degree of integration risk are generally avoided. Other considerations include the sufficiency of collateral, the level of balance sheet leverage and the adequacy of financial covenants. During the underwriting process, cash flows are stress-tested to evaluate the borrowers' abilities to handle economic downturns and an increase in interest rates. Management considers the leveraged loan portfolio to be one of the most sensitive to economic impacts stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and 

social distancing policies and has continued to set aside increased reserves for this portfolio as of June 30, 2020. Certain energy, automotive production and loans in other portfolios specifically identified as subject to additional stress due to COVID-19 impacts are also considered leveraged transactions. 

The FDIC defines higher-risk commercial and industrial (HR C&#38;I) loans for assessment purposes as loans generally with leverage of four times total debt to earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation (EBITDA) as well as three times senior debt to EBITDA, excluding certain collateralized loans. 

The following table summarizes information about HR C&#38;I loans.

Other Sectors Most at Risk due to Economic Stress Resulting from COVID-19 Impacts 

The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and increased unemployment levels. The resulting temporary closure of many businesses and the implementation of social distancing and sheltering in place policies may impact many of the Corporation&#8217;s customers. In addition to the energy, automotive production and leveraged loan portfolios, the Corporation considers the following sectors of its loan portfolio to be most vulnerable to financial risks from business disruptions caused by the pandemic spread mitigation efforts. For further discussion, see Item 1.A "Risk Factors" on page 65 of this report.

Market and Liquidity Risk 

Market risk represents the risk of loss due to adverse movement in prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. Liquidity risk represents the risk that the Corporation does not have sufficient access to funds to maintain its normal operations at all times, or does not have the ability to raise or borrow funds at a reasonable cost at all times. 

The Asset and Liability Policy Committee (ALCO) of the Corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities. ALCO meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the Corporation, including treasury, finance, economics, lending, deposit gathering and risk management. Corporate Treasury mitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of ALCO through the actions it takes to manage the Corporation's market, liquidity and capital positions. 

In addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis, Corporate Treasury also monitors the parent company's liquidity and has established limits for the minimum number of months into the future in which the parent company can meet existing and forecasted obligations without the support of additional dividends from subsidiaries. ALCO's liquidity policy requires the parent company to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet expected capital and debt obligations with a target of 24 months but no less than 18 months. 

Corporate Treasury and the Enterprise Risk Division support ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks. Key activities encompass: (i) providing information and analyses of the Corporation's 

balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks; (ii) monitoring and reporting of the Corporation's positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines; (iii) developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions; (iv) reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval; and (v) monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks. 

Interest Rate Risk 

Net interest income is the primary source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities, primarily through the Corporation's core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by core deposits. Including the impact of interest rate swaps converting floating-rate loans to fixed, the Corporation's loan composition at June 30, 2020 was 53 percent 30-day LIBOR, 8 percent other LIBOR (primarily 60-and 90-day), 13 percent prime and 26 percent fixed rate. This creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the faster repricing of the floating-rate loan portfolio versus deposit products. In addition, the growth and/or contraction in the Corporation's loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing fixed-rate investment securities, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity, as well as hedging with interest rate swaps and options. Other mitigating factors include interest rate floors on a portion of the loan portfolio. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity. 

Since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives, a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk. These techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve utilizing multiple simulation analyses. Simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors, including, but not limited to, the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, regulatory impacts and management strategies. 

Sensitivity of Net Interest Income to Changes in Interest Rates 

The analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is management's principal risk management technique. Management models a base-case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment. Existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes as of the balance sheet dates are included in the analysis, but no additional hedging is forecasted. At June 30, 2020, these derivative instruments comprise interest rate swaps that convert $2.7 billion of fixed-rate medium- and long-term debt to variable rates through fair value hedges and convert $5.6 billion of variable-rate loans to fixed rates through cash flow hedges. This base-case net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which rates rise or decline 100 basis points (with a floor of zero percent) in a linear, non-parallel fashion from the base case over 12 months, resulting in an average increase or decrease in short-term interest rates of 50 basis points over the period. 

Each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth, investment security prepayment levels, depositor behavior, yield curve changes, loan and deposit pricing, and overall balance sheet mix and growth. In this low rate environment, depositors have maintained a higher level of liquidity and their historical behavior may be less indicative of future trends. As a result, the rising rate scenario reflects a greater decrease in deposits than experienced historically as rates rise. Changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis. 

The table below, as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above. 

June 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 (dollar amounts in millions) Amount % Amount % Change in Interest Rates: Change in Interest Rates: Rising 100 basis points $ 130 &#160; 7 % Rising 100 basis points 

$ 90 &#160; 4 % Declining to zero percent (32) &#160; (2) &#160; Declining 100 basis points 

(135) &#160; (6) &#160; 

The change in sensitivity to interest rates from December 31, 2019 to June 30, 2020 was driven by growth in fixed-rate loans, as well as the addition of swaps converting variable-rate loans to fixed rates, partially offset by growth in core deposits. Also, decreased sensitivity to declining interest rates was related to limited downward movement in interest rates before hitting zero percent. 

Sensitivity of Economic Value of Equity to Changes in Interest Rates 

In addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income, an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position. The economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the Corporation's financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period, and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements. The Corporation primarily monitors the percentage change on the base-case economic value of equity. The economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel 100 basis point shock. 

The table below, as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above. 

June 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 (dollar amounts in millions) Amount % Amount % Change in Interest Rates: Change in Interest Rates: Rising 100 basis points $ 1,319 &#160; 15 % Rising 100 basis points $ 716 &#160; 7 % Declining to zero percent (479) &#160; (54) &#160; Declining 100 basis points (1,178) &#160; (12) &#160; 

The sensitivity of the economic value of equity to rising rates increased from December 31, 2019 to June 30, 2020 due to changes in deposit pay rates and expected lives. The sensitivity to declining rates decreased due to changes in balance sheet composition as well as limited remaining downward movement in rates before hitting modeled zero-percent floors. 

LIBOR Transition 

On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. The Corporation has substantial exposure to LIBOR-based products, including loans, securities, derivatives and hedges, and is preparing for a transition from LIBOR toward alternative rates. A dedicated program office and governance structure has been established, with direction and oversight from the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer. A cross-functional implementation team has been tasked with execution of an enterprise LIBOR transition plan road map. Comerica&#8217;s enterprise transition milestones align with recommendations from the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) for both best practices and recommended 2020 objectives. As of the second quarter of 2020, customer disclosure information for both consumer and commercial loans are being provided for new originations. Execution plans are in place to begin incorporating fallback language related to legacy LIBOR commercial loans by the end of 2020. Additional milestones for products originated on alternative reference rates will be executed in alignment with market and industry decisions. The Corporation continues to monitor market developments and regulatory updates, as well as collaborate with regulators and industry groups on the transition. For a discussion of the various risks facing the Corporation in relation to the transition away from LIBOR, refer to "Item 1A. Risk Factors" beginning on page 12 of the Corporation's 2019 Annual Report. 

Wholesale Funding 

The Corporation may access the purchased funds market when necessary, which includes a variety of funding sources. Capacity for incremental purchased funds at June 30, 2020 included short-term Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances, the ability to purchase federal funds, sell securities under agreements to repurchase as well as issue deposits through brokers. Purchased funds increased to $839 million at June 30, 2020 compared to $295 million at December 31, 2019, driven by increases in short-term FHLB advances. At June 30, 2020, the Bank had pledged loans totaling $21.2 billion which provided for up to $16.2 billion of available collateralized borrowing with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB). 

The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Dallas, Texas, which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. At June 30, 2020, $18.3 billion of real estate-related loans and $5.2 billion of investment securities were pledged to the FHLB as collateral for current and potential future borrowings. The Corporation had $3.6 billion of FHLB long-term advances, maturing between 2026 and 2028, as well as $750 million in short-term advances outstanding at June 30, 2020, and capacity for potential future borrowings of approximately $10.1 billion. The Corporation expects to repay $1.0 billion of its outstanding FHLB long-term advances in third quarter 2020. 

Additionally, the Bank had the ability to issue up to $13.5 billion of debt at June 30, 2020 under an existing $15.0 billion note program which allows the issuance of debt with maturities between three months and 30 years. The Corporation also maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission from which it may issue debt and/or equity securities. 

The ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise funds at competitive rates may be impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings of the Corporation and the Bank. As of June 30, 2020, the three major rating agencies had assigned the ratings below to long-term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 

Comerica Incorporated Comerica Bank June 30, 2020 Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Standard and Poor&#8217;s BBB+ Negative A- Negative Moody&#8217;s Investors Service A3 Stable A3 Stable Fitch Ratings A- Stable A- Stable 

The Corporation satisfies liquidity needs with either liquid assets or various funding sources. Liquid assets totaled $20.5 billion and $17.9 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Liquid assets include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits with banks, other short-term investments and unencumbered investment securities. 

The Corporation performs monthly liquidity stress testing to evaluate its ability to meet funding needs in hypothetical stressed environments. Such environments cover a series of broad events, distinguished in terms of duration and severity. The evaluation as of June 30, 2020 projected sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events. 

Total liquidity sources, comprised of liquid assets and remaining borrowing capacity with the FRB and the FHLB, totaled $46.8 billion at June 30, 2020. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The Corporation&#8217;s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation's 2019 Annual Report. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation&#8217;s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2019, the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to the allowance for credit losses, fair value measurement, goodwill, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These policies were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully on pages F-34 through F-36 in the Corporation's 2019 Annual Report. Below are significant changes to the Corporation's critical accounting policies or estimates since the Corporation's 2019 Annual Report. 

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 

The Corporation adopted new accounting guidance for estimating credit losses, known as the CECL framework, in first quarter 2020. In accordance with CECL, the allowance for credit losses, which includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve for current expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life of the portfolio. 

In determining the allowance for credit losses for the majority of its lending portfolio, the Corporation uses reserve factors, based on estimated probability of default for internal risk ratings and loss given default. Management applies reserve factors to pools of loans and lending-related commitments with similar risk characteristics, calibrates these factors using economic forecasts and incorporates qualitative adjustments. For further discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses, refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. For further discussion on the economic forecast incorporated into the second quarter 2020 model, refer to the &#8220;Risk Management&#8221; section of this report. 

Management's determination of the appropriateness of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio, lending-related commitments, current as well as forecasted economic factors and other relevant factors. The calculation is inherently subjective and requires management to exercise significant judgment in developing assumptions into the estimate, the most significant of which are the loan risk rating process, development of economic forecasts and application of qualitative adjustments. Sensitivities are disclosed to demonstrate how changes in loan risk ratings and economic forecast scenarios may impact the allowance for credit losses. Sensitivities only consider changes to each specific assumption in isolation and their impact to the quantitative modeled results; however, they do not contemplate impacts to the qualitative framework. 

Loan Risk Rating Process 

Loss factors are applied to pools of loans based on the Corporation's internal risk rating system; therefore, loss estimates are highly dependent on the accuracy of the risk rating assigned to each loan. The inherent imprecision in the risk rating system resulting from inaccuracy in assigning and/or entering risk ratings in the loan accounting system is monitored by the Corporation's asset quality review function. Changes to internal risk ratings, beyond the forecasted migration inherent in the credit models, would result in a different estimated allowance for credit losses. To illustrate, if five percent of the individual risk ratings were adjusted down by one rating across all pools, the allowance for loan losses as of June 30, 2020 would change by approximately $13 million. 

Forecasted Economic Variables 

Historical loss factor estimates are calibrated to economic forecasts over the reasonable and supportable forecast period based on the projected performance of specific economic variables that statistically correlate with the probability of default and loss given default pools. Loss estimates revert to historical loss experience for contractual lives beyond the forecast period. Management selects economic variables it believes to be most relevant based on the composition of the loan portfolio and customer base, including forecasted levels of employment, gross domestic product, corporate bond and treasury spreads, industrial production levels, consumer and commercial real estate price indices as well as housing statistics. 

The allowance for credit losses is highly sensitive to the economic forecasts used to develop the estimate. Due to the high level of uncertainty regarding significant assumptions, such as the ultimate impact of the global pandemic and effectiveness of the government stimulus, the Corporation evaluated a range of economic scenarios, including a more severe economic forecast scenario, with varying speeds of recovery. The following table summarizes the more severe forecast scenario for the economic variables that are most impactful. 

Economic Variable More Severe Forecast Real GDP growth Grows by 13 percent in third quarter 2020 followed by a short-term contraction, then reaches a growth rate of 7 percent as the forecast period ends part-way through an economic recovery. Unemployment rate Remains at elevated levels between 10 percent and 12 percent throughout the forecast period. Corporate BBB bond to 10-year Treasury bond spreads Remains between 3.75 percent and 4.15 percent in the near-term before normalizing into spreads below 2 percent by the end of the forecast period. Oil Prices Price remains low throughout the forecast period, improving to above $25 per barrel by the second quarter 2022. 

Selecting a different forecast in the current environment could result in significantly different estimated allowance for credit losses. To illustrate, absent model overlays and other qualitative adjustments that are part of the quarterly reserving process, if the Corporation selected the more severe scenario to inform its models, the allowance for credit losses as of June 30, 2020 would increase by approximately $1.6 billion. However, factoring in model overlays and qualitative adjustments could result in a materially different estimate under a more severe scenario. 

Qualitative Adjustments 

The Corporation includes qualitative adjustments, as appropriate, intended to capture the impact of uncertainties not reflected in the quantitative estimate, including foresight risk, model imprecisions and input imprecisions. Qualitative adjustments for foresight risk, reflect the inherent imprecision in economic forecasts and may be included based on management&#8217;s evaluation of different forecast scenarios, ranging from more benign to more severe, and known recent events impacting the Corporation&#8217;s portfolio. Model imprecision adjustments and model overlays may be included to mitigate known limitations in the quantitative models. Input imprecision includes adjustments for portfolios where recent historical losses exceed expected losses or known recent events are expected to alter risk ratings once evidence is acquired, as well as a qualitative assessment of the lending environment, including underwriting standards, current economic and political conditions, and other factors affecting credit quality. Qualitative reserves at June 30, 2020 primarily included adjustments for uncertainties related to forecasted economic variables and model imprecision. 

Other Considerations 

To the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates, additional provision for credit losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods. The allowance is assigned to business segments and any earnings impact resulting from actual outcomes differing from management estimates would primarily affect the Commercial Bank segment. 

GOODWILL 

Goodwill is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level, equivalent to a business segment or one level below. The Corporation has three reporting units: the Commercial Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. At June 30, 2020, goodwill totaled $635 million, including $473 million allocated to the Commercial Bank, $101 million allocated to the Retail Bank and $61 million allocated to Wealth Management. 

The Corporation performs its annual evaluation of goodwill impairment in the third quarter of each year and may elect to perform a quantitative impairment analysis or first conduct a qualitative analysis to determine if a quantitative analysis is necessary. Additionally, the Corporation evaluates goodwill impairment on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate additional testing may be warranted to determine if goodwill might be impaired. 

In the first quarter of 2020, economic conditions deteriorated significantly with the spread of the coronavirus global pandemic. The outbreak resulted in social distancing requirements throughout the world, severely restricting the economy. In response to the crisis, the Federal Reserve lowered the Federal Funds rate in March 2020 to close to zero. Additionally, the U.S. government initiated numerous measures to support the economy, including the CARES Act. Given the economic deterioration in the first quarter of 2020, the Corporation assessed whether the events and circumstances resulted in it being more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying value. Impairment indicators considered comprised economic conditions, including projections of the duration of current conditions and timing of a potential recovery; industry and market considerations; government intervention and regulatory updates; the impact of recent events to financial performance and cost factors of the reporting units; performance of the Corporation&#8217;s stock and other relevant events. The Corporation further considered the amount by which fair value exceeded book value for each unit in the most recent quantitative analysis 

and sensitivities performed. At the conclusion of the first quarter 2020 assessment, the Corporation determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. 

In second quarter 2020, the Corporation performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test in response to continued macroeconomic deterioration and the ongoing impacts to the banking industry and markets in which the Corporation operates. The estimated fair values of the reporting units were determined using a blend of two commonly used valuation techniques: the market approach and the income approach. For the market approach, valuations of reporting units considered a combination of earnings and equity multiples from companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit. Since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of noncontrolling interests, the valuations incorporated a control premium. For the income approach, estimated future cash flows were derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for each reporting unit. In the short- and mid-term, forecasts incorporated current economic conditions and ongoing impacts of the global pandemic, including a federal funds target near zero and an elevated allowance for credit losses. Long-term projections reflected normalized rate and credit environments, as well as a long-term rate of return for each reporting unit. Projections were discounted using an applicable discount rate to calculate fair value. The discount rate was based on the imputed cost of equity capital appropriate for each reporting unit, which incorporates the risk-free rate of return, the level of non-diversified risk associated with companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit, a size risk premium and a market equity risk premium. The discount rate further reflected the uncertainty of current economic conditions and potential impacts to the forecasted financial information. The combined fair value of all units was compared to the Corporation&#8217;s market capitalization for reasonableness. At the conclusion of the quantitative impairment test in second quarter 2020, the estimated fair values of all reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying amounts, including goodwill. 

The test included evaluation of various factors that continue to rapidly evolve and for which significant uncertainty remains, including the impact of the coronavirus global pandemic to the economy and ongoing government intervention to mitigate that impact. Further weakening in the economic environment, such as continued decline in the performance of the reporting units or other factors, could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below their carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Additionally, new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management's expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Any impairment charge would not affect the Corporation's regulatory capital ratios, tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position. 

SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATA 

The Corporation believes non-GAAP measures are meaningful because they reflect adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and our performance trends. Tangible common equity is used by the Corporation to measure the quality of capital and the return relative to balance sheet risk. 

Common equity tier 1 capital ratio removes preferred stock from the Tier 1 capital ratio as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank regulations. The tangible common equity ratio removes the effect of intangible assets from capital and total assets. Tangible common equity per share of common stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders' equity per share of common stock. 

The following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and regulatory ratios used in this financial review with financial measures defined by GAAP.
