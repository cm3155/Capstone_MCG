 ITEM 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The Corporation cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not all-inclusive. For discussion of factors that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In particular, please refer to &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; beginning on page 12 of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 and "Item 1A.

SERVING CUSTOMERS, COLLEAGUES AND COMMUNITIES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 

The COVID-19 outbreak has affected countless people world-wide and is having a destructive impact on the global economy. While the full effects of the pandemic remain unknown, the Corporation is committed to supporting its customers, colleagues and communities during this difficult time. The Corporation is offering hardship relief assistance to customers, including the consideration of various loan payment deferral and fee waiver options, and encourages customers to reach out for assistance to support their individual circumstances. As a Small Business Administration preferred lender, the Corporation is well positioned to assist business customers in accessing funds available through the Paycheck Protection Program and other lending initiatives. Through April 24, 2020, the Corporation had funded approximately $1.8 billion of approved Paycheck Protection Program loans from the initial $349 billion allocation approved by Congress, and stands ready to fund additional loan applications to the extent approved by the Small Business Administration. The Corporation has continued to serve customers at banking center drive-throughs and offer lobby hours by appointment while adhering to social distancing standards. 

In response to the pandemic, the Corporation activated its disaster recovery protocol, successfully avoiding significant disruptions to internal and external functions. Over 65 percent of the Corporation's colleagues are currently working remotely, and colleagues whose functions require them to be physically present are eligible for additional "Promise Pay" of up to $175 per week. The Corporation is also providing stipends to help cover unexpected dependent- and elder-care costs, as well as no-cost health care benefits pertaining to COVID-19 and free telehealth visits. 

The Corporation and the Comerica Charitable Foundation have pledged $4 million to support business needs and community service organizations assisting youth, seniors and other vulnerable populations, particularly organizations addressing food insecurities and limited access to health care. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The Corporation posted a net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2020 of $65 million , compared to net income of $339 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The $404 million decrease in net income was primarily due to an increase in the provision for credit losses, calculated using the current expected credit loss (CECL) model, which reflected the forecasted impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the economic impacts of social distancing, and continued pressures on Energy. Results for the three months ended March 31, 2020 were also impacted by lower net interest income, reflecting the net impact of lower short-term rates on loans, partially offset by lower noninterest expenses. The provision for income taxes decrease d $106 million to a benefit of $21 million , primarily driven by the decrease in pre-tax income. 

The net loss per diluted common share was $0.46 for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to net income per diluted common share of $2.11 for the same period in the prior year. 

Outlook for Second Quarter 2020 Compared to First Quarter 2020 

Based on current management expectations for recessionary conditions: 

&#8226; 

Growth in average loans, reflecting an increase in Mortgage Banker Finance and support of customers' liquidity needs, including through the Paycheck Protection Program, partly offset by customers' reduced working capital and capital expenditure needs. 

&#8226; 

Growth in average deposits as customers conserve liquidity and receive benefits of economic stimulus programs, partly offset by customers using cash to meet operating needs. 

&#8226; 

Decrease in net interest income due to the net impact of lower interest rates, partially offset by loan growth. 

&#9702; 

Assuming average one-month LIBOR of 45 basis points and average deposit pay rates of 25 to 30 basis points, net reduction solely from lower interest rates of approximately $75 million in second quarter 2020. 

&#8226; 

Provision for credit losses highly uncertain, reflective of economic environment, including the effects resulting from the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. Current reserve is appropriate based on expected recessionary conditions as of March 31, 2020. 

&#8226; 

Stable noninterest income with increase in card fees offset by reduced economic activity and lower market-based fees. 

&#8226; 

Increase in noninterest expenses from higher outside processing fee expense and costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the impact of merit increases, partially offset by continued expense discipline. 

&#8226; 

Capital to reflect suspension of share repurchase program and focus on supporting customers' financing needs as well as providing an attractive dividend.

Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume. 

Net interest income was $513 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , a decrease of $93 million compared to $606 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The decrease in net interest income primarily reflected the impact of lower short-term rates on loans. 

The net interest margin was 3.06 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , a decrease of 73 basis points compared to 3.79 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2019 , driven by the impact of the decline in short-term rates on loan yields. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The provision for credit losses totaled $411 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , calculated under the CECL model, compared to a benefit of $13 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The increase in provision for credit losses reflected the forecasted impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the economic impacts of social distancing, and continued pressures on the Energy portfolio. 

The provision for loan losses was $380 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 . Net loan charge-offs increased $73 million to $84 million , or 0.68 percent of average total loans for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to $11 million , or 0.08 percent of average total loans for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The increase was driven by a $59 million increase in net charge-offs of Energy loans. 

The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $31 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to no provision for the three months ended March 31, 2019 , with the increase primarily driven by Energy. There were no lending-related commitment charge-offs in the three-month periods ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 . 

An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and a summary of nonperforming assets are presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review. Further information about the adoption of CECL, which resulted in a $17 million decrease to the allowance for credit losses as of January 1, 2020, is presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

Amounts reported for the three months ended March 31, 2020 included a $7 million classification adjustment for costs incurred in cloud computing arrangements, reducing outside processing fee expense and increasing software expense due to the prospective adoption of ASU No. 2018-15. 

Noninterest expenses decrease d $8 million to $425 million , primarily reflecting a decrease in salaries and benefits expense, partially offset by increase s in operational losses, included in other noninterest expenses, FDIC insurance expense and advertising expense. The decline in salaries and benefits expense included decreases in incentive and annual stock-based compensation as well as lower technology-related contingent labor costs. 

STRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESS AND MARKETS 

The Corporation has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, the Finance Division is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes items not directly associated with these business segments or the Finance segment. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Market segment results are also provided for the Corporation's three primary geographic markets: Michigan, California and Texas. In addition to the three primary geographic markets, Other Markets is also reported as a market segment. Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of the business and market segments for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 . 

The Corporation's management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. These methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines. Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation's 2019 Annual Report describes the Corporation's segment reporting methodology. 

Net interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities plus the net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing (FTP). The FTP methodology allocates credits to each business segment for deposits and other funds provided as well as charges for loans and other assets being funded. FTP crediting rates for deposits and other funds provided reflect the long-term value of deposits and other funding sources based on their implied maturities. FTP charge rates for funding loans and other assets reflect a matched cost of funds based on the pricing and duration characteristics of the assets. Therefore, net interest income for each segment primarily reflects the volume and associated FTP impacts of loan and deposit levels. As overall interest rates decreased, business segments, particularly those focused on generating deposits, were impacted by lower FTP crediting rates on deposits in the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year. Similarly, FTP charges for funding loans decreased in the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to the same period in the prior year.

The decrease in loans was largely attributed to a decrease in Mortgage Banker Finance from higher seasonal activity and refinance volumes in the prior quarter, as well as decreases in National Dealer Services and Energy, partially offset by an increase in Commercial Real Estate. 

Total liabilities and shareholders' equity were relatively stable at $65.8 billion and $7.4 billion , respectively.

Includes approximately 95,000 shares purchased pursuant to deferred compensation plans and shares purchased from employees to pay for taxes related to restricted stock vesting under the terms of an employee share-based compensation plan during the three months ended March 31, 2020 . These transactions are not considered part of the Corporation's repurchase program. 

In March 2020, the Corporation suspended its share repurchase program, with a focus on deploying capital to meet customers' growing financing requirements. The Corporation will assess the resumption of repurchases subject to various factors including financial performance, capital needs and market conditions. Since its inception in 2010, a total of 87.2 million shares have been authorized for repurchase. There is no expiration date for the share repurchase program. 

The Corporation expects to use capital and liquidity in a responsible way to assist customers impacted by the COVID-19 crisis with a longer-term target of attaining and maintaining a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio of approximately 10 percent. At March 31, 2020 , the Corporation's estimated CET1 capital ratio was 9.51 percent , a decrease of 62 basis points compared to December 31, 2019. Higher period-end loans at March 31, 2020 increased risk-weighted assets and contributed to the lower estimated CET1 capital ratio. The Corporation expects to elect recently issued regulatory relief to defer the impact of adopting the CECL model for measuring credit losses on regulatory capital, which resulted in a 10-basis-point benefit to the estimated CET1 capital ratio at March 31, 2020 . 

On July 22, 2019, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that simplifies certain regulatory capital rules, including the capital treatment of mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets, investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions, and minority interests. On November 13, 2019, the agencies issued a final rule that permitted early adoption of this rule for the quarter beginning January 1, 2020 rather than on April 1, 2020, as initially provided. The Corporation expects to early adopt this rule resulting in a benefit of approximately 8 basis points to the total risk-based capital ratio at March 31, 2020 .

RISK MANAGEMENT 

The following updated information should be read in conjunction with the "Risk Management" section on pages F-20 through F-33 in the Corporation's 2019 Annual Report. 

Credit Risk 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. Effective January 1, 2020, the allowance for credit losses reflected the adoption of Topic 326, which requires companies to estimate credit losses using the CECL framework. 

CECL at January 1, 2020 

At adoption on January 1, 2020, the scope and severity of the economic crisis resulting from the eventual COVID-19 pandemic were unknown. As such, the economic scenario used by the Corporation to develop its estimate of CECL as of the adoption date reflected a continued moderate U.S. economic expansion compared to 2019 levels and a stable interest rate environment, with the federal funds rate remaining in the 1.50- to 1.75-percent range. Other assumptions included resolution of trade tensions, a calmer global economy and a strong U.S. dollar, all of which supported modest industrial production growth and stable oil prices. The economic scenario also assumed strong labor market conditions to support the consumer sector. Management also considered the level of uncertainty regarding its economic assumptions as part of the qualitative adjustment. The adoption of CECL resulted in a $17 million day-one decrease in the allowance for credit losses, from $668 million at December 31, 2019 under the incurred loss model. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the adoption of CECL. 

CECL at March 31, 2020 

The allowance for credit losses was $978 million at March 31, 2020 , which increased $327 million during the first quarter of 2020, primarily reflecting the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the response by domestic and global governmental authorities, including quarantines and other social distancing policies aimed at fighting the spread of the virus, which resulted in an economic slowdown with unprecedented speed and force. Oil prices decreased significantly during the first quarter as a result of an imbalance in production supply and demand, adding stress to an already reduced capital market activity. In response to the worsening situation, the Federal Reserve announced in March that it was reducing the target federal funds rate to zero to 0.25 percent, and Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), which included an estimated $2 trillion stimulus package seeking to prevent a protracted severe economic recession in the U.S. These developments shaped the economic scenarios used by the Corporation in its calculation of the CECL estimate at March 31, 2020 . The base scenario forecasted a recession with significant economic deterioration in the second quarter of 2020 before a partial recovery in third quarter 2020 and more modest recovery in subsequent quarters. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the ultimate economic consequences of the pandemic, as well as the effectiveness of the government&#8217;s stimulus packages, management also considered other economic scenarios to make appropriate qualitative adjustments for certain sectors of its lending portfolio, including more benign and more severe forecasts that resulted in a decline in gross domestic product ranging from 13 percent to 

33 percent in the second quarter of 2020, respectively. For certain loan portfolios deemed to have increased exposure to the current economic environment, including energy, automotive production, leveraged loans and industries considered at risk due to social distancing, management considered the more severe assumptions. 

Allowance for Loan Losses 

The allowance for loan losses represents management&#8217;s estimates of current expected credit losses in the Corporation&#8217;s loan portfolio. Pools of loans with similar risk characteristics are collectively evaluated, while loans that no longer share risk characteristics with loan pools are evaluated individually. 

Collective loss estimates are determined by applying reserve factors, designed to estimate current expected credit losses, to amortized cost balances over the remaining contractual life of the collectively evaluated portfolio. Loans with similar risk characteristics are aggregated into homogeneous pools. The allowance for loan losses also includes qualitative adjustments to bring the allowance to the level management believes is appropriate based on factors that have not otherwise been fully accounted for, including adjustments for foresight risk, input imprecisions and model imprecision. Credit losses for loans that no longer share risk characteristics with the loan pools are estimated on an individual basis. Individual credit loss estimates are typically performed for nonaccrual loans and modified loans classified as troubled debt restructurings and are based on one of several methods, including the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, observable market value of similar debt or the present value of expected cash flows. 

As a percentage of total loans, the allowance for loan losses was 1.71 percent at March 31, 2020 , compared to 1.27 percent at December 31, 2019 . The allocation of reserves for Energy loans increased to over 10 percent in response to the pressures on oil and gas markets described above. Nonperforming loans were 0.45 percent of total loans at March 31, 2020 , compared to 0.40 percent at December 31, 2019 , and the allowance covered 3.8 times and 3.1 times total nonperforming loans at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Lending-Related Commitments 

The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments estimates current expected credit losses on collective pools of letters of credit and unused commitments to extend credit based on standard reserve factors, determined in a manner similar to business loans, multiplied by a probability of draw estimate based on historical experience and credit risk, applied to commitment amounts. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments totaled $62 million and $31 million at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. 

For additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses, refer to the "Critical Accounting Policies" section and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. 

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, troubled debt restructured loans (TDRs) which have been renegotiated to less than the original contractual rates (reduced-rate loans) and foreclosed property. TDRs include performing and nonperforming loans, with nonperforming TDRs on either nonaccrual or reduced-rate status. Certain provisions within the CARES Act encourage financial institutions to practice prudent efforts to work with borrowers impacted by COVID-19. Under these provisions, modifications deemed to be COVID-19-related would not be considered a TDR if the loan was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019 and the deferral was executed between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of 60 days after the date of termination of the COVID-19 national emergency or December 31, 2020. The banking regulators issued similar guidance, which also clarified that a COVID-19-related modification should not be considered a TDR if the borrower was current on payments at the time the underlying loan modification program was implemented and if the modification is considered to be short-term. Under these terms, as of March 31, 2020 , the Corporation had processed payment deferrals for approximately 60 obligors with an aggregate loan balance of $108 million. Through April 24, 2020 , the number of obligors whose deferral request was processed increased to approximately 1,000 with an aggregate loan balance of $2.7 billion, with substantially all considered performing at the time of deferral.

The Corporation limits risk inherent in its commercial real estate lending activities by monitoring borrowers directly involved in the commercial real estate markets and adhering to conservative policies on LTV ratios for such loans. Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $13.5 billion at March 31, 2020 , an increase of $440 million compared to December 31, 2019 , of which $5.5 billion , or 41 percent , were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, including loans to real estate developers. The remaining $7.9 billion , or 59 percent , of commercial real estate loans in other business lines consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages, which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans. 

The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-tenured customers with satisfactory completion experience. Criticized real estate construction loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $33 million and $31 million at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. In other business lines, there were no criticized real estate construction loans at both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . There were no real estate construction loan charge-offs in either of the three-month periods ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 . 

Commercial mortgage loans are loans where the primary collateral is a lien on any real property and are primarily loans secured by owner occupied real estate. Real property is generally considered primary collateral if the value of that collateral represents more than 50 percent of the commitment at loan approval. Loans in the commercial mortgage portfolio generally mature within three to five years. Criticized commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $54 million and $55 million at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. In other business lines, $236 million and $242 million of commercial mortgage loans were criticized at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. Commercial mortgage loan net recoveries were $2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to net charge-offs of $1 million for the same period in 2019 . 

Residential Real Estate Lending 

Residential real estate loans, which consist of traditional residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit, totaled $3.5 billion , or 7 percent of total loans, at March 31, 2020 .

The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation's primary geographic markets. Substantially all residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more are placed on nonaccrual status, and substantially all junior lien home equity loans that are current or less than 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual status if full collection of the senior position is in doubt. At no later than 180 days past due, such loans are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell. 

Residential mortgages totaled $1.8 billion at March 31, 2020 , and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the $1.8 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, $20 million were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2020 . The home equity portfolio totaled $1.7 billion at March 31, 2020 , of which $1.6 billion was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit, $99 million were in amortizing 

status and $22 million were closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.7 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $22 million were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2020 . A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens at March 31, 2020 . 

Energy Lending 

The Corporation has a portfolio of Energy loans, primarily included in commercial loans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Customers in the Corporation's Energy line of business (approximately 140 relationships) are engaged in three segments of the oil and gas business: exploration and production (E&#38;P), midstream and energy services. E&#38;P generally includes such activities as searching for potential oil and gas fields, drilling exploratory wells and operating active wells. Commitments to E&#38;P borrowers are generally subject to semi-annual borrowing base re-determinations based on a variety of factors including updated pricing (reflecting market and competitive conditions), energy reserve levels and the impact of hedging. The midstream sector is generally involved in the transportation, storage and marketing of crude and/or refined oil and gas products. The Corporation's energy services customers provide products and services primarily to the E&#38;P segment. 

The following table summarizes information about loans in the Corporation's Energy business line.

Includes nonaccrual loans. 

Loans in the Energy business line totaled $2.1 billion , or 4 percent of total loans at March 31, 2020 , and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2019 , a decrease of $107 million . Total exposure, including unused commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, was $3.7 billion and $4.3 billion at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. 

The decrease in total exposure in the Energy business line primarily reflected reduced borrowing bases as a result of lower oil and gas prices. At March 31, 2020 , the Corporation had completed approximately 8 percent of the Spring borrowing base re-determinations and approximately 23 percent through April 24, 2020 resulting in average reduction to the borrowing base of 24 percent. Utilization increased to 56 percent primarily as a result of the reduction in exposure at March 31, 2020 . The value and coverage benefit of hedging contracts are dependent upon the oil/gas price in each contract, as well as the operational costs, which are different for each borrower. As of March 31, 2020 , 66 percent of the Corporation's E&#38;P customers had at least 50 percent of their oil and/or gas production hedged up to one year and 35 percent of customers had at least 50 percent of production hedged for two years or more. 

The Corporation's allowance methodology considers the various risk elements within the loan portfolio. When merited, the Corporation may incorporate a qualitative reserve component for Energy loans. The allocation of reserves for Energy loans increased to over 10 percent of the Energy portfolio at March 31, 2020 in response to oil market supply/demand imbalances as well as reduced capital market activity. The supply/demand imbalance has been exacerbated by the economic impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, further stressing the Energy portfolio. Net credit-related Energy charge-offs were $67 million and $8 million for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, while nonaccrual Energy loans increased $22 million to $65 million at March 31, 2020 , compared to December 31, 2019 . Criticized Energy loans increased $127 million to $493 million , or 20 percent of total criticized loans, at March 31, 2020 . 

Leveraged Loans 

Certain loans in the Corporation's commercial portfolio are considered leveraged transactions. These loans are typically used for mergers, acquisitions, business recapitalizations, refinancing and equity buyouts. To help mitigate the risk associated with these loans, the Corporation focuses on middle market companies with highly capable management teams, strong sponsors and solid track records of financial performance. Industries prone to cyclical downturns and acquisitions with a high degree of integration risk are generally avoided. Other considerations include the sufficiency of collateral, the level of balance sheet leverage and the adequacy of financial covenants. During the underwriting process, cash flows are stress-tested to evaluate the borrowers' abilities to handle economic downturns and an increase in interest rates. Management considers the leveraged loan portfolio to be one of the most sensitive to economic impacts stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing policies and has prudently increased reserves for this portfolio as of March 31, 2020. Certain energy, automotive production, and loans in other portfolios specifically identified as subject to additional stress due to COVID-19 impacts are also considered leveraged transactions. 

The FDIC defines higher-risk commercial and industrial (HR C&#38;I) loans for assessment purposes as loans generally with leverage of four times total debt to earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation (EBITDA) as well as three times senior debt to EBITDA, excluding certain collateralized loans.

Other Loan Portfolios Most at Risk due to Economic Stress Resulting from COVID-19 Impacts 

The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and increased unemployment levels. The resulting temporary closure of many businesses and the implementation of social distancing and sheltering in place policies may impact many of the Corporation&#8217;s customers. In addition to the energy, automotive production and leveraged loan portfolios, the Corporation considers the following portfolios to be most vulnerable to financial risks from business disruptions caused by the pandemic spread mitigation efforts.

Market and Liquidity Risk 

Market risk represents the risk of loss due to adverse movement in prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. Liquidity risk represents the risk that the Corporation does not have sufficient access to funds to maintain its normal operations at all times, or does not have the ability to raise or borrow funds at a reasonable cost at all times. 

The Asset and Liability Policy Committee (ALCO) of the Corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities. ALCO meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the Corporation, including treasury, finance, economics, lending, deposit gathering and risk management. Corporate Treasury mitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of ALCO through the actions it takes to manage the Corporation's market, liquidity and capital positions. 

In addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis, Corporate Treasury also monitors the parent company's liquidity and has established limits for the minimum number of months into the future in which the parent company can meet existing and forecasted obligations without the support of additional dividends from subsidiaries. ALCO's liquidity policy requires the parent company to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet expected capital and debt obligations with a target of 24 months but no less than 18 months. 

Corporate Treasury and the Enterprise Risk Division support ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks. Key activities encompass: (i) providing information and analyses of the Corporation's balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks; (ii) monitoring and reporting of the Corporation's positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines; (iii) developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions; (iv) reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval; and (v) monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks. 

Interest Rate Risk 

Net interest income is the primary source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities, primarily through the Corporation's core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by core deposits. Including the impact of interest rate swaps converting floating-rate loans to fixed, the Corporation's loan composition at March 31, 2020 was 70 percent 30-day LIBOR, 6 percent other LIBOR (primarily 60-day), 6 percent prime and 18 percent fixed rate. This creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the faster repricing of the floating-rate loan portfolio versus deposit products. In addition, the growth and/or contraction in the Corporation's loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing fixed-rate investment securities, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity, as well as hedging with interest rate swaps and options. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity. 

Since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives, a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk. These techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve utilizing multiple simulation analyses. Simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors, including, but not limited to, the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, regulatory impacts and management strategies. 

Sensitivity of Net Interest Income to Changes in Interest Rates 

The analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is management's principal risk management technique. Management models a base-case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment. Existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes as of the balance sheet dates are included in the analysis, but no additional hedging is forecasted. At March 31, 2020 , these derivative instruments comprise interest rate swaps that convert $3.3 billion of fixed-rate medium- and long-term debt to variable rates through fair value hedges and convert $5.6 billion of variable-rate loans to fixed rates through cash flow hedges. This base-case net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which rates rise or decline 100 basis points (with a floor of zero percent) in a linear, non-parallel fashion from the base case over 12 months, resulting in an average increase or decrease in short-term interest rates of 50 basis points over the period. 

Each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth, investment security prepayment levels, depositor behavior, yield curve changes, loan and deposit pricing, and overall balance sheet mix and growth. In this low rate environment, depositors have maintained a higher level of liquidity and their historical behavior may be less indicative of future trends. As a result, the rising rate scenario reflects a greater decrease in deposits than experienced historically as rates rise. Changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis. 

The table below, as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above.

Sensitivity to rising interest rates increased from December 31, 2019 to March 31, 2020 due to changes in balance sheet composition, partially offset by the addition of swaps converting variable-rate loans to fixed rates. Sensitivity to declining rates decreased due to changes in balance sheet composition and limited remaining downward movement in rates before reaching zero-percent floors. 

Sensitivity of Economic Value of Equity to Changes in Interest Rates 

In addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income, an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position. The economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the Corporation's financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period, and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements. 

The Corporation primarily monitors the percentage change on the base-case economic value of equity. The economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel 100 basis point shock. 

The table below, as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above.

The sensitivity of the economic value of equity to rising rates increased from December 31, 2019 to March 31, 2020 due to changes in deposit pay rates and expected lives. The sensitivity to declining rates decreased due to changes in balance sheet composition as well as limited remaining downward movement in rates before reaching zero-percent floors. 

LIBOR Transition 

On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. The Corporation has substantial exposure to LIBOR-based products, including loans, securities, derivatives and hedges, and is preparing for a transition from LIBOR toward alternative rates. A dedicated program office and governance structure has been established, with direction and oversight from the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer. A cross-functional implementation team has been tasked with execution of an enterprise LIBOR transition plan road map. Key execution tasks are underway and include evaluating alternative rates and associated impacts, assessing the population of impacted contracts and ensuring necessary fallback provisions are incorporated, ensuring operational and system readiness, monitoring and mitigating overall transition risks, as well as communicating timely with internal and external stakeholders. Additionally, Comerica is a member of the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) and assists with establishing industry guidelines and recommendations for the overall LIBOR transition. The Corporation continues to monitor market developments and regulatory updates, as well as collaborate with regulators and industry groups on the transition. For a discussion of the various risks facing the Corporation in relation to the transition away from LIBOR, refer to "Item 1A. Risk Factors" beginning on page 12 of the Corporation's 2019 Annual Report. 

Wholesale Funding 

The Corporation may access the purchased funds market when necessary, which includes a variety of funding sources. Capacity for incremental purchased funds at March 31, 2020 included short-term FHLB advances, the ability to purchase federal funds, sell securities under agreements to repurchase, as well as issue deposits through brokers. Purchased funds increased to $2.3 billion at March 31, 2020 compared to $295 million at December 31, 2019, driven by increases in short-term FHLB advances and federal funds purchased. At March 31, 2020 , the Bank had pledged loans totaling $21.6 billion which provided for up to $17.2 billion of available collateralized borrowing with the FRB. 

The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Dallas, Texas, which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. At March 31, 2020 , $17.6 billion of real estate-related loans and $5.5 billion of investment securities were pledged to the FHLB as collateral for current and potential future borrowings. The Corporation had $3.8 billion of FHLB long-term advances, maturing between 2026 and 2028, as well as $750 million in short-term advances outstanding at March 31, 2020 , and capacity for potential future borrowings of approximately $9.9 billion . 

Additionally, the Bank had the ability to issue up to $13.5 billion of debt at March 31, 2020 under an existing $15.0 billion note program which allows the issuance of debt with maturities between three months and 30 years. The Corporation also maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission from which it may issue debt and/or equity securities. 

The ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise funds at competitive rates may be impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings of the Corporation and the Bank. As of April 28, 2020, the three major rating agencies had assigned the ratings below to long-term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

The Corporation satisfies liquidity needs with either liquid assets or various funding sources. Liquid assets totaled $11.8 billion and $17.9 billion at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. Liquid assets include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits with banks, other short-term investments and unencumbered investment securities. 

The Corporation performs monthly liquidity stress testing to evaluate its ability to meet funding needs in hypothetical stressed environments. Such environments cover a series of broad events, distinguished in terms of duration and severity. The evaluation as of March 31, 2020 projected sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events. 

Total liquidity sources, comprised of liquid assets and remaining borrowing capacity with the FRB and the FHLB, totaled $38.9 billion at March 31, 2020 . 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The Corporation&#8217;s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation's 2019 Annual Report. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation&#8217;s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2019 , the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to the allowance for credit losses, fair value measurement, goodwill, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These policies were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully on pages F-34 through F-36 in the Corporation's 2019 Annual Report. Below are significant changes to the Corporation's critical accounting policies or estimates since the Corporation's 2019 Annual Report. 

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 

The Corporation adopted new accounting guidance for estimating credit losses, known as the CECL model, in first quarter 2020. In accordance with CECL, the allowance for credit losses, which includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve for current expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life of the portfolio. Management's determination of the appropriateness of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio, lending-related commitments, current as well as forecasted economic factors and other relevant factors. 

In determining the allowance for credit losses for the majority of its lending portfolio, the Corporation uses standard loss factors, based on estimated probability of default for internal risk ratings and loss given default. Management applies standard reserve factors to pools of loans and lending-related commitments with similar risk characteristics, calibrates these standard loss factors using economic forecasts and incorporates qualitative adjustments. As such, the calculation of current expected credit losses is inherently subjective and requires management to exercise significant judgment. 

&#8226; 

Internal risk ratings: Standard loss factors are applied to pools of loans based on the Corporation's internal risk rating system; therefore, loss estimates are highly dependent on the accuracy of the risk rating assigned to each loan. The inherent imprecision in the risk rating system resulting from inaccuracy in assigning and/or entering risk ratings in the loan accounting system is monitored by the Corporation's asset quality review function. Changes to internal risk ratings, beyond the forecasted migration inherent in the credit models, &#160; would result in a different estimated allowance for credit losses. To illustrate, if five percent of the individual risk ratings were adjusted down by one rating across all pools, the allowance for loan losses as of March 31, 2020 would change by approximately $10 million. 

&#8226; 

Forecasted economic variables: Historical standard loss factor estimates are calibrated to economic forecasts over the reasonable and supportable forecast period based on the projected performance of specific economic variables that statistically correlate with the probability of default and loss given default pools. Loss estimates revert to historical loss experience for contractual lives beyond the forecast period. Management selects economic variables it believes to be most relevant based on the composition of the loan portfolio and customer base, including forecasted levels of employment, gross domestic product, corporate bond and treasury spreads, industrial production levels, consumer and commercial real estate price indices as well as housing statistics. For first quarter 2020, management used an economic forecast that considered information available as of the end of the period, including assumptions regarding the impacts of the global coronavirus pandemic, the government stimulus package included in the CARES Act, effects of social distancing policy and current pressures on energy. The forecast anticipated significant economic deterioration during the second quarter of 2020 as part of a recession that would create severe financial stress, followed by a partial recovery during third quarter 2020 and more modest recovery in subsequent quarters for the remainder of the reasonable and supportable period. 

The allowance for credit losses is highly sensitive to the economic forecasts used to develop the estimate. Due to the high level of uncertainty regarding significant assumptions, such as the ultimate impact of the global pandemic and effectiveness of the government stimulus, the Corporation evaluated a range of economic scenarios, including more and less severe economic deteriorations in the second quarter of 2020, with varying speeds of recovery. In isolation, assuming a more prolonged recession through next year with elevated unemployment levels through the latter half of 2022, the CECL model may have resulted in a significantly higher allowance for credit losses. However, because qualitative adjustments are an integral part of the allowance methodology, the actual impact of a change in assumptions is not determinable. 

&#8226; 

Qualitative adjustments: The Corporation includes qualitative adjustments, as appropriate, intended to capture the impact of uncertainties not reflected in the quantitative estimate, including foresight risk, model imprecisions and input imprecisions. Qualitative adjustments for foresight risk, reflect the inherent imprecision in economic forecasts and may be included based on management&#8217;s evaluation of different forecast scenarios, ranging from more benign to more severe, and known recent events impacting the Corporation&#8217;s portfolio. Model imprecision adjustments may be included to mitigate known limitations 

in the quantitative models. Input imprecision includes adjustments for portfolios where recent historical losses exceed expected losses or known recent events are expected to alter risk ratings once evidence is acquired, as well as a qualitative assessment of the lending environment, including underwriting standards, current economic and political conditions, and other factors affecting credit quality. Qualitative reserves at March 31, 2020 primarily included adjustments for uncertainties related to forecasted economic variables and model imprecision. 

For further discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses, refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. To the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates, additional provision for credit losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods. The allowance is assigned to business segments and any earnings impact resulting from actual outcomes differing from management estimates would primarily affect the Business Bank segment. 

GOODWILL 

Goodwill is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level, equivalent to a business segment or one level below. The Corporation has three reporting units: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. At March 31, 2020, goodwill totaled $635 million, including $473 million allocated to the Business Bank, $101 million allocated to the Retail Bank and $61 million allocated to Wealth Management. 

The Corporation performs its annual evaluation of goodwill impairment in the third quarter of each year and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests suggest additional testing may be warranted to determine if goodwill might be impaired. The Corporation may elect to perform a quantitative impairment analysis, or first conduct a qualitative analysis to determine if a quantitative analysis is necessary. 

In the first quarter of 2020, economic conditions deteriorated significantly with the spread of the coronavirus global pandemic. The outbreak resulted in social distancing requirements throughout the world, severely restricting the economy. In response to the crisis, the Federal Reserve lowered the Federal Funds rate in March 2020 to close to zero. Additionally, the U.S. government initiated numerous measures to support the economy, including the CARES Act. Given the current economic deterioration, the Corporation assessed whether the events and circumstances resulted in it being more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying value. Impairment indicators considered comprised economic conditions, including projections of the duration of current conditions and timing of a potential recovery; industry and market considerations; government intervention and regulatory updates; the impact of recent events to financial performance and cost factors of the reporting units; performance of the Corporation&#8217;s stock and other relevant events. The Corporation further considered the amount by which fair value exceeded book value for each unit in the most recent quantitative analysis and sensitivities performed. At the conclusion of the assessment, the Corporation determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. 

The analysis included evaluation of various factors that continue to rapidly evolve and for which significant uncertainty remains, including the impact of the coronavirus global pandemic to the economy and ongoing government intervention to mitigate that impact. Further weakening in the economic environment, such as continued decline in the performance of the reporting units or other factors, could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below their carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Additionally, new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management's expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Any impairment charge would not affect the Corporation's regulatory capital ratios, tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position. 

SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATA 

The Corporation believes non-GAAP measures are meaningful because they reflect adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and our performance trends. Tangible common equity is used by Comerica to measure the quality of capital and the return relative to balance sheet risk. 

The following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this financial review with financial measures defined by GAAP.
