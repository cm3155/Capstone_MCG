2019 OVERVIEW AND 2020 OUTLOOK

Comerica Incorporated (the Corporation) is a financial holding company headquartered in Dallas, Texas. The Corporation's major business segments
are  the  Business  Bank,  the  Retail  Bank  and  Wealth  Management.  The  core  businesses  are  tailored  to  each  of  the  Corporation's  three  primary  geographic
markets: Michigan, California and Texas. Information about the activities of the Corporation's business segments is provided in Note 22 to the consolidated
financial statements.

As  a  financial  institution,  the  Corporation's  principal  activity  is  lending  to  and  accepting  deposits  from  businesses  and  individuals.  The  primary
source  of  revenue  is  net  interest  income,  which  is  principally  derived  from  the  difference  between  interest  earned  on  loans  and  investment  securities  and
interest paid on deposits and other funding sources. The Corporation also provides other products and services that meet the financial needs of customers
which generate noninterest income, the Corporation's secondary source of revenue. Growth in loans, deposits and noninterest income is affected by many
factors, including economic conditions in the markets the Corporation serves, the financial requirements and economic health of customers, and the ability to
add new customers and/or increase the number of products used by current customers. Success in providing products and services depends on the financial
needs of customers and the types of products desired.

The accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation and its subsidiaries conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the
United States (U.S.). The Corporation's consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of
which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. The most critical of these significant accounting policies are discussed in the “Critical
Accounting Policies” section of this financial review.

2019 Overview

Full-Year 2019 compared to Full-Year 2018

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•
•

Net income decreased $37 million, or 3 percent, to $1.2 billion. Net income per diluted common share was a record $7.87 in 2019 compared to $7.20
in 2018, an increase of 9 percent.
Average loans increased $1.7 billion, or 4 percent, to $50.5 billion. The increase primarily reflected increases in Energy, Mortgage Banker Finance,
National Dealer Services, general Middle Market and Commercial Real Estate.
Average  deposits  decreased  $454  million  to  $55.5  billion.  Average  noninterest-bearing  deposits  decreased  $2.6  billion,  or  9  percent,  driven  by
customers shifting balances to interest-bearing deposits and utilizing their deposits to fund growth, acquisitions and capital expenditures as well as
choosing  other  investment  options.  Average  interest-bearing  deposits  increased  $2.1  billion,  or  8  percent,  driven  by  increases  of  $1.3  billion  in
relationship-based deposits and $703 million in other time deposits.
Net interest income decreased $13 million to $2.3 billion, and the net interest margin decreased 4 basis points to 3.54 percent. Both decreases were
primarily driven by the impact of higher interest-bearing deposit and debt balances, partially offset by the benefit from higher loan balances and the
net impact of higher short-term rates.
The  provision  for  credit  losses  increased $75 million  to  $74 million  in  2019  from  a  benefit  of  $1 million  in  2018,  primarily  due  to  a  decline  in
valuations of select liquidating Energy credits.
Noninterest income increased $34 million to $1.0 billion, including growth in card fees, a decrease in losses related to securities repositioning and
higher deferred compensation asset returns, partially offset by lower service charges on deposit accounts.
Noninterest expenses decreased $51 million to $1.7 billion, primarily reflecting the end of restructuring charges related to the GEAR Up efficiency
initiative and lower FDIC insurance expense, partially offset by increased technology-related expenses and outside processing fees.
The provision for income taxes increased $34 million to $334 million, primarily due to a $31 million decrease in discrete tax benefits.
The Corporation repurchased approximately 18.6 million shares of common stock under the equity repurchase program and issued cash dividends of
$2.68 per share, a 46 percent increase. Altogether, $1.8 billion was returned to shareholders, an increase of $141 million.

Full-Year 2020 Outlook

For full-year 2020 compared to full-year 2019 results, management expects the following, assuming a continuation of the current economic and rate

environment:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

Two percent to three percent growth in average loans, reflecting increases in most lines of business, partly offset by declines in Mortgage Banker
Finance and National Dealer Services.

One percent to two percent increase in average deposits, with a continued focus on attracting and retaining relationship-based deposits.

Decrease in net interest income due to:

◦

◦

◦

the net impact of lower interest rates, including a net reduction of $10 million to $15 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the
fourth quarter of 2019; followed by a modest decrease in each of the remaining quarters of the year as longer-dated assets and liabilities
reprice as well as continued hedging activity;

the full-year impact from 2019 funding actions and lower nonaccrual interest recoveries;

partially offset by the benefit from loan growth.

Continued strong credit quality, with net credit-related charge-offs similar to 2019 levels (15 basis points to 25 basis points of average total loans).

One  percent  growth  in  noninterest  income,  reflecting  growth  in  card  fees  and  fiduciary  income,  partially  offset  by  lower  derivative  and  warrant
income, and assuming no returns on deferred compensation assets.

Three percent increase in noninterest expenses, reflecting higher outside processing expenses in line with growing revenue, technology expenditures,
typical inflationary pressures and higher pension expense.

Income tax expense to be approximately 23 percent of pre-tax income.

Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio target of approximately 10 percent.

Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities. Gains and losses related to risk management
interest rate swaps that convert fixed rate debt to a floating rate and qualify as fair value hedges are included in interest expense on medium- and long-term
debt. Additionally, the portion of gains and losses on risk management interest rate swaps that convert variable-rate loans to fixed rates through cash flow
hedges  that  relate  to  the  earnings  effect  of  the  hedged  loans  during  the  period  are  included  in  loan  interest  income.  Refer  to  the  Analysis  of  Net  Interest
Income and the Rate/Volume Analysis tables above for an analysis of net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 and details
of the components of the change in net interest income for 2019 compared to 2018 as well as 2018 compared to 2017.

Net interest income was $2.3 billion, a decrease of $13 million. The impact to net interest income from higher balances of interest-bearing sources of
funds and lower balances with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) (included in interest-bearing deposits with banks) was mostly offset by higher loan balances
and the net impact of higher short-term rates. Earning assets increased $724 million, primarily reflecting increases of $1.7 billion in loans and $310 million in
investment  securities,  partially  offset  by  a  $1.3  billion  decrease  in  interest-bearing  deposits  with  banks.  Interest-bearing  sources  increased  $3.6  billion,
primarily reflecting a $2.1 billion increase in interest-bearing deposits and a $1.1 billion increase in medium- and long-term debt.

The net interest margin decreased 4 basis points to 3.54 percent, from 3.58 percent, primarily reflecting higher balances of interest-bearing sources of

funds, mostly offset by a decrease in lower-yielding FRB deposit balances, higher loan balances and the net impact of higher short-term rates.

The Corporation utilizes various asset and liability management strategies to manage net interest income exposure to interest rate risk. Refer to the
“Market and Liquidity Risk” section of this financial review for additional information regarding the Corporation's asset and liability management policies
and the “Balance Sheet and Capital Funds Analysis” section for further discussion on changes in earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

Provision for Credit Losses

The provision for credit losses was $74 million, compared to a benefit of $1 million. The provision for credit losses includes both the provision for

loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments.

The  provision  for  loan  losses  is  recorded  to  maintain  the  allowance  for  loan  losses  at  the  level  deemed  appropriate  by  the  Corporation  to  cover
probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio. The provision for loan losses was $73 million, an increase of $62 million compared to $11 million, primarily
driven by an increase in Energy reserves due to a decline in valuations of select liquidating Energy credits. Net loan charge-offs increased $56 million to $107
million, or 0.21 percent of average total loans, compared to $51 million, or 0.11 percent. The increase was driven by an $80 million increase in Energy net
loan charge-offs, to $86 million.

The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments is recorded to maintain reserves at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation
to cover probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was a provision of
$1 million, an increase of $13 million compared to a benefit of $12 million. The benefit in 2018 primarily reflected a decrease in Energy commitments. There
were no lending-related commitment charge-offs in 2019 and 2018.

For  further  discussion  of  the  allowance  for  loan  losses  and  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  on  lending-related  commitments,  including  the
methodology  used  in  the  determination  of  the  allowances  and  an  analysis  of  the  changes  in  the  allowances,  refer  to  Note  1  to  the  consolidated  financial
statements and the "Credit Risk" section of this financial review.

(b) The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income.

Noninterest income increased $34 million to $1.0 billion, compared to $976 million. The change in noninterest income included losses of $8 million
and $20 million related to repositioning of the securities portfolio in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and an $11 million increase in deferred compensation asset
returns  (offset  in  noninterest  expenses).  The  remaining  $11  million  increase  was  primarily  due  to  increases  in  card  fees,  commercial  lending  fees  and
customer derivative income, partially offset by a decrease in service charges on deposit accounts.

Card  fees  consist  primarily  of  interchange  and  other  fee  income  earned  on  government  prepaid  card,  commercial  card,  debit/Automated  Teller
Machine (ATM) card and merchant payment processing services. Card fees increased $13 million, or 5 percent. The increase was primarily due to volume-
driven increases in merchant payment processing services and government card programs.

Service charges on deposit accounts consist primarily of charges on retail and business accounts, including fees for treasury management services.
Service  charges  on  deposit  accounts  decreased  $8  million,  or  3  percent.  The  decrease  primarily  reflected  higher  earnings  credit  allowances  provided  on
commercial customer deposit balances due to the increase in short-term interest rates.

Commercial lending fees include the assessments on the unused portion of lines of credit (unused commitment fees), syndication agent fees and loan

servicing fees. These fees increased $6 million, or 7 percent, primarily reflecting an increase in syndication agent fees.

Other noninterest income increased $13 million, or 13 percent, driven by increases of $11 million in deferred compensation asset returns (offset in
noninterest expenses) and $6 million in customer derivative income as well as a $6 million  gain  on  the  sale  of  the  Corporation's  Health  Savings  Account
business as illustrated in the following table. These increases were partially offset

by  decreases  of  $5  million  due  to  the  wind  down  of  a  retirement  savings  program  in  2018  and  $4  million  in  income  from  tax-credit  investments  (both
included in all other noninterest income).

(a) Outside processing fee expense in 2017 does not reflect the 2018 adoption of new accounting guidance for revenue from contracts with customers (Accounting Standards

Codification Topic 606). Refer to page F-8 of the "Results of Operations" section in the Corporation's 2018 Annual Report for further information.

Noninterest expenses decreased $51 million to $1.7 billion. Excluding $53 million in restructuring charges completed in 2018, noninterest expenses
increased $2 million, primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits expense, outside processing fees, advertising expense and smaller increases in various
other categories, mostly offset by decreases in FDIC insurance expense, pension expense and software expense.

Salaries and benefits expense increased $11 million, or 1 percent. The increase in salaries and benefits expense was driven by higher technology-
related labor costs, deferred compensation expense (offset in noninterest income) and merit increases, partially offset by lower incentive compensation tied to
financial performance.

Outside processing fee expense increased $9 million, or 3 percent, compared to $255 million in 2018, primarily due to volume-driven increases in
merchant payment and government card processing expenses tied to card fee revenues, increased hosting expenses associated with migrating to cloud-based
platforms and a $4 million vendor transition fee incurred in 2019, partially offset by a $7 million reduction in processing expenses related to the end of a
retirement savings program in 2018.

Software expense decreased $8 million,  or  6 percent,  primarily  reflecting  a  decrease  in  software  depreciation  expense,  as  several  large  internally

developed applications became fully depreciated in 2018 and 2019.

FDIC insurance expense decreased $19 million, or 45 percent, primarily due to the completion of FDIC surcharges in 2018.

Advertising expense increased $4 million, or 16 percent, primarily due to increased marketing expenses related to digital banking technologies as

well as an increase in sponsorship expenses, reflecting recent agreements with sports franchises.

Other noninterest expenses included a decrease of $14 million in other pension and postretirement benefit costs, mostly offset by increases of $5

million due to a state business tax refund in 2018 and $3 million each in operational losses and consulting fees.

Income Taxes and Related Items

The provision for income taxes was $334 million in 2019, compared to $300 million in 2018. The $34 million increase in the provision for income
taxes primarily reflected a $31 million decrease in discrete tax benefits, to $17 million in 2019 from $48 million in 2018. The discrete tax benefit in 2018
primarily resulted from a review of certain tax capitalization and recovery positions related to software and fixed assets included in the 2017 tax return and
tax benefits of $22 million from employee stock transactions. The discrete benefit in 2019 included $5 million from adjustments to annual state tax filings in
third quarter of 2019 and tax benefits of $12 million from employee stock transactions.

Net  deferred  tax  assets  were  $42  million  at  December  31,  2019,  compared  to  $166  million  at  December  31,  2018.  Refer  to  Note  18  to  the
consolidated  financial  statements  for  information  about  the  components  of  net  deferred  tax  assets.  Deferred  tax  assets  of  $329 million  were  evaluated  for
realization and it was determined that a valuation allowance of $3 million related to state net operating loss carryforwards was needed at both December 31,
2019  and  2018.  These  conclusions  were  based  on  available  evidence  of  projected  future  reversals  of  existing  taxable  temporary  differences,  assumptions
made regarding future events and, when applicable, state loss carryback capacity.

STRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESS

The  Corporation  has  strategically  aligned  its  operations  into  three  major  business  segments:  the  Business  Bank,  the  Retail  Bank  and  Wealth
Management. These business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided. In addition to the
three major business segments, the Finance Division is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes items not directly associated with the business
segments  or  the  Finance  segment.  The  performance  of  the  business  segments  is  not  comparable  with  the  Corporation's  consolidated  results  and  is  not
necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the
information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Market segment results are also provided
for the Corporation's three primary geographic markets: Michigan, California and Texas. In addition to the three primary geographic markets, Other Markets
is also reported as a market segment. Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements describes the Corporation's segment reporting methodology as well as
the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of the business and market segments for the years ended December 31, 2019,
2018 and 2017.

The Corporation's management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies,
which are regularly reviewed and refined. These methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the
organizational structure and/or product lines.

Net interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities plus
the net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing (FTP). The FTP methodology allocates credits to each business segment for deposits and other
funds provided as well as charges for loans and other assets being funded. FTP crediting rates on deposits and other funds provided reflect the long-term
value of deposits and other funding sources based on their implied maturities. FTP charge rates for funding loans and other assets reflect a matched cost of
funds  based  on  the  pricing  and  duration  characteristics  of  the  assets.  Therefore,  net  interest  income  for  each  segment  primarily  reflects  the  volume  and
associated FTP impacts of loan and deposit levels. As overall market rates were higher in 2019, business segments, particularly those focused on generating
deposits, benefited from higher FTP crediting rates on deposits compared to the prior year. Similarly, FTP charges for funding loans were higher in 2019.
Effective January 1, 2019, the Corporation prospectively discontinued allocating an additional FTP charge for the cost of maintaining liquid assets to support
potential draws on unfunded loan commitments.

The  following  sections  present  a  summary  of  the  performance  of  each  of  the  Corporation's  business  and  market  segments  for  2019  compared  to

2018.

an  increase  in  Energy  reserves.  Net  credit-related  charge-offs  increased  $59  million  to  $111  million,  primarily  due  to  a  decline  in  valuations  of  select
liquidating  Energy  credits,  partially  offset  by  decreases  in  general  Middle  Market  and  Technology  and  Life  Sciences.  Noninterest  income  increased  $8
million,  primarily  reflecting  increases  of  $12 million  in  card  fees  and  $6 million  in  commercial  lending  fees,  partially  offset  by  a  $4 million  decrease  in
income  from  tax  credit  investments,  as  well  as  smaller  decreases  in  other  categories.  Excluding  restructuring  charges  of  $30 million  in  2018,  noninterest

Middle  Market  business  lines  generally  serve  customers  with  annual  revenue  between  $30  million  and  $500  million.  Within  the  Middle  Market
business lines, the largest changes were increases in Energy, National Dealer Services and General Middle Market. Customers in the Energy business line are
primarily engaged in the oil and gas businesses. The $581 million increase in average Energy loans primarily reflected reduced capital market activity, which
drove  higher  utilization.  For  more  information  on  Energy  loans,  refer  to  "Energy  Lending"  in  the  "Risk  Management"  section  of  this  financial  review.
National  Dealer  Services  provides  floor  plan  inventory  financing  and  commercial  mortgages  to  auto  dealerships.  The  $358  million  increase  in  average
National  Dealer  Services  loans  and  the  $334  million  increase  in  General  Middle  Market  loans  largely  reflected  the  expansion  of  new  and  existing
relationships.

Mortgage Banker Finance provides short-term, revolving lines of credit to independent mortgage banking companies and therefore partly reflects the
level of home sales and refinancing activity in the market as a whole. The $434 million increase was primarily due to elevated refinancing activity and new
customer acquisition.

Investment securities increased $353 million to $12.4 billion  at  December  31,  2019,  from  $12.0 billion  at  December  31,  2018.  At  December  31,
2019, the weighted-average expected life of the Corporation's residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio was approximately 2.9 years. On an average
basis, investment securities increased $310 million to $12.1 billion in 2019, compared to $11.8 billion in 2018.  The  increase  was  primarily  due  unrealized
gains due to lower interest rates.

The Corporation repositioned treasury securities by selling $1.0 billion in 2019 and $1.3 billion in 2018 and purchasing higher yielding treasuries.

This resulted in after-tax losses of $6 million and $15 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Interest-Bearing Deposits with Banks and Other Short-Term Investments

Interest-bearing  deposits  with  banks  primarily  include  deposits  with  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  (FRB)  and  also  include  deposits  with  banks  in
developed countries or international banking facilities of foreign banks located in the United States. Interest-bearing deposits with banks are mostly used to
manage liquidity requirements of the Corporation. Interest-bearing deposits with banks increased $1.7 billion to $4.8 billion at December  31,  2019.  On  an
average basis, interest-bearing deposits with banks decreased $1.3 billion to $3.4 billion in 2019.

Other  short-term  investments  include  federal  funds  sold,  trading  securities,  money  market  investments  and  loans  held-for-sale.  Substantially  all
trading  securities  are  deferred  compensation  plan  assets.  Loans  held-for-sale  typically  represent  residential  mortgage  loans  originated  with  management's
intention to sell and, from time to time, other loans that are transferred to held-for-sale. Other short-term investments increased $21 million to $155 million at
December 31, 2019. On an average basis, other short-term investments increased $9 million to $143 million in 2019.

Deposits and Borrowed Funds

At December 31, 2019, total deposits were $57.3 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion, or 3 percent, compared to $55.6 billion at December 31, 2018.
The  increase  reflects  an  increase  of  $3.0 billion,  or  11 percent,  in  interest-bearing  deposits,  partially  offset  by  a  decrease  of  $1.3 billion,  or  5  percent,  in
noninterest-bearing deposits. The Corporation's average deposits and borrowed funds balances are detailed in the following table.

Average  deposits  decreased  $454  million  to  $55.5  billion  in  2019,  compared  to  $55.9  billion  in  2018,  reflecting  a  decrease  of  $2.6  billion  in
noninterest-bearing  deposits,  partially  offset  by  an  increase  of  $2.1  billion  in  interest-bearing  deposits.  The  decline  in  noninterest-bearing  deposits  was
primarily  the  result  of  customers  shifting  balances  to  interest-bearing  deposits  and  utilizing  their  deposits  to  fund  growth,  acquisitions  and  capital
expenditures as well as choosing other investment options. The increase in

Table of Contents

interest-bearing  deposits  reflected  increases  of  $1.3  billion  in  relationship-based  deposits  and  $703  million  in  other  time  deposits.  Other  time  deposits,
primarily brokered deposits, provided low-cost, flexible funding.

Short-term borrowings totaled $71 million at December 31, 2019, an increase of $27 million compared to $44 million at December 31, 2018. Short-
term borrowings primarily include federal funds purchased, short-term FHLB advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Average short-
term borrowings increased $307 million, to $369 million in 2019, compared to $62 million in 2018.

Total medium- and long-term debt at December 31, 2019 increased $806 million to $7.3 billion, compared to $6.5 billion at December 31, 2018. The
increase in medium- and long-term debt reflected issuances of $550 million of long-term notes and $500 million of medium-term notes, partially offset by the
maturity of $350 million of medium-term notes. The Corporation uses medium- and long-term debt, which includes long-term FHLB advances, medium- and
long-term  senior  notes  as  well  as  subordinated  notes,  to  provide  funding  to  support  earning  assets,  liquidity  and  regulatory  capital.  Average  medium-  and
long-term debt increased $1.1 billion, or 19 percent, to $7.0 billion in 2019, compared to $5.8 billion in 2018.

Further information on medium- and long-term debt is provided in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.

The  Corporation  expects  to  continue  to  return  capital  to  shareholders  with  a  target  of  maintaining  a  common  equity  Tier  1  capital  ratio  of
approximately  10  percent.  At  December  31,  2019,  the  Corporation's  Tier  1  capital  ratio  was  10.13  percent.  The  timing  and  ultimate  amount  of  future
distributions will be subject to various factors including financial performance, capital needs and market conditions.

The Board of Directors (the Board) authorized additional share repurchases of up to 15 million shares and 7 million shares of Comerica Incorporated
common stock in January 2019 and November 2019, respectively, in addition to the 4.7 million shares remaining at December 31, 2018 under the Board's
prior authorizations for the share repurchase program. During 2019, the Corporation repurchased 18.6 million shares for a total of $1.4 billion. At December
31, 2019, 8.1 million shares remained authorized for repurchase under the share repurchase program. Repurchases of common stock under the authorization
may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or accelerated repurchase programs. The number of shares ultimately purchased during
2020 will depend on many factors, including capital needs of the Corporation and market conditions. There is no expiration date for the Corporation's share
repurchase program.

The Board approved a 7-cent increase in the quarterly dividend, to $0.67 per share, in January 2019 and approved an additional 1-cent increase to

$0.68 per share in January 2020, effective for the dividend payable April 1, 2020.

The  Corporation  is  subject  to  the  capital  adequacy  standards  under  the  Basel  III  regulatory  framework  (Basel  III).  This  regulatory  framework
establishes comprehensive methodologies for calculating regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets (RWA). Basel III also set minimum capital ratios as well
as overall capital adequacy standards.

Under  Basel  III,  regulatory  capital  comprises  common  equity  Tier  1  (CET1)  capital,  additional  Tier  1  capital  and  Tier  II  capital.  CET1  capital
predominantly  includes  common  shareholders'  equity,  less  certain  deductions  for  goodwill,  intangible  assets  and  deferred  tax  assets  that  arise  from  net
operating losses and tax credit carry-forwards. Additionally, the Corporation has elected to permanently exclude capital in accumulated other comprehensive
income (AOCI) related to debt and equity securities classified as available-for-sale as well as for cash flow hedges and defined benefit postretirement plans
from CET1, an option available to standardized approach entities under Basel III. Tier 1 capital incrementally includes noncumulative perpetual preferred
stock. Tier 2 capital includes Tier 1 capital as well as subordinated debt qualifying as Tier 2 and qualifying allowance for credit losses. In December 2018, the
federal  banking  regulators  adopted  rules  that  would  permit  bank  holding  companies  and  banks  to  phase  in,  for  regulatory  capital  purposes,  the  transition
impact on retained earnings of the new current expected credit loss accounting standard (CECL), effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2020, over a
period of three years. The Corporation does not anticipate to elect this deferral. The transition impact to retained earnings is not expected to be significant. For
further information about the adoption of CECL, refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statement.

The Corporation computes RWA using the standardized approach. Under the standardized approach, RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-
weightings which vary by counterparty type and asset class. Under the Basel III standardized approach, capital is required for credit risk RWA, to cover the
risk of unexpected losses due to failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its financial obligations in accordance with contractual terms; and if trading
assets and liabilities exceed certain thresholds, capital is also required for market risk RWA, to cover the risk of losses due to adverse market movements or
from position-specific factors.

The following table presents the minimum ratios required to be considered "adequately capitalized."

In addition to the minimum risk-based capital requirements, the Corporation is required to maintain a minimum capital conservation buffer in the form of common equity,
in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses.

RISK MANAGEMENT

The Corporation assumes various types of risk as a result of conducting business in the normal course. The Corporation's enterprise risk management
framework  provides  a  process  for  identifying,  measuring,  controlling  and  managing  these  risks.  This  framework  incorporates  a  risk  assessment  process,  a
collection of risk committees that manage the Corporation's major risk elements, and a risk appetite statement that outlines the levels and types of risks the
Corporation accepts. The Corporation continuously enhances its enterprise risk framework with additional processes, tools and systems designed to not only
provide  management  with  deeper  insight  into  the  various  existing  and  emerging  risks  in  accordance  with  its  appetite  for  risk,  but  also  to  improve  the
Corporation's ability to control those risks and ensure that appropriate consideration is received for the risks taken.

The Corporation’s front line employees, the first line of defense, are responsible for the day-to-day management of risks including the identification,
assessment, measurement and control of risks encountered as a part of the normal course of business. Risks are further monitored and measured by the second
line of defense, comprising specialized risk managers for each of the major risk categories, who reside in the Enterprise Risk Division and provide oversight,
independent and effective challenge and guidance for the risk management activities of the organization. The Enterprise Risk Division, led by the Chief Risk
Officer,  is  responsible  for  designing  and  managing  the  Corporation’s  enterprise  risk  management  framework  and  ensures  effective  risk  management
oversight. Risk management committees serve as a point of review and escalation for those risks which may have risk interdependencies or where risk levels
may be nearing the limits outlined in the Corporation’s risk appetite statement. These committees comprise senior and executive management that represent
views from both the lines of business and risk management. Internal Audit, the third line of defense, monitors and assesses the overall effectiveness of the risk
management framework on an ongoing basis and provides an independent, objective assessment of the Corporation’s ability to manage and control risk to
management and the Audit Committee of the Board.

The Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Committee, chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, is established by the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Board,
and  is  responsible  for  governance  over  the  risk  management  framework,  providing  oversight  in  managing  the  Corporation's  aggregate  risk  position  and
reporting on the comprehensive portfolio of risks as well as the potential impact these risks can have on the Corporation's risk profile and resulting capital
level.  Capital  provides  the  primary  buffer  for  risk.  The  Enterprise-Wide  Risk  Management  Committee  is  principally  composed  of  senior  officers  and
executives representing the different risk areas and business units who are appointed by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation.

The Board's Enterprise Risk Committee meets quarterly and is chartered to assist the Board in promoting the best interests of the Corporation by
overseeing policies and risk practices relating to enterprise-wide risk and ensuring compliance with bank regulatory obligations. Members of the Enterprise
Risk Committee are selected such that the committee comprises individuals whose experiences and qualifications can lead to broad and informed views on
risk matters facing the Corporation and the financial services industry. These include, but are not limited to, existing and emerging risk matters related to
credit,  market,  liquidity,  operational,  technology,  compliance  and  strategic  conditions.  A  comprehensive  risk  report  is  submitted  to  the  Enterprise  Risk
Committee each quarter providing management's view of the Corporation's aggregate risk position.

Further discussion and analyses of each major risk area are included in the following sub-sections of the Risk Management section in this financial

review.

Credit Risk

Credit risk represents the risk of loss due to failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its financial obligations in accordance with contractual
terms. Credit risk is found in all activities where success depends on counterparty, issuer, or borrower performance. It arises any time funds are extended,
committed,  invested  or  otherwise  exposed,  whether  reflected  on  or  off  the  balance  sheet.  The  governance  structure  is  administered  through  the  Strategic
Credit  Committee.  The  Strategic  Credit  Committee  is  chaired  by  the  Chief  Credit  Officer  and  approves  recommendations  to  address  credit  risk  matters
through  credit  policy,  credit  risk  management  practices  and  required  credit  risk  actions.  The  Strategic  Credit  Committee  also  ensures  a  comprehensive
reporting  of  credit  risk  levels  and  trends,  including  exception  levels,  along  with  identification  and  mitigation  of  emerging  risks.  In  order  to  facilitate  the
corporate  credit  risk  management  process,  various  other  corporate  functions  provide  the  resources  for  the  Strategic  Credit  Committee  to  carry  out  its
responsibilities.  The  Corporation  manages  credit  risk  through  underwriting  and  periodically  reviewing  and  approving  its  credit  exposures  using  approved
credit  policies  and  guidelines.  Additionally,  the  Corporation  manages  credit  risk  through  loan  portfolio  diversification,  limiting  exposure  to  any  single
industry, customer or guarantor, and selling participations and/or syndicating credit exposures above those levels it deems prudent to third parties.

The  Credit  Division  manages  credit  policy  and  provides  the  resources  to  manage  the  line  of  business  transactional  credit  risk,  assuring  that  all
exposure  is  risk  rated  according  to  the  requirements  of  the  credit  risk  rating  policy  and  providing  business  segment  reporting  support  as  necessary.  The
Enterprise  Risk  Division  provides  credible  and  well-documented  challenge  of  overall  portfolio  credit  risk,  and  other  credit-related  attributes  of  the
Corporation's  loan  portfolios,  with  a  particular  emphasis  on  all  attendant  modeled  results.  The  Corporation's  Asset  Quality  Review  function,  a  division  of
Internal Audit, audits the accuracy of internal risk ratings that are assigned by the lending and credit groups. The Special Assets Group is responsible for
managing the recovery process on distressed or defaulted loans and loan sales.

The allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The
allowance for loan losses represents management's assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the Corporation's loan portfolio. The allowance for
credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, provides for probable
losses  inherent  in  lending-related  commitments,  including  unused  commitments  to  extend  credit  and  standby  letters  of  credit.  On  January  1,  2020,  the
Corporation  adopted  a  new  accounting  standard  for  estimating  credit  losses  (CECL).  The  day-one  impact  to  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  was  not
significant. Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit
losses, as well as further information about the adoption of CECL, under the "Pending Accounting Pronouncements" section.

An analysis of the coverage of the allowance for loan losses is provided in the following table.

The allowance for loan losses was $637 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $671 million at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $34 million.

The decrease in the allowance for loan losses reflected continued strong credit quality, partially offset by an increase in Energy reserves.

(a) Allocated allowance as a percentage of related loans outstanding.
(b) Loans outstanding as a percentage of total loans.

The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain letters of
credit in a manner consistent with business loans, and allowances based on the pool of the remaining letters of credit and all unused commitments to extend
credit within each internal risk rating.

The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $31 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $30 million at December 31,

2018. An analysis of changes in the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is presented below.

Nonperforming Assets

Nonperforming  assets  include  loans  on  nonaccrual  status,  troubled  debt  restructured  loans  (TDRs)  which  have  been  renegotiated  to  less  than  the
original contractual rates (reduced-rate loans) and foreclosed property. TDRs include performing and nonperforming loans. Nonperforming TDRs are either
on nonaccrual or reduced-rate status.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Concentrations of credit risk may exist when a number of borrowers are engaged in similar activities, or activities in the same geographic region, and
have  similar  economic  characteristics  that  would  cause  them  to  be  similarly  impacted  by  changes  in  economic  or  other  conditions.  The  Corporation  has
concentrations  of  credit  risk  with  the  automotive  and  commercial  real  estate  industries.  All  other  industry  concentrations,  as  defined  by  management,
individually represented less than 10 percent of total loans at December 31, 2019.

Substantially all dealer loans are in the National Dealer Services business line. Loans in the National Dealer Services business line primarily include
floor plan financing and other loans to automotive dealerships. Floor plan loans, included in commercial loans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, totaled
$4.0 billion at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $711 million compared to $4.7 billion at December 31, 2018. At both December 31, 2019 and 2018, other
loans  in  the  National  Dealer  Services  business  line  totaled  $3.4 billion,  including  $2.0 billion  of  owner-occupied  commercial  real  estate  mortgage  loans.
Automotive lending also includes loans to borrowers involved with automotive production, primarily Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers. Loans to borrowers involved
with automotive production totaled $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.

Dealer loans, as shown in the table above, totaled $7.4 billion at December 31, 2019, of which $4.3 billion, or 61 percent, were to foreign franchises,
and $2.0 billion, or 28 percent, were to domestic franchises. The remaining dealer loans include obligations where a primary franchise was indeterminable,
such as loans to large public dealership consolidators and rental car, leasing, heavy truck and recreation vehicle companies.

There were $19 million of nonaccrual loans to automotive borrowers at December 31, 2019 and $4 million at December 31, 2018. Automotive loan

The Corporation limits risk inherent in its commercial real estate lending activities by monitoring borrowers directly involved in the commercial real
estate markets and adhering to conservative policies on loan-to-value ratios for such loans. Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction
and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $13.0 billion at December 31, 2019. Of the total, $5.2 billion, or 40 percent, were to borrowers in the Commercial
Real Estate business line, which includes loans to real estate developers, an increase of $790 million compared to December 31, 2018. Commercial real estate
loans  in  other  business  lines  totaled  $7.8  billion,  or  60  percent,  at  December  31,  2019.  These  loans  consisted  primarily  of  owner-occupied  commercial
mortgages, which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans.

The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-time customers with satisfactory completion experience. Criticized
real estate construction loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $31 million and $23 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
In other business lines, there were no criticized real estate construction loans at December 31, 2019, compared to $8 million at December 31, 2018.  There
were no net charge-offs in either of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Commercial mortgage loans are loans where the primary collateral is a lien on any real property and are primarily loans secured by owner occupied
real estate. Real property is generally considered primary collateral if the value of that collateral represents more than 50 percent of the commitment at loan
approval. Loans in the commercial mortgage portfolio generally mature within three to five years. Criticized commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial
Real  Estate  business  line  totaled  $55 million  and  $61 million  at  December  31,  2019  and  December  31,  2018,  respectively.  In  other  business  lines,  $242
million  and  $206  million  of  commercial  mortgage  loans  were  criticized  at  December  31,  2019  and  2018,  respectively.  Commercial  mortgage  loans  net
recoveries were $1 million in 2019, compared to net charge-offs of $1 million in 2018.

For further information regarding significant group concentrations of credit risk, refer to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.

Residential  real  estate  loans,  which  consist  of  traditional  residential  mortgages  and  home  equity  loans  and  lines  of  credit,  totaled  $3.6  billion  at
December  31,  2019.  The  residential  real  estate  portfolio  is  principally  located  within  the  Corporation's  primary  geographic  markets.  Substantially  all
residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more are placed on nonaccrual status, and substantially all junior lien home equity loans that are current or
less than 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual status if full collection of the senior position is in doubt. At no later than 180 days past due, such loans are
charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell.

Residential  mortgages  totaled  $1.8 billion  at  December  31,  2019,  and  were  primarily  larger,  variable-rate  mortgages  originated  and  retained  for
certain  private  banking  relationship  customers.  Of  the  $1.8  billion  of  residential  mortgage  loans  outstanding,  $20  million  were  on  nonaccrual  status  at
December 31, 2019. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.7 billion at December 31, 2019, of which $1.6 billion was outstanding under primarily variable-
rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit, $89 million were in amortizing status and $23 million were closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.7 billion
of home equity loans outstanding, $17 million were on nonaccrual status at December  31,  2019.  A  majority  of  the  home  equity  portfolio  was  secured  by
junior liens at December 31, 2019.

Energy Lending

The Corporation has a portfolio of Energy loans that are included entirely in commercial loans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Customers in the
Corporation's Energy business line (approximately 150 relationships) are engaged in three segments of the oil and gas business: exploration and production
(E&P),  midstream  and  energy  services.  E&P  generally  includes  such  activities  as  searching  for  potential  oil  and  gas  fields,  drilling  exploratory  wells  and
operating active wells. Commitments to E&P borrowers are generally subject to semi-annual borrowing base re-determinations based on a variety of factors
including updated prices (reflecting market and competitive conditions), energy reserve levels and the impact of hedging. The midstream sector is generally
involved  in  the  transportation,  storage  and  marketing  of  crude  and/or  refined  oil  and  gas  products.  The  Corporation's  energy  services  customers  provide
products and services primarily to the E&P segment.

Loans in the Energy business line totaled $2.2 billion, or approximately 4 percent of total loans, at December 31, 2019, an increase of $58 million.
Total  exposure,  including  unused  commitments  to  extend  credit  and  letters  of  credit,  was  $4.3  billion  and  $4.5  billion  at  December  31,  2019  and
December 31, 2018, respectively.

The  Corporation's  allowance  methodology  considers  the  various  risk  elements  within  the  loan  portfolio.  When  merited,  the  Corporation  may
incorporate a qualitative reserve component for Energy loans. There were $86 million and $6 million in net credit-related charge-offs in the Energy business
line  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2019  and  2018,  respectively.  Criticized  loans  increased  $161 million  to  $366  million  at  December  31,  2019.  The
increase in net charge-offs and criticized loans resulted from the impact of a decline in valuations of select liquidating assets due to tight capital markets in the
industry.

Leveraged Loans

Certain  loans  in  the  Corporation's  commercial  portfolio  are  considered  leveraged  transactions.  These  loans  are  typically  used  for  mergers,
acquisitions,  business  recapitalizations,  refinancing  and  equity  buyouts.  To  help  mitigate  the  risk  associated  with  these  loans,  the  Corporation  focuses  on
middle  market  companies  with  highly  capable  management  teams,  strong  sponsors  and  solid  track  records  of  financial  performance.  Industries  prone  to
cyclical downturns and acquisitions with a high degree of integration risk are generally avoided. Other considerations include the sufficiency of collateral, the
level  of  balance  sheet  leverage  and  the  adequacy  of  financial  covenants.  During  the  underwriting  process,  cash  flows  are  stress  tested  to  evaluate  the
borrowers' abilities to handle economic downturns and an increase in interest rates.

The FDIC defines higher-risk commercial and industrial (HR C&I) loans for assessment purposes as loans generally with leverage of four times total
debt to earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation (EBITDA) as well as three times senior debt to EBITDA, excluding certain collateralized loans. HR
C&I loans were $2.6 billion and $2.5 billion at December  31,  2019  and  2018,  respectively.  Criticized  loans  within  the  HR  C&I  loan  portfolio  were  $169
million and $147 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Charge-offs of HR C&I loans totaled $6 million in 2019 and $15 million in 2018.

International Exposure

International assets are subject to general risks inherent in the conduct of business in countries, including economic uncertainties and each foreign
government's regulations. Risk management practices minimize the risk inherent in international lending arrangements. These practices include structuring
bilateral  agreements  or  participating  in  bank  facilities,  which  secure  repayment  from  sources  external  to  the  borrower's  country.  Accordingly,  such
international outstandings are excluded from the cross-border risk of that country.

There  were  no  countries  with  cross-border  outstandings  exceeding  0.75  percent  of  total  assets  at  December  31,  2019,  2018  and  2017.  The
Corporation's international strategy is to focus on international companies doing business in North America, with an emphasis on the Corporation's primary
geographic markets.

Market and Liquidity Risk

Market risk represents the risk of loss due to adverse movement in prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and
equity prices. Liquidity risk represents the risk that the Corporation does not have sufficient access to funds to maintain its normal operations at all times, or
does not have the ability to raise or borrow funds at a reasonable cost at all times.

The  Asset  and  Liability  Policy  Committee  (ALCO)  of  the  Corporation  establishes  and  monitors  compliance  with  the  policies  and  risk  limits
pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities. ALCO meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies,
and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the Corporation, including treasury, finance, economics, lending, deposit gathering
and  risk  management.  Corporate  Treasury  mitigates  market  and  liquidity  risk  under  the  direction  of  ALCO  through  the  actions  it  takes  to  manage  the
Corporation's market, liquidity and capital positions.

In addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis, Corporate Treasury also monitors the parent company's liquidity and has established
limits for the minimum number of months into the future in which the parent company can meet existing and forecasted obligations without the support of
additional dividends from subsidiaries. ALCO's liquidity policy requires the parent company to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet expected capital and debt
obligations with a target of 24 months but no less than 18 months.

Corporate Treasury and the Enterprise Risk Division support ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other
market risks. Key activities encompass: (i) providing information and analyses of the Corporation's balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate
and all other market risks; (ii) monitoring and reporting of the Corporation's positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines; (iii) developing and
presenting  analyses  and  strategies  to  adjust  risk  positions;  (iv)  reviewing  and  presenting  policies  and  authorizations  for  approval;  and  (v)  monitoring  of
industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks.

Interest Rate Risk

Net interest income is the primary source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences
in  the  repricing  and  cash  flow  characteristics  of  assets  and  liabilities,  primarily  through  the  Corporation's  core  business  activities  of  extending  loans  and
acquiring deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by core deposits. Including the impact of
interest rate swaps converting floating-rate loans to fixed, the Corporation's loan composition at December 31, 2019 was 62 percent 30-day LIBOR, 6 percent
other LIBOR (primarily 60-day), 14 percent prime and 18 percent fixed rate. This creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between
the  faster  repricing  of  the  floating-rate  loan  portfolio  versus  deposit  products.  In  addition,  the  growth  and/or  contraction  in  the  Corporation's  loans  and
deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing fixed-rate
investment securities, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity, as well as hedging with interest rate
swaps and options. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the
economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.

Since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives, a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk. These
techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios, including
changes  in  the  level,  slope  and  shape  of  the  yield  curve  utilizing  multiple  simulation  analyses.  Simulation  analyses  produce  only  estimates  of  net  interest
income as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors, including, but not limited to,
the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, regulatory impacts and management strategies.

Sensitivity of Net Interest Income to Changes in Interest Rates

The analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is management's principal risk
management technique. Management models a base case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment. Existing derivative instruments
entered into for risk management purposes as of the balance sheet dates

F-28

Table of Contents

are included in the analysis, but no additional hedging is forecasted. At December 31, 2019, these derivative instruments comprise interest rate swaps that
convert $3.3 billion of fixed-rate medium- and long-term debt to variable rates through fair value hedges and convert $4.6 billion of variable-rate loans to
fixed rates through cash flow hedges. This base case net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which rates rise or decline 100
basis points in a linear, non-parallel fashion from the base case over 12 months, resulting in an average increase or decrease in short-term interest rates of 50
basis points over the period.

Each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth, investment security prepayment levels, depositor behavior, yield curve changes, loan and
deposit  pricing,  and  overall  balance  sheet  mix  and  growth.  In  this  low  rate  environment,  depositors  have  maintained  a  higher  level  of  liquidity  and  their
historical behavior may be less indicative of future trends. As a result, the rising rate scenario reflects a greater decrease in deposits than we have experienced
historically as rates rise. Changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure
that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis.

The table below, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the

base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above.

Sensitivity to declining interest rates decreased from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 due to the impact of swaps converting variable-rate
loans  to  fixed  rates.  Sensitivity  to  rising  interest  rates  increased  due  to  changes  in  balance  sheet  composition,  partially  offset  by  the  addition  of  swaps
converting variable-rate loans to fixed rates.

During January 2020, the Corporation added interest rate swaps that convert an additional $1 billion of variable-rate loans to fixed rates through cash

flow hedges. These additional hedges are not included in the sensitivity analysis discussed above.

Sensitivity of Economic Value of Equity to Changes in Interest Rates

In addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income, an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate
risk position. The economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the Corporation's financial assets, liabilities and
off-balance sheet instruments, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period, and the estimated economic value after
applying the estimated impact of rate movements. The Corporation primarily monitors the percentage change on the base case economic value of equity. The
economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel 100 basis point shock.

The table below, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario

described above.

The  sensitivity  of  the  economic  value  of  equity  to  rising  and  declining  rates  increased  from  December  31,  2018  and  December  31,  2019  due  to

changes in expected deposit lives and balance sheet composition, partially offset by the addition of swaps converting variable-rate loans to fixed rate.

LIBOR Transition

On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading
or  compelling  banks  to  submit  LIBOR  rates  after  2021.  The  Corporation  has  substantial  exposure  to  LIBOR-based  products,  including  loans,  securities,
derivatives and hedges, and is preparing for a transition from LIBOR toward alternative rates. A dedicated program office and governance structure has been
established,  with  direction  and  oversight  from  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  Interim  Chief  Financial  Officer  and  Chief  Risk  Officer.  A  cross-functional
implementation team tasked with execution of the LIBOR transition plan is responsible for evaluating alternative rates and associated impacts, assessing the
population of impacted contracts and ensuring necessary fallback provisions are incorporated, ensuring operational readiness and communicating timely with
internal and external stakeholders. Additionally, the Corporation continues to monitor market developments and regulatory updates, as well as collaborate
with regulators and industry groups on the transition. For a discussion

The Corporation uses investment securities and derivative instruments as asset and liability management tools with the overall objective of managing
the  volatility  of  net  interest  income  from  changes  in  interest  rates.  These  tools  assist  management  in  achieving  the  desired  interest  rate  risk  management
objectives. Activity related to derivative instruments currently involves interest rate swaps effectively converting fixed-rate medium- and long-term debt to a
floating rate as well as variable rate loans to a fixed rate.

The  notional  amount  of  risk  management  interest  rate  swaps  totaled  $7.9 billion  at  December  31,  2019,  and  $2.6 billion  at  December  31,  2018,
which included fair value hedging strategies that convert $3.3 billion of fixed-rate medium- and long-term debt to a floating rate as well as cash flow hedging
strategies that convert $4.6 billion  of  variable-rate  loans  to  a  fixed  rate.  Risk  management  interest  rate  swaps  generated  $4 million  and  $7 million  of  net
interest income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

In addition to interest rate swaps, the Corporation employs various other types of derivative instruments as offsetting positions to mitigate exposures
to foreign currency risks associated with specific assets and liabilities (e.g., customer loans or deposits denominated in foreign currencies). Such instruments
may include foreign exchange spot and forward contracts as well as foreign exchange swap agreements.

Further information regarding risk management derivative instruments is provided in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

The Corporation sells and purchases interest rate caps and floors and enters into foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and energy derivative
contracts  to  accommodate  the  needs  of  customers  requesting  such  services.  Changes  in  the  fair  value  of  customer-initiated  and  other  derivatives  are
recognized in earnings as they occur. To limit the market risk of these activities, the Corporation generally takes offsetting positions with dealers. The notional
amounts of offsetting positions are included in the table above. Customer-initiated and other notional activity represented 73 percent and 86 percent of total
interest rate, energy and foreign exchange contracts at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Further information regarding customer-initiated and other derivative instruments is provided in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

Liquidity Risk and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Liquidity is the ability to meet financial obligations through the maturity or sale of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds. Various
financial  obligations,  including  contractual  obligations  and  commercial  commitments,  may  require  future  cash  payments  by  the  Corporation.  Certain
obligations are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, while others are off-balance sheet under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

The  following  contractual  obligations  table  summarizes  the  Corporation's  noncancelable  contractual  obligations  and  future  required  minimum

payments. Refer to Notes 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these contractual obligations.

Wholesale Funding

The  Corporation  may  access  the  purchased  funds  market  when  necessary,  which  includes  a  variety  of  funding  sources.  Capacity  for  incremental
purchased  funds  at  December  31,  2019  included  short-term  FHLB  advances,  the  ability  to  purchase  federal  funds,  sell  securities  under  agreements  to
repurchase,  as  well  as  issue  deposits  through  brokers.  Purchased  funds  increased  to  $295  million  at  December  31,  2019,  compared  to  $52  million  at
December 31, 2018, primarily reflecting a $133 million increase in brokered deposits included in other time deposits on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At
December 31, 2019, the Bank had pledged loans totaling $22.0 billion which provided for up to $17.8 billion of available collateralized borrowing with the
FRB.

The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Dallas, Texas, which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized
by real estate-related assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. At December 31, 2019,
$17.2 billion of real estate-related loans were pledged to the FHLB as collateral for current and potential future borrowings. The Corporation had $3.8 billion
of outstanding borrowings maturing between 2026 and 2028 and capacity for potential future borrowings of approximately $5.1 billion.

Additionally, the Bank had the ability to issue up to $13.5 billion of debt at December 31, 2019 under an existing $15.0 billion note program which
allows  the  issuance  of  debt  with  maturities  between  three  months  and  30  years.  The  Corporation  also  maintains  a  shelf  registration  statement  with  the
Securities and Exchange Commission from which it may issue debt and equity securities.

The ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise funds at competitive rates is impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity,
capital and earnings of the Corporation and the Bank. As of December 31, 2019, the three major rating agencies had assigned the following ratings to long-
term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be
subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

The Corporation satisfies liquidity needs with either liquid assets or various funding sources. Liquid assets totaled $17.9 billion  at  December 31,
2019, compared to $16.3 billion at December  31,  2018.  Liquid  assets  include  cash  and  due  from  banks,  federal  funds  sold,  interest-bearing  deposits  with
banks, other short-term investments and unencumbered investment securities.

The Corporation performs monthly liquidity stress testing to evaluate its ability to meet funding needs in hypothetical stressed environments. Such
environments cover a series of broad events, distinguished in terms of duration and severity. The evaluation as of December 31, 2019 projected that sufficient
sources of liquidity were available under each series of events.

Other Market Risks

Market  risk  related  to  the  Corporation's  trading  instruments  is  not  significant,  as  trading  activities  are  limited.  Certain  components  of  the
Corporation's noninterest income, primarily fiduciary income, are at risk to fluctuations in the market values of underlying assets, particularly equity and debt
securities. Other components of noninterest income, primarily brokerage fees, are at risk to changes in the volume of market activity.

Operational Risk

Operational risk represents the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and people, or from external events, excluding in
most cases those driven by technology (see Technology Risk below). The Corporation's definition of operational risk includes fraud; employment practice and
workplace safety; clients, products and business practice; business continuity or disaster recovery; execution, delivery, and process management; third party
and  model  risks.  The  definition  does  not  include  strategic  or  reputational  risks.  Although  operational  losses  are  experienced  by  all  companies  and  are
routinely incurred in business operations, the Corporation recognizes the need to identify and control operational losses and seeks to limit losses to a level
deemed appropriate by management, as outlined in the Corporation’s risk appetite statement. The appropriate risk level is determined through consideration
of the nature of the Corporation's business and the environment in which it operates, in combination with the impact from, and the possible impact on, other
risks faced by the Corporation. Operational risk is mitigated through a system of internal controls that are designed to keep operating risks at appropriate
levels. The Operational Risk Management Committee monitors risk management techniques and systems. The Corporation has developed a framework that
includes a centralized operational risk management function in the Enterprise Risk Division and business/support unit risk liaisons responsible for managing
operational risk specific to the respective business lines.

Technology Risk

Technology risk represents the risk of loss or adverse outcomes arising from the people, processes, applications and infrastructure that support the
technology environment. The Corporation's definition of technology risk includes technology delivery risk, technology investment risk, cybersecurity risk,
information security risk and information management risk. Technology risk is inclusive of the risks associated with the execution of technology processes
and activities by third-party contractors and suppliers to the Corporation. Other risk types may materialize in the event of a technology risk event, such as the
risk of a financial reporting error or regulatory non-compliance, and the impact of such risks are highly interdependent with operational risk.

The  Technology  Risk  Management  Committee,  comprising  senior  and  executive  business  unit  managers,  as  well  as  managers  responsible  for
technology, cybersecurity, information security and enterprise risk management, oversees technology risk. The Technology Risk Management Committee also
ensures that appropriate actions are implemented in business units to mitigate risk to an acceptable level.

Compliance Risk

Compliance  risk  represents  the  risk  of  sanctions  or  financial  loss  resulting  from  the  Corporation's  failure  to  comply  with  all  applicable  laws,
regulations  and  standards  of  good  banking  practice.  The  impact  of  such  risks  is  highly  interdependent  with  strategic  risk,  as  the  reputational  impact  from
compliance breaches can be severe. Activities which may expose the Corporation to compliance risk include, but are not limited to, those dealing with the
prevention  of  money  laundering,  privacy  and  data  protection,  community  reinvestment  initiatives,  fair  lending,  consumer  protection,  employment  and  tax
matters, over-the-counter derivative activities and other regulated activities.

The  Enterprise-Wide  Compliance  Committee,  comprising  senior  and  executive  business  unit  managers,  as  well  as  managers  responsible  for
compliance, audit and overall risk, oversees compliance risk. This enterprise-wide approach provides a consistent view of compliance across the organization.
The Enterprise-Wide Compliance Committee also ensures that appropriate actions are implemented in business units to mitigate risk to an acceptable level.

Strategic Risk

Strategic  risk  represents  the  risk  of  inadequate  returns  or  possible  losses  due  to  impairment  of  reputation,  failure  to  fully  develop  and  execute
business  plans,  failure  to  assess  current  and  new  opportunities  in  business,  markets  and  products,  failure  to  determine  appropriate  consideration  for  risks
accepted,  and  any  other  event  not  identified  in  the  defined  risk  categories  of  credit,  market  and  liquidity,  operational,  technology  or  compliance  risks.
Mitigation  of  the  various  risk  elements  that  represent  strategic  risk  is  achieved  through  various  metrics  and  initiatives  to  help  the  Corporation  better
understand, measure and report on such risks.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Corporation’s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are
described in Note 1. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations.
Changes  in  underlying  factors,  assumptions  or  estimates  could  have  a  material  impact  on  the  Corporation’s  future  financial  condition  and  results  of
operations. At December 31, 2019, the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to the allowance for credit losses, fair
value measurement, goodwill, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These policies were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation’s Board
of Directors and are discussed more fully below.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

The  allowance  for  credit  losses,  which  includes  both  the  allowance  for  loan  losses  and  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  on  lending-related
commitments,  is  calculated  with  the  objective  of  maintaining  a  reserve  sufficient  to  absorb  estimated  probable  losses.  Management's  determination  of  the
appropriateness  of  the  allowance  is  based  on  periodic  evaluations  of  the  loan  portfolio,  lending-related  commitments  and  other  relevant  factors.  This
evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires numerous estimates, including the loss content for internal risk ratings, collateral values, the amounts and
timing  of  expected  future  cash  flows,  and  for  lending-related  commitments,  estimates  of  the  probability  of  draw  on  unused  commitments.  In  addition,
management exercises judgment to adjust or supplement modeled estimates for factors not otherwise fully accounted for, such as the risks and uncertainties
observed in current market conditions, portfolio developments and other imprecision factors.

In determining the allowance for credit losses, the Corporation individually evaluates certain impaired loans, applies standard reserve factors to pools
of  homogeneous  loans  and  lending-related  commitments  and  incorporates  qualitative  adjustments.  Standard  loss  factors,  applied  to  the  majority  of  the
Corporation's  loan  portfolio  and  lending-related  commitments,  are  based  on  estimates  of  probabilities  of  default  for  individual  risk  ratings  over  the  loss
emergence period and loss given default. Loss emergence periods are used to determine the most appropriate default horizon associated with the calculation
of probabilities of default. Changes to one or more of the estimates used to develop standard loss factors, or the use of different estimates, would result in a
different estimated allowance for credit losses. To illustrate, if recent loss experience dictated that the estimated standard loss factors would be changed by
five percent of the estimate across all loan risk ratings, the allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2019 would change by approximately $28 million.

Because standard loss factors are applied to pools of loans based on the Corporation's internal risk rating system, loss estimates are highly dependent
on  the  accuracy  of  the  risk  rating  assigned  to  each  loan.  The  inherent  imprecision  in  the  risk  rating  system  resulting  from  inaccuracy  in  assigning  and/or
entering  risk  ratings  in  the  loan  accounting  system  is  monitored  by  the  Corporation's  asset  quality  review  function  and  incorporated  in  a  qualitative
adjustment. The Corporation may also include qualitative adjustments intended to capture the impact of certain other uncertainties that exist but are not yet
reflected  in  the  standard  reserve  factors.  These  qualitative  adjustments  are  based  on  management’s  analysis  of  factors  such  as  portfolios  where  recent
historical  losses  exceed  expected  losses  or  known  recent  events  are  expected  to  alter  risk  ratings  once  evidence  is  acquired,  observable  macroeconomic
metrics, including consideration of regional metrics within the Corporation's footprint, and a qualitative assessment of the lending environment, including
underwriting  standards,  current  economic  and  political  conditions,  and  other  factors  affecting  credit  quality.  Qualitative  reserves  at  December  31,  2019
primarily  included  components  for  portfolios  where  recent  loss  trends  were  in  excess  of  estimated  losses  based  on  overall  portfolio  standard  loss  factors,
model imprecision and changes in market conditions compared to the conditions that existed at the date of the most recent annual update to standard reserve
factors.

For further discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses, refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements.  To  the  extent  actual  outcomes  differ  from  management  estimates,  additional  provision  for  credit  losses  may  be  required  that  would  adversely
impact earnings in future periods. The allowance is assigned to business segments and any earnings impact resulting from actual outcomes differing from
management estimates would primarily affect the Business Bank segment.

On January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted a new accounting standard for estimating credit losses (CECL). For additional information about the

adoption of CECL, refer to the "Pending Accounting Pronouncements" section of Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

Investment securities available-for-sale, derivatives and deferred compensation plan assets and associated liabilities are recorded at fair value on a
recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, other assets and liabilities may be recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, such as impaired loans that
have been reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, other real estate (primarily foreclosed property), nonmarketable equity securities and
certain other assets and liabilities. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve write-downs of individual assets or application of lower of cost
or fair value accounting.

F-34

Table of Contents

Fair value is an estimate of the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction (i.e., not a
forced  transaction,  such  as  a  liquidation  or  distressed  sale)  between  market  participants  at  the  measurement  date  and  is  based  on  the  assumptions  market
participants would use when pricing an asset or liability. Fair value measurement and disclosure guidance establishes a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of
assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. Notes 1 and 2  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  includes  information  about  the  fair  value  hierarchy,  the
extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities, as well as the valuation methodologies and key inputs used.

At December 31, 2019, assets and liabilities measured using observable inputs that are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 represented 99.3 percent and
100  percent  of  total  assets  and  liabilities  recorded  at  fair  value,  respectively.  Valuations  generated  from  model-based  techniques  that  use  at  least  one
significant assumption not observable in the market are considered Level 3 and reflect estimates of assumptions market participants would use in pricing the
asset or liability.

GOODWILL

Goodwill  is  initially  recorded  as  the  excess  of  the  purchase  price  over  the  fair  value  of  net  assets  acquired  in  a  business  combination  and  is
subsequently  evaluated  at  least  annually  for  impairment.  The  Corporation  may  elect  to  perform  a  quantitative  impairment  analysis,  or  first  conduct  a
qualitative analysis to determine if a quantitative analysis is necessary. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level, equivalent to a
business  segment  or  one  level  below.  The  Corporation  has  three  reporting  units:  the  Business  Bank,  the  Retail  Bank  and  Wealth  Management.  At
December 31, 2019, goodwill totaled $635 million, including $473 million allocated to the Business Bank, $101 million allocated to the Retail Bank and $61
million allocated to Wealth Management.

The  annual  test  of  goodwill  impairment  was  performed  as  of  the  beginning  of  the  third  quarter  2019.  The  Corporation  first  assessed  qualitative
factors  to  determine  whether  it  was  more  likely  than  not  that  the  fair  value  of  any  reporting  unit  was  less  than  its  carrying  amount,  including  goodwill.
Qualitative factors included economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, regulatory developments
and performance of the Corporation’s stock, among other events and circumstances. At the conclusion of the qualitative assessment in the third quarter 2019,
the Corporation determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.

Qualitative  factors  considered  in  the  analysis  of  each  reporting  unit  incorporated  current  economic  and  market  conditions,  including  the  recent
Federal  Reserve  announcements  and  the  impact  of  legislative  and  regulatory  changes,  to  the  extent  known.  However,  further  weakening  in  the  economic
environment, such as continued declines in interest rates, a decline in the performance of the reporting units or other factors could cause the fair value of one
or more of the reporting units to fall below their carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Additionally, new legislative or regulatory changes
not anticipated in management's expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value, resulting in a
goodwill impairment charge. Any impairment charge would not affect the Corporation's regulatory capital ratios, tangible common equity ratio or liquidity
position.

PENSION PLAN ACCOUNTING

The  Corporation  has  a  qualified  and  non-qualified  defined  benefit  pension  plan.  Effective  January  1,  2017,  benefits  are  calculated  using  a  cash
balance  formula  based  on  years  of  service,  age,  compensation  and  an  interest  credit  based  on  the  30-year  Treasury  rate.  Participants  under  age  60  as  of
December 31, 2016 are eligible to receive a frozen final average pay benefit in addition to amounts earned under the cash balance formula. Participants age 60
or older as of December 31, 2016 continue to be eligible for a final average pay benefit. The Corporation makes assumptions concerning future events that
will determine the amount and timing of required benefit payments, funding requirements and defined benefit pension expense. The major assumptions are
the discount rate used in determining the current benefit obligation, the long-term rate of return expected on plan assets, mix of assets within the portfolio and
the projected mortality rate.

The discount rate is determined by matching the expected cash flows of the pension plans to a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds as of the
measurement date, December 31. The long-term rate of return expected on plan assets is set after considering both long-term returns in the general market and
long-term returns experienced by the assets in the plan. The current target asset allocation model for the plans is provided in Note 17 to the consolidated
financial statements. The expected returns on these various asset categories are blended to derive one long-term return assumption. The assets are invested in
certain collective investment funds, common stocks, U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government agency securities, as well as corporate and municipal bonds
and  notes.  Mortality  rate  assumptions  are  based  on  mortality  tables  published  by  third-parties  such  as  the  Society  of  Actuaries  (SOA),  considering  other
available information including historical data as well as studies and publications from reputable sources.

The Corporation reviews its pension plan assumptions on an annual basis with its actuarial consultants to determine if the assumptions are reasonable
and adjusts the assumptions to reflect changes in future expectations. The major assumptions used to calculate 2020 defined benefit plan pension expense
(benefit) were as follows:

Defined benefit plan expense is expected to decrease $7 million to a benefit of approximately $22 million in 2020,  compared  to  a  benefit  of  $29

million in 2019. This includes service cost expense of $35 million and a benefit from other components of $57 million.

Changing the 2020 discount rate and long-term rate of return by 25 basis points would impact defined benefit expense in 2020 by $7.6 million and

$6.6 million, respectively.

Due  to  the  long-term  nature  of  pension  plan  assumptions,  actual  results  may  differ  significantly  from  the  actuarial-based  estimates.  Differences
resulting in actuarial gains or losses are required to be recorded in shareholders' equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss and amortized to
defined benefit pension expense in future years. Refer to Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.

INCOME TAXES

The calculation of the Corporation's income tax provision and tax-related accruals is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments. The
provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes due for the current year and deferred taxes. Deferred taxes arise from temporary differences between
the income tax basis and financial accounting basis of assets and liabilities. Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from
taxing  jurisdictions,  currently  or  in  the  future,  and  are  included  in  accrued  income  and  other  assets  or  accrued  expenses  and  other  liabilities  on  the
Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  The  Corporation  assesses  the  relative  risks  and  merits  of  tax  positions  for  various  transactions  after  considering  statutes,
regulations, judicial precedent and other available information and maintains tax accruals consistent with these assessments. The Corporation is subject to
audit by taxing authorities that could question and/or challenge the tax positions taken by the Corporation.

Included in net deferred taxes are deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for realization based on available evidence of projected future
reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, assumptions made regarding future events and, when applicable, state loss carryback capacity. A valuation
allowance is provided when it is more-likely-than-not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur due to changes in tax law, interpretations of existing tax laws, new judicial or regulatory guidance,
and  the  status  of  examinations  conducted  by  taxing  authorities  that  impact  the  relative  risks  and  merits  of  tax  positions  taken  by  the  Corporation.  These
changes, when they occur, impact the estimate of accrued taxes and could be significant to the operating results of the Corporation. For further information on
tax accruals and related risks, see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.

The tangible common equity ratio removes the effect of intangible assets from capital and total assets. Tangible common equity per share of common
stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders' equity per share of common stock. The Corporation believes these measurements are
meaningful measures of capital adequacy used by investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and to compare
against other companies in the industry.
