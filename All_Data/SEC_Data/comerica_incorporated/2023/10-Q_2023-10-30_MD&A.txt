Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include credit risks (changes in customer behavior; unfavorable developments concerning credit quality; and declines or other changes in the businesses or industries of the Corporation's customers); market risks (changes in monetary and fiscal policies; fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on deposit pricing; and transitions away from LIBOR towards new interest rate benchmarks); liquidity risks (the Corporation's ability to maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity; reductions in the Corporation's credit rating; and the interdependence of financial service companies); technology risks (cybersecurity risks and heightened legislative and regulatory focus on cybersecurity and data privacy); operational risks (operational, systems or infrastructure failures; reliance on other companies to provide certain key components of business infrastructure; the impact of legal and regulatory proceedings or determinations; losses due to fraud; and controls and procedures failures); compliance risks (changes in regulation or oversight, or changes in the Corporation&#8217;s status with respect to existing regulations or oversight; the effects of stringent capital requirements; and the impacts of future legislative, administrative or judicial changes to tax regulations); strategic risks (damage to the Corporation's reputation; the Corporation's ability to utilize technology to efficiently and effectively develop, market and deliver new products and services; competitive product and pricing pressures among financial institutions within the Corporation's markets; the implementation of the Corporation's strategies and business initiatives; management's ability to maintain and expand customer relationships; management's ability to retain key officers and employees; and any future strategic acquisitions or divestitures); and other general risks (changes in general economic, political or industry conditions; negative effects from inflation; the effectiveness of methods of reducing risk exposures; the effects of catastrophic events, including pandemics; physical or transition risks related to climate change; changes in accounting standards; the critical nature of the Corporation's accounting policies; and the volatility of the Corporation's stock price). The Corporation cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not all-inclusive. For discussion of factors that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In particular, please refer to &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; beginning on page 13 of the Corporation's 2022 Annual Report and "Item 1A. Risk Factors" beginning on page 64 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

In accordance with Item 303(c) of Regulation S-K, the Corporation is providing a comparison of the quarter ended September 30, 2023 against the preceding sequential quarter. The Corporation believes providing a sequential discussion of its results of operations provides more relevant information for investors and stakeholders to understand and analyze the business. Balance sheet items are discussed in terms of average balances unless otherwise noted. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 

Three Months Ended (dollar amounts in millions, except per share data) September 30, 2023 June 30, 2023 Net interest income $ 601 $ 621 Provision for credit losses 14 33 Noninterest income 295 303 Noninterest expenses 555 535 Income before income taxes 327 356 Provision for income taxes 76 83 Net income $ 251 $ 273 Diluted earnings per common share $ 1.84 $ 2.01 

Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was $251 million, a decrease of $22 million compared to $273 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, driven by a decrease of $20 million in net interest income and a $20 million increase in noninterest expenses, partially offset by a $19 million decline in provision for credit losses. Net income per diluted common share was $1.84 and $2.01 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively, a decrease of $0.17 per diluted common share. 

To enhance the Corporation's core business focus, management is taking strategic actions to prioritize relationships that are most aligned with its strategy by considering price and return profiles, deposit contributions, the nature of relationships and geography. As part of this focus, the Corporation is organically exiting the Mortgage Banker Finance business, which is expected to be largely complete by year-end 2023. Additionally, the Corporation is increasing selectivity in other lines of business while accelerating certain initiatives related to Payments, Small Business, Wealth Management and Capital Markets, which is intended to help elevate products and services tailored to meet customers' needs as well as enhance the Corporation's funding profile, revenue mix and return on capital.

(a) Impact of additional days, other portfolio dynamics and interest rate swaps reflected as part of rate impact, rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume. 

Net interest income decreased $20 million to $601 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $621 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income reflected an increase of $3.1 billion in interest-bearing deposits and a $1.4 billion decline in loan balances, partially offset by a reduction of $2.4 billion in borrowings (primarily FHLB advances and senior debt) as well as a $1.0 billion increase in deposits held with the Federal Reserve Bank. Net interest margin was 2.84 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 9 basis points from 2.93 percent for the three months ended June 30, 2023, mostly reflecting higher-cost funding sources. 

For further discussion of the effects of market rates on net interest income, refer to the "Market and Liquidity Risk" section of this financial review. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses, which includes the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments, decreased $19 million to $14 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $33 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. While the economic forecast improved slightly from the prior quarter, the economic outlook as of September 30, 2023 remained uncertain, which, along with lower loan volumes, changes in portfolio composition and credit migration, resulted in an increase in the allowance for credit losses to 1.38% of total loans, or $736 million, at September 30, 2023. Net loan charge-offs were $6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to net recoveries of $2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, as increases in general Middle Market and Business Banking net charge-offs were partially offset by an increase in Corporate Banking net recoveries. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was a benefit of $2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to a benefit of $8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. 

An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and a summary of nonperforming assets are presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review. 

Noninterest Income 

Three Months Ended (in millions) September 30, 2023 June 30, 2023 Card fees $ 71 $ 72 Fiduciary income 59 62 Service charges on deposit accounts 47 47 Capital markets income 35 39 Commercial lending fees 19 18 Bank-owned life insurance 12 14 Letter of credit fees 10 11 Brokerage fees 6 8 Other noninterest income (a) 36 32 Total noninterest income $ 295 $ 303 

(a) The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income. 

Noninterest income decreased $8 million to $295 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting decreases in deferred compensation asset returns (offset in noninterest expenses), capital markets income (related to reduced derivative income), fiduciary income and smaller decreases in other categories, partially offset by an increase in risk management hedging income. 

The following table presents certain categories included in other noninterest income on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 

Three Months Ended (in millions) September 30, 2023 June 30, 2023 Risk management hedging income $ 17 $ 7 FHLB and FRB stock dividends 10 10 Securities trading income 4 4 Insurance commissions 3 3 Deferred compensation asset returns (a) (3) 4 All other noninterest income 5 4 Other noninterest income $ 36 $ 32 

(a) Compensation deferred by the Corporation's officers and directors is invested based on investment selections of the officers and directors. Income earned on these assets is reported in other noninterest income and the offsetting change in deferred compensation plan liabilities is reported in salaries and benefits expense. 

Noninterest Expenses 

Three Months Ended (in millions) September 30, 2023 June 30, 2023 Salaries and benefits expense $ 315 $ 306 Outside processing fee expense 75 68 Software expense 44 43 Occupancy expense 44 41 FDIC insurance expense 19 16 Equipment expense 12 12 Advertising expense 12 10 Other noninterest expenses 34 39 Total noninterest expenses $ 555 $ 535 

Noninterest expenses increased $20 million to $555 million, primarily driven by increases in salaries and benefits expense, outside processing fee expense, occupancy expense and FDIC insurance expense, partially offset by a decrease in other noninterest expenses. Salaries and benefits expense included increases of $8 million in temporary labor, $4 million in incentive compensation and $3 million in stock-based compensation, partially offset by decreases of $7 million in deferred compensation expense (offset in other noninterest income) and $3 million in severance costs. The decrease in other noninterest expenses was primarily due to $21 million in gains on the sale of bank-owned real estate and a $5 million decrease in legal fees, partially offset by increases of $10 million in litigation and regulatory-related expenses, $9 million in consulting expenses and $5 million in operational losses. 

Expenses included a net gain of $14 million for certain modernization initiatives, which was comprised of the above-referenced $21 million in gains on the sale of bank-owned real estate (reported in other noninterest expenses), partially offset by $2 million in Technology-related contract labor (reported in salaries and benefits expense), $2 million in corporate facilities costs (reported in occupancy expense) and $3 million related to the transition for Ameriprise Financial to become the Corporation's investment program provider (reported in other noninterest expenses). 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022

Net income increased $47 million to $848 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $801 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily driven by increases in net interest income and noninterest income, partially offset by higher noninterest expenses and an increase in provision for credit losses. Net income per diluted common share increased $0.36 to $6.24 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $5.88 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023/September 30, 2022 (in millions) Increase Due to Rate (a) Increase (Decrease) Due to Volume (a) Net Increase Interest Income: Loans $ 819 $ 238 $ 1,057 Investment securities 2 28 30 Interest-bearing deposits with banks 399 (164) 235 Other short-term investments 4 4 8 Total interest income 1,224 106 1,330 Interest Expense: Interest-bearing deposits 403 163 566 Short-term borrowings 1 331 332 Medium- and long-term debt 112 114 226 Total interest expense 516 608 1,124 Net interest income $ 708 $ (502) $ 206 

(a) Impact of additional days, other portfolio dynamics and interest rate swaps reflected as part of rate impact, rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume. 

Net interest income was $1.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $206 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in net interest income reflected higher short-term rates and $4.5 billion in loan growth, partially offset by an $11.3 billion increase in borrowings (mostly FHLB advances), a $3.3 billion decline in deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank and a shift to higher-cost deposits. Net interest margin was 3.11 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 33 basis points compared to 2.78 percent for the comparable period in 2022, mostly due to the impact of higher short-term rates, partially offset by higher-cost funding sources. 

For further discussion of the effects of market rates on net interest income, refer to the "Market and Liquidity Risk" section of this financial review. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses was $77 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $27 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, reflecting loan growth, a moderate weakening in the economic outlook and credit migration. Net loan charge-offs were $2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $21 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. General Middle Market net recoveries totaled $11 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to net charge-offs of $15 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, which was partially offset by an increase in Business Banking net charge-offs. Provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was a benefit of $9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to an expense of $18 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. 

An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets is presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review. 

Noninterest Income 

Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2023 2022 Card fees $ 212 $ 205 Fiduciary income 179 178 Service charges on deposit accounts 140 148 Capital markets income (a) 113 120 Commercial lending fees (a) 55 50 Bank-owned life insurance 36 37 Letter of credit fees 31 28 Brokerage fees 22 14 Other noninterest income (a), (b) 92 10 Total noninterest income $ 880 $ 790 

(a) Effective January 1, 2023, the Corporation reported derivative income, syndication agent fees (previously a component of commercial lending fees) and investment banking fees (previously a component of other noninterest income) as a combined item captioned by capital markets income on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Prior periods have been adjusted to conform to this presentation, and the changes in presentation do not impact total noninterest income. 

(b) The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income. 

Noninterest income increased $90 million to $880 million, which included increases in other noninterest income, brokerage fees (higher money market funds revenue), card fees (higher processing volumes) and loan commitment fees (a component of commercial lending fees), partially offset by decreases in service charges on deposit accounts and capital markets income (customer derivative income). Other noninterest income included increases in risk management hedging income, FHLB and FRB stock dividends and deferred compensation asset returns (offset in noninterest expenses). 

The following table presents certain categories included in other noninterest income on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2023 2022 Risk management hedging income $ 32 $ &#8212; FHLB and FRB stock dividends 24 2 Securities trading income 12 9 Insurance commissions 10 10 Deferred compensation asset returns (a) 5 (24) All other noninterest income 9 13 Other noninterest income $ 92 $ 10 

(a) Compensation deferred by the Corporation's officers and directors is invested based on investment selections of the officers and directors. Income earned on these assets is reported in other noninterest income and the offsetting change in deferred compensation plan liabilities is reported in salaries and benefits expense. 

Noninterest Expenses 

Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2023 2022 Salaries and benefits expense $ 947 $ 890 Outside processing fee expense 207 188 Software expense 127 120 Occupancy expense 126 122 FDIC insurance expense 48 24 Equipment expense 36 36 Advertising expense 30 24 Other noninterest expenses 120 53 Total noninterest expenses $ 1,641 $ 1,457 

Noninterest expenses increased $184 million to $1.6 billion primarily due to increases in other noninterest expenses, salaries and benefits expense, FDIC insurance expense and outside processing fee expense. The increase in salaries and benefits expense was driven by higher deferred compensation expense (offset in other noninterest income), the impact of annual merit-based salary increases and staff additions related to strategic revenue-building and technology initiatives as well as a return to a more normalized staff vacancy rate, partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation. Other noninterest expenses included increases in non-salary pension expense, legal fees, and litigation and regulatory-related expenses, partially offset by gains on sale of real estate. 

STRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESS 

The Corporation has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments: the Commercial Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, the Finance Division is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes items not directly associated with the business segments or the Finance segment. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of the business segments for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. 

The Corporation's management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. These methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines. Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation's 2022 Annual Report describes the Corporation's segment reporting methodology. 

Net interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities plus the net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing (FTP) funding credits and charges. The FTP methodology allocates credits to each business segment for deposits and other funds provided as well as charges for loans and other assets being funded. FTP crediting rates on deposits and other funds provided reflect the long-term value of deposits and other funding sources based on their implied maturities. Due to the longer-term nature of implied maturities, FTP crediting rates are generally less volatile than changes in interest rates observed in the market. FTP charge rates for funding loans and other assets reflect a matched cost of funds based on the pricing and duration characteristics of the assets. As a result of applying matched funding, interest revenue for each segment resulting from loans and other assets is generally not impacted by changes in interest rates. Therefore, net interest income for each segment primarily reflects the volume of loans and other earning assets at the spread over the matched cost of funds, as well as the volume of deposits at the associated FTP crediting rates. Generally, in periods of rising interest rates, FTP charge rates for funding loans and FTP crediting rates on deposits will increase, with FTP crediting rates for deposits typically repricing at a slower pace than FTP charge rates for funding loans. 

Business Segments 

The following sections present a summary of the performance of each of the Corporation's business segments for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. 

Commercial Bank 

Nine Months Ended September 30, Percent Change (dollar amounts in millions) 2023 2022 Change Earnings summary: Net interest income $ 1,550 $ 1,232 $ 318 26 % Provision for credit losses 80 1 79 n/m Noninterest income 460 461 (1) &#8212; Noninterest expenses 757 712 45 6 Provision for income taxes 270 229 41 18 Net income $ 903 $ 751 $ 152 20 % Net charge-offs $ 1 $ 24 $ (23) (95) Selected average balances: Loans (a) $ 46,797 $ 42,928 $ 3,869 9 % Deposits 33,204 43,733 (10,529) (24) 

(a) Included PPP loans with average balances of $17 million and $126 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

n/m - not meaningful 

Average loans increased $4 billion, with increases in Commercial Real Estate, National Dealer Services and Corporate Banking. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in Mortgage Banker Finance, as the Corporation is organically exiting the Mortgage Banker Finance business, which is expected to be largely complete by year-end 2023. Average deposits decreased $11 billion, with declines in all deposit categories with the exception of savings deposits. This decline was primarily driven by decreases in noninterest-bearing and money market deposits, with the largest declines in general Middle Market 

(primarily Financial Institutions and California-based Middle Market lending), Technology and Life Sciences, Business Banking, Corporate Banking, National Dealer Services and Commercial Real Estate. 

The Commercial Bank's net income increased $152 million. Net interest income increased $318 million due to higher FTP crediting rates on deposits related to the increase in short-term interest rates, as well as an increase in loan income, partially offset by higher allocated net FTP charges. The provision for credit losses increased to $80 million from $1 million, reflecting increases in Commercial Real Estate, general Middle Market and Business Banking, partially offset by a decrease in Technology and Life Sciences. Net charge-offs decreased $23 million to $1 million, primarily due to net recoveries in general Middle Market, partially offset by net charge-offs in Business Banking. Noninterest income was relatively stable, while noninterest expenses increased $45 million, primarily reflecting increases in salaries and benefits expense, FDIC insurance expense, outside processing fee expense, legal fees and litigation and regulatory-related expenses. 

Retail Bank 

Nine Months Ended September 30, Percent Change (dollar amounts in millions) 2023 2022 Change Earnings summary: Net interest income $ 644 $ 464 $ 180 39 % Provision for credit losses 2 7 (5) (73) Noninterest income 89 89 &#8212; &#8212; Noninterest expenses 511 508 3 1 Provision for income taxes 53 9 44 n/m Net income $ 167 $ 29 $ 138 n/m Net charge-offs (recoveries) $ &#8212; $ (1) $ 1 n/m Selected average balances: Loans (a) $ 2,223 $ 2,031 $ 192 9 % Deposits 24,394 26,890 (2,496) (9) 

(a) Included PPP loans with average balances of $4 million and $38 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

n/m - not meaningful 

Average loans increased $192 million, while average deposits decreased $2.5 billion, reflecting decreases in all deposit categories with the exception of time deposits. The Retail Bank's net income increased $138 million to $167 million. Net interest income increased $180 million, primarily due to higher FTP crediting rates on deposits. Noninterest income was stable, while noninterest expenses increased by $3 million, primarily due to an increase in FDIC insurance expense, partially offset by a decrease in consulting expenses. 

Wealth Management

n/m - not meaningful 

Average loans increased $415 million, while average deposits decreased $1.3 billion, reflecting decreases in all deposit categories with the exception of time deposits. The decrease in deposits was primarily driven by decreases in noninterest-bearing and money market deposits, most significantly in the California market. Wealth Management's net income increased $7 million to $78 million. Net interest income increased $20 million primarily due to higher FTP crediting rates on deposits. 

Provision for credit losses decreased from $11 million to a benefit of $9 million. Noninterest income increased $7 million, primarily driven by investment fees, while noninterest expenses increased $38 million, reflecting increases in salaries and benefits expense, outside processing fees and consulting expenses.

Average deposits, which primarily consist of centrally-managed brokered time deposits fully insured by the FDIC, increased $3.5 billion. Net loss for the Finance and Other category increased $250 million to $300 million. Net interest expense increased by $312 million, reflecting increased balances from higher-cost funding sources and the impact of interest rate swaps, both centrally managed, partly offset by favorable impacts to the Finance segment from other balance sheet dynamics. Noninterest income increased $84 million to $98 million, driven by an increase in risk management hedging income, FHLB stock dividends and a decrease in securities trading losses. Noninterest expenses increased $98 million, primarily reflecting an increase in salaries and benefits expense, non-salary pension expense, software expense and advertising expense, partially offset by gains on the sale of real estate.

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Third Quarter 2023 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2022 

Period-End Balances 

Total assets increased $300 million to $85.7 billion, reflecting a $2.4 billion increase in interest-bearing deposits with banks (primarily deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank) and a $991 million increase in accrued income and other assets, which included increases in deferred tax assets related to the tax impact of unrealized losses on securities and derivatives, FHLB stock and receivables related to customer investment sweep activity. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $2.7 billion in investment securities driven by Treasury maturities, paydowns on mortgage-backed securities and an increase in unrealized losses. Loans were relatively stable, with growth of $1.5 billion in Commercial Real Estate, $460 million in National Dealer Services and $237 million in Corporate Banking, offset by decreases of $1.0 billion in Mortgage Banker Finance, $629 million in general Middle Market and $509 million in Equity Fund Services. These declines reflected strategic actions, including the planned exit from the Mortgage Banker Finance business, which is expected to be mostly complete by year-end 2023, as well as increased selectivity in other lines of business. 

Total liabilities increased $509 million to $80.7 billion, reflecting increases of $5.8 billion in interest-bearing deposits, $3.0 billion in medium- and long-term debt and $1.6 billion in short-term borrowings, partially offset by a decrease of $10.0 billion in noninterest-bearing deposits. The increases in short-term borrowings and medium- and long-term debt were primarily driven by FHLB advances, partially offset by $850 million in senior notes that matured in the third quarter. The increase in interest-bearing deposits was primarily due to increases in brokered time deposits and customer certificates of deposit, while the 

decline in noninterest-bearing deposits reflected customer diversification efforts related to banking industry disruption in the first quarter of 2023 as well as a shift in deposit mix from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing. For additional information regarding deposits, refer to "Deposit Concentrations and Uninsured Deposits" under the "Market Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review. Total shareholders' equity decreased $209 million, primarily due to the net impact of unrealized losses on investment securities available-for-sale and, to a lesser extent, its cash flow hedge portfolio, partially offset by net income. 

Average Balances 

Total assets increased $5.3 billion to $89.2 billion, driven by increases of $5.9 billion in interest-bearing deposits with banks and $1.6 billion in loans, partially offset by a decrease of $2.2 billion in investment securities. The following table provides information about the change in the Corporation's average loan portfolio by loan type. 

Three Months Ended Percent Change (dollar amounts in millions) September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Change Commercial loans $ 29,721 $ 30,585 $ (864) (3 %) Real estate construction loans 4,294 2,978 1,316 44 Commercial mortgage loans 13,814 12,752 1,062 8 Lease financing 770 753 17 2 International loans 1,241 1,227 14 1 Residential mortgage loans 1,915 1,786 129 7 Consumer loans 2,232 2,294 (62) (3) Total loans $ 53,987 $ 52,375 $ 1,612 3 % 

The $1.6 billion increase in loans was primarily driven by increases of $1.7 billion in Commercial Real Estate, $667 million in National Dealer Services and $425 million in Corporate Banking, partially offset by decreases of $502 million in Equity Fund Services and $478 million in Mortgage Banker Finance. 

Total liabilities increased $5.2 billion to $83.8 billion, primarily reflecting increases of $7.3 billion in short-term borrowings, $3.4 billion in medium- and long-term debt and $5.5 billion in interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a decrease of $10.9 billion in noninterest-bearing deposits, reflecting the impacts described above in "Period-End Balances." The decrease in deposits included decreases of $2.1 billion in general Middle Market (largest impact in the California market), $2.0 billion in both the Retail Bank and Technology and Life Sciences, $1.2 billion in Wealth Management, $992 million in Energy, $820 million in Commercial Real Estate and $544 million in Business Banking.

(a) Maximum number of shares that may be repurchased under the publicly announced plans or programs. 

(b) Includes approximately 37,000 shares purchased pursuant to deferred compensation plans and shares purchased from employees to pay for taxes related to restricted stock vesting under the terms of an employee share-based compensation plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These transactions are not considered part of the Corporation's repurchase program. 

The Corporation continues to target a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio of approximately 10 percent with active capital management. At September 30, 2023, the Corporation's estimated CET1 capital ratio was 10.79 percent, up from 10.00 percent at December 31, 2022. Since the inception of the Corporation's share repurchase program in 2010, a total of 97.2 million shares have been authorized for repurchase. There is no expiration date for the share repurchase program. Due to disruption in the banking industry in the first quarter, management is not currently engaged in repurchasing shares and will continue to monitor various factors, including the Corporation's earnings generation, capital needs to fund future loan growth, regulatory changes and market conditions, before resuming the share repurchase program. 

The following table presents the minimum ratios required. 

Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 4.5 % Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 6.0 Total capital to risk-weighted assets 8.0 Capital conservation buffer (a) 2.5 Tier 1 capital to adjusted average assets (leverage ratio) 4.0 

(a) In addition to the minimum risk-based capital requirements, the Corporation is required to maintain a minimum capital conservation buffer, in the form of common equity, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses. 

The Corporation's capital ratios exceeded minimum regulatory requirements as follows: 

September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 (dollar amounts in millions) Capital/Assets Ratio Capital/Assets Ratio Common equity tier 1 (a), (b) $ 8,472 10.79 % $ 7,884 10.00 % Tier 1 risk-based (a), (b) 8,866 11.29 8,278 10.50 Total risk-based (a) 10,329 13.16 9,817 12.45 Leverage (a) 8,866 9.60 8,278 9.55 Common shareholders' equity 4,578 5.34 4,787 5.60 Tangible common equity (b) 3,935 4.62 4,143 4.89 Risk-weighted assets (a) 78,499 78,871 

(a) September 30, 2023 capital, risk-weighted assets and ratios are estimated. 

(b) See Supplemental Financial Data section for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and regulatory ratios. 

The common shareholders' equity ratio decreased 26 basis points to 5.34 percent at September 30, 2023, primarily due to the net impact of unrealized losses on investment securities available-for-sale and, to a lesser extent, the Corporation's cash flow hedge portfolio. The unrealized losses in the Corporation's available-for-sale investment security portfolio, which are due to market valuations since the time of initial acquisition, are not expected to be realized. The tangible common equity ratio, which excludes goodwill and other intangible assets, decreased 27 basis points to 4.62 percent for the same reasons discussed above. Common shareholders&#8217; equity included $4.5 billion in accumulated other comprehensive losses, with approximately $2.9 billion of those losses relating to balances recorded in total assets, comprised of valuation adjustments to available-for-sale securities and pension assets, as well as related deferred tax assets. These amounts impacted the common shareholders&#8217; equity ratio by 495 basis points; the impact on the tangible common equity ratio using the same calculation method was 502 basis points. 

Average common shareholders' equity and return on average common shareholders' equity for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was $5.0 billion and 19.50%, respectively, compared to $4.9 billion and 27.92%, respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2022. 

Basel III Endgame Framework 

On July 27, 2023, the federal banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking, commonly referred to as Basel III Endgame (the Capital Proposal) that would significantly increase the capital requirements applicable to large banking organizations with total assets of $100 billion or more. The Capital Proposal would align the regulatory capital calculation and the calculation of risk-weighted assets across large banking organizations subject to the Capital Proposal and require Category III and IV banking organizations to include most components of AOCI, including net unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, in their regulatory capital ratios. The Capital Proposal is subject to a public comment period ending November 30, 2023, and, if adopted, would include a three-year transition period beginning July 1, 2025. As of September 30, 2023, the Corporation had total assets of $85.7 billion. While the Capital Proposal would not apply to the Corporation as it is currently proposed, if the Corporation becomes subject to the requirements of the Capital Proposal in the future or becomes subject to any other new laws or regulations related to capital and liquidity, such requirements could limit the Corporation&#8217;s ability to pay dividends or make share repurchases or require Comerica to reduce business levels or to raise capital, which would have a material adverse effect on the Corporation&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. 

FDIC Special Assessment 

In May 2023, the FDIC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking which would implement a special assessment on banks with total assets greater than $5.0 billion to recover the cost associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The FDIC is proposing to collect the special assessment for an estimated eight consecutive quarters beginning with the first quarter 2024. A final rule is not expected until later in 2023 after the FDIC's final deliberations have concluded. As proposed, the estimated impact of the special assessment is approximately $100 million, which is expected to be recognized upon the rule's final issuance. The ultimate impact and timing of recognition will depend on the final outcome of the ongoing FDIC deliberations. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

The following updated information should be read in conjunction with the "Risk Management" section on pages F-15 through F-30 in the Corporation's 2022 Annual Report. 

Credit Risk 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses increased $75 million from $661 million at December 31, 2022 to $736 million at September 30, 2023. 

The following table presents metrics of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming loans. 

September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans 1.38 % 1.24 % Allowance for credit losses as a multiple of total nonaccrual loans 4.8x 2.8x Allowance for credit losses as a multiple of total nonperforming loans 4.8x 2.7x 

The economic forecasts informing the current expected credit loss (CECL) model project slower economic activity in the fourth quarter of 2023 and in 2024 as the cumulative effects of the Federal Reserve Bank's tightened monetary policy continue to flow through to the real economy and inflation moderates. Consumer spending is projected to soften as the support from pandemic-era savings dissipates, high inflation curbs discretionary spending and student loan payments restart, causing employers to slow the pace of hiring. Energy prices are projected to level off amid crosswinds from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, rising U.S. crude production and China's housing downturn. Residential and commercial real estate property prices are projected to decline modestly as the long and variable lags of the Federal Reserve Bank's tighter monetary policy slow credit intermediation, a headwind to real asset prices. 

Downside risks to growth from strikes, a potential government shutdown, geopolitical risks and the restart of student loan payments are projected to collectively contribute to slower growth in 2024. Price pressures are forecasted to gradually dissipate as a modest margin of slack opens in the economy's productive capacity. The Federal Reserve Bank's aggressive 

tightening of monetary policy, including rapid increases in interest rates and reductions in the size of their balance sheet, contribute to elevated risk of a policy error and recession. 

These factors shaped the 2-year reasonable and supportable forecasts used by the Corporation in its CECL estimate at September 30, 2023. The U.S. economy is projected to contract slightly in fourth quarter 2023, before returning to growth in 2024 at a pace somewhat below expectations for its longer-run average. Similarly, inflation is forecasted to converge toward the Federal Reserve Bank's target over the 2-year period. Interest rates are projected to increase in fourth quarter 2023, followed by a gradual decline as inflation slows and the Federal Reserve Bank gradually shifts to a less restrictive monetary stance. The following table summarizes select variables representative of the economic forecasts used to develop the CECL estimate at September 30, 2023. 

Economic Variable Base Forecast Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth Slight contraction in the fourth quarter 2023 before recovering to a growth rate between 2.0 percent and 2.5 percent by the end of the forecast period. Unemployment rate Expected to increase to 4.6 percent by third quarter 2024 followed by a slight decline throughout 2025. Spread of Corporate BBB bond to 10-year Treasury bond Spread widens to 2.3 percent by second quarter 2024 before normalizing to approximately 2 percent by 2025. Oil Prices Prices average between $78 and $80 per barrel throughout the forecast period. 

Due to the high level of uncertainty regarding conditioning assumptions used as inputs to the forecast, the Corporation evaluated a range of economic scenarios, including more benign and more severe economic forecasts. In a more severe scenario, real GDP is projected to contract through second quarter 2024, subsequently improving to a growth rate of 2.6 percent by the end of the forecast period. Other key economic variables follow a similar pattern of short-term deterioration followed by a recovery, except for unemployment levels, which remained elevated through the end of the forecast period. Selecting the more severe forecast would result in an increase in the quantitative calculation of allowance for credit losses of approximately $315 million as of September 30, 2023. However, factoring in model overlays and qualitative adjustments could result in a materially different estimate under a more severe scenario. The Corporation monitors evolving economic conditions for impacts to the allowance for credit losses. 

Allowance for Loan Losses 

The allowance for loan losses represents management&#8217;s estimates of current expected credit losses in the Corporation&#8217;s loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses increased $84 million to $694 million at September 30, 2023, compared to $610 million at December 31, 2022. 

Collective loss estimates are determined by applying reserve factors, designed to estimate current expected credit losses, to amortized cost balances over the remaining contractual life of the collectively evaluated portfolio. Loans with similar risk characteristics are aggregated into homogeneous pools. The allowance for loan losses also includes qualitative adjustments to bring the allowance to the level management believes is appropriate based on factors that have not otherwise been fully accounted for, including adjustments for foresight risk, input imprecisions and model imprecision. Credit losses for loans that no longer share risk characteristics with the loan pools are estimated on an individual basis. Individual credit loss estimates are typically performed for nonaccrual loans and are based on one of several methods, including the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, observable market value of similar debt or the present value of expected cash flows. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Lending-Related Commitments 

The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments estimates current expected credit losses on collective pools of letters of credit and unused commitments to extend credit based on reserve factors, determined in a manner similar to business loans, multiplied by a probability of draw estimate based on historical experience and credit risk, applied to commitment amounts. 

For additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses, refer to the "Critical Accounting Estimates" section and pages F-48 through F-49 in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation's 2022 Annual Report. 

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status and foreclosed assets. Effective January 1, 2023, the Corporation prospectively adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2022-02, which eliminated the accounting for TDRs. Refer to 

Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. At December 31, 2022, reduced-rate loans represented TDRs which had been renegotiated to less than their original contractual rates. 

The following table presents a summary of nonperforming assets and past due loans. 

(dollar amounts in millions) September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Nonaccrual loans $ 154 $ 240 Reduced-rate loans n/a 4 Total nonperforming loans/Total nonperforming assets $ 154 $ 244 Nonaccrual loans as a percentage of total loans 0.29 % 0.45 % Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans 0.29 0.46 Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and foreclosed property 0.29 0.46 Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing $ 45 $ 23 

Nonperforming assets decreased $90 million to $154 million at September 30, 2023, from $244 million at December 31, 2022. The decrease in nonperforming assets was primarily comprised of decreases of $53 million in nonaccrual business loans and $33 million in nonaccrual retail loans. Nonperforming loans were 0.29 percent of total loans at September 30, 2023, compared to 0.46 percent at December 31, 2022. For further information regarding the composition of nonaccrual loans, refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. 

The following table presents a summary of changes in nonaccrual loans.

(b) Consumer, excluding residential mortgage and certain personal purpose nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs, are included in the Other category. 

Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest generally represent loans that are well-collateralized and in the process of collection. Loans past due 90 days or more increased $22 million to $45 million at September 30, 2023, compared to $23 million at December 31, 2022. Loans past due 30-89 days decreased $152 million to $226 million at September 30, 2023, compared to $378 million at December 31, 2022. Loans past due 30 days or more and still accruing interest as a percentage of total loans were 0.51 percent and 0.75 percent at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. An aging analysis of loans included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements provides further information about the balances comprising past due loans. 

The following table presents a summary of total criticized loans. The Corporation's criticized list is consistent with the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful categories defined by regulatory authorities. Criticized loans on nonaccrual status are individually subjected to quarterly credit quality reviews, and the Corporation may establish specific allowances for such loans. A table of loans by credit quality indicator included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements provides further information about the balances comprising total criticized loans. 

(dollar amounts in millions) September 30, 2023 June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Total criticized loans $ 2,290 $ 2,048 $ 1,572 As a percentage of total loans 4.3 % 3.7 % 2.9 % 

The $718 million increase in criticized loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by Commercial Real Estate and general Middle Market. 

Concentrations of Credit Risk 

Concentrations of credit risk may exist when a number of borrowers are engaged in similar activities, or activities in the same geographic region, and have similar economic characteristics that would cause them to be similarly impacted by changes in economic or other conditions. The Corporation has concentrations of credit risk with the commercial real estate and automotive industries. All other industry concentrations, as defined by management, individually represented less than 10 percent of total loans at September 30, 2023. 

Commercial Real Estate Lending 

At September 30, 2023, the Corporation's commercial real estate portfolio represented 34 percent of total loans. The following table summarizes the Corporation's commercial real estate loan portfolio by loan category. 

September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 (in millions) Commercial Real Estate business line (a) Other (b) Total Commercial Real Estate business line (a) Other (b) Total Real estate construction loans $ 4,015 $ 530 $ 4,545 $ 2,505 $ 600 $ 3,105 Commercial mortgage loans 4,832 8,889 13,721 4,681 8,625 13,306 Total commercial real estate $ 8,847 $ 9,419 $ 18,266 $ 7,186 $ 9,225 $ 16,411 

(a) Primarily loans to real estate developers. 

(b) Primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate. 

The Corporation limits risk inherent in its commercial real estate lending activities by monitoring borrowers directly involved in the commercial real estate markets and adhering to conservative policies on loan-to-value ratios for such loans. Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $18.3 billion at September 30, 2023. Commercial real estate loans made to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which includes loans to real estate developers, totaled $8.8 billion, or 48 percent of total commercial real estate loans, an increase of $1.7 billion compared to December 31, 2022. The Commercial Real Estate business line at September 30, 2023 was predominantly secured by multi-family and industrial properties, comprising 45% and 34% of the portfolio, respectively, with only 6% secured by office properties. Commercial real estate loans in other business lines totaled $9.4 billion, or 52 percent of total commercial real estate loans, at September 30, 2023, an increase of $194 million compared to December 31, 2022. These loans consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages, which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans. Generally, loans previously reported as real estate construction are classified as commercial mortgage loans upon receipt of a certificate of occupancy. 

The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-tenured customers with satisfactory completion experience. Criticized real estate construction loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line were $61 million at September 30, 2023, compared to none at December 31, 2022. In other business lines, criticized real estate construction loans totaled $11 million at September 30, 2023, compared to $3 million at December 31, 2022. 

For the three month periods ended September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, as well as the nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were no net charge-offs of real estate construction loans, while net charge-offs totaled $1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. 

Commercial mortgage loans are loans where the primary collateral is a lien on any real property and are primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate. Real property is generally considered primary collateral if the value of that collateral represents more than 50 percent of the commitment at loan approval. Loans in the commercial mortgage portfolio generally mature within three to five years. Criticized commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $374 million and $16 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, with the increase primarily in multi-family properties. In other business lines, $245 million and $151 million of commercial mortgage loans were criticized at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

Commercial mortgage net charge-offs were $1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to net recoveries of $1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, and none for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. 

Automotive Lending - Dealer 

The following table presents a summary of dealer loans. 

September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 (in millions) Loans Outstanding Percent of Total Loans Loans Outstanding Percent of Total Loans Dealer: Floor plan $ 1,860 $ 1,379 Other 3,967 3,988 Total dealer $ 5,827 10.9 % $ 5,367 10.1 % 

Substantially all dealer loans are in the National Dealer Services business line and primarily include floor plan financing and other loans to automotive dealerships. Floor plan loans, included in commercial loans in the Consolidated 

Balance Sheets, totaled $1.9 billion at September 30, 2023, an increase of $481 million compared to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2022, as a result of new relationships. Other loans to automotive dealers in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $4.0 billion, including $2.3 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans, at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

There were no nonaccrual dealer loans at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Additionally, there were no net charge-offs of dealer loans during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, or in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. 

Automotive Lending - Production 

The following table presents a summary of loans to borrowers involved with automotive production. 

September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 (in millions) Loans Outstanding Percent of Total Loans Loans Outstanding Percent of Total Loans Production: Domestic $ 815 $ 797 Foreign 322 271 Total production $ 1,137 2.1 % $ 1,068 2.0 % 

Loans to borrowers involved with automotive production, primarily Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers, totaled $1.1 billion at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. These borrowers have faced, and could face in the future, financial difficulties due to disruptions in auto production, issues with supply chains and logistics operations and impacts resulting from labor union strikes. As such, management continues to monitor this portfolio. 

Nonaccrual loans to borrowers involved with automotive production totaled $3 million and $5 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. There were no automotive production loan net charge-offs during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, while net charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2022 totaled $2 million. There were also no loan net charge-offs during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. 

Residential Real Estate Lending 

At September 30, 2023, residential real estate loans represented 7 percent of total loans. The following table summarizes the Corporation's residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolios by geographic market. 

September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 (dollar amounts in millions) Residential Mortgage Loans % of Total Home Equity Loans % of Total Residential Mortgage Loans % of Total Home Equity Loans % of Total Geographic market: Michigan $ 560 29 % $ 454 26 % $ 497 27 % $ 487 27 % California 874 46 886 50 866 48 852 48 Texas 271 14 341 19 258 14 354 20 Other Markets 200 11 83 5 193 11 83 5 Total $ 1,905 100 % $ 1,764 100 % $ 1,814 100 % $ 1,776 100 % 

Residential real estate loans, which consist of traditional residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit, totaled $3.7 billion at September 30, 2023. The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation's primary geographic markets. Substantially all residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more are placed on nonaccrual status, and substantially all junior lien home equity loans that are current or less than 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual status if full collection of the senior position is in doubt. At no later than 180 days past due, such loans are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell. 

Residential mortgages totaled $1.9 billion at September 30, 2023, and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the $1.9 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, $19 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2023, a decrease of $34 million compared to December 31, 2022. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.8 billion at September 30, 2023, of which 96 percent was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit, 3 percent were in amortizing status and 1 percent were closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.8 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $17 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2023. A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens at September 30, 2023. 

Energy Lending 

The Corporation has a portfolio of Energy loans that are included entirely in commercial loans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Customers in the Corporation's Energy business line are engaged in exploration and production (E&#38;P) and midstream. E&#38;P generally includes such activities as searching for potential oil and gas fields, drilling exploratory wells and operating active wells. Commitments to E&#38;P borrowers are generally subject to semi-annual borrowing base re-determinations based on a variety of factors including updated prices (reflecting market and competitive conditions), energy reserve levels and the impact of hedging. The midstream sector is generally involved in the transportation, storage and marketing of crude and/or refined oil and gas products. Approximately 95% of loans in the Energy business line are Shared National Credits (SNC), which are facilities greater than or equal to $100 million shared by three or more federally supervised institutions, reflecting the Corporation's focus on larger middle market companies that have financing needs that generally exceed internal individual borrower credit risk limits. The Corporation seeks to develop full relationships with SNC borrowers. 

The following table summarizes information about loans in the Corporation's Energy business line. 

September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 (dollar amounts in millions) Outstandings Nonaccrual Criticized (a) Outstandings Nonaccrual Criticized (a) Exploration and production (E&#38;P) $ 1,127 78 % $ 6 $ 6 $ 1,162 82 % $ 7 $ 12 Midstream 310 22 &#8212; &#8212; 253 18 &#8212; &#8212; Total Energy business line $ 1,437 100 % $ 6 $ 6 $ 1,415 100 % $ 7 $ 12 

(a) Includes nonaccrual loans. 

Loans in the Energy business line totaled $1.4 billion, or less than 3 percent of total loans, at September 30, 2023, an increase of $22 million compared to December 31, 2022. Total exposure, including unused commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, was $3.4 billion at September 30, 2023 (a utilization rate of 42 percent) and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2022 (a utilization rate of 43 percent). Nonaccrual Energy loans were $6 million and $7 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Criticized Energy loans at September 30, 2023 decreased $6 million from December 31, 2022 to $6 million. E&#38;P included $27 million and $13 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, related to the Corporation's legacy energy services customers that provide products and services primarily to the E&#38;P sector. 

Energy net recoveries were $1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to none for the three months ended June 30, 2023, while Energy net recoveries were $1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to net charge-offs of $3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. 

Leveraged Loans 

Certain loans in the Corporation's commercial portfolio are considered leveraged transactions. These loans are typically used for mergers, acquisitions, business recapitalizations, refinancing and equity buyouts. To help mitigate the risk associated with these loans, the Corporation focuses on middle market companies with highly capable management teams, strong sponsors and solid track records of financial performance. Industries prone to cyclical downturns and acquisitions with a high degree of integration risk are generally avoided. Other considerations include the sufficiency of collateral, the level of balance sheet leverage and the adequacy of financial covenants. During the underwriting process, cash flows are stress-tested to evaluate the borrowers' abilities to handle economic downturns and an increase in interest rates. 

The FDIC defines higher-risk commercial and industrial (HR C&#38;I) loans for assessment purposes as loans generally with leverage of four times total debt to earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation (EBITDA) as well as three times senior debt to EBITDA, excluding certain collateralized loans. 

The following tables summarize information about HR C&#38;I loans, which represented 6 percent of total loans at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

(in millions) September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Outstandings $ 3,091 $ 3,120 Criticized 

386 393 

There were no net charge-offs of leveraged loans during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, and $1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $21 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. 

Market and Liquidity Risk 

Market risk represents the risk of loss due to adverse movement in prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. Liquidity risk represents the risk that the Corporation does not have sufficient access to funds to maintain its normal operations at all times or does not have the ability to raise or borrow funds at a reasonable cost at all times. 

The Asset and Liability Policy Committee (ALCO) of the Corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities. ALCO meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the Corporation, including treasury, finance, economics, lending, deposit gathering and risk management. Corporate Treasury mitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of ALCO through the actions it takes to manage the Corporation's market, liquidity and capital positions. 

The Corporation performs monthly liquidity stress testing to evaluate its ability to meet funding needs in hypothetical stressed environments. Such environments cover a series of scenarios, including both idiosyncratic and market-wide in nature, which vary in terms of duration and severity. Recent events have created greater uncertainty with respect to normal deposit patterns. Following the March 2023 banking industry disruption, the Corporation activated its contingency funding plan by increasing its cash position through wholesale funding channels and brokered deposits. The Corporation's evaluation as of September 30, 2023 projected that sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events. 

In addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis, Corporate Treasury also monitors the parent company's liquidity and has established liquidity coverage requirements for meeting expected obligations without the support of additional dividends from subsidiaries. ALCO's policy on liquidity risk management requires the parent company to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet expected cash obligations, such as debt service, dividend payments and normal operating expenses, over a period of no less than 12 months. The Corporation had liquid assets of $1.5 billion on an unconsolidated basis at September 30, 2023. 

Corporate Treasury and the Enterprise Risk Division support ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks. Key activities encompass: (i) providing information and analyses of the Corporation's balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks; (ii) monitoring and reporting the Corporation's positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines; (iii) developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions; (iv) reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval; and (v) monitoring industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks. 

Interest Rate Risk 

Net interest income is the primary source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities, primarily through the Corporation's core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by core deposits. Including the impact of interest rate swaps converting floating-rate loans to fixed, the Corporation's loan composition at September 30, 2023 was 50 percent fixed-rate, 41 percent overnight to 30-day rate (primarily BSBY and SOFR), 6 percent 90-day and greater rates and 3 percent prime. The composition of the loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the faster repricing of the floating-rate loan portfolio versus deposit products. In addition, the growth and/or contraction in the Corporation's loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing fixed-rate investment securities, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest rate sensitivity, as well as hedging with interest rate swaps and options. Other mitigating factors include interest rate floors on a portion of the loan portfolio. 

The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity. Currently, from an interest rate risk management perspective, the Corporation is approximately neutral to 100 basis point gradual interest rate changes. 

Since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives, a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk. These techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve utilizing multiple simulation analyses. Simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors, including, but not limited to, the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, regulatory impacts and management strategies. 

Sensitivity of Net Interest Income to Changes in Interest Rates 

The analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is management's principal risk management technique. Management models a base-case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment using a static balance sheet and generates sensitivity scenarios by changing certain model assumptions. Each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth, investment security prepayment levels, depositor behavior and overall balance sheet mix and growth which are in line with historical patterns. Changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis. Model assumptions in the sensitivity scenarios at September 30, 2023 included for the rising rate scenario, a modest increase in loan balances and a moderate decrease in deposit balances, and for the declining rate scenario, a modest decrease in loan balances and a moderate increase in deposit balances. In addition, both scenarios assumed loan spreads held at current levels, an incremental interest-bearing deposit beta of approximately 38%, no reinvestment of securities portfolio cash flows and no additions to interest rate swaps. 

The average balance of the securities portfolio included in the analysis was $16.9 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023 with an average yield of 2.10% and effective duration of 5.7 years. 

The table below details components of the cash flow hedge portfolio at September 30, 2023. 

Cash Flow Hedges (dollar amounts in millions) Notional Amount Weighted Average Yield Years to Maturity (a) 

Swaps under contract at September 30, 2023 (b) 

$ 25,100 2.48 % 4.1 Weighted average notional active per period: Full year 2023 22,372 2.38 3.7 Full year 2024 23,575 2.50 4.2 Full year 2025 22,973 2.57 4.4 

(a) Years to maturity calculated from a starting date of September 30, 2023. 

(b) Includes forward starting swaps of $1.3 billion starting in 2023 and $2.0 billion starting in 2024. Excluding forward starting swaps, the weighted average yield was 2.38%. 

The analysis also includes interest rate swaps that convert $6.3 billion of fixed-rate medium- and long-term debt and FHLB advances to variable rates through fair value hedges. Additionally, included in this analysis are $16.3 billion of loans that were subject to an average interest rate floor of 50 basis points at September 30, 2023. This base-case net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which short-term rates rise or decline 100 basis points (with a floor of zero percent) in a linear, parallel fashion from the base case over 12 months, resulting in an average change of 50 basis points over the period. 

The table below, as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above. 

Estimated Annual Change September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 (dollar amounts in millions) Amount % Amount % Change in Interest Rates: Change in Interest Rates: Rising 100 basis points $ 9 &#8212; % Rising 100 basis points 

$ 10 &#8212; % (50 basis points on average) (50 basis points on average) Declining 100 basis points (17) (1) Declining 100 basis points (72) (2) (50 basis points on average) (50 basis points on average) 

Sensitivity to declining interest rates decreased from December 31, 2022 to September 30, 2023 resulting from a decline in non-maturity deposits, partially offset by an increase in time deposits. Sensitivity to rising interest rates at September 30, 2023 remained relatively stable compared to December 31, 2022, resulting from refinements to modeled deposit runoff following the change in balance sheet mix that occurred during the year. 

At September 30, 2023, additional sensitivity scenarios applied the rising and declining 100 basis point scenario assumptions with a 55% incremental deposit beta relative to the base case scenario to assess the impact of the Corporation's deposit beta assumptions. In these rising and declining scenarios, net interest income decreased by $25 million and increased by $3 million, respectively, due to a more rapid repricing pace compared to the standard model assumptions. All scenarios presented for September 30, 2023 reflected a change in balance sheet composition following the March 2023 banking industry 

disruption, as the balance sheet maintained a higher concentration of cash as well as increased wholesale funding and brokered deposits, which contributed to the decrease in net interest income in all scenarios presented. 

Sensitivity of Economic Value of Equity to Changes in Interest Rates 

In addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income, an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position. The economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the Corporation's financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period, and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements. The Corporation primarily monitors the percentage change on the base-case economic value of equity. The economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel 100 basis point shock with a floor of zero percent. 

The table below, as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above. 

September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 (dollar amounts in millions) Amount % Amount % Change in Interest Rates: Change in Interest Rates: Rising 100 basis points $ (522) (4 %) Rising 100 basis points $ (417) (3 %) Declining 100 basis points 720 6 Declining 100 basis points 627 4 

The negative sensitivity of the economic value of equity to rising rates increased from December 31, 2022 to September 30, 2023 due to deposit runoff, partially offset by a declining notional amount of cash flow swaps and a smaller securities portfolio. Sensitivity to declining rates increased the economic value of equity due to the same factors. 

LIBOR Transition 

On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. Effective March 2021, the FCA confirmed that certain LIBOR tenors would no longer be supported after December 31, 2021 and that the remaining tenors, including those most commonly used by the Corporation, would no longer be supported after June 30, 2023. The Corporation had substantial exposure to LIBOR-based products, ceased originating LIBOR-based products in the fourth quarter 2021 and has worked to remediate its outstanding LIBOR contracts. 

As of September 30, 2023, substantially all of the Corporation's LIBOR exposure was remediated and remaining LIBOR-based contracts are expected to transition to other reference rates at their next repricing dates. 

For a discussion of the various risks facing the Corporation in relation to the transition away from LIBOR, see the market risk discussion within &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; beginning on page 15 of the Corporation's 2022 Annual Report. 

Sources of Liquidity 

The Corporation maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately satisfy its financial obligations while taking into account potential commitment draws and deposit run-off that may occur in the normal course of business. The majority of the Corporation's balance sheet is funded by customer deposits. Cash flows from loan repayments, increases in deposit accounts (including brokered deposits), activity in the securities portfolio and wholesale funding channels serve as the Corporation's primary liquidity sources. 

The Corporation satisfies incremental liquidity needs with either liquid assets or external funding sources. Available liquidity includes cash, FHLB advances and Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) borrowing, comprised of borrowing through the discount window and the newly established Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP). The Corporation has pledged its investment securities portfolio to access wholesale funding as needed and does not intend to sell or restructure securities at this time. 

The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Dallas, Texas, which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related loans, certain government agency-backed securities and other eligible assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral pledged to the FHLB and the fair value of pledged assets, as well as applicable FHLB haircuts. 

At September 30, 2023, the Bank had pledged real estate-related loans totaling $21.6 billion and investment securities totaling $6.4 billion to the FHLB, which provided for up to $17.3 billion of collateralized borrowing with the FHLB. 

The FRB provides liquidity through its discount window, where banks may borrow funds based on the discounted fair value of pledged assets. Additionally, in March 2023, the FRB established the BTFP in response to the recent industry disruption, offering loans with up to one year in maturity to eligible depository institutions in exchange for pledged collateral in 

the form of U.S Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities and other qualifying assets. Unlike other funding sources, borrowing capacity under the BTFP is based on the par value, not fair value, of collateral. 

At September 30, 2023, the Bank had pledged loans totaling $24.6 billion and investment securities totaling $7.5 billion to the FRB, which provided for up to $20.3 billion and $9.6 billion of collateralized borrowing through the discount window and BTFP program, respectively. Total available collateralized borrowings with the FRB totaled $29.9 billion at September 30, 2023. 

The table below details the Corporation's sources of available liquidity at September 30, 2023.

The Corporation may also use brokered deposits and external debt as additional sources of funding, and maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission through which it may issue securities.The ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise unsecured funding at competitive rates is impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity, capital, earnings and other relevant factors related to the Corporation and the Bank. As of September 30, 2023, the three major rating agencies had assigned the following ratings to long-term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank, as well as long-term deposits at the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

Deposit Concentrations and Uninsured Deposits 

The Corporation's focus is commercial customers, and accordingly, it has a larger percentage of uninsured deposits relative to financial institutions with a higher consumer focus. These deposits are well-diversified between geographies, industries and customers. At September 30, 2023, the Retail Banking and general Middle Market segments, both highly diversified and granular, accounted for 36% and 27% of the total deposit base, respectively. Corporate Banking and Technology and Life Sciences comprised 6% and 5% each of total deposits, respectively, which were the largest deposit concentrations of the more specialized business lines. 

Uninsured deposits are defined as the portion of deposit accounts in U.S. offices that exceed the FDIC insurance limit and amounts in any other uninsured investment or deposit account that are classified as deposits and are not subject to any federal or state deposit insurance regimes.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

The Corporation&#8217;s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation's 2022 Annual Report. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation&#8217;s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2022, the most critical of these estimates related to the allowance for credit losses, fair value measurement, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These estimates were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully on pages F-31 through F-34 in the Corporation's 2022 Annual Report. Below is an addition to the critical accounting estimates disclosed in the Corporation's 2022 Annual Report. 

GOODWILL 

Goodwill is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level, equivalent to a business segment or one level below. The Corporation has three reporting units: the Commercial Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, goodwill totaled $635 million, including $473 million allocated to the Commercial Bank, $101 million allocated to the Retail Bank and $61 million allocated to Wealth Management. 

The Corporation performs its annual evaluation of goodwill impairment in the third quarter of each year and may elect to perform a quantitative impairment analysis or first conduct a qualitative analysis to determine if a quantitative analysis is necessary. Additionally, the Corporation evaluates goodwill impairment on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate additional testing may be warranted to determine if goodwill might be impaired. 

During the third quarter of 2023, the Corporation elected to perform a quantitative impairment analysis. The estimated fair values of the reporting units were determined using a blend of two commonly used valuation techniques: the market approach and the income approach. For the market approach, valuations of reporting units considered a combination of earnings and equity multiples from companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit. Since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of noncontrolling interests, the valuations incorporated a control premium. For the income approach, estimated future cash flows were derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for each reporting unit. In the short- and mid-term, forecasts incorporated current economic conditions and impacts of expected monetary policy decisions by the Federal Reserve Bank. Long-term projections reflected normalized rate and credit environments, as well as a long-term rate of return for each reporting unit. Projections were discounted using an applicable discount rate to calculate the fair value. The discount rate was based on the imputed cost of equity capital for each reporting unit, which incorporates the risk-free rate of return, a market equity risk premium, potential stock volatility and a size risk premium. The discount rate further reflected the uncertainty of current economic conditions and potential impacts to the forecasted financial information. 

The combined fair value of all units was compared to the Corporation's market capitalization for reasonableness. At the conclusion of the quantitative impairment test in the third quarter 2023, the estimated fair values of all reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying amounts, including goodwill. The Corporation performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact to the estimated fair value of each reporting unit from an adverse change in the discount rate. A 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in the fair value of each reporting unit to continue to substantially exceed its carrying value. 

The Corporation continues to monitor economic conditions that could significantly impact the impairment analysis and result in future goodwill impairment charges that, if incurred, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's results of operations in the period such charges are recognized. Additionally, any new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management's expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Any impairment charge would not affect the Corporation's regulatory capital ratios, tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position. 

SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATA 

The Corporation believes non-GAAP measures are meaningful because they reflect adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and our performance trends. Tangible common equity is used by the Corporation to measure the quality of capital and the return relative to balance sheet risk. 

Common equity tier 1 capital ratio removes preferred stock from the Tier 1 capital ratio as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank regulations. The tangible common equity ratio removes the effect of intangible assets from capital and total assets. Tangible common equity per share of common stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders' equity per share of common stock. 

The following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and regulatory ratios used in this financial review with financial measures defined by GAAP.

(a) September 30, 2023 ratios are estimated. 

Total uninsured deposits as calculated per regulatory guidance and reported on schedule RC-O of the Bank&#8217;s Call Report include affiliate deposits, which by definition have a different risk profile than other uninsured deposits. The amounts presented below remove affiliate deposits from the total uninsured deposits number. The Corporation believes that the presentation of uninsured deposits adjusted for the impact of affiliate deposits provides enhanced clarity of uninsured deposits at risk.
