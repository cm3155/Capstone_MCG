RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2021 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2020 

Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2021 was $262 million, compared to $217 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020. The $45 million increase in net income was driven by lower provision for credit losses, broad-based noninterest income growth and an increase in net interest income that reflected higher loan fees and lower deposit costs, partially offset by higher noninterest expenses. The decline in the provision for credit losses resulted from continued improvements in the economic outlook and strong credit performance. Net income per diluted common share was $1.90 and $1.48 for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of $0.42 per diluted common share. Net income per diluted common share benefited from the decrease in shares outstanding due to repurchases in 2021. 

Effective January 1, 2021, the Corporation elected to change the accounting methodology for determining market-related value of plan assets (MRVA) for certain classes of assets in the qualified defined benefit pension plan. The impact of the change for the three months ended September 30, 2021 was an increase to the pension benefit reduction to noninterest expenses of $5 million and a corresponding increase to net income of $4 million. The change in accounting methodology is applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. Discussion of results of operations is based on recast results. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information and impacts of the change in accounting policy.

(a) Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume. 

(b) Included a $12 million increase in PPP interest income primarily related to loan forgiveness. 

Net interest income was $475 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of $17 million compared to $458 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020. The increase in net interest income was driven by PPP loan forgiveness as well as lower rates paid on interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by lower loan volume and the net impact of the increase in lower-yielding investment securities. Net interest margin was 2.23 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2021, a decline of 10 basis points from 2.33 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2020. 

Average earning assets increased $6.2 billion, due to increases of $8.0 billion in interest-bearing deposits with banks and $2.1 billion in investment securities, partially offset by a $3.9 billion decrease in loans. Average interest-bearing funding sources increased $1.0 billion, reflecting a $4.3 billion increase in interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a $3.1 billion decrease in medium- and long-term debt. 

For further discussion of the effects of market rates on net interest income, refer to the "Market and Liquidity Risk" section of this financial review. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses, which includes the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments, was a benefit of $42 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared to an expense of $5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020. The change in the provision for credit losses primarily reflected the economy re-opening as well as improvements in the economic forecast and in the loan portfolio, including Energy, since the onset of the pandemic last year. Net loan charge-offs decreased $31 million to $2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared to $33 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, driven by decreases of $25 million in Energy and $8 million in Technology and Life Sciences to net recoveries of $16 million and $1 million, respectively. 

An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and a summary of nonperforming assets are presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review. 

Noninterest Income 

Three Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2021 2020 Card fees $ 72 $ 71 Fiduciary income 58 51 Service charges on deposit accounts 50 47 Commercial lending fees 31 19 Derivative income (a) 20 9 Bank-owned life insurance 12 12 Letter of credit fees 10 9 Brokerage fees 3 5 Other noninterest income (a), (b) 24 29 Total noninterest income $ 280 $ 252 

(a) Beginning with the first quarter 2021, the Corporation reported customer derivative income, previously a component of other noninterest income, and foreign exchange income as a combined item captioned by derivative income on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Prior periods have been adjusted to conform to this presentation and the changes in presentation do not impact total noninterest income. 

(b) The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income. 

&#160; Noninterest income increased $28 million to $280 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, reflecting increases in commercial lending fees, derivative income, fiduciary income and service charges on deposit accounts. The increase in commercial lending fees primarily resulted from new syndication agent activity, while the increase in derivative income was largely due to favorable valuation adjustments. Noninterest income was also impacted by a decrease in other noninterest income, as detailed below, driven by lower securities trading income and deferred compensation asset returns (offset in other noninterest expenses), partially offset by higher income from principal investing and warrants. 

The following table presents certain categories included in other noninterest income on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 

Three Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2021 2020 Income from principal investing and warrants $ 14 $ 1 Investment banking fees 3 2 Deferred compensation asset returns (a) &#8212; 8 Securities trading income (b) (3) 8 All other noninterest income 10 10 Other noninterest income $ 24 $ 29 

(a) Compensation deferred by the Corporation's officers and directors is invested based on investment selections of the officers and directors. Income earned on these assets is reported in other noninterest income and the offsetting change in deferred compensation plan liabilities is reported in salaries and benefits expense. 

(b) Includes changes in value of shares obtained through exercise of warrants. 

Noninterest Expenses 

Three Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2021 2020 Salaries and benefits expense $ 282 $ 257 Outside processing fee expense 65 58 Occupancy expense 40 40 Software expense 40 39 Equipment expense 13 12 Advertising expense 10 9 FDIC insurance expense 4 8 Other noninterest expenses (a) 11 15 Total noninterest expenses (a) $ 465 $ 438 

(a) The three months ended September 30, 2020 have been recast to reflect the retrospective application of the Corporation's election to change the accounting method for certain components of expense related to the defined pension plan, resulting in a decrease of $8 million from the previously reported balances. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information and impacts of the change in accounting policy. 

Noninterest expenses increased $27 million to $465 million, primarily reflecting increases in salaries and benefits expense and outside processing fee expense, partially offset by a decrease in other noninterest expenses. The increase in salaries and benefits expense was mostly due to higher performance-related compensation driven by strong financial results and the impact of annual merit increases, partially offset by lower deferred compensation expense (offset in other noninterest income). 

The increase in outside processing fee expense primarily related to data processing support for PPP loans, while the decrease in other noninterest expenses was driven by lower non-salary pension expense and smaller decreases in other categories, partially offset by higher consulting fees. 

Provision for Income Taxes 

The provision for income taxes increased $20 million to $70 million, driven by higher pre-tax income, partially offset by an increase in discrete tax benefits. Discrete tax benefits were $5 million in third quarter 2021, primarily resulting from adjustments to annual federal filings and resolution of certain state matters, compared to $2 million in third quarter 2020. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 

Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was $940 million, an increase of $664 million compared to $276 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The increase was driven by lower provision for credit losses as the economic outlook significantly shifted from the height of the pandemic in 2020. Net income was also impacted by higher noninterest income, partially offset by higher noninterest expenses and a decrease in net interest income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, net income per diluted common share was $6.67, an increase of $4.77 compared to $1.90 for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Net income per diluted common share benefited from the decrease in shares outstanding due to repurchases in 2021. 

Effective January 1, 2021, the Corporation elected to change the accounting methodology for determining MRVA for certain classes of assets in the qualified defined benefit pension plan. The impact of the change for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was an increase to the pension benefit reduction to noninterest expenses of $14 million and a corresponding increase to net income of $11 million. The change in accounting methodology is applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. Discussion of results of operations is based on recast results. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information and impacts of the change in accounting policy.

(a) Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume. 

(b) Included a $60 million increase in PPP interest income primarily related to loan forgiveness. 

Net interest income was $1.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, a decrease of $59 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The decrease in net interest income reflected lower yields on earning assets and a decrease in loan balances, partially offset by lower rates paid on deposits and debt. Net interest margin was 2.27 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, a decrease of 34 basis points compared to 2.61 percent for the comparable period in 2020. The decrease in net interest margin reflected the decline in the average 30-day LIBOR, from 0.64 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 to 0.10 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. 

Average earning assets increased $7.6 billion, due to increases of $7.3 billion in interest-bearing deposits with banks and $2.5 billion in investment securities, partially offset by a $2.2 billion decrease in loans. Average interest-bearing funding sources decreased $153 million, reflecting a $3.7 billion decrease in medium- and long-term debt and a $416 million decrease in short-term borrowings, mostly offset by a $4.0 billion increase in interest-bearing deposits. 

For further discussion of the effects of market rates on net interest income, refer to the "Market and Liquidity Risk" section of this financial review. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $359 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to an expense of $554 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The change in provision for credit losses reflected the economy re-opening as well as improvements in the economic forecast and in the loan portfolio, including Energy, since the onset of the pandemic last year. Net loan recoveries were $6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to net loan charge-offs of $167 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, largely driven by a decrease of $150 million in Energy net charge-offs. 

An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets is presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.

(a) Beginning with the first quarter 2021, the Corporation reported customer derivative income, previously a component of other noninterest income, and foreign exchange income as a combined item captioned by derivative income on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Prior periods have been adjusted to conform to this presentation and the changes in presentation do not impact total noninterest income. 

(b) The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income. 

&#160; Noninterest income increased $98 million to $834 million, including increases in card fees, derivative income, syndication agent fees (component of commercial lending fees) and higher fiduciary income. The increase in card fees resulted from higher activity mostly related to stimulus payments and merchant payment processing services, while the increase in derivative income was primarily due to favorable valuation adjustments partially offset by a decrease in interest rate swap activity. Noninterest income was also impacted by an increase in other noninterest income, as detailed below, driven by higher income from principal investing and warrants, mostly offset by lower securities trading income. 

The following table presents certain categories included in other noninterest income on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2021 2020 Income from principal investing and warrants $ 22 $ 1 Deferred compensation asset returns (a) 9 7 Investment banking fees 9 9 Securities trading income (b) 1 20 All other noninterest income 29 28 Other noninterest income $ 70 $ 65 

(a) Compensation deferred by the Corporation's officers and directors is invested based on investment selections of the officers and directors. Income earned on these assets is reported in other noninterest income and the offsetting change in deferred compensation plan liabilities is reported in salaries and benefits expense. 

(b) Includes changes in value of shares obtained through exercise of warrants. 

Noninterest Expenses 

Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2021 2020 Salaries and benefits expense $ 841 $ 748 Outside processing fee expense 200 177 Occupancy expense 117 114 Software expense 117 115 Equipment expense 38 36 Advertising expense 25 24 FDIC insurance expense 17 24 Other noninterest expenses (a) 20 51 Total noninterest expenses (a) $ 1,375 $ 1,289 

(a) The nine months ended September 30, 2020 has been recast to reflect the retrospective application of the Corporation's election to change the accounting method for certain components of expense related to the defined pension plan, resulting in a decrease of $22 million from the previously reported balances. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information and impacts of the change in accounting policy. 

Noninterest expenses increased $86 million to $1.4 billion, due to increases in salaries and benefits expense and outside processing fee expense, partially offset by decreases in other noninterest expenses and lower FDIC insurance expense. The increase in salaries and benefits expense reflected higher performance-related compensation driven by strong financial 

results. Higher technology-related labor costs (related to contract labor) and staff insurance (from elevated claims) also contributed to the increase in salaries and benefits expense. The increase in outside processing fee expense was primarily due to higher volumes of government card transactions (tied to card fee revenue) and data processing support for PPP loans. The decrease in other noninterest expenses was driven by lower non-salary pension expense and operational losses, partially offset by higher litigation-related expenses and consulting fees. 

Provision for Income Taxes 

The provision for income taxes increased $202 million to $261 million, driven by higher pre-tax income, partially offset by an increase in certain discrete tax benefits. Discrete tax benefits were $9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, primarily resulting from adjustments to annual federal filings, resolution of certain state matters and compensation benefits, compared to $3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. 

OUTLOOK 

This outlook is based on management expectations for continued improvement in economic conditions. 

Fourth Quarter 2021 Compared to Third Quarter 2021 Average loans &#8226; Non-PPP portfolio to have growth in general Middle Market and several other business lines, partly offset by a decline in Mortgage Banker Finance. This growth is expected to be more than offset by forgiveness of the bulk of PPP loans. 

Average deposits &#8226; Deposits to remain strong. 

Net interest income &#8226; Non-PPP portfolio to have lower loan fees from elevated levels mostly offset by loan growth; this is expected to be more than offset by lower PPP-related income. 

Credit quality &#8226; Strong credit quality continues. 

Noninterest income &#8226; Growth in several customer-related fee categories, more than offset by lower commercial loan fees and warrant and BOLI income. 

Noninterest expenses &#8226; Increases in seasonal expenses and technology investments, offset by lower compensation expense from elevated level. 

Tax rate &#8226; Income tax expense for full-year 2021 to be between 22 and 23 percent of pre-tax income, excluding discrete items. 

Capital &#8226; CET1 target of approximately 10 percent. 

STRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESS AND MARKETS 

The Corporation has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments: the Commercial Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, the Finance Division is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes items not directly associated with the business segments or the Finance segment. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Market segment results are also provided for the Corporation's three primary geographic markets: Michigan, California and Texas. In addition to the three primary geographic markets, Other Markets is also reported as a market segment. Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of the business and market segments for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. 

The Corporation's management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. These methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines. Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation's 2020 Annual Report describes the Corporation's segment reporting methodology. 

Net interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities plus the net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing (FTP). The FTP methodology 

allocates credits to each business segment for deposits and other funds provided as well as charges for loans and other assets being funded. FTP crediting rates on deposits and other funds provided reflect the long-term value of deposits and other funding sources based on their implied maturities. Due to the longer-term nature of implied maturities, FTP crediting rates are generally less volatile than changes in interest rates observed in the market. FTP charge rates for funding loans and other assets reflect a matched cost of funds based on the pricing and duration characteristics of the assets. As a result of applying matched funding, interest revenue for each segment resulting from loans and other assets is generally not impacted by changes in interest rates. Therefore, net interest income for each segment primarily reflects the volume of loans and other earning assets at the spread over the matched cost of funds, as well as the volume of deposits at the associated FTP crediting rates. Due to the impact of lower interest rates, business segments, particularly those focused on generating deposits, were impacted by lower FTP crediting rates on deposits in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year. Similarly, FTP charges for funding loans decreased in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to the same period in the prior year. 

Business Segments 

The following sections present a summary of the performance of each of the Corporation's business segments for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year. The nine months ended September 30, 2021 has been recast to reflect the retrospective application of the Corporation's election to change the accounting method for certain components of expense related to the defined pension plan. Further information about the change in accounting methodology is presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Third Quarter 2021 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2020 

Period-End Balances 

Total assets increased $6.4 billion to $94.5 billion, driven by increases of $7.8 billion in interest-bearing deposits with banks and $1.8 billion in investment securities, partially offset by a decrease of $4.1 billion in loans, which included a $2.5 billion decline in PPP loans. Mortgage-backed securities increased $3.0 billion due to continued deployment of excess liquidity, partially offset by a $1.2 billion decrease in Treasury securities related to maturities. The decline in loans included decreases of $1.9 billion in National Dealer Services as a result of low inventories, $968 million in Mortgage Banker Finance from elevated activity in 2020 and $615 million in Business Banking, primarily due to PPP forgiveness. Excluding the impact of PPP loans, period-end loans declined $1.6 billion, primarily from decreases of $1.8 billion in National Dealer Service and $968 million in Mortgage Banker Finance, partially offset by increases of $719 million in general Middle Market and $418 million in Environmental Services. 

Total liabilities increased $6.6 billion to $86.7 billion, primarily reflecting increases of $4.7 billion each in interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by the repayment of $2.8 billion in floating-rate Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances during the first quarter. The deposit growth reflected increases in nearly every business line as commercial customers generated increased cash, while consumer customers continued to conserve cash from government stimulus payments. 

Average Balances 

Total assets increased $6.0 billion to $91.4 billion due to increases of $7.4 billion in interest-bearing deposits with banks and $1.1 billion in investment securities, partially offset by a $3.3 billion decrease in loans. The following table provides information about the change in the Corporation's average loan portfolio by loan type and geographic market.

(a) Included PPP loans of $1.7 billion and $3.7 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

The decrease in loans, which included a $2.0 billion decline in PPP loans, was primarily driven by declines in National Dealer Services, Mortgage Banker Finance and Business Banking, partially offset by an increase in Equity Fund Services. National Dealer Services continues to be impacted by supply chain issues resulting in low inventory levels. Excluding the impact of PPP loans, average loans declined $1.3 billion as a result of decreases in National Dealer Services and Mortgage Banker Finance, partially offset by increases in general Middle Market and Equity Fund Services. 

Total liabilities increased $6.0 billion to $83.4 billion, reflecting increases of $5.2 billion and $3.6 billion in noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits, respectively, partially offset by a decrease of $2.9 billion in medium- and long-term debt due to the repayment of $2.8 billion in floating-rate FHLB advances during the first quarter. The deposit growth reflected increases in nearly every business line as customers continue to conserve cash.

(b) Includes approximately 59,000 shares purchased pursuant to deferred compensation plans and shares purchased from employees to pay for taxes related to restricted stock vesting under the terms of an employee share-based compensation plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2021. These transactions are not considered part of the Corporation's repurchase program. 

On April 27, 2021 the Corporation's Board of Directors approved the authorization to repurchase up to an additional 10 million shares of its outstanding common stock, including an Accelerated Share Repurchase transaction (ASR) effected in the second quarter of 2021. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in 2010, a total of 97.2 million shares have been authorized for repurchase. There is no expiration date for the share repurchase program. The timing and actual amount of additional share repurchases are subject to various factors, including the Corporation's earnings generation, capital needs to fund future loan growth and market conditions. 

The Corporation continues to target a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of approximately 10 percent with continued active capital management. At September 30, 2021, the Corporation's estimated CET1 capital ratio was 10.21 percent. While the Corporation elected regulatory relief to defer the impact of adopting the CECL model for measuring credit losses on regulatory capital, there was no estimated deferral amount at September 30, 2021. 

The following table presents the minimum ratios required. 

Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 4.5 % Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 6.0 Total capital to risk-weighted assets 8.0 Capital conservation buffer (a) 2.5 Tier 1 capital to adjusted average assets (leverage ratio) 4.0 

(a) In addition to the minimum risk-based capital requirements, the Corporation is required to maintain a minimum capital conservation buffer, in the form of common equity, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses. 

The Corporation's capital ratios exceeded minimum regulatory requirements as follows: 

September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 (dollar amounts in millions) Capital/Assets Ratio Capital/Assets Ratio Common equity tier 1 (a), (b) $ 6,965 10.21 % $ 6,919 10.34 % Tier 1 risk-based (a), (b) 7,359 10.79 7,313 10.93 Total risk-based (a) 8,529 12.51 8,833 13.20 Leverage (a) 7,359 8.08 7,313 8.63 Common shareholders' equity 7,409 7.84 7,656 8.69 Tangible common equity (b) 6,762 7.20 7,020 8.02 Risk-weighted assets (a) 68,193 66,931 

(a) September 30, 2021 capital, risk-weighted assets and ratios are estimated. Ratios reflect deferral of CECL model impact as calculated per regulatory guidance. The deferred amounts were zero at September 30, 2021 (estimated) and $72 million at December 31, 2020.

RISK MANAGEMENT 

The following updated information should be read in conjunction with the "Risk Management" section on pages F-22 through F-38 in the Corporation's 2020 Annual Report. 

Credit Risk 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. As a percentage of total loans, the allowance for credit losses was 1.33 percent at September 30, 2021, compared to 1.90 percent at December 31, 2020. Excluding $1.0 billion in PPP loans, which are guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, the allowance for credit losses was 1.35 percent of total loans at September 30, 2021, compared to 2.03 percent at December 31, 2020. The allowance for credit losses covered 2.2 times and 2.8 times total nonperforming loans at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

The allowance for credit losses decreased $353 million from $992 million at December 31, 2020 to $639 million at September 30, 2021, primarily reflecting a sustained recovery by the U.S. economy from the COVID-19 pandemic and benefits of mitigating actions by the U.S. government. Despite a slowdown in consumer spending driven by the Delta variant, strong business spending and improved labor markets supported growth in the broader U.S. economy. However, there continues to be uncertainty related to the impact of emerging COVID-19 variants and lagging vaccination rates, supply chain constraints, future monetary and fiscal support and inflationary pressures. 

These factors shaped the 2-year reasonable and supportable forecasts used by the Corporation in its CECL estimate at September 30, 2021. The U.S. economy is expected to continue to grow at an accelerated pace through the first half of 2022 before normalizing into historical growth rates. Forecasts for other key economic variables, including the unemployment rate and oil prices, are generally in line with GDP projections. Interest rates remain low, reflecting the Federal Reserve's expectation that rates will remain at current levels in the near-to mid-term, while corporate bond rates reflect normalized default risk. The following table summarizes select economic variables representative of the economic forecasts used to develop the allowance for credit losses estimate at September 30, 2021. 

Economic Variable Base Forecast Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth Growth peaks at 6.7 percent in fourth quarter 2021, before gradually declining to a long-term rate of 2 to 3 percent by third quarter 2022. Unemployment rate Current levels decrease to 4 percent by third quarter 2022 with minimal change through the remainder of the forecast period. Corporate BBB bond to 10-year Treasury bond spreads Spreads gradually increase to 1.8 percent by the end of the forecast period. Oil Prices Prices gradually decrease from current levels to $62 per barrel by the end of the forecast period. 

Due to the high level of uncertainty regarding significant assumptions, such as the ultimate impact of the global pandemic, the Corporation evaluated a range of economic scenarios, including more benign and more severe economic forecasts. In the more severe scenario, real GDP is expected to contract through second quarter 2022, gradually improving to a growth rate of 4.5 percent by the end of the forecast period. Other key economic variables follow a similar pattern of short-term contractions followed by a gradual recovery. Selecting the more severe forecast would result in an increase in the quantitative calculation of allowance for credit losses by approximately $162 million as of September 30, 2021. However, factoring in model overlays and qualitative adjustments could result in a materially different estimate under a more severe scenario. 

Allowance for Loan Losses 

The allowance for loan losses represents management&#8217;s estimates of current expected credit losses in the Corporation&#8217;s loan portfolio. Pools of loans with similar risk characteristics are collectively evaluated, while loans that no longer share risk characteristics with loan pools are evaluated individually. 

Collective loss estimates are determined by applying reserve factors, designed to estimate current expected credit losses, to amortized cost balances over the remaining contractual life of the collectively evaluated portfolio. Loans with similar risk characteristics are aggregated into homogeneous pools. The allowance for loan losses also includes qualitative adjustments to bring the allowance to the level management believes is appropriate based on factors that have not otherwise been fully accounted for, including adjustments for foresight risk, input imprecisions and model imprecision. Credit losses for loans that no longer share risk characteristics with the loan pools are estimated on an individual basis. Individual credit loss estimates are typically performed for nonaccrual loans and modified loans classified as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) and are based on one of several methods, including the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, observable market value of similar debt or the present value of expected cash flows. 

The following table presents metrics of the allowance for loan losses and nonperforming loans. 

September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans 1.26 % 1.81 % Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans excluding PPP loans 1.29 1.94 Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans 0.61 0.67 Allowance for loan losses as a multiple of total nonperforming loans 2.1x 2.7x 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Lending-Related Commitments 

The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments estimates current expected credit losses on collective pools of letters of credit and unused commitments to extend credit based on reserve factors, determined in a manner similar to business loans, multiplied by a probability of draw estimate based on historical experience and credit risk, applied to commitment amounts. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments totaled $30 million and $44 million at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

For additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses, refer to the "Critical Accounting Policies" section and pages F-57 through F-59 in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation's 2020 Annual Report. 

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, TDRs which have been renegotiated to less than the original contractual rates (reduced-rate loans) and foreclosed assets. TDRs include performing and nonperforming loans, with nonperforming TDRs on either nonaccrual or reduced-rate status. In accordance with the provisions of the CARES Act, the Corporation elected not to consider qualifying COVID-19-related modifications, primarily deferrals, as TDRs and does not designate such loans as past due or nonaccrual. For additional information regarding the Corporation's accounting policies for the CARES Act, refer to page F-56 in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation's 2020 Annual Report. 

The following table presents a summary of nonperforming assets and past due loans.

0.62 0.69 Allowance for credit losses as a multiple of total nonperforming loans 2.2x 2.8x Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing $ 12 $ 45 

Nonperforming assets decreased $63 million to $296 million at September 30, 2021, from $359 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease in nonperforming assets primarily reflected an $86 million decrease in nonperforming Energy loans, which are a component of commercial loans. 

As of September 30, 2021, COVID-19-related payment deferrals, which consisted of residential mortgages, totaled $35 million, or 0.07 percent of total loans. Initial deferrals have expired and new requests have been nominal as customers continue to adjust to the new environment, resulting in a $107 million decrease in deferrals since fourth quarter 2020. Loans with COVID-19-related deferred payments on a third or later deferral, primarily residential mortgages, totaled $ 33 million at September 30, 2021 and would generally be considered TDRs if not for the provisions in the CARES Act. 

The following table presents a summary of TDRs at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest generally represent loans that are well collateralized and in the process of collection. Loans past due 90 days or more decreased $33 million to $12 million at September 30, 2021, compared to $45 million at December 31, 2020. Loans past due 30-89 days decreased $235 million to $169 million at September 30, 2021, compared to $404 million at December 31, 2020. Loans past due 30 days or more and still accruing interest as a percentage of total loans were 0.38 percent and 0.86 percent at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. An aging analysis of loans included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements provides further information about the balances comprising past due loans. 

The following table presents a summary of total criticized loans. The Corporation's criticized list is consistent with the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful categories defined by regulatory authorities. Criticized loans with balances of $2 million or more on nonaccrual status or loans with balances of $1 million or more whose terms have been modified in a TDR are individually subjected to quarterly credit quality reviews, and the Corporation may establish specific allowances for such loans. A table of loans by credit quality indicator included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements provides further information about the balances comprising total criticized loans. 

(dollar amounts in millions) September 30, 2021 June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Total criticized loans $ 1,818 $ 2,176 $ 2,947 As a percentage of total loans 3.8 % 4.3 % 5.6 % 

The $1.1 billion decrease in criticized loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 included decreases of $448 million in Energy and $521 million in general Middle Market. 

Concentrations of Credit Risk 

Concentrations of credit risk may exist when a number of borrowers are engaged in similar activities, or activities in the same geographic region, and have similar economic characteristics that would cause them to be similarly impacted by changes in economic or other conditions. The Corporation has concentrations of credit risk with the commercial real estate and automotive industries. All other industry concentrations, as defined by management, individually represented less than 10 percent of total loans at September 30, 2021. 

Commercial Real Estate Lending 

The following table summarizes the Corporation's commercial real estate loan portfolio by loan category. 

September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 (in millions) Commercial Real Estate business line (a) Other (b) Total Commercial Real Estate business line (a) Other (b) Total Real estate construction loans $ 2,488 $ 522 $ 3,010 $ 3,657 $ 425 $ 4,082 Commercial mortgage loans 3,413 7,802 11,215 2,273 7,639 9,912 Total commercial real estate $ 5,901 $ 8,324 $ 14,225 $ 5,930 $ 8,064 $ 13,994 

(a) Primarily loans to real estate developers. 

(b) Primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate. 

The Corporation limits risk inherent in its commercial real estate lending activities by monitoring borrowers directly involved in the commercial real estate markets and adhering to conservative policies on loan-to-value ratios for such loans. Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $14.2 billion at September 30, 2021. Of the total, $5.9 billion, or 41 percent, were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which includes loans to real estate developers, a decrease of $29 million compared to December 31, 2020. Commercial real estate loans in other business lines totaled $8.3 billion, or 59 percent, at September 30, 2021, an increase of $260 million compared to December 31, 2020. These loans consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages, which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans. Generally, loans previously reported as real estate construction are classified as commercial mortgage loans upon receipt of a certificate of occupancy. During the second and third quarters 2021, the Corporation performed an in-depth review of the status of these loans which resulted in $1.2 billion of loans previously reported as real estate construction to be classified as commercial mortgage loans as of September 30, 2021. 

The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-tenured customers with satisfactory completion experience. Criticized real estate construction loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $30 million and $27 million at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. In other business lines, criticized real estate construction loans totaled $36 million at September 30, 2021, compared to $20 million at December 31, 2020. There were no real estate construction loan charge-offs in either of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021 or 2020. 

Commercial mortgage loans are loans where the primary collateral is a lien on any real property and are primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate. Real property is generally considered primary collateral if the value of that 

collateral represents more than 50 percent of the commitment at loan approval. Loans in the commercial mortgage portfolio generally mature within three to five years. Criticized commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $68 million and $73 million at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. In other business lines, $270 million and $440 million of commercial mortgage loans were criticized at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Commercial mortgage loan net charge-offs were zero for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to net recoveries of $3 million for the same period in 2020. 

Automotive Lending - Dealer 

The following table presents a summary of dealer loans. 

September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 (in millions) Loans Outstanding Percent of Total Loans Loans Outstanding Percent of Total Loans Dealer: Floor plan $ 555 $ 2,344 Other 3,190 3,348 Total dealer $ 3,745 7.8 % $ 5,692 10.9 % 

Substantially all dealer loans are in the National Dealer Services business line and primarily include floor plan financing and other loans to automotive dealerships. Floor plan loans, included in commercial loans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, totaled $555 million at September 30, 2021, a decrease of $1.8 billion compared to $2.3 billion at December 31, 2020, due to an imbalance in supply and demand impacted by a shortage in microchips used in automotive production. Other loans to automotive dealers in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $3.2 billion, including $2.0 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans at both September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

There were no nonaccrual dealer loans at both September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Additionally, there were no net charge-offs of dealer loans in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to $2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. 

Automotive Lending- Production 

The following table presents a summary of loans to borrowers involved with automotive production. 

September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 (in millions) Loans Outstanding (a) Percent of Total Loans Loans Outstanding (a) Percent of Total Loans Production: Domestic $ 819 $ 791 Foreign 318 302 Total production $ 1,137 2.4 % $ 1,093 2.1 % 

(a) Excludes PPP loans. 

Loans to borrowers involved with automotive production, primarily Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers, totaled $1.1 billion at both September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. These borrowers have faced, and could face in the future, financial difficulties due to disruptions in auto production as well as their supply chains and logistics operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, management continued to monitor this portfolio and allocated reserves for this portfolio at September 30, 2021 were relatively stable. 

There were no nonaccrual loans to borrowers involved with automotive production at September 30, 2021, compared to $7 million at December 31, 2020. Criticized automotive production loans were 12 percent of the automotive production portfolio at September 30, 2021, compared to 24 percent at December 31, 2020. Automotive production loan net charge-offs totaled $7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to $1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. 

Residential Real Estate Lending 

At September 30, 2021, residential real estate loans represented 7 percent of total loans. The following table summarizes the Corporation's residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolios by geographic market. 

September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 (dollar amounts in millions) Residential Mortgage Loans % of Total Home Equity Loans % of Total Residential Mortgage Loans % of Total Home Equity Loans % of Total Geographic market: Michigan $ 450 25 % $ 500 32 % $ 428 23 % $ 540 34 % California 903 50 666 43 927 51 655 41 Texas 241 13 330 21 254 14 328 21 Other Markets 219 12 61 4 221 12 65 4 Total $ 1,813 100 % $ 1,557 100 % $ 1,830 100 % $ 1,588 100 % 

Residential real estate loans, which consist of traditional residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit, totaled $3.4 billion at September 30, 2021. The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation's primary geographic markets. Substantially all residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more are placed on nonaccrual status, and substantially all junior lien home equity loans that are current or less than 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual status if full collection of the senior position is in doubt. At no later than 180 days past due, such loans are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell. 

Residential mortgages totaled $1.8 billion at September 30, 2021, and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the $1.8 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, $35 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2021. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.6 billion at September 30, 2021, of which 95 percent was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit, 4 percent were in amortizing status and 1 percent were closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.6 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $12 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2021. A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens at September 30, 2021. 

Energy Lending 

The Corporation has a portfolio of Energy loans that are included entirely in commercial loans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Customers in the Corporation's Energy business line (approximately 120 relationships) are engaged in three segments of the oil and gas business: exploration and production (E&#38;P), midstream and energy services. E&#38;P generally includes such activities as searching for potential oil and gas fields, drilling exploratory wells and operating active wells. Commitments to E&#38;P borrowers are generally subject to semi-annual borrowing base re-determinations based on a variety of factors including updated prices (reflecting market and competitive conditions), energy reserve levels and the impact of hedging. The midstream sector is generally involved in the transportation, storage and marketing of crude and/or refined oil and gas products. The Corporation's energy services customers provide products and services primarily to the E&#38;P segment. 

The following table summarizes information about loans in the Corporation's Energy business line.

Loans in the Energy business line totaled $1.3 billion, or 3 percent of total loans, at September 30, 2021, a decrease of $323 million compared to December 31, 2020. Total exposure, including unused commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, was $2.9 billion at September 30, 2021 (a utilization rate of 44 percent) and $3.1 billion at December 31, 2020, respectively. 

Net credit-related Energy recoveries were $16 million and $29 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to net charge-offs of $9 million and $121 million for comparable periods in 2020. Nonaccrual Energy loans decreased $86 million to $28 million at September 30, 2021, compared to December 31, 2020. Criticized Energy loans decreased $448 million to $148 million, or 8 percent of total criticized loans, at September 30, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020. 

Leveraged Loans 

Certain loans in the Corporation's commercial portfolio are considered leveraged transactions. These loans are typically used for mergers, acquisitions, business recapitalizations, refinancing and equity buyouts. To help mitigate the risk associated with these loans, the Corporation focuses on middle market companies with highly capable management teams, strong sponsors and solid track records of financial performance. Industries prone to cyclical downturns and acquisitions with a high degree of integration risk are generally avoided. Other considerations include the sufficiency of collateral, the level of balance sheet leverage and the adequacy of financial covenants. During the underwriting process, cash flows are stress-tested to evaluate the borrowers' abilities to handle economic downturns and an increase in interest rates. 

The FDIC defines higher-risk commercial and industrial (HR C&#38;I) loans for assessment purposes as loans generally with leverage of four times total debt to earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation (EBITDA) as well as three times senior debt to EBITDA, excluding certain collateralized loans. 

The following table summarizes information about HR C&#38;I loans, which represented 5 percent of total loans at both September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Other Sectors Most at Risk due to Economic Stress Resulting from COVID-19 Impacts 

As the economy recovers, aided by additional stimulus packages and positive momentum in the vaccine rollout, the Corporation has continued to monitor the lingering impacts of the pandemic on its customers. In addition to the energy, automotive production and leveraged loan portfolios, the Corporation considers the following sectors of its loan portfolio to be most vulnerable to financial risks from business disruptions caused by the pandemic spread mitigation efforts. For further discussion, see Item 1.A "Risk Factors" on page 13 of the Corporation's 2020 Annual Report.

Market and Liquidity Risk 

Market risk represents the risk of loss due to adverse movement in prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. Liquidity risk represents the risk that the Corporation does not have sufficient access to funds to maintain its normal operations at all times, or does not have the ability to raise or borrow funds at a reasonable cost at all times. 

The Asset and Liability Policy Committee (ALCO) of the Corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities. ALCO meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the Corporation, including treasury, finance, economics, lending, deposit gathering and risk management. Corporate Treasury 

mitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of ALCO through the actions it takes to manage the Corporation's market, liquidity and capital positions. 

In addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis, Corporate Treasury also monitors the parent company's liquidity and has established limits for the minimum number of months into the future in which the parent company can meet existing and forecasted obligations without the support of additional dividends from subsidiaries. ALCO's liquidity policy requires the parent company to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet expected capital and debt obligations with a target of 24 months but no less than 18 months. 

Corporate Treasury and the Enterprise Risk Division support ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks. Key activities encompass: (i) providing information and analyses of the Corporation's balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks; (ii) monitoring and reporting of the Corporation's positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines; (iii) developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions; (iv) reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval; and (v) monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks. 

Interest Rate Risk 

Net interest income is the primary source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities, primarily through the Corporation's core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by core deposits. Including the impact of interest rate swaps converting floating-rate loans to fixed, the Corporation's loan composition at September 30, 2021 was 59 percent 30-day LIBOR, 6 percent other LIBOR (primarily 60-and 90-day), 12 percent prime and 23 percent fixed rate. Additionally, 31 percent of loans had non-zero interest rate floors protecting against future rate declines. The composition of the loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the faster repricing of the floating-rate loan portfolio versus deposit products. In addition, the growth and/or contraction in the Corporation's loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing fixed-rate investment securities, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity, as well as hedging with interest rate swaps and options. Other mitigating factors include interest rate floors on a portion of the loan portfolio. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity. 

Since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives, a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk. These techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve utilizing multiple simulation analyses. Simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors, including, but not limited to, the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, regulatory impacts and management strategies. 

Sensitivity of Net Interest Income to Changes in Interest Rates 

The analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is management's principal risk management technique. Management models a base-case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment. Existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes as of the balance sheet dates are included in the analysis, but no additional hedging is forecasted. At September 30, 2021, these derivative instruments comprise interest rate swaps that convert $2.7 billion of fixed-rate medium- and long-term debt to variable rates through fair value hedges and convert $5.3 billion of variable-rate loans to fixed rates through cash flow hedges. Additionally, included in this analysis are $15.1 billion of loans that were subject to an average interest rate floor of 0.7 percent at September 30, 2021. This base-case net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which short-term rates rise or decline 100 basis points (with a floor of zero percent) in a linear, non-parallel fashion from the base case over 12 months, resulting in an average change of 50 basis points over the period while long-term rates increase or decrease to a lesser degree. 

Each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth, investment security prepayment levels, depositor behavior, yield curve changes, loan and deposit pricing, and overall balance sheet mix and growth which are in line with historical patterns. However, in this low rate environment, depositors have maintained a higher level of liquidity and their historical behavior may be less indicative of future trends. As a result, the rising rate scenario reflects a greater decrease in deposits than we have experienced historically as rates rise. Changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis. 

The table below, as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above. 

Estimated Annual Change September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 (dollar amounts in millions) Amount % Amount % Change in Interest Rates: Change in Interest Rates: Rising 100 basis points $ 188 11 % Rising 100 basis points 

$ 161 9 % Declining to zero percent (41) (2) Declining to zero percent 

(34) (2) 

Sensitivity to declining interest rates remained steady from December 31, 2020 to September 30, 2021 due to offsetting changes in balance sheet composition, as well as limited remaining downward movement in rates before hitting zero percent floors. Sensitivity to rising interest rates slightly increased due to forgiveness of fixed-rate PPP loans and higher deposit volumes, partially offset by the growth of floating-rate loans with floors as well as a larger securities portfolio. 

Sensitivity of Economic Value of Equity to Changes in Interest Rates 

In addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income, an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position. The economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the Corporation's financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period, and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements. The Corporation primarily monitors the percentage change on the base-case economic value of equity. The economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel 100 basis point shock with a floor of zero percent. 

The table below, as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above. 

September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 (dollar amounts in millions) Amount % Amount % Change in Interest Rates: Change in Interest Rates: Rising 100 basis points $ 1,475 10 % Rising 100 basis points $ 1,793 18 % Declining to zero percent (417) (3) Declining to zero percent (551) (6) 

The sensitivity of the economic value of equity to rising rates decreased from December 31, 2020 to September 30, 2021 due primarily to duration extension and balance growth in the securities portfolio. Sensitivity to declining rates decreased due to the changes in the securities portfolio and is limited by the assumption of a zero percent rate floor. 

LIBOR Transition 

On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. Effective March 2021, the FCA confirmed that certain LIBOR tenors will no longer be supported after December 31, 2021 and that the remaining tenors, including those most commonly used by the Corporation, will cease to be supported after June 30, 2023. The Corporation has substantial exposure to LIBOR-based products, including loans, securities, derivatives and hedges, and is preparing for a transition from LIBOR toward alternative rates. 

As of July 1, 2021, the Corporation was operationally ready to issue new Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)-based cash and derivative products. Additionally, as of September 30, 2021, the Corporation was operationally ready to issue new Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index (BSBY)-based cash and derivative products. The Corporation is prepared for the cessation of the LIBOR tenors as announced by the FCA and will cease originating LIBOR-based products in the fourth quarter of 2021. Communications and learning activities to support customers and colleagues are ongoing. 

The Corporation's enterprise transition timelines are closely aligned with recommendations from the Alternative Reference Rates Committee for both best practices and recommended objectives. The Corporation will continue to align with industry and regulatory guidelines regarding the cessation of LIBOR as well as monitor market developments for transitioning to alternative reference rates. For a discussion of the various risks facing the Corporation in relation to the transition away from LIBOR, see the market risk discussion within &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; beginning on page 13 of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

Wholesale Funding 

The Corporation may access the purchased funds market when necessary, which includes a variety of funding sources. Capacity for incremental purchased funds at September 30, 2021 included short-term FHLB advances, the ability to purchase 

federal funds, sell securities under agreements to repurchase as well as issue deposits through brokers. Purchased funds decreased to $43 million at September 30, 2021 compared to $66 million at December 31, 2020. 

At September 30, 2021, the Bank had pledged loans totaling $20.4 billion which provided up to $16.4 billion of available collateralized borrowing with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB). 

The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Dallas, Texas, which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. At September 30, 2021, $ 18.6 billion of real estate-related loans and $ 2.4 billion of investment securities were pledged to the FHLB as collateral for potential future borrowings. The Corporation had capacity for potential future borrowings of approximately $ 11.7 billion. 

In April 2021, the Bank terminated a $15.0 billion note program, under which the Bank had the ability to issue up to $13.5 billion of debt at the time of termination. Outstanding notes issued under the program were unaffected by the termination. 

The Corporation maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission from which it may issue debt and/or equity securities. 

The ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise funds at competitive rates may be impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings of the Corporation and the Bank. As of September 30, 2021, the three major rating agencies had assigned the ratings below to long-term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

The Corporation satisfies liquidity needs with either liquid assets or various funding sources. Liquid assets totaled $36.8 billion and $25.9 billion at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Liquid assets include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits with banks, other short-term investments and unencumbered investment securities. 

The Corporation performs monthly liquidity stress testing to evaluate its ability to meet funding needs in hypothetical stressed environments. Such environments cover a series of broad events, distinguished in terms of duration and severity. The evaluation as of September 30, 2021 projected sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events. 

Total liquidity sources, comprised of liquid assets and remaining borrowing capacity with the FRB and the FHLB, totaled $64.9 billion at September 30, 2021. On a stand-alone basis, the Corporation had liquid assets of $716 million on an unconsolidated basis at September 30, 2021. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The Corporation&#8217;s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation's 2020 Annual Report. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation&#8217;s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2020, the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to the allowance for credit losses, fair value measurement, goodwill, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These policies were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully on pages F-39 through F-43 in the Corporation's 2020 Annual Report. As of the date of this report, there have been no significant changes to the Corporation's critical accounting policies or estimates, except for the MRVA methodology change described in Results of Operations and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements and the updates to the goodwill critical accounting policy outlined below. 

The Corporation performed the annual goodwill impairment test in third quarter 2021, resulting in the following updates to the critical accounting policy on page F-41 of the Corporation's 2020 Annual Report. 

Goodwill 

Goodwill is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level, equivalent to a business segment or one level below. The Corporation has three reporting units: the Commercial Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, goodwill totaled $635 million, including $473 million allocated to the Commercial Bank, $101 million allocated to the Retail Bank and $61 million allocated to Wealth Management. 

The annual test of goodwill impairment was performed as of the beginning of the third quarter 2021. The Corporation first assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. Qualitative factors included economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, regulatory developments and performance of the Corporation&#8217;s stock, among other events and circumstances. At the conclusion of the qualitative assessment in third quarter 2021, the Corporation determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. 

Qualitative factors considered in the analysis of each reporting unit incorporate current macroeconomic and market conditions, such as trends in key economic data and industry developments, effects of the global pandemic and ongoing recovery to the business, recent reporting unit financial performance and the impact of regulatory and legislative actions. Further weakening in the economic environment, such as a decline in the performance of the reporting units or other factors, could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below their carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Additionally, new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management's expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Any impairment charge would not affect the Corporation's regulatory capital ratios, tangible equity ratio or liquidity position. 

SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATA 

The Corporation believes non-GAAP measures are meaningful because they reflect adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and our performance trends. Tangible common equity is used by the Corporation to measure the quality of capital and the return relative to balance sheet risk. 

Common equity tier 1 capital ratio removes preferred stock from the Tier 1 capital ratio as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank regulations. The tangible common equity ratio removes the effect of intangible assets from capital and total assets. Tangible common equity per share of common stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders' equity per share of common stock. 

The following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and regulatory ratios used in this financial review with financial measures defined by GAAP.
