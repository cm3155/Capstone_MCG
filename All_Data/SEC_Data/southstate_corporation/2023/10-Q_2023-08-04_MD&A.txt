References to the &#8220;Bank&#8221; means SouthState Corporation&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiary, SouthState Bank, National Association, a national banking association. 

Overview 

&#8203; 

SouthState is a financial holding company headquartered in Winter Haven, Florida, and was incorporated under the laws of South Carolina in 1985. We provide a wide range of banking services and products to our customers through our Bank. The Bank operates SouthState|Duncan-Williams, a registered broker-dealer headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee that serves primarily institutional clients across the U.S. in the fixed income business. The Bank also operates SouthState Advisory, Inc., a wholly owned registered investment advisor, and CBI Holding Company, LLC (&#8220;CBI&#8221;), which in turn owns Corporate Billing, a transaction-based finance company headquartered in Decatur, Alabama that provides factoring, invoicing, collection and accounts receivable management services to transportation companies and automotive parts and service providers nationwide. The holding company also owns SSB Insurance Corp., a captive insurance subsidiary pursuant to Section 831(b) of the U.S. Tax Code. 

&#8203; 

At June 30, 2023, we had approximately $44.9 billion in assets and 5,162 full-time equivalent employees. Through our Bank branches, ATMs and online banking platforms, we provide our customers with a wide range of financial products and services, through a six (6) state footprint in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. These financial products and services include deposit accounts such as checking accounts, savings and time deposits of various types, safe deposit boxes, bank money orders, wire transfer and ACH services, brokerage services and alternative investment products such as annuities and mutual funds, trust and asset management services, loans of all types, including business loans, agriculture loans, real estate-secured (mortgage) loans, personal use loans, home improvement loans, automobile loans, manufactured housing loans, boat loans, credit cards, letters of credit, home equity lines of credit, treasury management services, and merchant services. 

&#8203; 

We also operate a correspondent banking and capital markets division within our national bank subsidiary, of which the majority of its bond salesmen, traders and operational personnel are housed in facilities located in Atlanta, Georgia, Memphis, Tennessee, Walnut Creek, California, and Birmingham, Alabama. This division&#8217;s primary revenue generating activities are related to its capital markets division, which includes commissions earned on fixed income security sales, fees from hedging services, loan brokerage fees and consulting fees for services related to these activities; and its correspondent banking division, which includes spread income earned on correspondent bank deposits (i.e., federal funds purchased) and correspondent bank checking account deposits and fees from safe-keeping activities, bond accounting services for correspondents, asset/liability consulting related activities, international wires, and other clearing and corporate checking account services. 

&#8203; 

We have pursued, and continue to pursue, a growth strategy that focuses on organic growth, supplemented by acquisitions of select financial institutions, or branches in certain market areas.

&#8203; 

The following discussion describes our results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and also analyzes our financial condition as of June 30, 2023 as compared to December 31, 2022 . Like most financial institutions, we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments. Our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits, on which we may pay interest. Consequently, one of the key measures of our success is the amount of our net interest income, or the difference between the income on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the expense on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits. Another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. 

&#160; 

Of course, there are risks inherent in all loans, as such, we maintain an allowance for credit losses, otherwise referred to herein as ACL, to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible. We establish and maintain this allowance by charging a provision for credit losses against our operating earnings. In the following discussion, we have included a detailed discussion of this process. 

&#8203; 

In addition to earning interest on our loans and investments, we earn income through fees and other services we charge to our customers. We incur costs in addition to interest expense on deposits and other borrowings, the largest of which is salaries and employee benefits. We describe the various components of this noninterest income and noninterest expense in the following discussion. 

&#8203; 

The following sections also identify significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements. We encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other statistical information also included in this report. 

Recent Events 

Regulatory Considerations 

&#8203; 

In response to the recent bank failures, the FDIC approved a notice of proposed rulemaking to implement a special assessment to recover the losses to the FDIC&#8217;s Deposit Insurance Fund. The FDIC is proposing to collect the special assessment at an annual rate of approximately 12.5 basis points over eight quarterly assessment periods beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2024. Under the proposal, the base for the special assessment will be equal to an insured depository institution&#8217;s (IDI&#8217;s) estimated uninsured deposits reported as of December 31, 2022, adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion. Under the current FDIC proposal, the Company estimates the special assessment will equate to a quarterly special assessment of $2.8 million, or $22.7 million for the two-year special assessment period, which would be recognized at the time the final rule is adopted. The special assessment rate is subject to change prior to any final rule depending on any adjustments to the loss estimate, mergers or failures, or amendments to reported estimates of uninsured deposits. 

&#8203; 

Liquidity and Capital 

&#8203; 

During 2023, the financial markets experienced some volatility in response to a small number of regional bank failures resulting from deposit runs generally related to high concentrations in particular customer segments, high levels of uninsured deposits and failures in interest rate risk management.

&#8203; 

Deposit flows are significantly influenced by general and local economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, internal pricing decisions and competition. Our deposits are primarily obtained from depositors located around our branch footprint, and we believe that we have attractive opportunities to capture additional retail and commercial deposits in our markets, in addition to having access to brokered deposits. At June 30, 2023, we had $36.7 billion in total deposits, of which approximately 71% were insured or collateralized. Our deposit base is comprised of 1.5 million accounts with an average deposit size of $25,000. Our top 10 and 20 deposit relationships represent 3% and 4%, respectively, of total deposits. 

&#8203; 

In addition to deposits, we have other contingency funding sources available to the Bank. At June 30, 2023, our Bank had a total FHLB credit facility of $7.8 billion, with $400.0 million in FHLB advances and $2.1 million in FHLB letters of credit outstanding at quarter-end, leaving $7.4 billion in availability on the FHLB credit facility. In addition, our Bank had $2.4 billion of credit available at the Federal Reserve Bank&#8217;s discount window and total federal funds credit lines of $300.0 million with no balances outstanding at quarter-end. The Bank also has an internal limit on brokered deposits of 15% of total deposits which would allow capacity of $5.5 billion as of June 30, 2023. The Bank had $1.2 billion of outstanding brokered deposits at the end of the quarter leaving $4.3 billion in available capacity. All of these resources would provide an additional $14.1 billion in funding if the Bank needed additional liquidity. In addition, the Bank also has $4.1 billion in unpledged securities at June 30, 2023 that can be pledged to obtain additional funds, if necessary. The Company has a $100.0 million unsecured line of credit with U.S. Bank National Association with no balance outstanding at June 30, 2023. We believe that our liquidity position continues to be adequate and readily available .

&#8203; 

&#160; 

In addition to adequate liquidity, the Company and Bank are considered well capitalized by all regulatory capital standards as it was significantly above the required capital levels as of June 30, 2023. The Company&#8217;s tier 1 leverage ratio, CET 1 risk-based capital ratio and total risk-based capital ratio were 9.17%, 11.25% and 13.48%, respectively, at June 30, 2023. The Bank&#8217;s Tier 1 leverage ratio, CET 1 risk-based capital ratio and total risk-based capital ratio were 9.81%, 12.04% and 13.18%, respectively, at June 30, 2023. As permitted, we elected to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income related to available for sale securities from Tier 1, CET 1 and total risk-based capital; however, even if our unrealized losses as of June 30, 2023 in our available for sale and held to maturity investment portfolios were recognized by selling the portfolios for liquidity purposes, all else being equal, our regulatory capital ratios would remain well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; regulatory classification. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

&#8203; 

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and follow general practices within the banking industry. Our financial position and results of operations are affected by management&#8217;s application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. Differences in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations and related disclosures. Understanding our accounting policies is fundamental to understanding our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. Accordingly, our significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 2 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 &#8212; Recent Accounting and Regulatory Pronouncements of our consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Results of Operations 

&#8203; 

Overview 

&#8203; 

We reported consolidated net income of $123.4 million, or diluted earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) of $1.62, for the second quarter of 2023 as compared to consolidated net income of $119.2 million, or diluted EPS of $1.57, in the comparable period of 2022, a 3.6% increase in consolidated net income and a 3.2% increase in diluted EPS. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we reported consolidated net income of $263.4 million, or diluted earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) of $1.62, as compared to consolidated net income of $219.5 million, or diluted EPS of $2.96, in the comparable period of 2022, a 20.0% increase in consolidated net income and a 16.4% increase in diluted EPS. The $4.3 million increase in consolidated net income for the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same period of 2022 was the net result of the following items: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; A $151.7 million increase in interest income, resulting from a $147.4 million increase in interest income from loans, a $1.8 million increase in interest income from investment securities and a $2.5 million increase in interest income from federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell and interest-bearing deposits. These increases were due to the increase in yields in all categories of interest-earning assets in the current rising rate environment as the Federal Reserve Bank has raised it federal funds rate 500 basis points in 2022 and the first six months of 2023. The increase in interest income is also due to the increase in the average balance of loans of $4.0 billion through organic loan growth; &#9679; A $105.8 million increase in interest expense, which resulted from a $95.9 million increase in interest expense from deposits, a $2.7 million increase in interest expense in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and a $7.2 million increase in interest expense from corporate and subordinated debentures and other borrowings. These increases in expense resulted mainly from an increase in costs of all categories of interest-bearing liabilities as interest rates have increased in 2022 and 2023. The increase in average cost of interest-bearing liabilities was particularly felt in 2023 with the stress in financial markets and liquidity as the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 133 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2022; &#8203; 

&#160; 

&#9679; A $19.0 million increase in the provision for allowance for credit losses, as the Company recorded provision for credit losses of $38.4 million during the second quarter of 2023 while recording a provision for credit losses of $19.3 million in the second quarter of 2022. In the second quarter of 2023, we recorded a higher provision for credit losses as economic forecasts reflected the continued stress of inflation and rising interest rates that began in 2022; &#9679; A $9.5 million decrease in noninterest income, primarily from a decline in mortgage banking income of $1.1 million, correspondent banking and capital market income of $6.9 million and SBA income of $1.5 million. (See Noninterest Income section on page 56 for further discussion); &#9679; An $11.5 million increase in noninterest expense, which resulted primarily from an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $10.3 million, in FDIC assessment and other regulatory charges of $4.5 million and in other noninterest expense of $2.2 million driven by an increase in business development and staff related expense of $1.8 million, an increase in expense related to our earnings credit program for certain deposit accounts of $1.8 million partially offset by a decline in check and digital fraud charges of $1.2 million. These increases were offset by declines in merger, branch consolidation and severance related expense of $3.6 million and amortization of intangibles of $1.8 million (See Noninterest Expense section on page 58 for further discussion; and &#9679; A $1.6 million increase in the provision for income taxes primarily due to the change in pretax book income between the two quarters. The Company recorded pretax book income of $157.9 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to pretax book income of $152.1 million in the second quarter of 2022. Our effective tax rate was 21.84% for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to 21.66% for the three months ended June 30, 2022. &#8203; 

Our quarterly efficiency ratio improved to 53.6% in the second quarter of 2023 compared to 54.9% in the second quarter of 2022. The improvement in the efficiency ratio compared to the second quarter of 2022 was the result of the 8.6% increase in the total of tax-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income being greater than the increase in noninterest expense (excluding amortization of intangibles) of 6.0%. The increase in income was mainly due to a 14.0% increase in tax-equivalent net interest income reflective of the rising rate environment where our interest-earning assets repriced more quickly than our interest-bearing liabilities. 

&#8203; 

Basic and diluted EPS were $1.62 for the second quarter of 2023, compared to $1.58 and $1.57, respectively for the second quarter of 2022. The increase in basic and diluted EPS was due to a 3.6% increase in net income in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, partially offset by an increase in average basic common shares of 0.8%. The increase in net income was mainly due to the increase in net interest income resulting from the rising rate environment in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022.

&#8203; 

&#9679; For the three months ended June 30, 2023, the return on average assets increased compared to the same period in 2022. This increase was primarily due to the increase in net income of $4.3 million, or 3.6%, which was mainly attributable to higher net interest income of $45.9 million due to the increase in the yield on interest-earning assets in the rising rate environment. Average assets decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2023 from the same period in 2022 by $948.6 million, or 2.1%, as cash and cash equivalents declined $4.0 billion and investment securities declined $886.1 million as liquidity has tightened in 2023. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, the return on average assets increased primarily due to the increase in net income of $43.9 million, or 20.0%. &#8203; 

&#160; 

&#9679; For the three months ended June 30, 2023, the return on average equity and the return on average tangible equity declined compared to the same periods in 2022. These decreases were primarily due to the increase in net income of 3.6% and net income adjusted for the amortization of intangibles of 2.3% being lower than the increase in equity of 3.8% and tangible equity of 7.3%. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, the return on average equity and the return on average tangible equity increased primarily due to the increase in net income of $43.9 million, or 20.0% being greater than the increase in equity of $216.0 million, or 4.3%. &#9679; Equity to assets ratios was 11.77% for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, a decrease of 0.76% from June 30, 2022, which was due to the increase in total equity of 5.0% resulting from the net income earned during the last twelve months along with a decline in total assets of 1.8% from June 30, 2022. &#9679; Dividend payout ratios were 30.75% and 28.81% for the three and six month periods ending June 30, 2023, respectively, and 31.03% and 32.26% for the three and six month periods ending June 30, 2022, respectively. The decrease in the dividend payout ratio for the three months period ending June 30, 2023 was due the 3.6% increase in net income while total dividends paid during the current quarter increased 2.6% compared to the same period in 2022. The dividend payout ratio for the six months period ending June 30, 2023 decreased due to a higher increase in net income of 20.0% compared to an increase in dividend paid per share of 7.2% when compared to the same period in 2022. Net Interest Income and Margin 

&#8203; 

Non-Tax Equivalent (&#8220;TE&#8221;) net interest income increased $45.9 million, or 14.5%, to $361.7 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $315.8 million in the same period in 2022. Interest-earning assets averaged $40.1 billion during the three months period ended June 30, 2023 compared to $40.9 billion for the same period in 2022, a decrease of $771.5 million, or 1.9%. Interest-bearing liabilities averaged $26.0 billion during the three months period ended June 30, 2023 compared to $25.5 billion for the same period in 2022, an increase of $481.1 billion, or 1.9% . Non-Tax Equivalent (&#8220;TE&#8221;) net interest income increased $165.7 million, or 28.7%, to $743.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to $577.3 million in the same period in 2022. Interest-earning assets averaged $39.8 billion during the six months period ended June 30, 2023 compared to $39.7 billion for the same period in 2022, a slight increase of $32.1 million, or 0.1%. Interest-bearing liabilities averaged $25.3 billion during the six months period ended June 30, 2023 compared to $25.2 billion for the same period in 2022, an increase of $124.4 million, or 0.5%. 

&#8203; 

The Federal Reserve continued to raise rates in 2023 with three increases of 25 basis points, the most recent in early May 2023, resulting in a range of 5.00% to 5.25% at June 30, 2023. As a result, the Company operated under an increasing rate environment for the first six months of 2023 while it operated under a comparatively lower rate environment in the first six months of 2022. Some key highlights are outlined below: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Non-TE and TE net interest margin increased by 52 basis points and 50 basis points, respectively, in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter of 2022. The increase in the yield on interest earning assets of 158 basis points, which was offset by the increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities of 162 basis points. In the rising rate environment in 2022 and 2023, the net interest margin increased due to the higher yielding balance of average interest-earning assets of $40.1 billion repricing during the period in comparison to the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities of $26.0 billion . o Non-TE yield on interest-earning assets for the second quarter of 2023 increased 158 basis points to 4.78% from the comparable period in 2022, primarily due to an increase in yields on all interest-earning assets as the Federal Reserve Bank raised interest rates 500 basis points starting late in first quarter of 2022. The increases in interest rates, in combination with the increase in the average balance of the higher yielding loan portfolio of $4.0 billion, along with the decline in the average balances of lower yielding interest-earning deposits and federal funds sold of $3.9 billion and investment securities of $886.1 million, affected the overall yield increase between the comparable periods. &#8203; 

&#160; 

o The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the second quarter of 2023 increased 162 basis points from the same period in 2022. This increase was driven by the effects from the rising rate environment on the repricing of all deposit accounts, federal funds purchased and securities purchased with agreement to repurchase, trust preferred corporate debt and other borrowings. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 156 basis points as the increase occurred in all deposit categories. The average cost of federal funds purchased and securities purchased with agreements to repurchase increased 218 basis points while the average cost of corporate and subordinated debentures increased 119 basis points. Other borrowings, consisting of FHLB advances had an average cost of 5.22% during the second quarter of 2023. The increase in overall average cost of interest-bearing liabilities was also due to the decrease in the average balance of lower costing transaction and money market deposit accounts, along with savings deposit accounts, while the higher costing certificates and other time deposits and other borrowings increased compared to the same period a year ago. Our overall cost of funds, including noninterest-bearing deposits, was 1.23% for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to 0.11% for the three months ended June 30, 2022. &#8203; 

The tables below summarize the analysis of changes in interest income and interest expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 and net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis:

(1) Investment securities (taxable) and (tax-exempt) include trading securities. Investment Securities 

&#8203; 

The yield and interest earned on investment securities increased in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2022. The average balance of investment securities decreased $886.1 million and $277.8 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 from the comparable periods in 2022. The yield on the investment securities increased 32 basis points and 46 basis points, respectively, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. While the Bank decreased the size of its investment securities portfolio, the yield on the investment securities increased as a result of the higher interest rates in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, leading to higher interest earned in 2023. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Loans 

&#8203; 

Interest earned on loans held for investment increased $147.6 million, to $418.8 million and increased $307.8 million to $811.8 million, respectively, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 from the comparable periods in 2022. Interest earned on loans held for investment included loan accretion income recognized during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 of $5.5 million, $12.9 million, and $12.8 million, $19.5 million, respectively, a decrease of $7.3 million and a decrease of $6.6 million, respectively. Some key highlights for the quarter ended June 30, 2023 are outlined below:

&#9679; Our non-TE yield on total loans increased 138 basis points in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 due to a 140 basis-point increase in the yield on the acquired loan portfolio and a 153 basis-point increase in the yield on the non-acquired loan portfolio. These increases in both portfolios were due to the rising rate environment. o The yield on the acquired loan portfolio increased from 4.68% in the second quarter of 2022 to 6.08% in the same period in 2023. Interest income on the acquired loan portfolio declined $3.5 million. &#9726; The yield increased 140 basis points from the second quarter of 2022 due to the rising rate environment during 2022 and 2023 as the Federal Reserve increased interest rates 500 basis points. &#9726; Interest income on acquired loans decreased by $3.5 million, due to a decrease in the average balance of $2.3 billion. The decrease in average balance was mainly related to the impact from the paydowns and pay-offs of loans along with renewals of acquired loans that were moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio o The yield on the non-acquired loan portfolio increased 153 basis points to 5.20% in the second quarter of 2023 compared to 3.67% in the same period in 2022. Interest income on the non-acquired loan portfolio increased $151.1 million during the same period. &#9726; The yield and interest income on non-acquired loans increased due to the rising rate environment during 2022 and 2023. Both new loans and renewal have repriced in a much higher rate environment resulting in a higher yield. &#9726; For the non-acquired loans, interest income also increased due to an increase in the average loan balance of $6.3 billion in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, primarily through organic loan growth and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio . &#8203; 

Interest-Bearing Liabilities 

&#8203; 

The quarter-to-date average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased $481.1 billion, or 1.9%, in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Overall cost of funds, including demand deposits, increased by 112 basis points to 1.23% in the second quarter of 2023, compared to the same period in 2022. Some key highlights for the quarter ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 include: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; The cost of interest-bearing deposits was 1.64% for the second quarter of 2023 compared to 0.08% for the same period in 2022. o Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits increased by $95.9 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 as interest expense on all interest-bearing deposit accounts increased. Interest expense on transaction and money market accounts, savings, and certificates and other time deposits increased $62.7 million, $1.8 million, and $31.3 million, respectively. The increase in the cost and interest expense was due to the repricing of deposits in the rising rate environment in 2022 and 2023. &#8203; 

&#160; 

o The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased by $211.7 million as certificate and other time deposits increased by $1.6 billion, offset by a decrease in interest-bearing transaction accounts and money market accounts and savings accounts of $1.3 billion. For the second quarter of 2023, the average balance of brokered deposits increased to $1.3 billion from $150.0 million for the same quarter in 2022. As customers moved funds from lower costing interest-bearing transaction accounts (excluding money market accounts) and savings accounts, seeking higher yields in the rising rate environment, the Company increased its balance in higher costing brokered time deposits, in-market time deposits and money market accounts starting in the first quarter of 2023. This shift from the lower costing interest-bearing transaction accounts and savings accounts to the higher costing time deposits and money market accounts increased both the overall cost of deposits and interest expense. Overall, interest-bearing deposits had been slower to reprice in the rising rate environment, however, the cost increased significantly in the first six months of 2023. &#9679; The cost on the corporate and subordinated debt increased by 119 basis points to 5.96% for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2023, driven by the effects from the rising rate environment on the repricing of variable rate trust preferred corporate debt. o The interest expense from corporate and subordinated debt increased $1.0 million during the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. o The average balance of corporate and subordinated debt decreased by $13.1 million due to the redemption of $13.0 million of subordinated debentures in late June 2022. &#9679; The cost of repurchase agreements was 1.03% for the second quarter of 2023 compared to 0.15% for the same period in 2022. The increase in cost was due to the rising interest rate environment. &#9679; The cost of federal funds purchased increased 426 basis points due to the rising rate environment. Although the average balance decreased by $118.2 million, the interest expense increased $2.1 million as the rate increased. &#9679; The cost of other borrowings, consisting of FHLB advances, for the three months ended June 30, 2023 was 5.22% and interest expense was $6.2 million. The Bank had $400 million outstanding in FHLB advances at June 30, 2023 with an average balance of $473.6 million during the quarter. There were no outstanding balances in other borrowings during the second quarter of 2022 . The Company borrowed short-term FHLB advances in 2023 to provide liquidity with the turmoil in the financial markets in 2023. &#8203; 

We continue to monitor and adjust rates paid on deposit products as part of our strategy to manage our net interest margin. Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits, CDs, other time deposits, federal funds purchased, and other borrowings. Interest-bearing transaction accounts include NOW, HSA, IOLTA, and Market Rate checking accounts. 

Noninterest-Bearing Deposits 

&#8203; 

Noninterest-bearing deposits are transaction accounts that provide our Bank with &#8220;interest-free&#8221; sources of funds. Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $1.9 billion, or 14.0%, to $11.9 billion in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $13.9 billion during the same period in 2022. Actual noninterest-bearing deposits declined $1.7 billion from December 31, 2022. This decline was due to both the rising rate environment as customers seek higher yields, in addition to some customers spreading deposit funds amongst institutions to achieve full deposit insurance coverage. 

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Noninterest Income 

&#8203; 

Noninterest income provides us with additional revenues that are significant sources of income. For the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, noninterest income comprised 17.6%, and 21.6%, respectively, of total net interest income and noninterest income. For the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, noninterest income comprised 16.7%, and 23.0%, respectively, of total net interest income and noninterest income.

Noninterest income decreased by $9.5 million, or 11.0%, during the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. This quarterly change in total noninterest income resulted from the following: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Correspondent banking and capital markets income in the second quarter of 2023 decreased by $6.9 million, or 26.4%, compared to the same quarter in 2022. The decline was due to the expense attributable to the variation margin payments for centrally cleared swaps, along with lower commissions and fees earned on fixed income security sales of $5.1 million during the second quarter of 2023 as the volume in sales declined compared to the same quarter of 2022. We recorded an expense of $8.5 million related to variation margin payments in the second quarter of 2023 compared to an expense of $1.5 million in the second quarter of 2022. The rise in interest rates increased our expense related to variation margin as it led to an increase in the value of our centrally cleared interest rate swaps with LCH and CME. The increase in value of our centrally cleared interest rate swaps increased daily settlements by LCH and CME with the Company, which resulted in an overall increase in our expense. These declines were partially offset by an increase in income derived from the ARC hedging program of $4.8 million during the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022. This increase was due to more activity and volume in 2023 as the Bank&#8217;s commercial loan customers try to lock in a fixed loan rates in the rising rate environment. &#9679; SBA income, including the impact from the change to fair value accounting prospectively applied beginning with the period ending June 30, 2022, decreased by $1.5 million, or 33.6% compared to the second quarter of 2022. SBA income includes changes in fair value of the servicing asset, loan servicing fees and gains on sale of SBA loans. The decrease in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the comparable period in 2022 was attributable to a decrease in the fair value of the SBA servicing asset of $1.5 million. &#9679; Mortgage banking income decreased by $1.1 million, or 20.5%, during the current quarter compared to the same period of the prior year, which was comprised of a $1.6 million, or 35.9%, decrease in secondary market mortgage income, slightly offset by a $477,000, or 46.9%, increase in mortgage servicing related income, net of the hedge. Mortgage production declined from $1.4 billion in the second quarter of 2022 to $696 million in the second quarter of 2023 , while the Company allocated a higher percentage of its mortgage production to the secondary market compared to the same quarter in 2022. The allocation of mortgage production to the secondary market increased from 27% in the second quarter of 2022 to 38% in the second quarter of 2023. The allocation of mortgage production between portfolio and secondary market depends on the Company&#8217;s liquidity, market spreads and rate changes during each period and will fluctuate quarter to quarter. The decline in mortgage production in 2023 was mainly due to the rise in interest rates which resulted in an overall decrease in mortgage banking income. o The decrease in mortgage income from the secondary market was comprised of a $3.8 million decline in gain on sale of mortgage loans, which is net of the commission expense related to mortgage production, offset by a $2.1 million increase in the change in fair value of the pipeline, loans held for sale and MBS forward trades. Mortgage commission expense was $2.3 million during the second quarter of 2023 compared to $3.1 million during the comparable period in 2022. &#8203; 

&#160; 

o The increase in mortgage servicing related income, net of the hedge, in the second quarter of 2023 was due to a $387,000 increase in the change in fair value of the MSR including decay and a $90,000 increase from servicing fee income. The increase in fair value of the MSR was primarily due to a $907,000 decline in MSR decay and an increase in gains on the MSR hedge of $289,000, offset by a decrease in the change in fair value from interest rates of $809,000. &#9679; Debit, ATM, prepaid and merchant card related income was lower by $876,000, or 7.5%, in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022. The decrease in debit, ATM, prepaid and merchant card related income was driven by a decrease in debit/ATM fee income, net of card expense, of $793,000 due mainly to higher card expense of $1.0 million. &#9679; Service charges on deposit accounts were higher by $1.1 million, or 5.3%, in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. This increase mainly consisted of an increase in service charge account maintenance fees of $766,000 and in other retail fees of $359,000 including wire transfer fees and check sales commissions. &#8203; 

Noninterest income decreased by $24.2 million, or 14.0% , during the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. This change in total noninterest income resulted from the following: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Correspondent banking and capital markets income for 2023 decreased by $21.2 million compared to 2022 primarily due to an increase in expense attributable to the variation margin payments for centrally cleared swaps of $15.3 million and lower commissions and fees earned on fixed income security sales of $9.2 million during 2023 as the volume in sales declined from 2022. We recorded an expense of $16.9 million related to variation margin payments in 2023 compared to an expense of $1.6 million in 2022. &#9679; Mortgage banking income decreased by $7.4 million, or 46.0%, which was comprised of a $6.8 million, or 54.9%, decrease from mortgage income in the secondary market and a $553,000, or 15.3%, decrease from mortgage servicing related income, net of the hedge. Mortgage production declined from $2.7 billion in the first half of 2022 to $1.3 billion in the second half of 2023 with the rise in mortgage rates in 2022 and 2023. During the current year, the Company also allocated a lower percentage of its mortgage production and pipeline to the secondary market compared to 2022. Both the reduction in mortgage production and the lower allocation to the secondary market resulted in lower mortgage income from the secondary market in 2023. The allocation of mortgage production between portfolio and secondary market depends on the Company&#8217;s liquidity, market spreads and rate changes during each period and will fluctuate quarter to quarter. o During the first six months of 2023, mortgage income from the secondary market comprised of a $15.7 million decline in gain on sale of mortgage loans, which is net of the commission expense related to mortgage production, offset by an $8.8 million increase in the change in fair value of the pipeline, loans held for sale and MBS forward trades. Mortgage commission expense was $3.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to $8.9 million during the comparable period in 2022. o The decrease in mortgage servicing related income, net of the hedge, in the six months ended June 30, 2023 was due to a $925,000 decrease in the change in fair value of the MSR, including decay, slightly offset by a $372,000 increase from servicing fee income. The decrease in fair value of the MSR was due to a $14.9 million decrease in the change in fair value from interest rates, offset by a $1.7 million decline in MSR decay and a $12.3 million increase in gains on the MSR hedge. &#9679; SBA income, including the impact from the change to fair value accounting, decreased by $917,000, or 12.2% in 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease was attributable to a decrease in the change in fair value of the SBA servicing asset of $1.0 million and in gains on sale of SBA loans of $240,000, partially offset by an increase in SBA servicing fee income of $366,000. &#9679; Debit, prepaid, ATM and merchant card related income was lower by $743,000, or 3.6%, in 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease in debit, ATM, prepaid and merchant card related income was driven by a decrease in debit/ATM fee income, net of card expense, of $852,000 due mainly to higher card expense of $1.8 million. &#9679; Service charges on deposit accounts were higher in 2023 by $2.8 million, or 7.1%, compared to 2022, due primarily to the increase in customers and activity, partially through the Atlantic Capital merger completed during the first quarter of 2022. The increase was mainly attributable to a $2.6 million increase in service charge account maintenance fees in 2023 compared to 2022. &#9679; Bank owned life insurance income increased $1.6 million, or 13.7%, in 2023 compared to 2022. This increase was due to the purchase of $91.9 million of new policies since March of 2022 and the addition of $74.6 million in BOLI resulting from the acquisition of Atlantic Capital in the first quarter of 2022. &#8203; 

&#160; 

&#9679; Other income increased by $1.4 million, or 42.5%, in 2023 compared to 2022. This increase was primarily due to income of $960,000 from a legal settlement recorded during the first quarter of 2023 and an increase in income from prepaid cards of $403,000 along with the Company showing a gain in sale of fixed assets of $89,000 in 2023 compared to a loss of $247,000 in 2022. These increases were partially offset by a decline in income from SBIC partnerships of $622,000. Noninterest Expense

&#8203; 

Noninterest expense increased by $11.5 million, or 5.0%, in the second quarter of 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022. The quarterly increase in total noninterest expense primarily resulted from the following: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Salaries and employee benefits increased $10.3 million, or 7.5%, in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries of $9.2 million which included annual salary increases of $5.1 million and a decline in total deferred loan costs of $4.1 million. The reduction in deferred loan costs was driven by lower loan production. The overall increase in salaries and employee benefits was also due to an increase in incentives of $1.4 million and employee benefits of $743,000. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in commissions of $1.3 million mainly related to a decline in commission expense related to the Correspondent Banking Division. &#9679; FDIC assessment and other regulatory charges increased $4.5 million, or 84.2%, in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the FDIC assessment rate in 2023 to bring the overall FDIC fund to 1.35x total deposit by the end of 2028. The increase also reflects changes in the Company&#8217;s size and complexity, along with the resulting effects in the Company&#8217;s liquidity compared to the second quarter of 2022. &#9679; Business development and staff related expense increased $1.8 million, or 35.7%, in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. This increase was mainly due to an increase in employee expenses including employee travel expense, convention and meeting expense, and recruitment and relocation costs associated with the Company investing in new talent. &#9679; Information services expense increased $1.2 million, or 5.9% in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. &#160; The increase was due to additional cost associated with the Company updating systems as it grows in size and complexity . &#9679; Merger, branch consolidation and severance related expense decreased $3.6 million, or 66.5%, in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease was due to lower merger expense pertaining to previous acquisitions totaling $2.9 million and in branch consolidation expense of $682,000. &#9679; Amortization of intangibles, which is related to the Company&#8217;s prior mergers, decreased $1.8 million, or 20.6%. &#8203; 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Noninterest expense increased by $23.4 million, or 5.1%, during the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The categories and explanations for the fluctuations year-to-date, except the items discussed below, are similar to the ones noted above in the quarterly comparison. 

&#9679; Merger, branch consolidation and severance related expense decreased by $4.4 million, or 28.4%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a $11.1 million decrease in merger expense pertaining to expenses related to the Atlantic Capital and CenterState mergers. Branch consolidation related expense decreased $1.3 million in 2023 compared to 2022. These decreases were offset by severance related payments totaling $8.1 million related to restructuring costs recorded in March 2023. The restructuring costs include approximately $7.0 million of severance related expense pertaining to the elimination of the Company&#8217;s executive officer position and approximately $1.1 million of severance related expense pertaining to the reduction in force of the Company&#8217;s mortgage division. &#9679; Other noninterest expense increased $3.1 million, or 9.6%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023. This increase was mainly attributable to a $3.8 million increase in earnings credit expense to Homeowners Association (&#8220;HOA&#8221;) customers and a $2.1 million increase in state franchise and occupation tax payments. The Bank provides a credit to HOA customers based on the average deposit balances held that reduces fees for other services provided. This increase was due to having a full six months&#8217; expense in 2023 as this line of business was acquired through the Atlantic Capital transaction completed on March 1, 2022, along with growth in the business since the acquisition. The tax payment increase was mainly attributable to occupancy tax payments made to the state of Georgia, as the Company expanded its presence in the state through the acquisition of Atlantic Capital, along with increases in other franchise taxes paid to states. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in fraud, digital banking and miscellaneous operational charge-off related expenses totaling approximately $2.7 million. Income Tax Expense 

&#8203; 

Our effective tax rate was 21.84% for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to 21.66% for the three months ended June 30, 2022. T he increase in the effective rate for the quarter, when compared to the same period in the prior year, is mostly driven by an increase in pretax income, disallowed interest expense, disallowed executive compensation, and non-deductible FDIC premiums, partially offset by an increase in tax-exempt interest income and non-deductible merger expenses associated with the Atlantic Capital transaction that closed during the first quarter of 2022. 

&#8203; 

Our effective tax rate for the first six months of the year was 21.84% compared to 21.47% for the first six months of 2022. The increase in the year-to-date effective tax rate compared to the same period of 2022 was driven by an increase in pretax book income, non-deductible FDIC premiums, disallowed executive compensation, and disallowed interest expense, partially offset by an increase in tax-exempt interest income and an increase in federal tax credits available. 

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Analysis of Financial Condition 

Summary 

Our total assets increased approximately $1.0 billion, or 2.3%, from December 31, 2022 to June 30, 2023, to approximately $44.9 billion. Within total assets, loans (excluding changes in the allowance for credit losses) increased $1.4 billion, or 4.5%, and cash and cash equivalents increased $201.2 million, or 15.3%, while investment securities decreased $458.6 million, or 5.6%, during the period. Within total liabilities, deposit growth was $391.3 million, or 1.1%, and federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchased increased $25.0 million, or 4.5%. Total borrowings including corporate and subordinated debentures increased $399.8 million, or 101.9%. Total shareholder&#8217;s equity increased $215.1 million, or 4.2%. During the first half of 2023, the Company took in net $400 million in short-term FHLB borrowings and $1.0 billion in brokered time deposits to increase our liquidity. The increase in FHLB borrowings and brokered time deposits contributed to the increase in cash and cash equivalents. The increase in loans was due to normal organic growth. Deposit increase was due to growth in time deposits of $2.0 billion, including $1.0 billion in brokered time deposits, and in money market accounts of $1.4 billion in the current year, which replaced declines in noninterest-bearing, interest-bearing checking and savings accounts of $1.7 billion, $769.9 million and $533.0 million, respectively. Our loan to deposit ratio was 86% and 83% at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, while our percentage of noninterest-bearing deposit accounts to total deposits was 31% and 36%, respectively at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Investment Securities 

&#8203; 

We use investment securities, our second largest category of earning assets, to generate interest income, provide liquidity, fund loan demand or deposit liquidation, and pledge as collateral for public funds deposits, repurchase agreements, derivative exposures and to augment borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. At June 30, 2023, investment securities totaled $7.7 billion, compared to $8.2 billion at December 31, 2022, a decrease of $458.6 million, or 5.6%. At June 30, 2023, approximately 64.0% of the investment portfolio was classified as available for sale, approximately 33.4% was classified as held to maturity and approximately 2.6% was classified as other investments. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we purchased $163.6 million of capital stock with the Federal Home Loan Bank classified as other investment securities on the balance sheet of which we sold back $146.6 million. The net increase to the capital stock holding for the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta of $17.0 million during the quarter was due to the increase in Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we purchased $3.2 million of available for sale securities. There were no purchases of held to maturity securities during 2023. These purchases were offset by maturities, paydowns, sales and calls of investment securities totaling $623.3 million. Net amortization of premiums was $10.2 million in the first six months of 2023. 

&#8203; 

At June 30, 2023, the unrealized net loss of the available for sale securities portfolio was $881.2 million, or 15.1%, below its amortized cost basis, compared to an unrealized net loss of $889.3 million, or 14.3%, at December 31, 2022. At June 30, 2023, the unrealized net loss of the held to maturity securities portfolio was $440.6 million, or 17.0%, below its amortized cost basis, compared to an unrealized net loss of $433.1 million, or 16.1%, at December 31, 2022. 

&#8203;

* Agency mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;MBS&#8221;), agency collateralized mortgage-obligations (&#8220;CMO&#8221;) and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;CMBS&#8221;) are guaranteed by the issuing government-sponsored enterprise (&#8220;GSE&#8221;) as to the timely payments of principal and interest. Except for Government National Mortgage Association securities, which have the full faith and credit backing of the United States Government, the GSE alone is responsible for making payments on this guaranty. While the rating agencies have not rated any of the MBS, CMO and CMBS issued, senior debt securities issued by GSEs are rated consistently as &#8220;Triple-A.&#8221; Most market participants consider agency MBS, CMOs and CMBSs as carrying an implied Aaa rating (S&#38;P rating of AA+) because of the guarantees of timely payments and selection criteria of mortgages backing the securities. We do not own any private label mortgage-backed securities. The balances presented under the ratings above reflect the amortized cost of the investment securities. 

At June 30, 2023 , we had 1,245 investment securities (including both available for sale and held to maturity) in an unrealized loss position, which totaled $1.3 billion. At December 31, 2022, we had 1,311 investment securities (including both available for sale and held to maturity) in an unrealized loss position, which totaled $1.3 billion. The total number of investment securities with an unrealized loss position decreased by 66 securities, while the total dollar amount of the unrealized loss decreased by $4.4 million. The level of unrealized losses within the Company available for sale and held to maturity securities portfolios is due to the overall increase in short and long-term interest rates in 2022 and 2023. 

&#8203; 

All investment securities in an unrealized loss position as of June 30, 2023 continue to perform as scheduled. We have evaluated the securities and have determined that the decline in fair value, relative to its amortized cost, is not due to credit-related factors. In addition, we have the ability and intent to hold these securities within the portfolio until maturity or until the value recovers, and we believe that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities prior to recovery. We continue to monitor all of our securities with a high degree of scrutiny. There can be no assurance that we will not conclude in future periods that conditions existing at that time indicate some or all of our securities may be sold or would require a charge to earnings as a provision for credit losses in such periods. Any charges as a provision for credit losses related to investment securities could impact cash flow, tangible capital or liquidity. See Note 2 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 &#8212; Investment Securities for further discussion on the application of ASU 2016-13 on the investment securities portfolio. 

&#8203; 

As securities held for investment are purchased, they are designated as held to maturity or available for sale based upon our intent, which incorporates liquidity needs, interest rate expectations, asset/liability management strategies, and capital requirements. Although securities classified as available for sale may be sold from time to time to meet liquidity or other needs, it is not our normal practice to trade this segment of the investment securities portfolio. From time to time, the Bank may execute transactions to reposition the investment portfolio. Such activity has not expanded the broad asset classes used by the Bank. While management generally holds these assets on a long-term basis or until maturity, any short-term investments or securities available for sale could be converted at an earlier point, depending partly on changes in interest rates and alternative investment opportunities.

(1) Yields on tax exempt income have been presented on a taxable equivalent basis in the table above.

(2) FRB, FHLB and other non-marketable equity securities have no set maturity date and are classified in &#8220;Due after 10 Years.&#8221;

(3) The total values presented in the table above represent total fair value for available for sale and amortized cost for held to maturity.

Approximately 86.2% of the investment portfolio is comprised of U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Government agency securities, and U.S. Government Agency Mortgage-backed securities. These securities may be pledged to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta or the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta Discount Window or Bank Term Funding Program. Approximately 13.4% of the investment portfolio is comprised of municipal securities. A portion of the municipal bond portfolio may be pledged to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta subject to their credit approval. Approximately 99.1% of the municipal bond portfolio has ratings in the Double A or Triple A category. 

&#8203; 

Through June 30, 2023, we sold approximately $125.3 million of municipal securities given advantageous market conditions. The primary rationale for the sale was to reduce municipal and portfolio duration/price risk at an opportune moment in fixed income markets. As of June 30, 2023, the portfolio had an effective duration of 5.65 years. Our target for effective duration is 3 to 5 years. The portfolio duration is currently outside of the target range due to portfolio repositioning and extension in the mortgage-backed securities due to the historic rise in rates. We continue to monitor duration risk and seek to align actual duration with the target range.

Other Investments 

&#8203; 

Other investment securities include primarily our investments in FHLB and FRB stock with no readily determinable market value. Accordingly, when evaluating these securities for impairment, management considers the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than recognizing temporary declines in value. As of June 30, 2023, we determined that there was no impairment on our other investment securities. As of June 30, 2023, other investment securities represented app rox imately $196.7 million, or 0.44% of total assets, and primarily consists of FHLB and FRB stock which totals $182.3 million, or 0.41% of total assets. There were no gains or losses on the sales of these securities for three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Trading Securities 

&#8203; 

We have a trading portfolio associated with our Correspondent Bank Division and its subsidiary SouthState|Duncan-Williams. This portfolio is carried at fair value and realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in trading securities revenue, a component of Correspondent Banking and Capital Market Income in our Consolidated Statements of Net Income. Securities purchased for this portfolio have primarily been municipal bonds, treasuries and mortgage-backed agency securities, which are held for short periods of time and totaled $56.6 million and $31.3 million, respectively, at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

Loans Held for Sale 

&#8203; 

The balance of mortgage loans held for sale increased $14.0 million from December 31, 2022 to $43.0 million at June 30, 2023. Mortgage production in the second quarter of $696 million remained flat when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 mortgage production of $693 million. However, the percentage of mortgage production sold into the secondary market increased in the second quarter of 2023 to 38% from 19% in the fourth quarter of 2022. This increase in the allocation of mortgage production into the secondary market caused mortgage loans held for sale to increase at period end. The allocation of mortgage production between portfolio and secondary market depends on the Company&#8217;s liquidity, market spreads and rate changes during each period and will fluctuate over time.

Total loans, net of deferred loan costs and fees (excluding mortgage loans held for sale), increased by $1.4 billion, or 9.1% annualized, to $31.5 billion at June 30, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022. Our non-acquired loan portfolio increased by $2.2 billion, or 19.3% annualized, driven by organic growth. Consumer owner occupied loans, commercial non-owner occupied loans, commercial owner occupied real estate, commercial and industrial loans and home equity loans led the way with $828.8 million, $626.2 million, $270.4 million, $239.1 million and $94.9 million in year-to-date loan growth, respectively, or 38.2%, 22.8%, 14.8%, 11.7% and 20.0% annualized growth, respectively. The acquired loan portfolio decreased by $826.9 million, or 22.6% annualized. This decline in acquired loans was due to paydowns and payoffs in both the PCD and Non-PCD loan categories along with renewals of acquired loans that were moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. The main categories that declined were commercial non-owner occupied loans, commercial and industrial loans and commercial owner occupied loans with $222.9 million, $174.3 million and $144.6 million in year-to-date loan decrease. Acquired loans as a percentage of total loans decreased to 20.8% and non-acquired loans as a percentage of the overall portfolio increased to 79.2% at June 30, 2023. This compares to acquired loans as a percentage of total loans of 24.4% and non-acquired loans as a percentage of total loans of 75.6% at December 31, 2022.

Allowance for Credit Losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;) on Loans and Certain Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures 

&#8203; 

The ACL reflects management&#8217;s estimate of losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments. The Company records loans charged off against the ACL and subsequent recoveries, if any, increase the ACL when they are recognized. Please see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, under the &#8220;ACL &#8211; Loans&#8221; section, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and Note 2 &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the ACL on loans. 

&#8203; 

Management considers forward-looking information in estimating expected credit losses. The Company subscribes to a third-party service which provides a quarterly macroeconomic baseline outlook and alternative scenarios for the United States economy. The baseline, along with the evaluation of alternative scenarios, is used by management to determine the best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. Management evaluates the appropriateness of the reasonable and supportable forecast scenarios and takes into consideration the scenarios in relation to actual economic and other data, such as gross domestic product growth, monetary and fiscal policy, inflation, supply chain issues and global events like the Russian/Ukraine conflict, as well as the volatility and magnitude of changes within those scenarios quarter over quarter, and consideration of conditions within the Bank&#8217;s operating environment and geographic area. Additional forecast scenarios may be weighted along with the baseline forecast to arrive at the final reserve estimate. While periods of relative economic stability should generally lead to stability in forecast scenarios and weightings to estimate credit losses, periods of instability can likewise require management to adjust the selection of scenarios and weightings, in accordance with the accounting standards. For the contractual term that extends beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts to the long term mean of historical factors within four quarters using a straight-line approach. The Company generally uses a four-quarter forecast and a four-quarter reversion period. 

&#8203; 

In spite of the rapid interest rate hikes experienced cycle-to-date, the U.S. has thus far avoided a recession, although an inverted yield curve such as observed in the current interest rate environment often portends a coming recession. Management continues to use a blended forecast scenario of the baseline and more severe scenario, depending on the circumstances and economic outlook. For the quarter ending June 30, 2023, management selected a baseline weighting of 50%, a 25% weighting for an upside scenario and a 25% weighting for the more severe scenario. The scenario weightings were unchanged from the first quarter of 2023. The scenario weightings reflect continued recognition of downside risks in the economic forecast from persistent levels of inflation, rising interest rates, and tightening credit conditions conducive of a mild recession. While employment figures still showed resilience and actual loan losses remain at low levels, significant, abrupt downward shifts in the forecasted commercial real estate price index elevated modeled expected losses for the Commercial Real Estate and Commercial Construction and Development, which excludes Residential Construction, loan segments. The Company determined that increases to expected loss rates for the completed Commercial Real Estate portfolios were appropriate, but the modeled expected loss rate for the Commercial Construction and Development portfolio needed a qualitative adjustment given the mix of our current portfolio composition compared to the historical composition utilized in our model. The resulting provision was approximately $38.4 million during the second quarter of 2023. 

&#8203; 

Longstanding TDR accounting rules were replaced with ASU No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures (See Note 3 &#8212; Recent Accounting and Regulatory Pronouncements). The Company adopted the retirement of TDR guidance, effective January 1, 2023. Please see Note 2 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further detailed descriptions of how we determine expected losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Atlantic Capital was acquired and merged with and into the Bank on March 1, 2022, requiring that a closing date ACL be prepared for Atlantic Capital on a standalone basis and that the acquired portfolio be included in the Bank&#8217;s first quarter ACL. Atlantic Capital&#8217;s loans represented approximately 8% of the total Bank&#8217;s portfolio at March 31, 2022. Given the relative size and complexity of the acquired portfolio, similarities of the loan characteristics, and similar loss history to the existing portfolio, reserve calculations were performed using the Bank&#39;s existing CECL model, loan segmentation, and forecast weighting as the first quarter end reserve. As a result of the merger with Atlantic Capital on March 1, 2022, the Company identified approximately $137.9 million of loans as PCD. The acquisition date ACL totaled $27.5 million, consisting of a non-PCD pooled reserve of $13.7 million, PCD pooled reserve of $5.7 million, and PCD individually evaluated reserve of $8.1 million. It represented about 8% of the combined Bank&#8217;s ACL reserve at March 31, 2022. The acquisition date reserve for unfunded commitments totaled $3.4 million, or 11% of the combined Bank&#8217;s total at March 31, 2022. 

&#8203; 

The Company has a variety of assets that have a component that qualifies as an off-balance sheet exposure. These primarily include undrawn portions of revolving lines of credit and standby letters of credit. Please see MD&#38;A, under the &#8220;Financial Condition&#8221;, &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;)&#8221; section, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and Note 2 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the ACL on certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures.

&#8203; 

As of June 30, 2023, the balance of the ACL was $427.4 million or 1.36% of total loans. The ACL increased $56.8 million from the balance of $370.6 million recorded at March 31, 2023. This increase during the second quarter of 2023 included $60.1 million of provision for credit losses, in addition to $3.3 million in net charge-offs. During the first six months of 2023, the Company recorded $75.3 million of provision for credit losses along with net charge-offs of $4.3 million. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses based on loan growth and continued uncertainty around economic recession risks. 

&#8203; 

At June 30, 2023, the Company had a reserve on unfunded commitments of $63.4 million, which was recorded as a liability on the Balance Sheet, compared to $85.1 million at March 31, 2023 and $67.2 million at December 31, 2022. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded a decrease in the reserve for unfunded commitments of $21.7 million and $3.8 million, respectively. For the prior comparative period, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments of $2.1 million and $2.0 million, respectively, during three and six months ended June 30, 2022. The Company did not have an allowance for credit losses or record a provision for credit losses on investment securities or other financial asset during the first six months of 2023. 

&#8203; 

The ACL provides 2.52 times coverage of nonperforming loans at June 30, 2023. Net charge-offs to total average loans during three and six months ended June 30, 2023 were 0.04% and 0.03%, respectively, compared to 0.03% and 0.04%, respectively, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022. We continued to show solid and stable asset quality numbers and ratios as of June 30, 2023. 

The following table presents a summary of the allowance for credit losses by loan segment, for the six months ended June 30, 2023.

(1) Consists of real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure. (2) Consists of non-real estate foreclosed assets, such as repossessed vehicles. (3) Includes nonaccrual loans that are purchase credit deteriorated (PCD loans). (4) Loan data excludes mortgage loans held for sale. (5) For purposes of this calculation, total assets include all assets (both acquired and non-acquired). (6) Excludes non-acquired bank premises held for sale of $10.0 million, $13.3 million, $14.3 million, $21.2 million, and $1.4 million as of June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022, and June 30, 2022 , respectively, that is now separately disclosed on the balance sheet. (7) Excludes acquired bank premises held for sale of $3.4 million, $3.4 million, $3.4 million, $3.9 million, and $4.2 million as of June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively, that is now separately disclosed on the balance sheet. Total nonperforming assets were $170.9 million, or 0.54% of total loans and repossessed assets, at June 30, 2023, an increase of $61.2 million, or 55.7%, from December 31, 2022. Total nonperforming loans were $169.7 million, or 0.54%, of total loans, at June 30, 2023, an increase of $61.1 million, or 56.3%, from December 31, 2022. Non-acquired nonperforming loans increased by $61.4 million from December 31, 2022. The increase in non-acquired nonperforming loans was driven primarily by an increase in commercial nonaccrual loans of $59.6 million, an increase in consumer nonaccrual loans of $4.4 million, an increase in accruing loans past due 90 days or more of $1.3 million, offset by a decrease in restructured nonaccrual loans of $3.9 million. The increase in commercial nonaccrual loans at June 30, 2023 was primarily due to three commercial and industrial relationships totaling $38.8 million, one commercial owner occupied relationship totaling $11.2 million, one commercial owner occupied loan totaling $3.3 million, and one commercial non owner occupied loan totaling $3.3 million. Acquired nonperforming loans decreased $0.2 million from December 31, 2022. The decrease in the acquired nonperforming loan balances was due to a decrease in consumer nonaccrual loans of $3.7 million, a decrease in restructured nonaccrual loans of $2.8 million, a decline in accruing loans past due 90 days or more of $1.4 million, offset by an increase in commercial nonaccrual loans of $7.7 million. The decline in restructured nonaccrual loans over both the nonacquired and acquired loan portfolios was due to the adoption of ASU 2022-02 effective January 1, 2023, which extinguishes the former troubled debt restructuring (TDR) guidance and issues new requirements for determining modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.

&#8203; 

&#160; 

At June 30, 2023, OREO totaled $1.1 million, which included $118,000 in non-acquired OREO and $1.0 million in acquired OREO. Total OREO increased $57,000 from December 31, 2022. At June 30, 2023, non-acquired OREO consisted of two properties with an average value of $59,000. This compared to three properties with an average value of $47,000 at December 31, 2022. During the second quarter of 2023, we added two new properties into non-acquired OREO with an aggregate value of $118,000, while selling two properties during the quarter with an aggregate value of $58,000. At June 30, 2023, acquired OREO consisted of three properties with an average value of $321,000, compared to three properties with an average value of $294,000 at December 31, 2022. In the second quarter of 2023, one new property was transferred to acquired OREO with an value of $242,000, while selling two properties with an aggregate value of $2.7 million. 

Interest-Bearing Liabilities 

&#8203; 

Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits, CDs, other time deposits, federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings. Interest-bearing transaction accounts include NOW, HSA, Interest on Layers&#8217; Trust Accounts (&#8220;IOLTA&#8221;), and Market Rate checking accounts. 

&#8203; 

Total interest-bearing deposits increased $2.1 billion or 18.0% annualized to $25.3 billion at June 30, 2023 from $23.2 billion at December 31, 2022. This increase was mainly driven by growth in time deposits of $2.0 billion including an increase in brokered time deposits of $1.0 billion. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, core deposits decreased $1.6 billion. These funds exclude certificates of deposits and other time deposits and are normally lower cost funds. Core deposits declined as customers moved their funds seeking higher yields as interest rates have risen along with some business customers moving funds for deposit insurance purposes. Federal funds purchased related to the correspondent bank division and repurchase agreements were $581.4 million at June 30, 2023, up $25.0 million from December 31, 2022. Other borrowings, consisting of FHLB borrowings, increased to $400 million during the six months period ended June 30, 2023. The Company had no FHLB borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2022. Corporate and subordinated debentures declined by $185,000 to $392.1 million. Some key highlights are outlined below: 

&#9679; The increase in interest-bearing deposits from December 31, 2022 was driven by an increase in time deposits of $2.0 billion, including an increase in brokered time deposits of $1.0 billion and an increase in money market accounts of $1.4 billion. These increases were partially offset by declines in interest bearing checking deposits of $769.9 million and savings deposits of $533.0 million. As customers moved funds from interest bearing checking and savings accounts, seeking higher yields in the rising rate environment and deposit insurance coverage, the Company increased its balance in brokered time deposits and in-market time deposits along with higher yielding money market accounts during the first half of 2023. The Company raised interest rates on most interest-bearing deposit products (in particular money market accounts and time deposit specials) during 2023 due to competitive pressures to retain deposits. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $211.7 million to $24.6 billion during the quarter ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. For more information on the composition of our total deposits, see Note 10 &#8211; Deposits in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. &#9679; Other borrowings, consisting of FHLB borrowings, increased to $400 million during the six months period ended June 30, 2023. The Company borrowed funds from the FHLB to provide excess liquidity during 2023. The Company paid down $500 million, on a net basis, in FHLB borrowing during the second quarter of 2023 from $900 million at March 31, 2023 as the financial markets stabilized and the stress on liquidity declined. Noninterest-Bearing Deposits 

&#8203; 

Noninterest-bearing deposits are transaction accounts that provide our Bank with &#8220;interest-free&#8221; sources of funds. At June 30, 2023, the period end balance of noninterest-bearing deposits was $11.5 billion compared to $13.2 billion at December 31, 2022. Average noninterest-bearing deposits were $11.9 billion for the second quarter of 2023 compared to $13.9 billion for the second quarter of 2022. The decrease in period end and average noninterest bearing deposits was mainly due to customers seeking both higher yields in the rising rate environment and deposit insurance coverage amid the financial turmoil during 2023. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Uninsured Deposits 

At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $12.5 billion and $14.1 billion, respectively, in estimated uninsured deposits. The amounts above are estimates and are based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank&#8217;s regulatory reporting requirements issued by the FDIC for the FFIEC 041, also referred to as the Call Report.

In January 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the 2021 Stock Repurchase Plan, which authorized the Company to repurchase 3,500,000 common shares. During the first quarter of 2022, we repurchased 1,012,038 shares, at an average price of $85.43 per share (excluding cost of commissions) for a total of $86.5 million under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Plan. 

In April 2022, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program (&#8220;2022 Stock Repurchase Program&#8221;) authorizing the Company to repurchase up to 3,750,000 of the Company&#8217;s common shares along with the remaining authorized shares of 370,021 from the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program for a total authorization of 4,120,021 shares. The Company did not repurchase any shares through the 2022 Stock Repurchase Program during 2023 or 2022. The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of the purchases are based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of cash balances, general business conditions, regulatory requirements, the market price of our common stock, and the availability of alternative investment opportunities. 

We are subject to regulations with respect to certain risk-based capital ratios. These risk-based capital ratios measure the relationship of capital to a combination of balance sheet and off-balance sheet risks. The values of both balance sheet and off-balance sheet items are adjusted based on the rules to reflect categorical credit risk. In addition to the risk-based capital ratios, the regulatory agencies have also established a leverage ratio for assessing capital adequacy. The leverage ratio is equal to Tier 1 capital divided by total consolidated on-balance sheet assets (minus amounts deducted from Tier 1 capital). The leverage ratio does not involve assigning risk weights to assets. 

&#8203; 

Specifically, we are required to maintain the following minimum capital ratios:

&#9679; a CET1, risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%; &#9679; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%; &#9679; a total risk-based capital ratio of 8%; and &#9679; a leverage ratio of 4%. 

&#160; 

Under the current capital rules, Tier 1 capital includes two components: CET1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. The highest form of capital, CET1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, otherwise referred to as AOCI, and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock. Additional Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and Tier 1 minority interests. Tier 2 capital generally includes the allowance for loan losses up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, qualifying preferred stock, subordinated debt, trust preferred securities and qualifying tier 2 minority interests, less any deductions in Tier 2 instruments of an unconsolidated financial institution. AOCI is presumptively included in CET1 capital and often would operate to reduce this category of capital. When the current capital rules were first implemented, the Bank exercised its one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of AOCI, allowing us to retain our pre-existing treatment for AOCI. 

In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a banking organization must maintain a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity, but the buffer applies to all three risk-based measurements (CET1, Tier 1 capital and total capital), resulting in the following effective minimum capital plus capital conservation buffer ratios: (i) a CET1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%. 

The Bank is also subject to the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, which identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized) and is based on specified thresholds for each of the three risk-based regulatory capital ratios (CET1, Tier 1 capital and total capital) and for the leverage ratio.

&#8203; 

The federal banking agencies revised their regulatory capital rules to (i) address the implementation of CECL&#894; (ii) provide an optional three-year phase-in period for the adoption date adverse regulatory capital effects that banking organizations are expected to experience upon adopting CECL&#894; and (iii) require the use of CECL in stress tests beginning with the 2020 capital planning and stress testing cycle for certain banking organizations that are subject to stress testing. CECL became effective for us on January 1, 2020 and the Company applied the provisions of the standard using the modified retrospective method as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. Related to the implementation of ASU 2016-13, we recorded additional allowance for credit losses for loans of $54.4 million, deferred tax assets of $12.6 million, an additional reserve for unfunded commitments of $6.4 million and an adjustment to retained earnings of $44.8 million. Instead of recognizing the effects on regulatory capital from ASU 2016-13 at adoption, the Company initially elected the option for recognizing the adoption date effects on the Company&#8217;s regulatory capital calculations over a three-year phase-in .

&#8203; 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule for additional transitional relief to regulatory capital related to the impact of the adoption of CECL. The Company chose the five-year transition method and is deferring the recognition of the effects from the adoption date and the CECL difference for the first two years of application. The modified CECL transitional amount was fixed as of December 31, 2021, and that amount began the three-year phase out in the first quarter of 2022 with 50% being phased out in 2023.

The Company&#8217;s and Bank&#8217;s Common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios all increased compared to December 31, 2022. These ratios increased mainly due to net income during 2023 of $263.4 million. Tier 1 capital increased 5.3% and 4.7% at both the Company and Bank, respectively, with the increase in equity from net income. Total risk-based capital increased 6.6% and 6.5% at both the Company and Bank, respectively, with the increase in equity from net income along with the increase in the allowance for credit losses and unfunded commitments. Both regulatory risk-based assets and quarterly average assets remained reasonably flat compared to the fourth quarter with average assets for the Company and Bank increasing 0.2% and risk-based assets increasing 3.1%. Our capital ratios are currently well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; regulatory classification. Should the Company need to sell its available for sale and held to maturity securities for liquidity purposes and recognize the unrealized losses as of June 30, 2023 through earnings, all else equal, our capital ratios would remain well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; regulatory classification. 

Liquidity 

&#8203; 

Liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our financial obligations, which arise primarily from the withdrawal of deposits, extension of credit and payment of operating expenses. Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank&#8217;s financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by an inability (or perceived inability) to meet its obligations. Our Asset Liability Management Committee (&#8220;ALCO&#8221;) is charged with the responsibility of monitoring policies designed to ensure acceptable composition of our asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management. We have employed our funds in a manner to provide liquidity from both assets and liabilities sufficient to meet our cash needs. 

&#8203; 

Asset liquidity is maintained by the maturity structure of loans, investment securities and other short-term investments. Management has policies and procedures governing the length of time to maturity on loans and investments. Normally, changes in the earning asset mix are of a longer-term nature and are not used for day-to-day corporate liquidity needs. 

Our liabilities provide liquidity on a day-to-day basis. Daily liquidity needs are met from deposit levels or from our use of federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, interest-bearing deposits at other banks and other short-term borrowings. We engage in routine activities to retain deposits intended to enhance our liquidity position. These routine activities include various measures, such as the following: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers, where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with our Bank; &#9679; Pricing deposits, including certificates of deposit, at rate levels that will attract and /or retain balances of deposits that will enhance our Bank&#8217;s asset/liability management and net interest margin requirements; and &#9679; Continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or enhance our Bank&#8217;s appeal as a primary provider of financial services. Our non-acquired loan portfolio increased by approximately $2.2 billion, or approximately 19.3% annualized, compared to the balance at December 31, 2022. The increase from December 31, 2022 was mainly related to organic growth and renewals on acquired loans. The acquired loan portfolio decreased by $826.9 million from the balance at December 31, 2022 through principal paydowns, charge-offs, foreclosures and renewals of acquired loans. 

Our investment securities portfolio (excluding trading securities) decreased $458.6 million compared to the balance at December 31, 2022. The decrease in investment securities from December 31, 2022 was a result of maturities, calls, sales and paydowns of investment securities totaling $623.3 million as well as a reduction from the net amortization of premiums of $10.2 million. This decrease was partially offset by purchases of available for sale investment securities totaling $3.2 million and FHLB stock of $163.6 million, as well as an increase in the market value of the available for sale investment securities portfolio of $8.1 million. There were no purchases of held to maturity securities during the quarter. Total cash and cash equivalents were $1.5 billion at June 30, 2023 as compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2022. This increase was due to the Company increasing its brokered time deposits by $1.0 billion and borrowing $400 million in FHLB borrowings during 2023 to increase liquidity as customers moved funds from noninterest bearing checking, interest bearing checking and savings accounts, seeking higher yields in the rising rate environment and deposit insurance coverage. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had $1.2 billion and $150.0 million of traditional, out&#8211;of-market brokered deposits, respectively. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had $1.6 billion and $637.0 million, respectively, of reciprocal deposits. Total deposits were $36.7 billion at June 30, 2023, an increase of $391.3 million from $36.4 billion at December 31, 2022 . This increase was driven by an increase in time deposits of $2.0 billion including an increase in brokered time deposits of $1.0 billion and an increase in money market accounts of $1.4 billion. These increases in deposits were partially offset by declines in noninterest bearing deposits of $1.7 billion, in interest bearing checking deposits of $769.9 million and savings deposits of $533.0 million. As customers moved funds from noninterest bearing checking, interest bearing checking and savings accounts, seeking higher yields in the rising rate environment and deposit insurance coverage, the Company&#8217;s balance in higher costing in-market time deposits and brokered time deposits and in money market deposit accounts. The Company raised interest rates on most interest-bearing deposit products (in particular time deposit specials and money market accounts) during the 2023 due to competitive pressures to retain deposits. Total corporate and subordinated debentures and other borrowings at June 30, 2023 were $792.1 million and consisted of trust preferred securities and subordinated debentures of $392.1 million and FHLB borrowings of $400.0 million. The Company borrowed $4.1 billion during the 2023 and repaid $3.7 billion in FHLB borrowings to increase liquidity. The Company reduced its period end FHLB borrowing by $500 million during the second quarter of 2023 from $900 million at March 31, 2023 as the financial markets stabilized and the stress on liquidity declined. Total short-term borrowings at June 30, 2023 were $581.4 million, consisting of $246.9 million in federal funds purchased and $334.5 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase. To the extent that we employ other types of non-deposit funding sources, typically to accommodate retail and correspondent customers, we continue to take in shorter maturities of such funds. Our current approach may provide an opportunity to sustain a low funding rate or possibly lower our cost of funds but could also increase our cost of funds if interest rates rise. 

&#8203; 

Through the operations of our Bank, we have made contractual commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of our business activities. These commitments are legally binding agreements to lend money to our customers at predetermined interest rates for a specified period of time. We manage the credit risk on these commitments by subjecting them to normal underwriting and risk management processes. We believe that we have adequate sources of liquidity to fund commitments that are drawn upon by the borrowers. In addition to commitments to extend credit, we also issue standby letters of credit, which are assurances to third parties that they will not suffer a loss if our customer fails to meet its contractual obligation to the third-party. Although our experience indicates that many of these standby letters of credit will expire unused, through our various sources of liquidity, we believe that we will have the resources to meet these obligations should the need arise. 

&#8203; 

Our ongoing philosophy is to remain in a liquid position, as reflected by such indicators as the composition of our earning assets, typically including some level of reverse repurchase agreements, federal funds sold, balances at the Federal Reserve Bank, and/or other short-term investments; asset quality; well-capitalized position; and profitable operating results. Cyclical and other economic trends and conditions can disrupt our desired liquidity position at any time. We expect that these conditions would generally be of a short-term nature. Under such circumstances, we expect our reverse repurchase agreements and federal funds sold positions, or balances at the Federal Reserve Bank, if any, to serve as the primary source of immediate liquidity. We could draw on additional alternative immediate funding sources from lines of credit extended to us from our correspondent banks . The Bank may also access funds from borrowing facilities established with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and the discount window of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. The Bank may also access funds through the Federal Reserve Bank Term Funding Program. At June 30, 2023, our Bank had a total FHLB credit facility of $7.8 billion, with $400.0 million in FHLB advances and $2.1 million FHLB letters of credit outstanding at quarter-end, leaving $7.4 billion in availability on the FHLB credit facility. At June 30, 2023, our Bank had $2.4 billion of credit available at the Federal Reserve Bank&#8217;s discount window and federal funds credit lines of $300.0 million with no balances outstanding at quarter-end. The Bank also has an internal limit on brokered deposits of 15% of total deposits which would allow capacity of $5.5 billion at June 30, 2023. The Bank had $1.2 billion of outstanding brokered deposits at the end of the quarter leaving $4.3 billion in available capacity. All of these resources would provide an additional $14.1 billion in funding if we needed additional liquidity. The Bank also has $4.1 billion in unpledged securities at June 30, 2023 that can be pledge to attain additional funds if necessary. We can also consider actions such as deposit promotions to increase core deposits. The Company has a $100.0 million unsecured line of credit with U.S. Bank National Association with no balance outstanding at June 30, 2023. We believe that our liquidity position continues to be adequate and readily available. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Our contingency funding plan describes several potential stages based on stressed liquidity levels. Liquidity key risk indicators are reported to the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. We maintain various wholesale sources of funding. If our deposit retention efforts were to be unsuccessful, we would use these alternative sources of funding. Under such circumstances, depending on the external source of funds, our interest cost would vary based on the range of interest rates charged. This could increase our cost of funds, impacting our net interest margin and net interest spread .

Asset-Liability Management and Market Risk Sensitivity 

&#8203; 

Our earnings and the economic value of equity vary in relation to the behavior of interest rates and the accompanying fluctuations in market prices of certain of our financial instruments. We define interest rate risk as the risk to earnings and equity arising from the behavior of interest rates. These behaviors include increases and decreases in interest rates as well as continuation of the current interest rate environment. 

&#8203; 

Our interest rate risk principally consists of reprice, option, basis, and yield curve risk. Reprice risk results from differences in the maturity or repricing characteristics of asset and liability portfolios. Option risk arises from embedded options in the investment and loan portfolios such as investment securities calls and loan prepayment options. Option risk also exists since deposit customers may withdraw funds at their discretion in response to general market conditions, competitive alternatives to existing accounts or other factors. The exercise of such options may result in higher costs or lower revenue. Basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates or indices, which subsequently result in narrowing spreads on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Basis risk also exists in administered rate liabilities, such as interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market accounts where the price sensitivity of such products may vary relative to general markets rates. Yield curve risk refers to adverse consequences of nonparallel shifts in the yield curves of various market indices that impact our assets and liabilities. 

&#8203; 

We use simulation analysis as a primary method to assess earnings at risk and equity at risk due to assumed changes in interest rates. Management uses the results of its various simulation analyses in combination with other data and observations to formulate strategies designed to maintain interest rate risk within risk tolerances. 

&#8203; 

Simulation analysis involves the use of several assumptions including, but not limited to, the timing of cash flows such as the terms of contractual agreements, investment security calls, loan prepayment speeds, deposit attrition rates, the interest rate sensitivity of loans and deposits relative to general market rates, and the behavior of interest rates and spreads. Equity at risk simulation uses assumptions regarding discount rates that value cash flows. Simulation analysis is highly dependent on model assumptions that may vary from actual outcomes. Key simulation assumptions are subject to sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of assumption changes on earnings at risk and equity at risk. Model assumptions are reviewed by our Assumptions Committee. 

Earnings at risk is defined as the percentage change in net interest income due to assumed changes in interest rates. Earnings at risk is generally used to assess interest rate risk over relatively short time horizons. 

Equity at risk is defined as the percentage change in the net economic value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates compared to a base net economic value. The discounted present value of all cash flows represents our economic value of equity. Equity at risk is generally considered a measure of the long-term interest rate exposures of the balance sheet at a point in time. 

The earnings simulation models take into account our contractual agreements with regard to investments, loans, deposits, borrowings, and derivatives as well as a number of behavioral assumptions applied to certain assets and liabilities. 

Mortgage banking derivatives used in the ordinary course of business consist of forward sales contracts and interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans. These derivatives involve underlying items, such as interest rates, and are designed to mitigate risk. Derivatives are also used to hedge mortgage servicing rights. For additional information see Note 28&#8212;Derivative Financial Instruments in the consolidated financial statements. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

From time to time, we execute interest rate swaps to hedge some of our interest rate risks. Under these arrangements, the Company enters into a variable rate loan with a client in addition to a swap agreement. The swap agreement effectively converts the client&#8217;s variable rate loan into a fixed rate loan. The Company then enters into a matching swap agreement with a third-party dealer to offset its exposure on the customer swap. The Company may also execute interest rate swap agreements that are not specific to client loans. As of June 30, 2023, the Company did not have such agreements. For additional information on these derivatives refer to Note 28&#8212;Derivative Financial Instruments in the consolidated financial statements. 

Our interest rate risk key indicators are applied to a static balance sheet using forward rates from the Moody&#8217;s Baseline Scenario. The Company will also use other rate forecasts, including, but not limited to, Moody&#8217;s Consensus Scenario. This Base Case Scenario assumes the maturity composition of asset and liability rollover volumes is modeled to approximately replicate current consolidated balance sheet characteristics throughout the simulation. These treatments are consistent with the Company&#8217;s goal of assessing current interest rate risk embedded in its current balance sheet. The Base Case Scenario assumes that maturing or repricing assets and liabilities are replaced at prices referencing forward rates derived from the selected rate forecast consistent with current balance sheet pricing characteristics. Key rate drivers are used to price assets and liabilities with sensitivity assumptions used to price non-maturity deposits. The sensitivity assumptions for the pricing of non-maturity deposits are subjected to sensitivity analysis no less frequently than on an annual basis. 

Interest rate shocks are applied to the Base Case on an instantaneous basis. Our policy establishes the use of upward and downward interest rate shocks applied in 100 basis point increments through 400 basis points. We calculate smaller rate shocks as needed. At times, market conditions may result in assumed rate movements that will be deemphasized. For example, during a period of ultra-low interest rates, certain downward rate shocks may be impractical. The model simulation results produced from the Base Case Scenario and related instantaneous shocks for changes in net interest income and changes in the economic value of equity are referred to as the Core Scenario Analysis and constitute the policy key risk indicators for interest rate risk when compared to risk tolerances. 

During the second quarter of 2022, management revised its deposit beta assumptions higher due to the rapid increase in interest rates and expected further increases. From the beginning of the upward rate cycle, our deposit costs have increased from five basis points to one hundred twenty-five basis points. During this period, the federal funds rate has increased 500 basis points. Accordingly, our cycle to date beta has been approximately 22.0%. Management recognizes the difficulty using historical data to forecast deposit betas in the current environment. For internal purposes, we are assuming a cumulative upward rate cycle beta of 29.0% with a terminal federal funds rate of 5.50% and a corresponding cumulative rate increase of 525 basis points. 

&#8203; 

The following interest rate risk metrics are derived from analysis using the Moody&#8217;s Consensus Scenario published in July 2023 as the Base Case. As of June 30, 2023, the earnings simulations indicated that the year 1 impact of an instantaneous 100 basis point increase / decrease in rates would result in an estimated 1.6% increase (up 100) and 2.2% decrease (down 100) in net interest income. 

&#8203; 

We use Economic Value of Equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;) analysis as an indicator of the extent to which the present value of our capital could change, given potential changes in interest rates. This measure also assumes a static balance sheet (Base Case Scenario) with rate shocks applied as described above. At June 30, 2023, the percentage change in EVE due to a 100-basis point increase or decrease in interest rates was 1.9% decrease and 0.03% decrease, respectively. The percentage changes in EVE due to a 200-basis point increase or decrease in interest rates were 4.7% decrease and 1.1% decrease, respectively. The interest rate shock analysis results for EVE sensitivities are unusual as the benefits of repricing assets are mitigated by increasing deposit costs, and downward shocks are constrained on various balance sheet categories due to the inability to price products below floors or zero. This is particularly meaningful given the cost of deposits as of June 30, 2023. 

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

The analysis below reflects a Base Case and shocked scenarios that assume a static balance sheet projection where volume is added to maintain balances consistent with current levels, except for PPP loans that are not assumed to be replaced. Base Case assumes new and repricing volumes reference forward rates derived from the Moody&#8217;s Consensus rate forecast. Instantaneous, parallel, and sustained interest rate shocks are applied to the Base Case scenario over a one-year time horizon.

LIBOR Transition 

&#8203; 

The publication of all tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR on a representative basis ceased as of the June 30, 2023. As previously noted, we established a cross-functional LIBOR transition working group that (1) assessed the Company&#39;s exposure to LIBOR indexed instruments and the data, systems and processes that were impacted; (2) established a detailed implementation plan; and (3) developed a formal governance structure for the transition. The Company developed and implemented various proactive steps to facilitate the transition on behalf of customers up through June 30, 2023, which included: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; The adoption and implementation of fallback provisions that provided for the determination of replacement rates for LIBOR-linked financial products. &#9679; The adoption of new products linked to alternative reference rates, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, consistent with guidance provided by the U.S. regulators, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, and GSEs. &#9679; The selection of SOFR indices as the replacement indices, and successful completion of systems testing using the SOFR replacement indices. &#9679; Successful transition of Libor-exposed instruments to SOFR and other indices as appropriate for contracts that provided for a specific replacement index other than SOFR. &#8203; 

We utilized the provisions of the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act passed by Congress and signed into law by the President in March 2022 for certain contracts referencing LIBOR. The Act provides for the use of SOFR as the replacement index with a spread adjustment when the remaining LIBOR indices are discontinued. The Act applies when there is no contract provision addressing the loss of LIBOR and may be used otherwise as well, provided the contract does not provide for a specific replacement index. 

&#8203; 

In addition, the Company developed and implemented processes to educate client-facing associates and coordinate communications with customers regarding the transition.

&#8203; 

As of June 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s LIBOR-indexed loans, derivatives, and trust preferred securities have migrated to SOFR and other indices and will reprice by reference to such replacement indices at the next scheduled repricing date. Final validations and other verification tasks will be completed during the third quarter of 2023. 

Deposit and Loan Concentrations 

&#8203; 

We have no material concentration of deposits from any single customer or group of customers. We have no significant portion of our loans concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries. Furthermore, we attempt to avoid making loans that, in an aggregate amount, exceed 10% of total loans to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities. As of June 30, 2023, there were no aggregated loan concentrations of this type. We do not believe there are any material seasonal factors that would have a material adverse effect on us. We do not have any foreign loans or deposits. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Concentration of Credit Risk 

&#8203; 

Each category of earning assets has a certain degree of credit risk. We use various techniques to measure credit risk. Credit risk in the investment portfolio can be measured through bond ratings published by independent agencies. In the investment securities portfolio, the investments consist of U.S. government-sponsored entity securities, tax-free securities, or other securities having ratings of &#8220;AAA&#8221; to &#8220;Not Rated&#8221;. All securities, with the exception of those that are not rated, were rated by at least one of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. The credit risk of the loan portfolio can be measured by historical experience. We maintain our loan portfolio in accordance with credit policies that we have established. Although the Bank has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial portion of our borrowers&#8217; abilities to honor their contracts is dependent upon economic conditions within our geographic footprint and the surrounding regions. 

We consider concentrations of credit to exist when, pursuant to regulatory guidelines, the amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by general economic conditions represents 25% of total Tier 1 capital plus regulatory adjusted allowance for credit losses of the Company, or $1.1 billion at June 30, 2023. Based on this criteria, we had seven such credit concentrations at June 30, 2023, including loans to lessors of nonresidential buildings (except mini-warehouses) of $6.9 billion, loans secured by owner occupied office buildings (including medical office buildings) of $1.9 billion, loans secured by owner occupied nonresidential buildings (excluding office buildings) of $1.8 billion, loans to lessors of residential buildings (investment properties and multi-family) of $2.1 billion, loans secured by 1st mortgage 1-4 family owner occupied residential property (including condos and home equity lines) of $8.0 billion, loans secured by jumbo (original loans greater than $548,250) of $2.3 billion, and loans secured by business assets including accounts receivable, inventory and equipment of $2.1 billion. The risk for these loans and for all loans is managed collectively through the use of credit underwriting practices developed and updated over time. The loss estimate for these loans is determined using our standard ACL methodology. 

After the adoption of CECL in the first quarter of 2020, banking regulators established guidelines for calculating credit concentrations. Banking regulators set the guidelines for construction, land development and other land loans to total less than 100% of total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL (CDL concentration ratio) and for total commercial real estate loans (construction, land development and other land loans along with other non-owner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans) to total less than 300% of total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL (CRE concentration ratio). Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the Bank&#8217;s total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Bank&#8217;s CDL concentration ratio was 59.9% and 64.8%, respectively, and its CRE concentration ratio was 242.3% and 249.0%, respectively. As of June 30, 2023, the Bank was below the established regulatory guidelines. When a bank&#8217;s ratios are in excess of one or both of these loan concentration ratios guidelines, banking regulators generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by Bank management. Therefore, we monitor these two ratios as part of our concentration management processes. 

&#8203;

R econciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP 

&#8203; 

The return on average tangible equity is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the effect of the average balance of intangible assets and adds back the after-tax amortization of intangibles to GAAP basis net income. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional information that is useful to investors in evaluating our performance and capital and may facilitate comparisons with other institutions in the banking industry as well as period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as promulgated under GAAP, and investors should consider the Company&#8217;s performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of the Company. Non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, are not audited, and may not be comparable to other similarly titled financial measures used by other companies. Investors should not consider non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company&#8217;s results or financial condition as reported under GAAP.

Cautionary Note Regarding Any Forward-Looking Statements 

&#8203; 

Statements included in this report, which are not historical in nature are intended to be, and are hereby identified as, forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward looking statements are based on, among other things, management&#8217;s beliefs, assumptions, current expectations, estimates and projections about the financial services industry, the economy, and the acquisition of Atlantic Capital. Words and phrases such as &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;approximately,&#8221; &#8220;continue,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;projects,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;is likely,&#8221; &#8220;look ahead,&#8221; &#8220;look forward,&#8221; &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;strategy,&#8221; &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;potential,&#8221; &#8220;possible&#8221; and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. We caution readers that forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict with regard to, among other things, timing, extent, likelihood and degree of occurrence, which could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. Such risks, uncertainties and assumptions, include, among others, the following:

For any forward-looking statements made in this report or in any documents incorporated by reference into this Report, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and are based on information available at that time. We do not undertake any obligation to update or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by federal securities laws. As forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, caution should be exercised against placing undue reliance on such statements. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements by us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this Report. 

&#8203; 

Additional information with respect to factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements may also be included in other reports that we file with the SEC. We caution that the foregoing list of risk factors is not exclusive and not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.
