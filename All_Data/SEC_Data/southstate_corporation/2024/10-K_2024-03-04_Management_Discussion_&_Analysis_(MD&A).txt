Introduction 

The following Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) describes SouthState Corporation and its subsidiary&#8217;s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, and the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, and also analyzes our financial condition as of December 31, 2023 as compared to December 31, 2022. Like most banking institutions, we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments. Our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits, on most of which we pay interest. Consequently, one of the key measures of our success is the amount of net interest income, or the difference between the income on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the expense on our interest- bearing liabilities, such as deposits. Another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. 

&#8203; 

There are risks inherent in all loans, so we maintain an allowance for credit losses to absorb our estimate of probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible. We establish and maintain this allowance by recording a provision or recovery for credit losses against our earnings. In the following section, we have included a detailed discussion of this process. 

&#8203; 

In addition to earning interest on our loans and investments, we earn income through fees and other services we charge to our customers. We incur costs in addition to interest expense on deposits and other borrowings, the largest of which is salaries and employee benefits. We describe the various components of this noninterest income and noninterest expense in the following discussion. 

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

The following section also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements. We encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other information included in this Report. 

Overview 

SouthState is a financial holding company headquartered in Winter Haven, Florida, and was incorporated under the laws of South Carolina in 1985. We provide a wide range of banking services and products to our customers through our Bank. The Bank operates SouthState|Duncan-Williams, a registered broker-dealer headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee that serves primarily institutional clients across the U.S. in the fixed income business. The Bank also operates SouthState Advisory, Inc., a wholly owned registered investment advisor, and Corporate Billing, a transaction-based finance company headquartered in Decatur, Alabama that provides factoring, invoicing, collection and accounts receivable management services to transportation companies and automotive parts and service providers nationwide. Corporate Billing&#8217;s previous holding company CBI Holding Company, LLC and its subsidiary CBI Real Estate Holding, LLC were merged into Corporate Billing effective November 30, 2023. The holding company also owns SSB Insurance Corp., a captive insurance subsidiary pursuant to Section 831(b) of the U.S. Tax Code. In late 2023, the Bank formed SSB First Street Corporation, an investment subsidiary headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware, to hold tax-exempt municipal investment securities as part of the Bank&#8217;s investment portfolio. 

&#8203; 

At December 31, 2023, we had $44.9 billion in assets and 5,184 full- time equivalent employees. Through our Bank branches, ATMs and online banking platforms, we provide our customers with a wide range of financial products and services, through a six (6) state footprint in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. These financial products and services include deposit accounts such as checking accounts, savings and time deposits of various types, safe deposit boxes, bank money orders, wire transfer and ACH services, brokerage services and alternative investment products such as annuities and mutual funds, trust and asset management services, loans of all types, including business loans, agriculture loans, real estate-secured (mortgage) loans, personal use loans, home improvement loans, automobile loans, manufactured housing loans, boat loans, credit cards, letters of credit, home equity lines of credit, treasury management services, and merchant services. 

&#8203; 

We also operate a correspondent banking and capital markets division within our national bank subsidiary, of which the majority of its bond salesmen, traders and operational personnel are housed in facilities located in Atlanta, Georgia, Memphis, Tennessee, Walnut Creek, California, and Birmingham, Alabama. This division&#8217;s primary revenue generating activities are related to its capital markets division, which includes commissions earned on fixed income security sales, fees from hedging services, loan brokerage fees and consulting fees for services related to these activities; and its correspondent banking division, which includes spread income earned on correspondent bank deposits (i.e., federal funds purchased) and correspondent bank checking account deposits and fees from safe-keeping activities, bond accounting services for correspondents, asset/liability consulting related activities, international wires, and other clearing and corporate checking account services. 

&#8203; 

We earned net income of $494.3 million, or $6.46 diluted earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;), during 2023 compared to net income of $496.0 million, or $6.60 diluted EPS, in 2022. Net income available to the common shareholders was down $1.7 million, or 0.4%, in 2023 compared to 2022. For further discussion of the Company&#8217;s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, and the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, see Results of Operations section of this MD&#38;A starting on page 66. 

&#8203; 

At December 31, 2023, we had total assets of approximately $44.9 billion compared to approximately $43.9 billion at December 31, 2022. See the Financial Condition section of this MD&#38;A starting on page 76 for a more detailed description of the change in our balance sheet. 

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

With high inflation and a rising interest rate environment, there was some deterioration in asset quality in 2023. However, our overall asset quality results remained strong during the year. Net charge offs as a percentage of average loans increased to 0.08% compared to 0.02% for the year ended December 31, 2022. The total nonperforming assets (&#8220;NPAs&#8221;) increased $74.4 million to $184.1 million at December 31, 2023 from $109.7 million at December 31, 2022. Non-acquired NPAs increased $75.2 million to $122.5 million at December 31, 2023 from $47.3 million at December 31, 2022, which was related to an increase in non-acquired nonperforming loans of $74.7 million. Non-acquired OREO and other NPAs increased by $466,000 to $711,000 as of December 31, 2023 compared to $245,000 as of December 31, 2022. Acquired NPAs decreased $827,000 to $61.6 million at December 31, 2023 from $62.5 million at December 31, 2022. Acquired nonperforming loans decreased $617,000 and acquired OREO and other nonperforming assets decreased $210,000. Total NPAs as a percentage of total assets increased 16 basis points to 0.41% at December 31, 2023 compared to 0.25% at December 31, 2022. While net charge-offs totaled $29.1 million, the Company recorded a total of $195.9 million of provision for credit losses for the trailing eight quarters. Our NPA ratios remained historically low. 

&#8203; 

Our efficiency ratio was 55.5% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 54.2% for the same period in 2022. The increase in our efficiency ratio was due to the effects of a 7.0% increase in noninterest expense being greater than the effects of a 5.8% increase in the total net interest income and noninterest income. The increase in noninterest expense was mainly due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $28.6 million, an increase in FDIC regulatory and other regulatory charges of $10.0 million and the recording of the FDIC special assessment expense of $25.7 million in 2023. 

&#8203; 

We continue to remain well-capitalized with a total risk-based capital ratio of 14.1% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9.4%, as of December 31, 2023, compared to 13.0% and 8.7%, respectively, at December 31, 2022. The improvement in the total risk-based capital ratio was mainly due to t otal risk-based capital increasing 11.1% with the increase in equity resulting from net income of $494.3 million recognized in 2023, along with the increase in the allowance for credit losses and unfunded commitments of $126.5 million includable in Tier 2 capital. Total risk-weighted assets increased $807.3 million, or 2.3%, in 2023. The improvement in the Tier 1 leverage ratio was due to the increase in Tier 1 capital of 9.8% with the increase in equity resulting from net income of $494.3 million recognized in 2023. Regulatory average assets used to calculate the Tier 1 leverage ratio only increased $707.6 million, or 1.6%, in 2023. We believe our current capital ratios position us well to grow both organically and through certain strategic opportunities. For further discussion of the Company&#8217;s financial condition as of December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022, see Financial Condition section of this MD&#38;A starting on page 76. 

Recent Events 

Capital Management 

&#8203; 

In April 2022, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program (&#8220;2022 Stock Repurchase Program&#8221;) authorizing the Company to repurchase up to 3,750,000 of the Company&#8217;s common shares along with the remaining authorized shares of 370,021 from the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program for a total authorization of 4,120,021 shares. During 2023, the Company repurchased a total of 100,000 shares at a weighted average price of $67.45, excluding cost of commissions, per share pursuant to the 2022 Stock Repurchase Program. During 2022, the Company did not repurchase any shares pursuant to the 2022 Stock Repurchase Program. During the first quarter of 2022, before the approval of the 2022 Stock Repurchase Program, the Company repurchased a total of 1,312,038 shares at a weighted average price of $83.99 per share pursuant to the 2021 Stock Repurchase Plan. 

&#8203; 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and follow general practices within the banking industry. Our financial position and results of operations are affected by management&#8217;s application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. Differences in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations and related disclosures. Understanding our accounting policies is fundamental to understanding our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. Accordingly, our significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 1 of our audited consolidated financial statements. 

The following is a summary of our critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates, assumptions and judgments.

Business Combinations 

&#8203; 

We account for acquisitions under FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations , which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting. All identifiable assets acquired, including loans, and liabilities assumed, are recorded at fair value. We adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , on January 1, 2020 which requires us to record purchased financial assets with credit deterioration (PCD assets), defined as a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination or issuance, at the purchase price plus the allowance for credit losses expected at the time of acquisition. Under this method, there is no provision for credit losses affecting net income on acquisition of PCD assets. Changes in estimates of expected credit losses after acquisition are recognized as provision for credit loss expense (or recovery of credit losses) in subsequent periods as they arise. Any non-credit discount or premium resulting from acquiring a pool of purchased financial assets with credit deterioration shall be allocated to each individual asset. At the acquisition date, the initial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective basis shall be allocated to individual assets to appropriately allocate any non-credit discount or premium. The non-credit discount or premium, after the adjustment for the allowance for credit losses, shall be accreted into interest income using the interest method based on the effective interest rate determined after the adjustment for credit losses at the adoption date. 

&#8203; 

A purchased financial asset that does not qualify as a PCD asset is accounted for similar to an originated financial asset. Generally, this means that an entity recognizes the allowance for credit losses for non-PCD assets through net income at the time of acquisition. In addition, both the credit discount and non-credit discount or premium resulting from acquiring a pool of purchased financial assets that do not qualify as PCD assets shall be allocated to each individual asset. This combined discount or premium shall be accreted into interest income using the effective yield method. 

For further discussion of our loan accounting and acquisitions, see Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 2&#8212;Mergers and Acquisitions, Note 4&#8212;Loans and Note 5&#8212;Allowance for Credit Losses to the audited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

&#8203; 

Allowance for Credit Losses or ACL 

&#8203; 

The ACL reflects management&#8217;s estimate of the portion of the amortized cost of loans and unfunded commitments that it does not expect to collect. Management has a methodology determining its ACL for loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. Management considers the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. The Company&#8217;s estimate of its ACL involves a high degree of judgment; therefore, management&#8217;s process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach a different reasonable conclusion. The Company&#8217;s ACL recorded on the balance sheet reflects management&#8217;s best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. The Company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the ACL for management&#8217;s current estimate of expected credit losses. See Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the ACL. See also Note 5&#8212;Allowance for Credit Losses and &#8220;Provision for Credit Losses&#8221; in this MD&#38;A. 

&#8203; 

One of the most significant judgments influencing the ACL is the macroeconomic forecasts from the third-party service provider. Changes in the economic forecasts may significantly affect the estimated credit losses which may potentially lead to materially different quantitatively modeled allowance levels from one reporting period to the next. Given the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables, it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the ACL. SouthState uses a third-party service provider to support the economic forecast assumptions under CECL forecast by providing various levels of economic scenarios. These scenarios are weighted in accordance with management assessment of scenarios as well as expectations of the general market and industry conditions. To illustrate the sensitivity of these scenarios, if a 100% probability weighting was applied to the adverse scenario rather than using the probability-weighted three scenario approach, this would result in an increase in the ACL by approximately $263.8 million. Conversely, if a 100% probability weighting was applied to the upside scenario, this would result in a decrease in the ACL by approximately $137.3 million. The adverse scenario includes assumptions including, but not limited to, an extended shutdown of the federal government, inflation, global events such as the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, tensions between China and Taiwan, tensions in the Middle east, political risks, increased unemployment and the U.S. economy falling into recession in 2024. Conversely, the upside scenario includes assumptions such as a swift resolution of international conflicts, stabilization of consumer confidence, more than full employment, reduced political tensions, resolution of congressional gridlock, and other favorable assumptions. This sensitivity analysis and related impact on the ACL is a hypothetical analysis and is not intended to represent management&#8217;s judgments or assumptions of qualitative loss factors that were utilized at December 31, 2023 

Mortgage Servicing Rights (&#8220;MSRs&#8221;) 

The Company has a mortgage loan servicing portfolio with related mortgage servicing rights. MSRs represent the present value of the future net servicing fees from servicing mortgage loans. Servicing assets and servicing liabilities must be initially measured at fair value, if practicable. For subsequent measurements, an entity can choose to measure servicing assets and liabilities either based on fair value or lower of cost or market. The Company uses the fair value measurement option for MSRs. MSRs are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of Mortgage Banking Income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

&#8203; 

The methodology used to determine the fair value of MSRs is subjective and requires the development of a number of assumptions, including anticipated prepayments of loan principal. Fair value is determined by estimating the present value of the asset&#8217;s future cash flows utilizing estimated market-based prepayment rates and discount rates, interest rates and other economic factors and assumptions validated through comparison to trade information, industry surveys and with the use of independent third-party appraisals. Risks inherent in the MSRs valuation include higher than expected prepayment rates and/or delayed receipt of cash flows. The value of MSRs is significantly affected by interest rates available in the marketplace, which influence loan prepayment speeds. In general, during periods of declining interest rates, the value of mortgage servicing rights declines due to increasing prepayments attributable to increased mortgage refinance activity. Conversely, during periods of rising interest rates, the value of servicing rights generally increases due to reduced refinance activity. 

&#8203; 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

&#8203; 

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less the estimated fair value of the liabilities assumed in a business combination. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the balance of goodwill was $1.9 billion. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset&#8217;s fair value. 

&#8203; 

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, which simplified the accounting for goodwill impairment for all entities by requiring impairment charges to be based on Step 1 of the previous accounting guidance&#8217;s two-step impairment test under ASC Topic 350. Under the guidance, if a reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an entity will record an impairment charge based on that difference. The impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The standard eliminated the requirement to calculate a goodwill impairment charge using Step 2, which involved calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated impairment. The standard does not change the guidance on completing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. An entity is able to perform an optional qualitative goodwill impairment assessment before proceeding to the quantitative step of determining whether the reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount exceeds it fair value. 

We evaluated the carrying value of goodwill as of October 31, 2023, our annual test date, and determined that no impairment charge was necessary as the fair value of the entity exceeded the carrying value. We will continue to monitor the impact of current economic conditions and other events on the Company&#8217;s business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition. If the current economic conditions and other events were to deteriorate and our stock price falls below current levels, we will have to reevaluate the impact on our financial condition and potential impairment of goodwill. 

&#8203; 

Core deposit intangibles and client list intangibles consist primarily of amortizing assets established during the acquisition of other banks. This includes whole bank acquisitions and the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities from other financial institutions. Core deposit intangibles represent the estimated value of long-term deposit relationships acquired in these transactions. Client list intangibles represent the value of long-term client relationships for the correspondent banking and wealth and trust management business. These costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives, such as deposit accounts in the case of core deposit intangible, on a method that we believe reasonably approximates the anticipated benefit stream from this intangible. The estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed for reasonableness. 

Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets 

&#8203; 

Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of the transactions reported in our consolidated financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related to differences between the tax basis and accounting basis of certain assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company determines the realization of deferred tax assets by considering all positive and negative evidence available, including the impact of recent operating results, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards and tax planning strategies. Determining whether deferred tax assets are realizable is subjective and requires the use of significant judgment. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more-likely-than-not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. Additionally, income tax returns are filed by the Company or its subsidiaries in various state and local jurisdictions based on the Company&#8217;s footprint. The tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction are complex and may be subject to different interpretations by the Company and the relevant taxing authorities. Therefore, the Company is required to exercise judgment in determining tax accruals and evaluating the Company&#8217;s tax positions, including evaluating uncertain tax positions. See Note 1 &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 12 &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements for further details and discussion.

Results of Operations 

Consolidated net income available to common shareholders decreased by $1.7 million, or 0.4%, to $494.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $496.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and increased $18.8 million, or 3.9%, compared to $475.5 million in 2021. Below are key highlights of our results of operations during 2023: 

##TABLE_START &#9679; A $547.4 million increase in interest income, resulting from a $538.4 million increase in interest income from loans and loans held for sale, a $14.2 million increase in interest income from investment securities, slightly offset by a $5.2 million decrease in interest income on federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreement to resell and interest-bearing deposits. The increases in interest income in loans and investment securities were mainly due to the increase in yield in the rising rate environment in 2022 and in 2023 as the Federal Reserve Bank has raised its federal funds rate 525 basis points. The increase in interest income from loans is also due to the increase in the average balance of loans of $3.9 billion through organic loan growth. The decline in interest income from federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell and interest-bearing deposits was due to a decline in average balance of $3.1 billion as liquidity tightened in 2023 with a more competitive deposit market in the rising rate environment; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; A $430.4 million increase in interest expense, resulted from a $403.3 million increase in interest expense from deposits, a $16.1 million increase in interest expense from corporate and subordinated debentures and other borrowings, and a $7.7 million and $3.4 million increase in interest expense in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, respectively. The rise in interest expense is attributed primarily to increased costs across all categories of interest-bearing liabilities as interest rates have increased in 2022 and 2023. The increase in average cost of interest-bearing liabilities was particularly felt in 2023 with the stress in financial markets and liquidity along with the increased competition for deposits. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 164 basis point in 2023 compared to the prior year; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; A $22.3 million decrease in noninterest income, which resulted primarily from a $29.7 million decrease in correspondent banking and capital markets income, a $4.4 million decline in mortgage banking income, a $1.9 million decrease in debit, prepaid, ATM and merchant card related income, and a $1.7 million decrease in SBA income. These decreases were offset by a $6.4 million increase in other noninterest income, a $6.1 million increase in service charges on deposit accounts, a $2.4 million increase in Bank Owned Life Insurance (&#8220;BOLI&#8221;) income, and a $428,000 increase in trust and investment services income (See Noninterest Income section on page 71 for further discussion); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; A $64.9 million increase in noninterest expense, resulted primarily from a $28.7 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense, the $25.7 million accrual for the FDIC special assessment in 2023, a $10.0 million increase in FDIC assessment and other regulatory charges, a $7.7 million increase in other noninterest expense, a $6.0 million increase in business development and staff related expense, a $4.8 million increase information services expenses, a $3.2 million increase in professional fees, and a $1.3 million increase in OREO expense and loan related expense. These increases were partially offset by a $17.7 million decrease in merger, branch consolidation and severance related expense and a $5.6 million decrease in amortization expense of intangible assets (See Noninterest Expense section on page 74 for further discussion); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; A $32.2 million increase in the provision for allowance for credit losses, as the Company recorded provision for credit losses of $114.1 million during 2023 compared to recording a provision for credit losses of $81.9 million in 2022. During 2023, we recorded a higher provision for credit losses as economic forecasts reflected the continued stress of inflation and rising interest rates that began in 2022 along with tight labor markets and global uncertainty; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Lower income tax provision of $769,000 primarily due to the change in pretax book income between the two years. The Company recorded pretax book income of $630.9 million in 2023 compared to pretax book income of $633.4 million in 2022. The Company&#8217;s effective tax rate was 21.64% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 21.68% for the year ended December 31, 2022. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Basic earnings per common share decreased 2.3% to $6.50 in 2023, from $6.65 in 2022 and decreased 3.8% from $6.76 in 2021. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Diluted earnings per common share decreased 2.1% to $6.46 in 2023, from $6.60 in 2022, and decreased 3.7% from $6.71 in 2021. ##TABLE_END &#8203; 

##TABLE_START &#9679; Return on average assets was 1.11% in 2023, a slight decrease compared to 1.12% in 2022 and a decrease compared to 1.19% in 2021. The decrease in 2023 compared to 2022 was driven by both the increase in total average assets of $175.5 million, or 0.4%, to $44.7 billion in 2023 along with the decrease in net income of $1.7 million, or 0.4%, to $494.3 million. The increase in average assets mainly resulted from the increase in non-acquired loans through organic growth partially offset by declines in investment securities and federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell and other interest-earning deposit as liquidity declined in 2023. The increase in 2022 compared to 2021 was driven by both increases in loans and investment securities through both the Atlantic Capital acquisition and organic growth. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Return on average common shareholders&#8217; equity decreased to 9.37% in 2023, compared to 9.84% in 2022, and decreased from 10.01% in 2021. The decrease in 2023 compared to 2022 was driven by the growth in average common shareholders&#8217; equity of 4.7%, or $237.1 million, while net income declined by 0.4%, or $1.7 million, to $494.3 million. The increase in average common shareholders&#8217; equity was mainly due to net income in 2023. The decrease in 2022 compared to 2021 was driven by the higher growth in average common shareholders&#8217; equity of 6.1%, or $291.4 million, compared to the growth in net income of 4.3%, or $20.5 million, to $496.0 million. The increase in average equity in 2022 was primarily resulted from the Atlantic Capital acquisition. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START &#9679; Our dividend payout ratio was 31.34% for 2023 compared with 29.54% in 2022 and 28.43% in 2021. The increase in the dividend payout ratio in 2023 compared to 2022 was due to the increase in total dividends paid during 2023 of 5.8%, or $8.4 million, while the net income available to common shareholders decreased 0.4%, or $1.7 million. The increase in the dividend payout ratio in 2022 compared to 2021 was due to the increase in total dividends paid during 2022 of 8.3%, or $11.3 million, being greater than the increase in net income available to common shareholders, which increased 4.3%, or $20.5 million. ##TABLE_END 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is the largest component of our net income. Net interest income is the difference between income earned on interest- earning assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is determined by the yields earned on interest-earning assets, rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, the relative balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the degree of mismatch, and the maturity and repricing characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest- bearing liabilities. Net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets represents our net interest margin. 

The Federal Reserve made four 25 basis-point rate increases in 2023, the most recent in late July 2023, resulting in a range of 5.25% to 5.50% at December 31, 2023 . As a result, the Company operated under an increasing rate environment for the majority of the year in 2023 while it operated under a comparatively lower rate environment in 2022. 

2023 compared to 2022 

Net interest income and net interest margin are highlighted for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 2022:

##TABLE_START &#9679; The non-tax equivalent and the tax equivalent net interest margin increased by 27 basis points and 26 basis points, respectively, in 2023 compared to 2022. The net interest margin increased primarily due to the rising rate environment in effect during 2023. Despite the 164 basis points increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities being greater than the 135 basis points increase in the yield on interest-earning assets, our net interest margin increased due to average interest-earning assets of $40.1 billion being greater than average interest-bearing liabilities of $26.0 million during 2023. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o Overall, our yield on interest-earning assets in 2023 increased 135 basis points from 2022, primarily due to higher yields on all interest-earning assets as the Federal Reserve Bank raised interest rates 525 basis points starting late in first quarter of 2022 . The increase in interest rates, in combination with the increase in the average balance of the higher yielding loan portfolio of $3.9 billion, along with the decline in the average balances of lower yielding federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell and other interest-earning deposits of $3.1 billion and investment securities of $615.6 million, affected the overall yield increase in interest-earning assets between the comparable periods. ##TABLE_END &#8203; 

##TABLE_START o The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities in 2023 compared to 2022 increased 164 basis points. This increase was driven by the effects from the rising rate environment on the repricing of all deposit accounts, federal funds purchased and securities purchased with agreement to repurchase and other borrowings. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 162 basis points as the increase occurred in all deposit categories. The average cost of federal funds purchased and securities purchased with agreements to repurchase increased 373 basis points and 111 basis points, respectively, while the average cost of other borrowings increased 66 basis points. The increase in the average cost of other borrowings was due to the variable rate trust preferred debt. The increase in overall average cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the 2023 from the same period in 2022 was also a result of the change in the mix of deposit balances, shifting from lower-costing savings and transaction deposit accounts to higher-costing certificates and other time deposits and money market accounts . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Our net interest income increased by $116.9 million, or 8.8%, to $1.5 billion during 2023, compared to 2022 as our interest income increased $547.4 million while interest expense increased $430.4 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o Our interest income increased by $547.4 million due to higher non-acquired loan interest income of $542.7 million attributable to both a higher average balance of $5.7 billion through organic loan growth and renewals of matured acquired loans that are moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio along with a higher yield of 126 basis points due to the rising rate environment. Investment securities interest income was higher by $14.2 million because of an increase in the yield of 34 basis points due to the rising rate environment. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o These increases in interest income were partially offset by lower federal funds sold and repurchase agreements interest income of $5.2 million and lower interest income on acquired loans of $3.7 million due to lower average balances by $3.1 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. Interest income on loans held for sale also declined by $643,000 due to a lower average balance of $33.9 million. The effects from the declines in average balance were partially offset by the increases in yields of 125 basis points on acquired loans, 378 basis on federal funds sold and repurchase agreements, and 248 basis points on loans held for sale from the effects of the rising rate environment. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o Our interest expense increased by of $430.4 million in 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to interest expense on interest-bearing deposits increasing $403.3 million, which was attributable to an increase in the average cost of 162 basis points as well as an increase in the average balance of $1.1 billion. As noted above, the increase in expense on interest-bearing deposit was significantly impacted by the change in mix from lower costing savings and transaction deposit accounts to higher costing certificate and other time deposit accounts and money market accounts as customer sought higher yields in the competitive deposit market in 2023. Interest expense related to other borrowings increased $16.1 million due to an increase in average cost of 66 basis points along with an increase in the average balance of $238.0 million. Interest expense on federal funds purchased and repurchased agreements increased $7.7 million and $3.4 million, respectively, due to increases in the average costs of 373 basis points and 111 basis points, respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Average interest-earning assets increased $216.5 million, or 0.5%, to $40.1 billion in 2023 compared to 2022. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o The increase in the average balance on non-acquired loan portfolio of $5.7 billion was due to organic growth and renewals of matured acquired loans that are moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o The decrease in the average balance on the acquired loan portfolio of $1.8 billion was due to paydowns, pay-offs and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o The average balance in investment securities decreased by $615.6 million. The decrease in average was primarily a result of maturities, calls and paydowns on available for sale and held to maturity securities of $590.8 million, and $190.8 million, respectively, during the year, along with sales of available for sale securities of $129.6 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in market value on available for sale securities of $112.7 million and purchases of available for sale securities of $80.4 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o The average balance on federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell and other interest earning deposits decreased $3.1 billion as the liquidity tightened in 2023 with the more competitive market for deposits with costumers seeking higher yields. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $1.2 billion, or 5.0%, to $26.0 billion in 2023 compared to 2022. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $1.1 billion primarily due to an increase in the average balance of higher costing time deposits of $1.4 billion. Of this increase in time deposits, $769.0 million was due to an increase in the use of brokered time deposits during 2023. The average balance of transaction and money market accounts increased $328.3 million during 2023 as lower costing savings account deposits declined $567.5 million. Within transaction and money market accounts, there was a shift to the higher costing money market account accounts in 2023 as customers sought higher yields driving the increase in balance. ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START o The average balance of federal funds purchased decreased $52.6 million and repurchase agreements decreased $77.3 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o The average balance of other borrowings increased by $238.0 million due to the increased use of short-term FHLB advance during 2023 as deposits markets became more competitive. ##TABLE_END 2022 compared to 2021 

Net interest income and net interest margin are highlighted for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2021: 

##TABLE_START &#9679; Both the non-tax equivalent and the tax equivalent net interest margin increased by 45 basis points in 2022 compared to 2021. While the yield on interest-earning assets increased 45 basis points, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities marginally increased 3 basis points. The increase in the net interest margin was primarily due to the rising rate environment in effect during 2022 as our interest-earning assets have repriced more quickly than our interest-bearing liabilities. The increase was also due to a change in asset mix as the lower yielding interest-bearing deposit and federal funds sold declined in 2022, while our higher yielding loan portfolio and investments increased. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o Overall, our yield on interest-earning assets in 2022 increased 45 basis points from 2021, primarily due to higher yields on all interest-earning assets as the Federal Reserve Bank raised interest rates 425 basis points starting late in first quarter of 2022. The increases in interest rates, in combination with the increase in the average balance of the higher yielding loan portfolio of $3.3 billion and the investment portfolio of $2.7 billion, along with the decline in the average balance of lower yielding interest-earning deposits and federal funds sold of $1.6 billion, affected the overall yield increase between the comparable periods. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities in 2022 compared to 2021 increased 3 basis points. This increase was driven by the effects from the rising rate environment on the repricing of variable rate products, including interest-bearing and savings deposits, federal funds purchased and trust preferred corporate debt. The cost of interest-bearing and savings deposits increased 5 basis points, while the cost of federal funds purchased increased 126 basis points and the cost of corporate and subordinated debentures increased 12 basis points. Overall, interest-bearing deposits have been slower to reprice in the rising rate environment. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Our net interest income increased by $302.5 million, or 29.3%, to $1.3 billion during 2022, compared to 2021, as interest income increased $312.2 million and interest expense only increased $9.7 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o Our interest income increased by $312.2 million due to &#8211; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9726; Higher non-acquired loan interest income of $235.2 million due to a higher average balance of $5.0 billion, higher investment securities interest income of $84.6 million because of a higher average balance of $2.7 billion, and higher federal funds sold and repurchase agreements interest income of $40.1 million due to the rising rate environment in effect during the current year even though the average balance was lower by $1.6 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9726; These increases in interest income were partially offset by lower interest income on acquired loans of $43.6 million due to a lower average balance of $1.6 billion resulting from paydowns, pay-offs and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. Interest income on loans held for sale also declined by $4.1 million due to a lower average balance of $177.9 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o Our interest expense increased by of $9.7 million in 2022 compared to 2021 due to &#8211; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9726; Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits increasing $3.8 million because of a slight increase in the average cost of 1 basis point along with a $1.7 billion increase in the average balance, interest expense on federal funds purchased increasing $3.3 million because of an increase in the average cost of 126 basis points, and interest expense related to other borrowings increasing $2.6 million because of an increase in the average cost of 14 basis points. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Average interest-earning assets increased $4.3 billion, or 12.0%, to $39.9 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o The increase in the average balance on non-acquired loan portfolio of $5.0 billion was due to organic growth and renewals of matured acquired loans that are moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o The decrease in the average balance on the acquired loan portfolio of $1.6 billion was due to paydowns, pay-offs and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. ##TABLE_END &#8203; 

##TABLE_START o The increase in the average balance in investment securities of $2.7 billion was a result of the Bank using a portion of the excess funds to increase the size of its investment securities, along with the Bank&#8217;s strategy on replacing lower yielding securities with higher yielding securities as interest rates started to increase in the first quarter of 2022, in addition to retaining a portion of the investment securities acquired from Atlantic Capital on March 1, 2022. The excess liquidity was from the growth in deposits in 2021 and during the first half of 2022. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $1.6 billion, or 6.8%, to $24.8 billion in 2022 compared to 2021. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $1.7 billion, primarily due to the interest-bearing deposits of $1.6 billion assumed from the Atlantic Capital acquisition on March 1, 2022. The average balance of lower costing interest-bearing transaction accounts, money market accounts and savings accounts increased $2.4 billion, while the average balance of higher costing time deposits declined $631.7 million in 2022 compared to 2021. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o The average balance of federal funds purchased decreased $204.2 million and repurchase agreements decreased $357,000. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o The average balance of other borrowings increased by $42.3 million due to $78.4 million of subordinated debentures assumed from Atlantic Capital on March 1, 2022, partially offset by the redemption of $13.0 million of subordinated debentures in late June 2022. ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_END &#8203; 

2023 compared to 2022 

Our noninterest income decreased $22.3 million, or 7.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022. This change in total noninterest income resulted from the following: 

##TABLE_START &#9679; Service charges on deposit accounts were higher in 2023 by $6.1 million, or 7.4%, compared to 2022. The increase was mainly attributable to a $3.9 million increase in account maintenance fees and a $2.4 million increase in Non-Sufficient Fund (&#8220;NSF&#8221;) fees, slightly offset by approximately $181,000 decrease in other services charges in 2023 compared to 2022. The majority of the increase in the account maintenance fees and the NSF fees in 2023 was related to business accounts as there was a full year of activity from the accounts acquired in the Atlantic Capital acquisition and the Company reduced that amount of business fees waived and charged off in 2023. ##TABLE_END &#8203; 

##TABLE_START &#9679; Debit, prepaid, ATM and merchant card related income decreased by $1.9 million, or 4.5%, in 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease in debit, ATM, prepaid and merchant card related income was driven by a decrease in debit/ATM fee income, net of card expense, of $2.0 million, due mainly to a higher card expense of $2.2 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Mortgage banking income decreased by $4.4 million, or 24.9%, which comprised of a $6.6 million, or 44.9%, decrease in secondary market mortgage income, offset by a $2.2 million, or 72.9%, increase in mortgage servicing related income. Mortgage production declined from $4.5 billion in 2022 to $2.2 billion in 2023 with the rise in mortgage rates continuing during 2023. The reduction in mortgage production resulted in lower mortgage income from the secondary market in 2023. We allocated a slightly higher percentage of mortgage production to the secondary market in 2023 compared to 2022. The allocation of mortgage production between portfolio and secondary market depends on the Company&#8217;s liquidity, market spreads and rate changes during each period and will fluctuate year to year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o During 2023, mortgage income from the secondary market comprised of a $16.9 million decline in gain on sale of mortgage loans, which is net of the commission expense related to mortgage production, offset by a $10.2 million increase in the change in fair value of the pipeline, loans held for sale and MBS forward trades. Mortgage commission expense was $8.6 million during 2023 compared to $12.8 million during 2022. The declines in the gain on sale of mortgage loans and mortgage commission expense was mainly due to the reduction in mortgage production. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o The increase in mortgage servicing related income, net of the hedge, during 2023 was due to a $1.9 million increase in the change in fair value of the MSR including decay and a $290,000 increase in servicing fee income. The increase in fair value of the MSR in 2023 was primarily due to an increase in gains on the MSR hedge of $16.8 million and a $1.4 million increase due to a decline in MSR decay, offset by a decrease in the change in fair value from interest rates of $16.2 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Trust and investment services income increased $428,000, or 1.1%, in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in fee earnings as the average assets under management increased $870.0 million, or 13.0%, and an increase in number of relationships under management from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START &#9679; Correspondent banking and capital markets income decreased by $29.7 million, or 37.7%, from 2022. The decline was due to the expense attributable to the variation margin payments for centrally cleared swaps, along with lower commissions and fees earned on fixed income security sales of $12.1 million during 2023 as the volume in sales declined compared to the same period in 2022 due to the volatility in financial markets and interest rate environment. We recorded an expense of $41.5 million related to variation margin payments in 2023 compared to an expense of $14.2 million in 2022 . These declines in income were partially offset by an increase of $7.6 million in income generated from the customer swap ARC hedging program in 2023 compared to 2022. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; SBA income decreased by $1.7 million, or 10.9%, compared to 2022. SBA income includes changes in fair value of the servicing asset, loan servicing fees, and gains on sale of SBA loans. The decrease was attributable to a decrease in gains on sale of SBA loans of $922,000 and a decline in the fair value of the SBA servicing asset of $911,000, partially offset by an increase in SBA servicing fee income of $126,000. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Bank owned life insurance income increased $2.4 million, or 9.8%, in 2023 compared to 2022. This increase was due to having a full year effect from the purchase of $86.0 million of new policies in March of 2022 and the addition of $74.6 million in BOLI resulting from the acquisition of Atlantic Capital in the first quarter of 2022 along with the purchase of $6.0 million of new policies purchased in 2023. In addition, the Company saw an increase of $296,000 in income received from the payout on BOLI policies during 2023 compared to 2022. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Other income increased by $6.4 million, or 72.3%, in 2023 compared to 2022. This increase was primarily due to approximately $3.7 million in income for tax refunds, income from a legal settlement of approximately $960,000, and an increase in income generated from prepaid cards of $766,000. Income from VISA merchant sponsorship program, in which the Bank earns fees by aiding merchants in processing transactions through VISA, also increased $729,000. The Bank also recorded a total of $486,000 in income from assisting small business customers with Employee Retention Credit (&#8220;ERC&#8221;) filings in 2023 . ##TABLE_END

2022 compared to 2021 

Our noninterest income decreased 12.7% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. This change in total noninterest income resulted from the following: 

##TABLE_START &#9679; Service charges on deposit accounts were higher in 2022 by $16.2 million, or 24.5%, compared to 2021. During the third quarter of 2022, the Company modified its consumer overdraft program to eliminate Non-Sufficient Funds (&#8220;NSF&#8221;) fees as well as transfer fees to cover overdrafts. We also started offering a deposit product with no overdraft fees. However, mainly due to the increase in numbers of customers and activity through the Atlantic Capital merger completed during the first quarter of 2022, service charge account maintenance fees increased $9.8 million, NSF and Automated Overdraft Privilege (&#8220;AOP&#8221;) charges increased $4.1 million, and commissions from sales of checks increased $1.7 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Debit, prepaid, ATM and merchant card related income was higher by $5.9 million, or 15.9%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase in debit, prepaid, ATM and merchant card related income was mainly driven by higher debit card income and credit card sales incentive income resulting from the increase in activity related to the acquisition of Atlantic Capital completed in the first quarter of 2022. Debit card income (net of debit card expenses) and credit card sales incentive increased by $4.1 million and $1.7 million, respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Mortgage banking income decreased by $46.8 million, or 72.5%, which was comprised of $45.5 million, or 75.5%, decrease from mortgage income in the secondary market and a $1.3 million, or 30.1%, decrease from mortgage servicing related income, net of the hedge. Starting in the second quarter of 2021, the Company allocated a lower percentage of its mortgage production and pipeline to the secondary market, which resulted in a decrease in mortgage income from the secondary market. The allocation of mortgage production between portfolio and secondary market depends on the Company&#8217;s liquidity, market spreads and rate changes during each period and will fluctuate year to year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o During 2022, mortgage income from the secondary market comprised of a $4.8 million increase in the change in fair value of the pipeline, loans held for sale and MBS forward trades and a $50.4 million decrease in the net gain on sale of mortgage loans due to overall lower mortgage production in 2022, along with the lower allocation of mortgage production going to the secondary market. Mortgage commission expense was $12.8 million during 2022 compared to $27.2 million during 2021. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o The decrease in mortgage servicing related income, net of the hedge during 2022 was due to a $3.4 million decrease in the change in fair value of the MSR including decay, which was partially offset by a $2.1 million increase from servicing fee income. The decrease in the change in fair value of the MSR was primarily due to an increase in losses on the MSR hedge of $13.3 million, offset by an increase in the change in fair value from interest rates of $5.0 million and a $5.0 million decline in MSR decay as interest rates have increased since 2021. The increase in the servicing fee income is due to the increase in size of the servicing portfolio. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Trust and investment services income increased $2.0 million, or 5.5%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in fees earnings as the assets under management increased $53.9 million, or 0.8%, and increases in numbers of accounts and relationships under management from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Correspondent banking and capital markets income for 2022 decreased by $31.3 million, or 28.4%, from 2021. The decline was due to lower commissions and fees earned on fixed income security sales during 2022 as the volume in sales declined from 2021 and due to expense attributable to the variation margin payments for the centrally cleared swaps. During 2022, the Company determined the variation margin payments for its interest rate swaps centrally cleared through London Clearing House (&#8220;LCH&#8221;) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange (&#8220;CME&#8221;) met the legal characteristics of daily settlements of the derivatives rather than collateral. The expense or income attributable to the variation margin payments for the centrally cleared swaps is now reported in noninterest income, specifically within Correspondent and Capital Markets Income, as opposed to interest income or interest expense. We recorded expense of $14.0 million related to variation margin payments in 2022 compared to income of $43,000 in 2021. The increase in expense in 2022 was due to the rise in interest rates which caused a decline in value in our centrally cleared interest rate swaps with LCH and CME. Refer to Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, section titled &#8220;Derivative Financial Instruments&#8221; for a detailed discussion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; SBA income, including the impact from the change to fair value accounting during 2022, increased by $3.8 million, or 31.8% compared to 2021. SBA income includes changes in fair value of the servicing asset, loan servicing fees and gains on sale of SBA loans. The increase is mainly attributable to additional business resulting from the acquisition of Atlantic Capital. ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#9679; Bank owned life insurance income increased $5.9 million, or 32.1%, in 2022 compared to 2021. This increase was due to the purchase of $86.0 million of new policies since March 2022 and the addition of $74.6 million in bank owned life insurance through the acquisition of Atlantic Capital completed in the first quarter of 2022, along with an increase in income from the payout of bank owned life insurance policies of $1.1 million in 2022 compared to 2021. ##TABLE_END Noninterest expense represents the largest expense category for our company. Our expenses in 2023 increased $64.9 million or 7.0% from 2022. Our noninterest expenses in 2022 decreased $18.7 million or 2.0% from 2021.

2023 compared to 2022 

&#8203; 

Noninterest expense increased $64.9 million, or 7.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022. The change in total noninterest expense resulted from the following: 

&#8203; 

##TABLE_START &#9679; Salaries and employee benefits increased $28.7 million, or 5.2%, in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries of $39.9 million resulting from merit increases and increase in numbers of employees. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in commissions of $2.5 million, mainly attributable to lower commissions related to lower bond sales within the correspondent division and loan sales with the SBA division along with declines in employee benefits of $2.2 million, and a decrease in incentives of $9.0 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Information services expense increased $4.8 million, or 6.0%, in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase was due to additional cost associated with the Company updating systems and software as it grows in size and complexity. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; OREO expense and loan related expense increased $1.3 million, or 365.0%, in 2023 compared to 2022, which was primarily due to approximately a $1.1 million increase in Shared Appreciation Mortgage (&#8220;SAM&#8221;) related expenses including legal, tax and other costs. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Amortization of intangibles, which is related to the Company&#8217;s prior mergers, decreased $5.6 million, or 17.0%. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Business development and staff related expense increased $6.0 million, or 31.8%, in 2023 compared to 2022. This increase was mainly due to an increase in employee expenses including employee travel expense, convention and meeting expense, recruitment and relocation costs associated with the Company investing in new talent and employee education and training related costs. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Professional fees increased $3.2 million, or 21.0%, in 2023 compared to 2022. This increase was primarily due to increases in consulting and audit related fees totaling $6.2 million, offset by a decrease in non-loan and loan legal and advisory related fees of $3.0 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; FDIC assessment and other regulatory charges increased $10.0 million, or 43.6%. This increase was primarily due to an increase in FDIC assessment of $10.6 million, slightly offset by declines from other regulatory fees of $599,000. The increase in the FDIC assessment was primarily due to an increase in the FDIC assessment rate in 2023 to bring the overall FDIC fund to 1.35x total deposit by the end of 2028. The increase also reflects ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START changes in the Company&#8217;s size and complexity, along with the resulting effects on the Company&#8217;s liquidity compared to 2022. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; The Company incurred a total of $25.7 million of the FDIC&#8217;s special assessment for the two-year special assessment period, with the entire assessed amount being recorded during the fourth quarter of 2023. The special assessment was introduced to recover losses to the FDIC&#8217;s Deposit Insurance Fund resulting from bank failures that occurred during early 2023. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Merger, branch consolidation and severance related expense decreased $17.7 million, or 57.4% in 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a $21.9 million decrease in merger expenses pertaining to the Atlantic Capital and CenterState mergers and a $4.7 million decrease in branch consolidation related expense in 2023 compared to 2022. These decreases were offset by severance related payments totaling $8.0 million related to restructuring costs recorded in 2023. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Other noninterest expense increased $7.7 million, or 11.8%, compared to 2022. This increase was mainly attributable to a $10.1 million increase in earnings credit expense to Homeowners Association (&#8220;HOA&#8221;) customers. The Bank provides a credit to HOA customers based on the average deposit balances held that reduces fees for other services provided. There was a $2.8 million increase in state franchise and occupation tax payments, and a $2.7 million increase related to a new subscription to a system that provides real-time financial market data analysis services. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in fraud charge-offs, tax penalties, digital banking losses, and other insurance and miscellaneous operational charge-off related expenses totaling approximately $9.0 million. ##TABLE_END &#8203; 

2022 compared to 2021 

&#8203; 

Noninterest expense decreased $18.7 million, or 2.0% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. The change in total noninterest expense resulted from the following: 

&#8203; 

##TABLE_START &#9679; Salary and employee benefits increased by $2.7 million, or 0.5%, primarily due to the addition of Atlantic Capital employees during the year, annual salary increases, and higher 2022 incentive costs. This increase was partially offset by a $7.3 million decline in commission expense and higher deferred loan costs due to increased loan production volumes and the late 2021 update of the Company&#8217;s standard loan costs. During 2022, we recorded a total of $383.6 million in salary expense and $(88.2) million in net deferred loan costs, compared to $366.2 million and $(46.5) million, respectively, during 2021. During 2022, we recorded a total of $35.5 million in commission expense and $96.8 million in incentive expense, compared to $42.8 million and $71.8 million, respectively, during 2021 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Occupancy expense decreased $2.7 million, or 3.0%. The decrease was related to the cost savings associated with Atlantic Capital and branch consolidations that occurred during 2022. The number of branches declined in 2022 to 251 from 281 at the end of 2021. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Information services expense increased $5.3 million, or 7.1%. The increase was due to additional cost associated with systems added through our acquisition of Atlantic Capital, along with the cost of the Company updating systems as it grows in size and complexity. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Business development and staff related expense increased $4.4 million, or 30.5%, due mainly to the increase in employees resulting from the merger with Atlantic Capital and additional employee travel and entertainment as the COVID-19 pandemic receded. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Professional fees increased $4.7 million, or 44.2%, in 2022 compared to 2021. This increase was primarily due to increases in non-loan legal, advisory and consulting related fees. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; FDIC assessment and other regulatory charges increased $5.1 million, or 28.1%. This increase was due to an increase in FDIC assessments and other regulatory charges. The FDIC assessment increased $4.3 million and OCC examination fee increased $761,000 as the Company continues to grow in size and complexity. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Merger and branch consolidation related expense decreased $36.4 million, or 54.1% in 2022 compared to 2021. The expense in 2022 consists mainly of costs associated with branch consolidations and the merger related costs pertaining to the Atlantic Capital acquisition. The expense in 2021 mainly consisted of costs related to the merger with CenterState. Merger and branch consolidation expense of $18.5 million in 2022 and $1.7 million in 2021 was related primarily to the merger with Atlantic Capital while $64.4 million in merger and branch consolidation expense was related to the merger with CenterState in 2021. ##TABLE_END &#8203; 

##TABLE_START &#9679; The Company had extinguishment of debt cost of $11.7 million in 2021. This cost was from the write-off of the unamortized fair market value adjustment recorded on the trust preferred securities assumed in the CenterState merger. All of the trust preferred securities assumed in the CenterState merger were redeemed in June 2021. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Other noninterest expense increased by $12.7 million, or 24.0%. This increase was mainly due to a general increase in expenses due to the merger with Atlantic Capital, an increase in fraud, digital banking and miscellaneous operational charge-off related expenses of $6.5 million, expense related to the settlement of lawsuits of $2.6 million, increases in donations of $1.5 million, increases in tax penalties of $1.3 million, and increases in incurred but not reported insurance loss reserves of $1.1 million. ##TABLE_END &#8203; 

Income Tax Expense 

Our effective tax rate held consistent at 21.64% at December 31, 2023, mirroring the 21.68% rate for the year-ended December 31, 2022. The slight decrease was due to a slight decrease in pre-tax book income, an increase in tax-exempt income, an increase in federal tax credits, offset partially by an increase in TEFRA interest expense disallowance and an increase in non-deductible FDIC premiums compared to December 31, 2022 . For additional information refer to Note 12&#8212;Income Taxes in the consolidated financial statements.

Financial Condition 

Overview 

&#8203; 

At December 31, 2023, we had total assets of approximately $44.9 billion, consisting principally of $32.4 billion in total loans, before taking into account the allowance for credit losses of $456.6 million, $7.5 billion in investment securities, $1.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $1.9 billion in goodwill. Our liabilities at December 31, 2023 totaled $39.4 billion, consisting principally of deposits of $37.0 billion ($10.6 billion in noninterest-bearing and $26.4 billion in interest-bearing), $804.5 million derivative liabilities and $981.1 million of short-term and long-term borrowings. At December 31, 2023, our shareholders&#8217; equity was $5.5 billion. 

&#8203; 

At December 31, 2022, we had total assets of approximately $43.9 billion, consisting principally of $30.2 billion in total loans, before taking into account the allowance for credit losses of $356.4 million, $8.2 billion in investment securities, $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $1.9 billion in goodwill. Our liabilities at December 31, 2022 totaled $38.8 billion, consisting principally of deposits of $36.4 billion ($13.2 billion in noninterest-bearing and $23.2 in interest-bearing) and short-term and long-term borrowings of $948.7 million. At December 31, 2022, our shareholders&#8217; equity was $5.1 billion. 

&#8203; 

Book value per common share was $72.78 at the end of 2023, an increase from $67.04 at the end of 2022. Book value per common share increased in 2023 as shareholder equity increased by 9.0% while common shares outstanding only increased by 0.4%. The primary reasons for an increase in shareholder&#8217;s equity of $458.2 December 31, 2023 were due to net income of $494.3 million and a $94.6 million increase in AOCI related to unrealized gains on available for sale securities and post-retirement benefit plans. These increases were partially offset by declines resulting from dividends paid to shareholders of $154.9 million, common stock repurchased from officers and directors for income taxes owed on their vested shares of restricted stock of $9.3 million, and common stock repurchased in the open market of $6.7 million. 

&#8203; 

Our common equity to assets ratio increased to 12.3% in 2023, compared to 11.6% in 2022. The improvement during 2023 was due to an increase in shareholders&#8217; equity of 9.0%, resulting from the items noted above, while total assets had a moderate increase of 2.2%. 

&#8203; 

Trading Securities 

We have a trading portfolio associated with our Correspondent Bank Division and its subsidiary SouthState|Duncan-Williams. This portfolio is carried at fair value and realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in trading securities revenue, a component of Correspondent Banking and Capital Markets Income in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Securities purchased for this portfolio have primarily been municipal bonds, treasuries and mortgage-backed agency securities, which are held for short periods of time and totaled $31.3 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022. 

Investment Securities 

We use investment securities, our second largest category of earning assets, to generate interest income, provide liquidity, fund loan demand or deposit liquidation, and pledge as collateral for public funds deposits, repurchase agreements, derivative exposures and to augment borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, investment securities totaled $7.5 billion and $8.2 billion, respectively . For the year ended December 31, 2023, average investment securities were $7.7 billion, or 19.5% of average earning assets, compared with $8.4 billion, or 21.2% of average earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2022. The expected average life of the investment portfolio at December 31, 2023 was approximately 7.87 years, compared with 7.96 years at December 31, 2022. See Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the audited consolidated financial statements for our accounting policy on investment securities.

As securities are purchased, they are designated as held to maturity or available for sale based upon our intent, which considers liquidity needs, interest rate expectations, asset/liability management strategies, and capital requirements.

&#8203; 

During 2023, our total investment securities decreased $725.9 million, or 8.9%, from December 31, 2022. During 2023, we purchased $307.1 million of securities, $80.4 million classified as available for sale and $226.7 million classified as other investments. These purchases were offset by maturities, paydowns, sales and calls of investment securities totaling $1.1 billion. Net amortization of premiums were $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. During 2022, t he Atlantic Capital acquisition added $691.7 million of investment securities available for sale to our portfolio. We immediately sold $414.4 million in securities, after principal paydowns, and retained $273.7 million in our portfolio. The Atlantic Capital securities retained were mostly state and municipal obligations. 

At December 31, 2023, the unrealized net loss of the available for sale investment securities portfolio was $776.6 million, or 14.0%, below its amortized cost basis. Comparable valuations at December 31, 2022 reflected an unrealized net loss of the available for sale investment portfolio of $889.3 million, or 14.3%, below its amortized cost basis. The increase in fair value in the available for sale investment portfolio at December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022 was attributable to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s decision during their latest policy meeting held in December 2023 to hold the rates steady with indications of potential rate cuts in 2024. At December 31, 2023, the unrealized net loss of the held to maturity investment securities portfolio was $402.7 million, or 16.2%, below its amortized cost basis. At December 31, 2022, the unrealized net loss of the held to maturity investment securities portfolio was $433.1 million, or 16.1%, below its amortized cost basis.

Agency mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;MBS&#8221;), agency collateralized mortgage-obligations (&#8220;CMO&#8221;) and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;CMBS&#8221;) are guaranteed by the issuing government-sponsored enterprise (&#8220;GSE&#8221;) as to the timely payments of principal and interest. Except for Government National Mortgage Association securities, which have the full faith and credit backing of the United States Government, the GSE alone is responsible for making payments on this guaranty. While the rating agencies have not rated any of the MBS, CMO and CMBS issued, senior debt securities issued by GSEs are rated consistently as &#8220;Triple-A.&#8221; Most market participants consider agency MBS, CMOs and CMBSs as carrying an implied Aaa rating (S&#38;P rating of AA+) because of the guarantees of timely payments and selection criteria of mortgages backing the securities. We do not own any private label mortgage-backed securities. The balances presented under the ratings above reflect the amortized cost of the investment securities. 

##TABLE_END Held to maturity 

As described above, the Company elected to classify some of its securities purchased as held to maturity at the time of purchase. The securities designated as held to maturity are securities the Company does not intend to sell and expects to hold through maturity. The securities consist of $197.3 million of agency securities, $2.2 billion of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S government agencies or sponsored enterprises and $53.1 million of Small Business Administration loan-backed securities. The following are highlights of our held to maturity portfolio: 

##TABLE_START &#9679; Total amortized cost of held to maturity portfolio totaled $2.5 billion ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; The balance of securities held to maturity represented 5.5% of total assets at December 31, 2023. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; No purchases or sales of held to maturity investment securities in 2023; maturities, calls and paydowns totaled $190.8 million in 2023. ##TABLE_END 

&#8203; 

Available for sale 

Securities available for sale consist of debentures of government sponsored entities, state and municipal bonds, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S government agencies or sponsored enterprises, Small Business Administration loan-backed securities and corporate securities. At December 31, 2023, investment securities with a fair value and amortized cost of $4.8 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively, were classified as available for sale. The adjustment for net unrealized losses of $776.6 million between the carrying value of these securities and their amortized cost has been reflected, net of tax, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. The following are highlights of our available for sale securities: 

##TABLE_START &#9679; Total securities available for sale decreased $542.4 million, or 10.2%, from the balance at December 31, 2022 . The unrealized gain/loss position on the investment portfolio increased $112.7 million and net amortization of premiums was $15.2 million during 2023. We purchased $80.4 million of available for sale investment securities in 2023, partially offset by maturities, calls and paydowns totaling $590.8 million and sales totaling $129.6 million in 2023. The sales in 2023 were mainly related to restructuring our portfolio to fit our investment strategy and risk profile. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; The balance of securities available for sale represented 10.7% of total assets at December 31, 2023 and 12.1% of total assets at December 31, 2022. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Interest income earned on all investment securities in 2023 was $186.4 million, an increase of $14.2 million, or 8.3%, from $172.2 million in 2022. The increase was due to an increase in the yield on investment securities while the total average balance decreased $615.6 million. The yield on investment securities increased 34 basis points during 2023, to 2.4%. The improvement in the yield was due the maturities, calls and sales of lower yielding securities. ##TABLE_END &#8203; 

At December 31, 2023, we had 1,232 investment securities (including both available for sale and held to maturity) in an unrealized loss position, which totaled $1.2 billion, compares to 1,311 investment securities in an unrealized loss position, which totaled $1.3 billion at December 31, 2022. See Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3&#8212;Investment Securities in the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

Management evaluates securities for impairment where there has been a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis of a security to determine whether there is a credit loss associated with the decline in fair value on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. For securities designated as held for sale, credit losses are calculated individually, rather than collectively, using a discounted cash flow method, whereby management compares the present value of expected cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the security. The credit loss component would be recognized through the provision for credit losses. Consideration is given to (1) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer including looking at default and delinquency rates, (2) the outlook for receiving the contractual cash flows of the investments, (3) the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (4) our intent to hold the security as well as there being no requirement to sell the security, (5) the anticipated outlook for changes in the general level of interest rates, (6) credit ratings, (7) third-party guarantees, and (8) collateral values. In analyzing an issuer&#8217;s financial condition, management considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, the results of reviews of the issuer&#8217;s financial condition, and the issuer&#8217;s anticipated ability to pay the contractual cash flows of the investments. The Company performed an analysis that determined that the following securities have a zero expected credit loss: U.S. Treasury Securities, Agency-Backed Securities including securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, FHLB, FFCB and SBA. All of the U.S. Treasury and Agency-Backed Securities have the full faith and credit backing of the United States Government or one of its agencies. Municipal securities and all other securities that do not have a zero expected credit loss are evaluated quarterly to determine whether there is a credit loss associated with a decline in fair value. All debt securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2023 continue to perform as scheduled and we do not believe there is a credit loss or a provision for credit losses is necessary. Also, as part of our evaluation of our intent and ability to hold investments, we consider our investment strategy, cash flow needs, liquidity position, capital adequacy and interest rate risk position. We do not currently intend to sell the securities within the portfolio and it is not more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the debt securities. 

&#8203; 

Also, as part of our evaluation of our intent and ability to hold investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market, we consider our investment strategy, cash flow needs, liquidity position, capital adequacy and interest rate risk position. We do not currently intend to sell the securities within the portfolio and it is not more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the debt securities. Changes in the above considerations may affect our intent in the future. See Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Account Policies for further discussion.

Other Investments 

Other investment securities include primarily our investments in FHLB and FRB stock with no readily determinable market value. Accordingly, when evaluating these securities for impairment, management considers the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than recognizing temporary declines in value. As of December 31, 2023, other investment securities represented approximately $192.0 million, or 0.43% of total assets and primarily consisted of FRB and FHLB stock, which totaled $150.3 million and $22.8 million, respectively. There were no gains or losses on the sales of these securities during 2023 or 2022.

These securities may be pledged to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta or the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta Discount Window or Bank Term Funding Program. Approximately 14.2% of the investment portfolio is comprised of municipal securities. A portion of the municipal bond portfolio may be pledged to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta subject to their credit approval. Approximately 95% of the municipal bond portfolio has ratings in the Double A or Triple A category. 

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

During 2023, we sold approximately $125.3 million of municipal securities given advantageous market conditions. The primary rationale for the sale was to reduce municipal and portfolio duration/price risk at an opportune moment in fixed income markets. As of December 31, 2023, the portfolio had an effective duration of 5.74 years. We continue to monitor duration risk and seek to align actual duration with the target range.

Loan Portfolio 

Our loan portfolio remains our largest category of interest- earning assets. At December 31, 2023, total loans, excluding held for sale loans, were $32.4 billion, which was an overall increase of $2.2 billion, or 7.3%, from the balance at the end of 2022. Non- acquired loan growth was $3.7 billion, or 16.1% for 2023, driven by organic growth. The loan growth was made up of a 32.5% increase in consumer real estate loans, a 13.5% increase in non- owner occupied real estate loans (including construction and land development loans), a 9.2% increase in commercial owner occupied real estate loans, a 11.7% increase in commercial and industrial loans, a 5.5% increase in other income producing property and a 1.8% increase in consumer non real estate loans. Total acquired loans decreased by $1.5 billion, or 19.9% from the balance at the end of 2022. The decrease in acquired loans was due to paydowns and payoffs in both the PCD and Non-PCD loan categories along with renewals of acquired loans that were moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio.

Average total loans outstanding during 2023 were $31.4 billion, an increase of $3.9 billion, or 14.4%, over the 2022 average of $27.5 billion. (For further discussion of the Company&#8217;s acquired loan accounting, see Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 2&#8212;Mergers and Acquisitions, Note 4&#8212;Loans and Note 5&#8212;Allowance for Credit Losses in the consolidated financial statements.)

Between both the non-acquired and acquired portfolios, 60.2% of loans were non-owner occupied and consumer real estate loans. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9726; Of the non-acquired real estate loans at December 31, 2023, $9.2 billion, or 28.3% of the loan portfolio were secured by non-owner occupied real estate.

At December 31, 2022, we had $4.4 billion in consumer owner occupied loans and $958.2 million in home equity loans in the non-acquired loan portfolio. The Company made the decision to hold more 1-4 family mortgage production in its portfolio in 2023 rather than sell the loans into the secondary market. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9726; Acquired loans secured by consumer real estate are comprised of $666.6 million in consumer owner occupied loans and $255.0 million in home equity loans at December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2022, we had $781.0 million in consumer owner occupied loans and $355.0 million in home equity loans in the acquired loan portfolio. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o Non-acquired and acquired commercial owner-occupied real estate loans were $4.0 billion, or 12.5%, and $1.5 billion, or 4.5%, respectively, of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2023 compared to $3.7 billion, or 12.2%, and $1.8 billion, or 5.9%, respectively, of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2022. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9726; Non-acquired commercial owner-occupied real estate loans increased $340.8 million through organic growth and renewals of acquired loans. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9726; Acquired commercial owner-occupied real estate loans decreased $303.3 million due to principal payments, charge offs, foreclosures and renewals of acquired loans that were moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio from December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2023. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o Non-acquired and acquired commercial and industrial loans were $4.6 billion, or 14.2%, and $903.5 million, or 2.8%, respectively, of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2023 compared to $4.1 billion, or 13.6%, and $1.2 billion, or 4.0%, respectively, of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2022. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9726; Non-acquired commercial and industrial loans increased $482.7 million from December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2023. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9726; Acquired commercial and industrial loans decreased $291.6 million from December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2023. ##TABLE_END 

Total loan interest income, including interest income on held for sale loans, was $1.7 billion in 2023, an increase of $538.4 million, or 45.7%, compared to $1.2 billion in 2022. This increase was mainly due to a 126-basis point increase in the yield on the non-acquired portfolio and a 125-basis point increase in the yield on the acquired portfolio. The yield on the non-acquired loan portfolio increased from 4.03% in 2022 to 5.29% in 2023 and the yield on the acquired loan portfolio increased from 4.85% in 2022 to 6.10% in 2023. The increase in the yields on the non-acquired loan portfolio and the acquired loan portfolio was due to the rise in interest rates starting in March 2022 . The effects on interest income from the overall increase in the yields on loans was enhanced by a $5.7 billion increase in the average balance of our non-acquired loan portfolio, offset by a $1.8 billion decrease in the average balance of our acquired loan portfolio. The growth in the non-acquired loan portfolio average balance was due to normal organic growth and renewals of acquired loans . The decline in the acquired loan portfolio was due to paydowns and payoffs, along with renewals of acquired loans that were moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. 

The table below shows the contractual maturity of the non-acquired loan portfolio at December 31, 2023.

Total non-acquired nonperforming loans were $121.8 million, or 0.46% of total non-acquired loans, an increase of approximately $74.7 million, or 158.9%, from December 31, 2022. The increase in nonperforming loans was driven primarily by an increase in commercial nonaccrual loans of $59.0 million, an increase in consumer nonaccrual loans of $10.9 million and an increase in accruing loans past due 90 days or more of $8.9 million, offset by a decrease in restructured nonaccrual loans of $4.1 million. The increase in commercial nonaccrual loans from December 31, 2022, was primarily due to three commercial and industrial relationships totaling $41.4 million, six commercial owner-occupied loans totaling $9.8 million, and three commercial non owner occupied loans totaling $4.2 million. The increase in accruing loans past due 90 days or more are deemed to be low risk and greater than 70% of these loans have been brought current since the year-end 2023. Acquired nonperforming loans were $60.9 million, or 1.03% of total acquired loans, a decrease of $617,000, or 1.0% from December 31, 2022. The decrease in acquired nonperforming loans was mainly driven by a decrease in consumer nonaccrual loans of $3.3 million, a decrease in restructured loans of $2.9 million and a decrease in accruing loans past due 90 days or more of $818,000, offset by an increase in commercial nonaccrual loans of $6.4 million . 

&#8203; 

The top ten nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2023 totaled $61.3 million and consisted of four loans located in South Carolina, two in North Carolina, three in Georgia, and one in Florida. These loans comprise 36.0% of total nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2023, with around 50% being real estate collateral dependent and the other 50% being non real estate. We currently hold a specific reserve against one of these ten loans, totaling $6.9 million. The remaining nine loans do not carry a specific reserve due to carrying balances being below current collateral values. 

The decline in restructured nonaccrual loans over both the nonacquired and acquired loan portfolios was due to the adoption of ASU 2022-02 effective January 1, 2023, which extinguishes the former troubled debt restructuring (TDR) guidance and issues new requirements for determining modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank had a total of $12.1 million loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Of the $12.1 million, $9.9 million loans were current and $2.2 million loans were 30 to 89 days past due. 

Allowance for Credit Losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;) on Loans and Certain Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposure 

As stated previously, the ACL reflects management&#8217;s estimate of the portion of the amortized cost of loans and unfunded commitments that it does not expect to collect. The Company records loans charged off against the ACL and subsequent recoveries, if any, increase the ACL when they are recognized. 

Management considers forward-looking information in estimating expected credit losses. The Company subscribes to a third-party service which provides a quarterly macroeconomic baseline outlook and alternative scenarios for the United States economy. The baseline, along with the evaluation of alternative scenarios, is used by management to determine the best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. Management evaluates the appropriateness of the reasonable and supportable forecast scenarios and takes into consideration the scenarios in relation to actual economic and other data, such as gross domestic product growth, monetary and fiscal policy, inflation, supply chain issues and global events like the Russian/Ukraine conflict, as well as the volatility and magnitude of changes within those scenarios quarter over quarter, and consideration of conditions within the Bank&#8217;s operating environment and geographic area. Additional forecast scenarios may be weighted along with the baseline forecast to arrive at the final reserve estimate. While periods of relative economic stability should generally lead to stability in forecast scenarios and weightings to estimate credit losses, periods of instability can likewise require management to adjust the selection of scenarios and weightings, in accordance with the accounting standards. For the contractual term that extends beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts to the long term mean of historical factors within four quarters using a straight-line approach. The Company generally uses a four-quarter forecast and a four-quarter reversion period. 

In spite of the rapid interest rate hikes experienced cycle-to-date, the U.S. has thus far avoided a recession, although an inverted yield curve such as observed in the current interest rate environment often portends a coming recession. Management continues to use a blended forecast scenario of the baseline, upside, and more severe scenario, depending on the circumstances and economic outlook As of December 31, 2023, management selected a baseline weighting of 60%, a 20% weighting for an upside scenario and a 20% weighting for the more severe scenario compared to a baseline weighting of 75% and the more severe scenario of 25% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. While the December Federal Open Market Committee Meeting brought some clarity around the path of interest rates and condition of the economy, the scenario weightings reflect continued recognition of downside risks in the economic forecast from persistent levels of inflation, rising interest rates, and tightening credit conditions conducive of a mild recession. While employment figures still showed resilience and actual loan losses remain at low levels, continued downward shifts in the forecasted commercial real estate price index elevated modeled expected losses for the Commercial Real Estate and Commercial Construction and Land Development, which excludes Residential Construction, loan segments. As a result of the continued pressures in the market and tightening credit conditions, the Company recorded provision for credit losses of $114.1 million and net charge-offs of $24.9 million during 2023. 

As disclosed previously, the longstanding TDR accounting rules were replaced with ASU No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures . The Company adopted the retirement of TDR guidance, effective January 1, 2023. Please see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in this Form 10-K for further detailed descriptions of how we determine expected losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. 

&#8203; 

Atlantic Capital was acquired and merged with and into the Bank on March 1, 2022, requiring that a closing date ACL be prepared for Atlantic Capital on a standalone basis and that the acquired portfolio be included in the Bank&#8217;s first quarter ACL. Atlantic Capital&#8217;s loans represented approximately 8% of the total Bank&#8217;s portfolio at March 31, 2022. Given the relative size and complexity of the acquired portfolio, similarities of the loan characteristics, and similar loss history to the existing portfolio, reserve calculations were performed using the Bank's existing CECL model, loan segmentation, and forecast weighting as the first quarter end reserve. As a result of the merger with Atlantic Capital on March 1, 2022, the Company identified approximately $137.9 million of loans as PCD. The acquisition date ACL totaled $27.5 million, consisting of a non-PCD pooled reserve of $13.7 million, PCD pooled reserve of $5.7 million, and PCD individually evaluated reserve of $8.1 million. It represented about 8% of the combined Bank&#8217;s ACL reserve at March 31, 2022. The acquisition date reserve for unfunded commitments totaled $3.4 million, or 11% of the combined Bank&#8217;s total at March 31, 2022. 

The Company has a variety of assets that have a component that qualifies as an off-balance sheet exposure. These primarily include undrawn portions of revolving lines of credit and standby letters of credit. The expected losses associated with these exposures within the unfunded portion of the expected credit loss will be recorded as a liability on the balance sheet. Management has determined that a majority of the Company&#8217;s off-balance-sheet credit exposures are not unconditionally cancellable. Management completes funding studies based on historical data to estimate the percentage of unfunded loan commitments that will ultimately be funded to calculate the reserve for unfunded commitments. Management applies this funding rate, along with the loss factor rate determined for each pooled loan segment, to unfunded loan commitments, excluding unconditionally cancellable exposures and letters of credit, to arrive at the reserve for unfunded loan commitments. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the liabilities recorded for expected credit losses on unfunded commitments were $56.3 million and $67.2 million, respectively. The current adjustment to the ACL for unfunded commitments is recognized through the Provision (Recovery) for Credit Losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

&#8203; 

As of December 31, 2023, the balance of the ACL was $456.6 million, or 1.41%, of total loans. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the ACL increased $100.1 million from the balance of $356.4 million at December 31, 2022. The increase in ACL of $100.1 million included $125.0 million of provision for credit losses, and $24.9 million in net charge-offs. For both the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded provision for credit losses due to loan growth and current forecasts applied to our modeling to adequately capture growing economic recessionary risks . As of December 31, 2022, the balance of the ACL was $356.4 million or 1.18% of total loans. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the ACL increased $54.6 million from the balance of $301.8 million at December 31, 2021. The increase in ACL of $54.6 million was due a provision for credit losses of $45.2 million, $13.7 million due to the initial allowance for PCD loans acquired in the Atlantic Capital acquisition, along with net charge-offs of $4.3 million in 2022. For both the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded provision for credit losses due to loan growth and current forecasts applied to our modeling to adequately capture growing economic recessionary risks. 

&#8203; 

At December 31, 2023, the Company had a reserve on unfunded commitments of $56.3 million, which was recorded as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, compared to $67.2 million at December 31, 2022. During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a release in the reserve for unfunded commitments of $6.0 million and $10.9 million, respectively. For the prior comparative period, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments of $14.2 million and $36.7 million, respectively. The provision of $36.7 million recorded in 2022 includes the initial provision for credit losses for unfunded commitments acquired from Atlantic Capital, which the Company recorded during the first quarter of 2022. The provision for credit losses for unfunded commitments is based on the growth in unfunded loan commitments, production mix, and current forecast scenarios applied to our modeling to adequately capture growing economic recessionary risks. This amount was recorded in Provision (Recovery) for Credit Losses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company did not have an allowance for credit losses or record a provision for credit losses on investment securities or other financials asset during 2023. 

&#8203; 

The ACL provides 2.50 times coverage of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2023. Net charge offs to total average loans during the year ended December 31, 2023 were 0.08%, compared to 0.02% during the year ended December 31, 2022. ACL, including reserve for unfunded commitments, as a percentage of loans were 1.58% and 1.40%, respectively, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. 

&#8203; 

The following table provides the allocation, by segment, for expected credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2023. While non-owner occupied CRE is the largest segment of our loan portfolio, the risk profile of the non-owner occupied CRE portfolio remains low and stable. We have a granular loan portfolio where the average loan size of the non-owner occupied CRE portfolio is less than $5 million. The weighted average loan to value for the non-owner occupied CRE portfolio was less than 60% as of December 31, 2023. Loans for the commercial office space, which are included in the non-owner occupied CRE portfolio, represent approximately 4% of the total outstanding portfolio with an average loan size of less than $2 million as of December 31, 2023. Over 95% of these office spaces are located in the Company&#8217;s southeast footprint, of which approximately 91% mature in 2025 or later.

Deposits 

We rely on deposits by our customers as the primary source of funds for the continued growth of our loan and investment securities portfolios. Customer deposits are categorized as either noninterest-bearing deposits or interest- bearing deposits. Noninterest-bearing deposits (or demand deposits) are transaction accounts that provide us with &#8220;interest- free&#8221; sources of funds. Interest-bearing deposits include savings deposit, interest-bearing transaction accounts, certificates of deposits, and other time deposits. Interest-bearing transaction accounts include NOW, HSA, IOLTA, and Market Rate checking accounts. The Company uses brokered time deposits as a secondary source of deposits to supplement its primary source through organic growth of deposits from our customers. 

During 2023, overall deposits increased $698.3 million, or 1.9%, to $37.0 billion from 2022. The increase was driven by growth in money market accounts of $3.2 billion, including $1.2 billion in reciprocal insured money market deposits and time deposits of $1.8 billion, including an increase in brokered deposits of $569.6 million. These increases were partially offset by declines in noninterest-bearing checking deposits of $2.5 billion, interest-bearing checking deposits of $976.7 million and savings deposits of $832.1 million. As customers moved funds from noninterest-bearing checking, interest-bearing checking and savings accounts, seeking higher yields in the rising rate environment, the Company increased its balance in higher yielding money market accounts including reciprocal insured money market deposits along with in-market time deposits and brokered deposits in 2023. The Company raised interest rates on most interest-bearing deposit products (in particular money market accounts and time deposit specials) during 2023 due to competitive pressures to retain deposits. The Company also increased its use of brokered time deposits in the first quarter of 2023 with the financial turmoil caused by the few regional banks failing to provide the Company with excess liquidity. The balance at the end of the first quarter was $1.4 billion. As the financial markets settled, the Company has allowed the brokered time deposits to run off to an ending balance of $719.7 million at December 31, 2023. The declines in noninterest-bearing, interest-bearing and savings accounts were also due to customers having less excess cash as funds from government support programs related to the COVID-19 pandemic declined.

Short-Term Borrowed Funds 

Our short- term borrowed funds consist of federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements, FRB borrowings on a secured line of credit, short-term FHLB Advances and the U.S. Bank line of credit. Note 10 &#8212; Federal Funds Purchased and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase in our audited financial statements provides a profile of these funds at each year-end, the average amounts outstanding during each period, the maximum amounts outstanding at any month-end, and the weighted average interest rates on year- end and average balances in each category. Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase most typically have maturities within one to three days from the transaction date. Certain of these borrowings have no defined maturity date. Note 11 &#8212; Other Borrowings in our audited financial statements provide provides a profile of short-term FHLB advances, FRB borrowings and the U.S. Bank line of credit at each year-end, the average amount outstanding during each period and the weighted average interest rates on year- end and average balances. Short-term FHLB advances has a maturity of less than one year and the FRB borrowings and U.S. Bank line of credit has a daily maturity. 

Long-Term Borrowed Funds 

Our long- term borrowed funds consist of trust preferred junior subordinated debt and corporate subordinated debt. Note 11 &#8212; Other Borrowings in our audited financial statements provides a profile of these funds at each year- end, the balance at year end, the interest rate at year end and the weighted average interest rate for long-term borrowings. Each issuance of trust preferred junior subordinated debt has a maturity of 30 years, but we can call the debt at any time without penalty. 

Capital and Dividends 

Our ongoing capital requirements have been met primarily through retained earnings, less the payment of cash dividends. As of December 31, 2023, shareholders&#8217; equity was $5.5 billion, an increase of $458.2 million, or 9.0%, compared to the balance at December 31, 2022. The change from year-end 2022 was mainly attributable to net income of $494.3 million, an increase in the market value of securities available for sale, net of tax, of $93.3 million recorded through AOCI and the recognition of equity based compensation of $35.9 million. These increases were mainly offset by dividends paid on common shares of $154.9 million and common stock repurchased under our stock repurchase plan and equity plans of $16.1 million .

##TABLE_END Our equity-to-assets ratio increased to 12.3% at December 31, 2023 from 11.6% at December 31, 2022. The increase from December 31, 2022 was due to the percentage increase in equity of 9.0% being higher than the percentage increase in total assets of 2.2%. The higher percentage growth in capital was mainly due to the Company&#8217;s net income of $494.3 million. The increase in assets in 2023 was mainly due to organic loan growth funded through deposit growth. 

&#8203; 

On April 27, 2022, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors approved 2022 Stock Repurchase Program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to 3,750,000 of the Company&#8217;s common shares along with the remaining authorized shares of 370,021 from the Company&#8217;s 2021 Stock Repurchase Plan. Our Board of Directors approved the program after considering, among other things, our liquidity needs and capital resources as well as the estimated current value of our net assets. The aggregate number of shares of common stocks authorized to be repurchased totals 4.12 million shares. The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of the purchases are based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of cash balances, general business conditions, regulatory requirements, the market price of our common stock, and the availability of alternative investment opportunities. During 2023, the Company repurchased a total of 100,000 shares at a weighted average price of $67.48 per share pursuant to the 2022 Stock Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2023, there is a total of 4,020,021 shares authorized to be repurchased.

We are subject to regulations with respect to certain risk-based capital ratios. These risk-based capital ratios measure the relationship of capital to a combination of balance sheet and off-balance sheet risks. The values of both balance sheet and off-balance sheet items are adjusted based on the rules to reflect categorical credit risk. In addition to the risk-based capital ratios, the regulatory agencies have also established a leverage ratio for assessing capital adequacy. The leverage ratio is equal to Tier 1 capital divided by total consolidated on-balance sheet assets (minus amounts deducted from Tier 1 capital). The leverage ratio does not involve assigning risk weights to assets. 

&#8203; 

Specifically, we are required to maintain the following minimum capital ratios:

&#8203; 

##TABLE_START &#9679; a CET1, risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; a total risk-based capital ratio of 8%; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; a leverage ratio of 4%. ##TABLE_END 

Under the current capital rules, Tier 1 capital includes two components: CET1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. The highest form of capital, CET1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, otherwise referred to as AOCI, and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock. Additional Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and Tier 1 minority interests. Tier 2 capital generally includes the allowance for loan losses up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, qualifying preferred stock, subordinated debt, trust preferred securities and qualifying tier 2 minority interests, less any deductions in Tier 2 instruments of an unconsolidated financial institution. AOCI is presumptively included in CET1 capital and often would operate to reduce this category of capital. When the current capital rules were first implemented, the Bank exercised its one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of AOCI, allowing us to retain our pre-existing treatment for AOCI. 

In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a banking organization must maintain a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity, but the buffer applies to all three risk-based measurements (CET1, Tier 1 capital and total capital), resulting in the following effective minimum capital plus capital conservation buffer ratios: (i) a CET1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%. 

The Bank is also subject to the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, which identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized) and is based on specified thresholds for each of the three risk-based regulatory capital ratios (CET1, Tier 1 capital and total capital) and for the leverage ratio.

&#8203; 

The federal banking agencies revised their regulatory capital rules to (i) address the implementation of CECL&#894; (ii) provide an optional three-year phase-in period for the adoption date adverse regulatory capital effects that banking organizations are expected to experience upon adopting CECL&#894; and (iii) require the use of CECL in stress tests beginning with the 2020 capital planning and stress testing cycle for certain banking organizations that are subject to stress testing. CECL became effective for us on January 1, 2020 and the Company applied the provisions of the standard using the modified retrospective method as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. Related to the implementation of ASU 2016-13, we recorded additional allowance for credit losses for loans of $54.4 million, deferred tax assets of $12.6 million, an additional reserve for unfunded commitments of $6.4 million and an adjustment to retained earnings of $44.8 million. Instead of recognizing the effects on regulatory capital from ASU 2016-13 at adoption, the Company initially elected the option for recognizing the adoption date effects on the Company&#8217;s regulatory capital calculations over a three-year phase-in .

&#8203; 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule for additional transitional relief to regulatory capital related to the impact of the adoption of CECL. The Company chose the five-year transition method and is deferring the recognition of the effects from the adoption date and the CECL difference for the first two years of application. The modified CECL transitional amount was fixed as of December 31, 2021, and that amount began the three-year phase out in the first quarter of 2022 with 50% phased out in 2023. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, approximately $30.5 million and $45.8 million, respectively, was added to Tier 1 capital at the Company and Bank as a result of the modified CECL transition. Had the Company elected not to apply the modified CECL transitional amount to its Tier 1 capital, the Company and Bank would have still been considered well capitalized as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.

##TABLE_END The Company&#8217;s and Bank&#8217;s Common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios all improved compared to December 31, 2022. All of these ratios mainly improved due to net income recognized during 2023 of $494.3 million. Tier 1 capital increased 8.6% and 9.8% at the Bank and Company, respectively, with the increase in equity resulting from the net income recognized during the current period. Total risk-based capital increased 10.9% and 11.1% at both the Bank and Company, respectively, with the increase in equity resulting from the net income recognized during the current period, along with the increase in the allowance for credit losses and unfunded commitments includable in Tier 2 capital. Both regulatory risk-based assets and quarterly average assets remained reasonably flat in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 with average assets for the both Company and Bank increasing 1.6% and risk-based assets increasing 2.3%. Our capital ratios are currently well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; regulatory classification. Should the Company need to sell its available for sale and held to maturity securities for liquidity purposes and recognize the unrealized losses as of December 31, 2023 through earnings, all else equal, our capital ratios would remain well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; regulatory classification. 

The Company pays cash dividends to shareholders from its assets, which are mainly provided by dividends from its banking subsidiary. However, certain restrictions exist regarding the ability of its banking subsidiary to transfer funds to the Company in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances. The approval of the OCC is required if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus. The federal banking agencies have issued policy statements which provide that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of current earnings. 

&#8203; 

During 2023, the Bank paid dividends to SouthState totaling $180.0 million. The Bank was not required to obtain approval of the OCC to pay these dividends. We used these funds and excess cash to pay our dividend to shareholders of $154.9 million and repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market totaling $6.7 million. 

The following table provides the amount of dividends and payout ratios for the years ended December 31:

##TABLE_END We retain earnings to have capital sufficient to grow our loan and investment portfolios and to support certain acquisitions or other business expansion opportunities. The dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing dividends paid during the year by net income for the year.

Liquidity 

Liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our financial obligations, which arise primarily from the withdrawal of deposits, extension of credit and payment of operating expenses. Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank&#8217;s financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by an inability (or perceived inability) to meet its obligations. Our Asset Liability Management Committee (&#8220;ALCO&#8221;) is charged with the responsibility of monitoring policies designed to ensure acceptable composition of our asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management. We have employed our funds in a manner to provide liquidity from both assets and liabilities sufficient to meet our cash needs. 

&#8203; 

The ALCO has established key risk indicators to monitor liquidity and interest rate risk. The key risk indicators are reviewed and approved by the ALCO on an annual basis. The liquidity key risk indicators include the loan to deposit ratio, net noncore funding dependence ratio, On-hand liquidity to total liabilities ratio, the percentage of securities pledged to total securities, and the ratio of brokered deposits to total deposits. As of December 31, 2023, the Company was operating within its liquidity policy limits. 

&#8203; 

Asset liquidity is maintained by the maturity structure of loans, investment securities and other short-term investments. Management has policies and procedures governing the length of time to maturity on loans and investments. Normally, changes in the earning asset mix are of a longer-term nature and are not used for day-to-day corporate liquidity needs. 

&#8203; 

Our liabilities provide liquidity on a day-to-day basis. Daily liquidity needs are met from deposit levels or from our use of federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, interest-bearing deposits at other banks and other short-term borrowings. We engage in routine activities to retain deposits intended to enhance our liquidity position. These routine activities include various measures, such as the following: 

##TABLE_START &#9679; Emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers, where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with our Bank; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Pricing deposits, including certificates of deposit, at rate levels that will attract and /or retain balances of deposits that will enhance our Bank&#8217;s asset/liability management and net interest margin requirements; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or enhance our Bank&#8217;s appeal as a primary provider of financial services. ##TABLE_END Our non-acquired loan portfolio increased by approximately $3.7 billion, or approximately 16.1%, compared to the balance at December 31, 2022. The increase in the non-acquired loan portfolio was due to organic growth and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. The acquired loan portfolio decreased by $1.5 billion, or 19.9%, from the balance at December 31, 2022 through principal paydowns, charge-offs, foreclosures and renewals of acquired loans. For more detail around the changes in the loan portfolio see the Loan Portfolio section in MDA starting on page 81. 

&#8203; 

Our investment securities portfolio (excluding trading securities) decreased $725.9 million, or approximately 8.9%, compared to the balance at December 31, 2022. The decrease in investment securities from December 31, 2022 was a result of maturities, calls, sales and paydowns of investment securities totaling $1.1 billion and a reduction from the net amortization of premiums of $20.1 million. These decreases were partially offset by purchases of available for sale investment securities totaling $80.4 million and other investment securities of $226.7 million and an increase in the market value of the available for sale investment securities portfolio of $112.7 million . There were no purchases or sales of held to maturity securities during the year . For the purchases of other investment securities, $222.1 million of the purchases were related to capital stock with the Federal Home Loan Bank of which we sold back $214.4 million during 2023. The activity in the purchases and sales of the Federal Home Loan Bank Capital Stock was due to activity with FHLB borrowings during the year. The Bank pledges a portion of its investment portfolio for a variety of purposes, including, but not limited to, collateral for public funds and credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. As of December 31, 2023, the bank pledged 49.6% of the market value of its investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank had unpledged securities with a market value of $3.5 billion. These securities included Treasury, Agency, Agency MBS, Municipals and Corporate securities. Total cash and cash equivalents declined $313.7 million in 2023 to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2023, compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2022. Liquidity has tightened in 2023 with the rising rate environment and turmoil in the financial markets. Competition for in-market deposits has increased throughout 2023 resulting in increases in deposit rates to retain local deposits. While the Company has increased its use of brokered time deposits since December 31, 2022, the ratio of brokered time deposits to total deposits at December 31, 2023 was only 1.9% compared to the Company&#8217;s internal limit of 15%. During 2023, the Company has also borrowed funds from the FHLB on a short-term basis. The outstanding borrowings from the FHLB were $100.0 million at December 31, 2023. See below for further discussion around brokered deposits and FHLB borrowings. 

&#8203; 

At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had $719.7 million and $150.0 million of traditional, out&#8211;of-market brokered time deposits, respectively. At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had $2.2 billion and $637.0 million, respectively, of reciprocal deposits. Total deposits were $37.0 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $698.3 million from $36.4 billion at December 31, 2022. Our deposit growth since December 31, 2022 included an increase in money market accounts of $3.2 billion and an increase in certificates of deposit of $1.8 billion. These increases were offset by declines in demand deposit , interest-bearing checking and savings accounts of $2.5 billion, $976.7 million and $832.1 million, respectively. As customers moved funds from noninterest bearing checking, interest bearing checking and savings accounts, seeking higher yields in the rising rate environment along with insurance coverage, the Company&#8217;s balance in higher costing in-market time deposits, brokered time deposits and in money market deposit accounts including reciprocal insured money market accounts, increased. The Company raised interest rates on most interest-bearing deposit products (in particular time deposit specials and money market accounts) during 2023 due to competitive pressures to retain deposits. Total short-term borrowings at December 31, 2023 were $589.2 million consisting of $248.2 million in federal funds purchased, $241.0 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase and $100.0 million in short-term FHLB advances. Total long-term borrowings at December 31, 2023 were $391.9 million and consisted of trust preferred securities and subordinated debentures. To the extent that we employ other types of non-deposit funding sources, typically to accommodate retail and correspondent customers, we continue to take in shorter maturities of such funds. Our current approach may provide an opportunity to sustain a low funding rate or possibly lower our cost of funds but could also increase our cost of funds if interest rates rise. 

&#8203; 

The Bank has a granular deposit base comprised of over 1.4 million accounts, with an average deposit size of $27,000. The top ten and twenty deposit relationships comprise approximately three and four percent of total deposits. Approximately 29% of total deposits are non-interest bearing. The Bank&#8217;s deposit beta, which represents the change in the Bank&#8217;s cost of deposits over the change in the federal funds target rate, during this cycle (from March 2022 through December 2023) is approximately 30%. 

&#8203; 

The Bank supplements its in-market deposits with brokered deposits. While the Bank has a policy limit for brokered time deposits of no more than 15% of total deposits, it has operated well below this policy limit. At December 31, 2023, the percentage of brokered time deposits to total deposits was 1.9%. During calendar years 2022 and 2023, the highest ratio of brokered time deposits to total deposits was 3.8% on March 31, 2023. During the first quarter of 2023, the Company sought to increase liquidity with the turmoil in the financial markets after the few regional banks failed and increased the balance in brokered time deposits to $1.4 billion. As the financial markets stabilized during 2023, the Company has let the brokered time deposits run-off to an ending balance of $719.7 million at December 31, 2023. 

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

As discussed below, the Bank maintains credit facilities with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. The table below compares Primary Funding Sources to uninsured deposits as of December 31, 2023.

##TABLE_END Through the operations of our Bank, we have made contractual commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of our business activities. These commitments are legally binding agreements to lend money to our customers at predetermined interest rates for a specified period of time. We manage the credit risk on these commitments by subjecting them to normal underwriting and risk management processes. We believe that we have adequate sources of liquidity to fund commitments that are drawn upon by the borrowers. In addition to commitments to extend credit, we also issue standby letters of credit, which are assurances to third parties that they will not suffer a loss if our customer fails to meet its contractual obligation to the third-party. Although our experience indicates that many of these standby letters of credit will expire unused, through our various sources of liquidity, we believe that we will have the resources to meet these obligations should the need arise. 

Our ongoing philosophy is to remain in a liquid position, as reflected by such indicators as the composition of our earning assets, typically including some level of reverse repurchase agreements; federal funds sold; balances at the Federal Reserve Bank; and/or other short-term investments; asset quality; well-capitalized position; and profitable operating results. Cyclical and other economic trends and conditions can disrupt our desired liquidity position at any time. We expect that these conditions would generally be of a short-term nature. Under such circumstances, we expect our reverse repurchase agreements and federal funds sold positions, or balances at the Federal Reserve Bank, if any, to serve as the primary source of immediate liquidity. We could draw on additional alternative immediate funding sources from lines of credit extended to us from our correspondent banks. The Bank may also access funds from borrowing facilities established with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and the discount window of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. At December 31, 2023, the Bank had a total FHLB credit facility of $7.1 billion, with $100.0 million in short-term FHLB advances and $2.9 million FHLB letters of credit outstanding at year-end, leaving $7.0 billion in availability on the FHLB credit facility . At December 31, 2023, the Bank had $1.9 billion of credit available at the Federal Reserve Bank&#8217;s discount window and federal funds credit lines of $300.0 million with no balances outstanding at quarter-end. The Bank also has an internal limit on brokered deposits of 15% of total deposits, which would allow capacity of $5.6 billion at December 31, 2023. The Bank had $719.7 million of outstanding brokered deposits at the end of the year leaving $4.8 billion in available capacity as per the internal policy limit of 15% of total deposits. All of these resources would provide an additional $14.0 billion in funding if we needed additional liquidity. The Bank also has $3.5 billion in market value of unpledged securities at December 31, 2023 that can be pledged to attain additional funds if necessary. We can also consider actions such as deposit promotions to increase core deposits. The Company has a $100.0 million unsecured line of credit with U.S. Bank National Association with no balance outstanding at December 31, 2023. We believe that our liquidity position continues to be adequate and readily available.

&#8203; 

Our contingency funding plan describes several potential stages based on stressed liquidity levels. Liquidity key risk indicators are reported to the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. We maintain various wholesale sources of funding. If our deposit retention efforts were to be unsuccessful, we would use these alternative sources of funding. Under such circumstances, depending on the external source of funds, our interest cost would vary based on the range of interest rates charged. This could increase our cost of funds, impacting our net interest margin and net interest spread. 

&#8203; 

Asset-Liability Management and Market Risk Sensitivity 

Our earnings and the economic value of equity vary in relation to the behavior of interest rates and the accompanying fluctuations in market prices of certain of our financial instruments. We define interest rate risk as the risk to earnings and equity arising from the behavior of interest rates. These behaviors include increases and decreases in interest rates as well as continuation of the current interest rate environment. 

Our interest rate risk principally consists of reprice, option, basis, and yield curve risk. Reprice risk results from differences in the maturity or repricing characteristics of asset and liability portfolios. Option risk arises from embedded options in the investment and loan portfolios such as investment securities calls and loan prepayment options. Option risk also exists since deposit customers may withdraw funds at their discretion in response to general market conditions, competitive alternatives to existing accounts or other factors. The exercise of such options may result in higher costs or lower revenue. Basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates or indices, which subsequently result in narrowing spreads on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Basis risk also exists in administered rate liabilities, such as interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market accounts where the price sensitivity of such products may vary relative to general markets rates. Yield curve risk refers to adverse consequences of nonparallel shifts in the yield curves of various market indices that impact our assets and liabilities. 

We use simulation analysis as a primary method to assess earnings at risk and equity at risk due to assumed changes in interest rates. Management uses the results of its various simulation analyses in combination with other data and observations to formulate strategies designed to maintain interest rate risk within risk tolerances. 

Simulation analysis involves the use of several assumptions including, but not limited to, the timing of cash flows such as the terms of contractual agreements, investment security calls, loan prepayment speeds, deposit attrition rates, the interest rate sensitivity of loans and deposits relative to general market rates, and the behavior of interest rates and spreads. The assumptions for loan prepayments, deposit decay, and nonstable deposit balances are derived from models that use historical bank data. These models are independently validated. Equity at risk simulation uses assumptions regarding discount rates that value cash flows. Simulation analysis is highly dependent on model assumptions that may vary from actual outcomes. Key simulation assumptions are subject to sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of assumption changes on earnings at risk and equity at risk. Model assumptions are reviewed by our Assumptions Committee. While the Bank is continuously refining its modeling methodology, the core principles of the methodology have remained stable over the past two years. 

Earnings at risk is defined as the percentage change in net interest income due to assumed changes in interest rates. Earnings at risk is generally used to assess interest rate risk over relatively short time horizons. 

Equity at risk is defined as the percentage change in the net economic value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates compared to a base net economic value. The discounted present value of all cash flows represents our economic value of equity. Equity at risk is generally considered a measure of the long-term interest rate exposures of the balance sheet at a point in time. 

The earnings simulation models consider our contractual agreements with regard to investments, loans, deposits, borrowings, and derivatives as well as a number of behavioral assumptions applied to certain assets and liabilities. 

Mortgage banking derivatives used in the ordinary course of business consist of forward sales contracts and interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans. These derivatives involve underlying items, such as interest rates, and are designed to mitigate risk. Derivatives are also used to hedge mortgage servicing rights. For additional information see Note 28&#8212;Derivative Financial Instruments in the consolidated financial statements. 

&#8203; 

From time to time, we execute interest rate swaps to hedge some of our interest rate risks. Under these arrangements, the Company enters into a variable rate loan with a client in addition to a swap agreement. The swap agreement effectively converts the client&#8217;s variable rate loan into a fixed rate loan. The Company then enters into a matching swap agreement with a third-party dealer to offset its exposure on the customer swap. The Company may also execute interest rate swap agreements that are not specific to client loans. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had a series of short-term interest rate hedges to address monthly accrual mismatches related to the Company&#8217;s ARC program and its transition from LIBOR to SOFR after June 30, 2023. For additional information on these derivatives refer to Note 28&#8212;Derivative Financial Instruments in the consolidated financial statements. 

Our interest rate risk key indicators are applied to a static balance sheet using forward rates from the Moody&#8217;s Baseline Scenario. The Company will also use other rate forecasts, including, but not limited to, Moody&#8217;s Consensus Scenario. This Base Case Scenario assumes the maturity composition of asset and liability rollover volumes is modeled to approximately replicate current consolidated balance sheet characteristics throughout the simulation. These treatments are consistent with the Company&#8217;s goal of assessing current interest rate risk embedded in its current balance sheet. The Base Case Scenario assumes that maturing or repricing assets and liabilities are replaced at prices referencing forward rates derived from the selected rate forecast consistent with current balance sheet pricing characteristics. Key rate drivers are used to price assets and liabilities with sensitivity assumptions used to price non-maturity deposits. The sensitivity assumptions for the pricing of non-maturity deposits are subjected to sensitivity analysis no less frequently than on an annual basis. 

&#8203; 

Interest rate shocks are applied to the Base Case on an instantaneous basis. Our policy establishes the use of upward and downward interest rate shocks applied in 100 basis point increments through 400 basis points. We calculate smaller rate shocks as needed. At times, market conditions may result in assumed rate movements that will be deemphasized. For example, during a period of ultra-low interest rates, certain downward rate shocks may be impractical. The model simulation results produced from the Base Case Scenario and related instantaneous shocks for changes in net interest income and changes in the economic value of equity are referred to as the Core Scenario Analysis and constitute the policy key risk indicators for interest rate risk when compared to risk tolerances. As of December 31, 2023, the Company was operating within it interest rate key risk indicator policy limits. 

&#8203; 

During 2023, the beta assumption applied to total deposits increased to reflect changes in deposit mix. From the beginning of the upward rate cycle, our deposit costs have increased from five basis points to one hundred sixty basis points. During this period, the federal funds rate has increased 525 basis points. Accordingly, our cycle to date beta has been approximately 30%. Management recognizes the difficulty using historical data to forecast deposit betas in the current environment. For internal purposes, and based on the deposit mix as of December 31, 2023, the total deposit beta assumption was 35.0%. For internal forecasting, Management will apply overlays to certain assumptions to adjust for current market conditions rather than use assumptions modeled over longer periods of time. 

&#8203; 

The following interest rate risk metrics are derived from analysis using the Moody&#8217;s Consensus Scenario published in January 2024 as the Base Case. As of December 31, 2023, the earnings simulations indicated that the year 1 impact of an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase / decrease in rates would result in an estimated 1.0% increase (up 100) and 1.7% decrease (down 100) in net interest income. 

&#8203; 

We use Economic Value of Equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;) analysis as an indicator of the extent to which the present value of our capital could change, given potential changes in interest rates. This measure also assumes a static balance sheet (Base Case Scenario) with rate shocks applied as described above. At December 31, 2023, the percentage change in EVE due to a 100-basis point increase or decrease in interest rates was 2.6% decrease and 1.0% increase, respectively. The percentage changes in EVE due to a 200-basis point increase or decrease in interest rates were 6.3% decrease and 0.1% increase, respectively. The interest rate shock analysis results for EVE sensitivities are unusual as the benefits of repricing assets are mitigated by increasing deposit costs, and downward shocks are constrained on various balance sheet categories due to the inability to price products below floors or zero. This is particularly meaningful given the cost of deposits as of December 31, 2023. 

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

The analysis below reflects a Base Case and shocked scenarios that assume a static balance sheet projection where volume is added to maintain balances consistent with current levels. Base Case assumes new and repricing volumes reference forward rates derived from the Moody&#8217;s Consensus rate forecast. Instantaneous, parallel, and sustained interest rate shocks are applied to the Base Case scenario over a one-year time horizon.

##TABLE_END LIBOR Transition 

The publication of all tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR on a representative basis ceased as of December 31, 2023. As previously noted, we established a cross-functional LIBOR transition working group that (1) assessed the Company's exposure to LIBOR indexed instruments and the data, systems and processes that were impacted; (2) established a detailed implementation plan; and (3) developed a formal governance structure for the transition. The Company developed and implemented various proactive steps to facilitate the transition on behalf of customers up through December 31, 2023, which included: 

##TABLE_START &#9679; The adoption and implementation of fallback provisions that provided for the determination of replacement rates for LIBOR-linked financial products. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; The adoption of new products linked to alternative reference rates, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, consistent with guidance provided by the U.S. regulators, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, and GSEs. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; The selection of SOFR indices as the replacement indices, and successful completion of systems testing using the SOFR replacement indices. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Successful transition of Libor-exposed instruments to SOFR and other indices as appropriate for contracts that provided for a specific replacement index other than SOFR. ##TABLE_END 

We utilized the provisions of the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act passed by Congress and signed into law by the President in March 2022 for certain contracts referencing LIBOR. The Act provides for the use of SOFR as the replacement index with a spread adjustment when the remaining LIBOR indices are discontinued. The Act applies when there is no contract provision addressing the loss of LIBOR and may be used otherwise as well, provided the contract does not provide for a specific replacement index. 

&#8203; 

In addition, the Company developed and implemented processes to educate client-facing associates and coordinate communications with customers regarding the transition.

&#8203; 

As of December 31, 2023, the Company&#8217;s LIBOR-indexed loans, derivatives, and trust preferred securities have migrated to SOFR and other indices . 

Asset Credit Risk and Concentrations 

The quality of our interest- earning assets is maintained through our management of certain concentrations of credit risk. We review each individual earning asset including investment securities and loans for credit risk. To facilitate this review, we have established credit and investment policies that include credit limits, documentation, periodic examination, and follow- up. In addition, we examine these portfolios for exposure to concentration in any one industry, government agency, or geographic location. 

&#8203; 

Deposit Concentrations 

At December 31, 2023 and 2022, we have no material concentration of deposits from any single customer or group of customers. We have no significant portion of our deposits concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries. We do not believe there are any material seasonal factors that would have a material adverse effect on us. The total deposit balances held by top 10 and 20 deposit holders were below 5% of the Company&#8217;s average total deposit balances at December 31, 2023 and 2022. We do not have any foreign deposits. 

Concentration of Credit Risk 

Each category of earning assets has a certain degree of credit risk. We use various techniques to measure credit risk. Credit risk in the investment portfolio can be measured through bond ratings published by independent agencies. In the investment securities portfolio, the investments consist of U.S. government-sponsored entity securities, tax-free securities, or other securities having ratings of &#8220;AAA&#8221; to &#8220;Not Rated&#8221;. All securities, with the exception of those that are not rated, were rated by at least one of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. The credit risk of the loan portfolio can be measured by historical experience. We maintain our loan portfolio in accordance with credit policies that we have established. Although the Bank has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial portion of our borrowers&#8217; abilities to honor their contracts is dependent upon economic conditions within our geographic footprint and the surrounding regions. 

We consider concentrations of credit to exist when, pursuant to regulatory guidelines, the amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by general economic conditions represents 25% of total Tier 1 capital plus regulatory adjusted allowance for credit losses of the Company, or $1.2 billion at December 31, 2023. Based on this criteria, we had eight such credit concentrations at December 31, 2023, including loans to lessors of nonresidential buildings (except mini-warehouses) of $6.2 billion, loans secured by owner occupied office buildings (including medical office buildings) of $1.9 billion, loans secured by owner occupied nonresidential buildings (excluding office buildings) of $1.8 billion, loans to lessors of residential buildings (investment properties and multi-family) of $2.4 billion, loans secured by 1st mortgage 1-4 family owner occupied residential property (including condos and home equity lines) of $8.8 billion, loans secured by jumbo (original loans greater than $726,200) 1 st mortgage 1-4 family owner occupied residential property of $2.6 billion, loans secured by business assets including accounts receivable, inventory and equipment of $2.2 billion, and loans to consumers secured by non-real estate of $1.2 billion. The risk for these loans and for all loans is managed collectively through the use of credit underwriting practices developed and updated over time. The loss estimate for these loans is determined using our standard ACL methodology.

After the adoption of CECL in the first quarter of 2020, banking regulators established guidelines for calculating credit concentrations. Banking regulators set the guidelines for construction, land development and other land loans to total less than 100% of total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL (CDL concentration ratio) and for total commercial real estate loans (construction, land development and other land loans along with other non-owner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans) to total less than 300% of total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL (CRE concentration ratio). Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the Bank&#8217;s total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL. At December 31, 2023, the Bank&#8217;s CDL concentration ratio was 59.7% and its CRE concentration ratio was 236.5%. At December 31, 2022, the Bank&#8217;s CDL concentration ratio was 64.8% and its CRE concentration ratio was 249.0%. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Bank was below the established regulatory guidelines. When a bank&#8217;s ratios are in excess of one or both of these loan concentration ratios guidelines, banking regulators generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management. Therefore, we monitor these two ratios as part of our concentration management processes. 

&#8203; 

Effect of Inflation and Changing Prices 

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the measure of financial position and results of operations in terms of historical dollars, without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power over time due to inflation. Unlike most other industries, the majority of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant effect on a financial institution&#8217;s performance than does the effect of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily change in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services. 

While the effect of inflation on banks is normally not as significant as is its influence on those businesses which have large investments in plant and inventories, it does have an effect. During periods of high inflation, there are normally corresponding increases in money supply, and banks will normally experience above average growth in assets, loans and deposits. Also, general increases in the prices of goods and services will result in increased operating expenses. Inflation also affects our Bank&#8217;s customers and may result in an indirect effect on our Bank&#8217;s business. 

Contractual Obligations 

The following table presents payment schedules for certain of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2023. Long-term debt obligations totaling $391.9 million include trust preferred junior subordinated debt and corporate subordinated debt. Operating and finance lease obligations of $126.6 million and $2.2 million, respectively, pertain to banking facilities. Certain lease agreements include payment of property taxes and insurance and contain various renewal options. Additional information regarding leases is contained in Note 21&#8212; Lease Commitments of the audited consolidated financial statements.
