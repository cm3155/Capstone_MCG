&#8203; 

Overview 

&#8203; 

South State Corporation is a financial holding company headquartered in Winter Haven, Florida, and was incorporated under the laws of South Carolina in 1985. We provide a wide range of banking services and products to our customers through our Bank. The Bank operates South State Advisory, Inc. (formerly First Southeast 401K Fiduciaries, Inc.), a wholly owned registered investment advisor. The Bank also operates Duncan-Williams, Inc. (&#8220;Duncan-Williams&#8221;), which it acquired on February 1, 2021. Duncan-Williams is a registered broker-dealer, headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, that serves primarily institutional clients across the U.S. in the fixed income business. Through the merger with CenterState Bank Corporation (&#8220;CSFL&#8221;) in the second quarter of 2020, the Bank also owns CBI Holding Company, LLC (&#8220;CBI&#8221;), which in turn owns Corporate Billing, LLC (&#8220;Corporate Billing&#8221;), a transaction-based finance company headquartered in Decatur, Alabama that provides factoring, invoicing, collection and accounts receivable management services to transportation companies and automotive parts and service providers nationwide. Also, through the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020, the holding company operates R4ALL, Inc., which manages troubled loans purchased from the Bank to their eventual disposition and SSB Insurance Corp., a captive insurance subsidiary pursuant to Section 831(b) of the U.S. Tax Code. 

&#8203; 

At March 31, 2021, we had approximately $39.7 billion in assets and 5,210 full-time equivalent employees. Through our Bank branches, ATMs and online banking platforms, we provide our customers with a wide range of financial services, including deposit accounts such as checking accounts, NOW accounts, savings and time deposits of various types, safe deposit boxes, bank money orders, wire transfer and ACH services, brokerage services and alternative investment products such as annuities and mutual funds, trust and asset management services, loans of all types, including business loans, agriculture loans, real estate-secured (mortgage) loans, personal use loans, home improvement loans, automobile loans, manufactured housing loans, boat loans, credit cards, letters of credit, home equity lines of credit, treasury management services, merchant services and, factoring through a six (6) state footprint in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. We also operate a correspondent banking and capital markets division within our national bank subsidiary, of which the majority of its bond salesmen, traders and operational personnel are housed in facilities located in Birmingham, Alabama and Atlanta, Georgia. This division&#8217;s primary revenue generating activities are related to its capital markets division, which includes commissions earned on fixed income security sales, fees from hedging services, loan brokerage fees and consulting fees for services related to these activities; and its correspondent banking division, which includes spread income earned on correspondent bank deposits (i.e., federal funds purchased) and correspondent bank checking account deposits and fees from safe-keeping activities, bond accounting services for correspondents, asset/liability consulting related activities, international wires, and other clearing and corporate checking account services. The correspondent banking and capital markets division was further expanded with the addition of Duncan-Williams on February 1, 2021. 

&#8203; 

We have pursued, and continue to pursue, a growth strategy that focuses on organic growth, supplemented by acquisitions of select financial institutions, or branches in certain market areas.

&#8203; 

The following discussion describes our results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020 and also analyzes our financial condition as of March 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 . Like most financial institutions, we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments. Our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits, on which we may pay interest. Consequently, one of the key measures of our success is the amount of our net 

&#160; 

interest income, or the difference between the income on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the expense on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits. Another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. 

Of course, there are risks inherent in all loans, as such we maintain an allowance for credit losses, otherwise referred to herein as ACL, to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible. We establish and maintain this allowance by charging a provision for credit losses against our operating earnings. In the following discussion, we have included a detailed discussion of this process. 

&#8203; 

In addition to earning interest on our loans and investments, we earn income through fees and other services we charge to our customers. We incur costs in addition to interest expense on deposits and other borrowings, the largest of which is salaries and employee benefits. We describe the various components of this noninterest income and noninterest expense in the following discussion. 

&#8203; 

The following sections also identify significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements. We encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other statistical information also included in this report. 

&#8203; 

Recent Events 

&#8203; 

COVID-19 

&#8203; 

The COVID-19 pandemic has severely restricted the level of economic activity in our markets. Specifically due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal and state governments in which we have financial centers and of most other states have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations, advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego their time outside of their homes, and ordering temporary closures of some businesses that have been deemed to be non-essential. 

&#8203; 

While our business has been designated an essential business, which allows us to continue to serve our customers, we serve many customers that were deemed, or who were employed by businesses that were deemed, to be non-essential. Although states in our market area have allowed businesses to reopen in the second and third quarters of 2020 that were deemed non-essential, there are still many restrictions, and our customers are still being adversely effected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In many of the states in our market area, as the economies have been allowed to reopen, there has been an increase in cases of COVID-19 and some restrictions have been reinstated.

&#8203; 

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is fluid and continues to evolve. The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated impacts on trade (including supply chains and export levels), travel, employee productivity, unemployment, consumer spending, and other economic activities has resulted in less economic activity, lower equity market valuations and increased volatility and disruption in financial markets, and has had an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of general operations, with a more limited impact to our mortgage and correspondent banking and capital markets business lines. The ultimate extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations is uncertain and will depend on various developments and other factors, including, among others, the duration and scope of the pandemic, as well as governmental, regulatory and private sector responses to the pandemic, and the associated impacts on the economy, financial markets and our customers, employees and vendors.

&#8203; 

Our business, financial condition and results of operations generally rely upon the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, the value of collateral underlying our secured loans, and demand for loans and other products and services we offer, which are highly dependent on the business environment in our primary markets where we operate and in the United States as a whole. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on our business and operations. As part of our efforts to practice social distancing, in March 2020, we closed all of our banking lobbies and began conducting most of our business through drive-thru tellers and through electronic and online means. To support the health and well-being of our employees, we allowed a majority of our non-customer facing workforce to work from home. In October 2020, we reopened our banking lobbies in our branch locations, but a majority of our support staff is still working from home. To support our customers or to comply with law, we deferred loan payments from 90 to 360 days for consumer and commercial customers. For customers directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we suspended residential property foreclosure sales and involuntary automobile repossessions through October 1, 2020, 

&#160; 

which was the latest moratorium expiration for states in our footprint. Eviction actions remained suspended through December 31, 2020 per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Agency Order 2020-19654. Additionally, we offered fee waivers, payment deferrals, and other expanded assistance for automobile, mortgage, small business and personal lending customers. 

&#8203; 

Future governmental actions may require more of these and other types of customer-related responses. We are awaiting a final ruling from the CFPB as to its proposal of a nationwide moratorium on foreclosures for all residential mortgages, which if enacted will have an effective date of August 31, 2021. 

&#8203; 

As of March 31, 2021, we have deferrals of $186 million, or 0.83%, of our total loan portfolio, excluding loans held for sale and Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;) loans. For commercial loans, the standard deferral was 90 days for both principal and interest, 120 days of principal only payments or 180 days of interest only payments. We have actively reached out to our customers to provide guidance and direction on these deferrals. In terms of available lines of credit, the Company has not experienced an increase in borrowers drawing down on their lines. As of March 31, 2021, below are the loan portfolios which we view are of the greatest risk: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Lodging (hotel / motel) loan portfolio - 13% is under deferral, and the weighted average loan to value (&#8220;LTV&#8221;) was 59%. The Company currently has $978 million, or 4.3% of the total loan portfolio, excluding loans held for sale and PPP loans, in lodging loans. &#8203; 

&#9679; Restaurant loan portfolio &#8211; 2% is under deferral, and the weighted average LTV of real estate secured was 56%. The Company currently has $434 million, or 1.9% of the total loan portfolio, excluding loans held for sale and PPP loans, in restaurants. &#8203; 

&#9679; Retail loan portfolio &#8211; 0.03% of retail CRE loan portfolio is under deferral and the weighted average LTV of 53%. The Company currently has $2.2 billion, or 9.8% of the total loan portfolio, excluding loans held for sale and PPP loans, in retail CRE loans. &#8203; 

Also, we have extended credit to both customers and non-customers related to the PPP. As of March 31, 2021, we have produced approximately 26,000 loans totaling approximately $3.1 billion through the PPP. While deferrals have been decreasing materially since the third quarter of 2020, given the fluidity of the pandemic and the risk there may be new lockdowns or restrictions on business activities to slow the spread of the virus, there is no guarantee that some loan not currently on deferral might return to deferral status. 

&#8203; 

A restructuring that results in only a delay in payments that is insignificant is not considered an economic concession. In accordance with the CARES Act, the Company implemented loan modification programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to provide borrowers with flexibility with respect to repayment terms. The Company&#8217;s payment relief assistance includes forbearance, deferrals, extension and re-aging programs, along with certain other modification strategies. The Company elected the accounting policy in the CARES Act to suspend TDR accounting to loans modified for borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic if the concession met the criteria defined under the CARES Act. 

&#8203; 

We are continuously monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations and financial condition. We implemented ASU 2016-13 in the first quarter of 2020 related to the calculation for our ACL for loans, investments, unfunded commitments and other financial assets. Considering the COVID-19 pandemic in our CECL models and moving to one CECL model (with the merged bank), during the third quarter of 2020, we recorded an additional provision for credit losses in the third quarter of 2020. We also adjust our investment securities portfolio to market each period end and review for any impairment that would require a provision for credit losses. At this time, we have determined there is no need for a provision for credit losses related to our investment securities portfolio. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers, we may be required to recognize impairments in the future on the securities we hold, as well as reductions in other comprehensive income. We cannot currently determine the ultimate impact of the pandemic on the long-term value of our portfolio. 

&#8203; 

We also are monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the valuation of goodwill. Additional detail in regards to the goodwill analysis is disclosed below under the Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets section of the Recent Events.

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Mergers and Acquisition 

&#8203; 

On February 1, 2021, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of Duncan-Williams, Inc. (&#8220;Duncan-Williams&#8221;). Duncan-Williams, which operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank, is a registered broker-dealer, headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, that serves primarily institutional clients across the U.S. in the fixed income business. 

&#8203; 

Branch Consolidation 

&#8203; 

As a part of the ongoing evaluation of customer service delivery and efficiencies, the Company closed 4 branch locations during the first quarter of 2021. The expected cost associated with these closures and cost initiatives is estimated to be approximately $400,000, and primarily includes personnel, facilities and equipment cost. The annual savings in 2021 of these closures is expected to be $750,000. Two of the locations are in Florida and two in Georgia. 

&#8203; 

Critical Accounting Policies 

&#8203; 

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies in accordance with GAAP and follow general practices within the banking industry. Our financial position and results of operations are affected by Management&#8217;s application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. Differences in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations and related disclosures. Understanding our accounting policies is fundamental to understanding our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. Accordingly, our significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 2 and Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Note 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

&#8203; 

The following is a summary of our critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates, assumptions and judgments.

&#8203; 

Allowance for Credit Losses or ACL 

&#8203; 

The ACL reflects Management&#8217;s estimate of losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments. Due to the Merger between the Company and CSFL, effective June 7, 2020, Management adopted one combined methodology during the third quarter of 2020. Management used the one systematic methodology to determine its ACL for loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. Management considers the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. The Company&#8217;s estimate of its ACL involves a high degree of judgment; therefore, Management&#8217;s process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach a different reasonable conclusion. The Company&#8217;s ACL recorded in the balance sheet reflects Management&#8217;s best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. The Company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the ACL for Management&#8217;s current estimate of expected credit losses. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the ACL. See also Note 7 &#8212; Allowance for Credit Losses in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, &#8220;Provision for Credit Losses and Nonperforming Assets&#8221; in this MD&#38;A.

&#8203; 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

&#8203; 

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less the estimated fair value of the liabilities assumed in a business combination. As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the balance of goodwill was $1.6 billion. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset&#8217;s fair value. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Our most recent evaluation of goodwill was performed as of November 30, 2020, and after considering the effects of COVID-19 on the economy, we determined that no impairment charge was necessary. Our stock price has historically traded above its book value, however, our stock price fell below book value and remained below book value through much of 2020 in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, which affected stock prices of companies in almost all industries. In November 2020, our stock price rose back above book value as the economy slowly began to recover and there was positive news on vaccines for COVID-19. Our stock price closed on December 31, 2020 at $72.30. Our stock price has continued to trade above book value and tangible book value in the first quarter of 2021. Our stock price closed on March 31, 2021 at $78.51, which was above book value of $66.42 and tangible book value of $42.02. We will continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the Company&#8217;s business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the economy deteriorates and our stock price falls below current levels, we will have to reevaluate the impact on our financial condition and potential impairment of goodwill. 

&#8203; 

Core deposit intangibles, client list intangibles, and noncompetition (&#8220;noncompete&#8221;) intangibles consist primarily of amortizing assets established during the acquisition of other banks. This includes whole bank acquisitions and the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities from other financial institutions. Core deposit intangibles represent the estimated value of long-term deposit relationships acquired in these transactions. Client list intangibles represent the value of long-term client relationships for the correspondent banking and wealth and trust management business. Noncompete intangibles represent the value of key personnel relative to various competitive factors such as ability to compete, willingness or likelihood to compete, and feasibility based upon the competitive environment, and what the Bank could lose from competition. These costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives, such as deposit accounts in the case of core deposit intangible, on a method that we believe reasonably approximates the anticipated benefit stream from this intangible. The estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed for reasonableness. 

Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets 

&#8203; 

Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of the transactions reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related to differences between the tax basis and accounting basis of certain assets and liabilities, including available-for-sale securities, ACL, write downs of OREO properties, accumulated depreciation, net operating loss carry forwards, accretion income, deferred compensation, intangible assets, mortgage servicing rights, and post- retirement benefits. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. A valuation allowance is recorded in situations where it is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; that a deferred tax asset is not realizable. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. Additionally, income tax returns are filed by the Company or its subsidiaries in the states of Alabama, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, New York, New York City and Virginia. We evaluate the need for income tax reserves related to uncertain income tax positions but had no material reserves at March 31, 2021 or 2020. 

&#8203; 

Other Real Estate Owned and Bank Property Held For Sale 

&#8203; 

Other real estate owned (&#8220;OREO&#8221;) consists of properties obtained through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of loans. Prior to the merger with CSFL, we classified former branch sites as held for sale OREO. During the second quarter of 2020 and with the merger with CSFL, the Company elected to reclassify these assets as bank property held for sale and report on a separate line within the balance sheet. Both OREO and bank property held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value and the fair value was determined on the basis of current valuations obtained principally from independent sources, adjusted for estimated selling costs. At the time of foreclosure or initial possession of collateral, for OREO, any excess of the loan balance over the fair value of the real estate held as collateral is treated as a charge against the ACL. At the time a bank property is no longer in service and is moved to held for sale, any excess of the current book value over fair value is recorded as an expense in the Statement of Net Income. Subsequent adjustments to this value are described below in the following paragraph. 

&#8203; 

We report subsequent declines in the fair value of OREO and bank properties held for sale below the new cost basis through valuation adjustments. Significant judgments and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of these properties, and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility. In response to market conditions and other economic factors, Management 

&#160; 

may utilize liquidation sales as part of its problem asset disposition strategy. As a result of the significant judgments required in estimating fair value and the variables involved in different methods of disposition, the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from the current valuations used to determine the fair value of these properties. Management reviews the value of these properties periodically and adjusts the values as appropriate. Revenue and expenses from OREO operations as well as gains or losses on sales and any subsequent adjustments to the value are recorded as OREO expense and loan related expense, a component of non-interest expense. 

&#8203; 

Results of Operations 

&#8203; 

Overview 

&#8203; 

We reported consolidated net income of $146.9 million, or diluted earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) of $2.06, for the first quarter of 2021 as compared to consolidated net income of $24.1 million, or diluted EPS of $0.71, in the comparable period of 2020, a 509.5% increase in consolidated net income and a 190.1% increase in diluted EPS. The $146.9 million increase in consolidated net income was the net result of the following items: 

&#8203; 

&#8226;

A $130.7 million increase in interest income, resulting from a $99.0 million increase in interest income from acquired loans due to an increase in average acquired loans from the merger with CSFL, a $26.3 million increase in interest income on non-acquired loans and a $4.2 million increase in interest income from investment securities. Non-acquired loan interest income increased due to the $3.3 billion increase in the average balance, although the interest rate declined by 21 basis points. Investment interest income increased due to the $2.7 billion increase in the average balance partially offset by a decline in yield of 113 basis points. This increase in loan interest income was offset by a $463,000 decline in interest income on federal funds sold and interest-earning deposits with banks due to a decline in yield of 100 basis points attributable to the falling interest rate environment, even though the average balance increased by $4.2 billion as a result of the merger with CSFL and the funds that flowed in from the government stimulus; 

&#8226;

A $3.3 million decrease in interest expense, which resulted from a decline in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities of 48 basis points. The effects from the decline in cost were partially offset by an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities of $12.2 billion as a result of the merger with CSFL and government stimulus. The decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was due to a falling interest rate environment as the Federal Reserve dropped the federal funds target rate 150 basis points to a range of 0.00% to 0.25% in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The first quarter of 2021 reflects the full impact of these actions and the Company&#8217;s move to reduce the interest rate paid on deposits as opposed to a partial month in the first quarter of 2020 ; 

&#8226;

A $95.0 million decrease in the provision for credit losses, as the Company recorded a release of the allowance for credit losses of $58.4 million in the first quarter of 2021 while recording a provision for credit losses of $36.5 million in the first quarter of 2020. The Company recorded higher provision for credit losses in the first quarter of 2020 and throughout 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the first quarter of 2021, with the improvement in the economy and the increased availability of the COVID-19 vaccine, the Company began to release some of this allowance for credit losses based on improvements in forecasts. 

&#8226;

A $52.2 million increase in noninterest income, which resulted primarily from the impact of the CSFL merger completed in the second quarter of 2020. The largest increases were a $28.3 million increase in correspondent banking and capital market income, $12.2 million increase in mortgage banking income and a $7.1 million increase in fees on deposit accounts. (See Noninterest Income section on page 58 for further discussion); 

&#8226;

A $121.5 million increase in noninterest expense, which resulted primarily from the impact of the CSFL merger completed in the second quarter of 2020. The largest increases were from salary and employee benefits which totaled $79.4 million, occupancy expense of $11.0 million, information services expense of $9.5 million, merger and branch consolidation related expense of $5.9 million and amortization of intangibles of $6.2 million. (See Noninterest Expense section on page 59 for further discussion); and 

&#8226;

A $36.8 million increase in the provision for income taxes. This increase was primarily due to an increase in pretax book income of $159.6 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 which drove our effective tax rate higher. Our effective tax rate was 21.83% for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to 15.00% for the three months ended March 31, 2020. 

&#8203; 

Our quarterly efficiency ratio increased to 61.1% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 60.4% in the first quarter of 2020. The increase in the efficiency ratio compared to the first quarter of 2020 was the result of a 110.6% 

&#160; 

increase in noninterest expense (excluding amortization of intangibles) being greater than the 108.1% increase in the total of net interest income and noninterest income. The significant increases in noninterest expense and net interest income and noninterest income were due to the fact the first quarter of 2021 includes the effects of the merger with CSFL while the first quarter of 2020 does not. 

&#8203; 

Diluted and basic EPS were $2.06 and $2.07, respectively, for the first quarter of 2021, compared to the first quarter of 2020 of $0.71 and $0.72. The increase of 509.5% in net income in the first quarter of 2021 was greater than the increase in average common shares of 111% compared to the same period in 2020. The first quarter in 2021 includes the effect of net income from CSFL while the first quarter of 2020 does not. The weighted average common shares increased to 71.0 million shares, or 111%, due to the merger with CSFL compared to 33.6 million weighted average shares outstanding at March 31, 2020. The Company issued 37.3 million shares with the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020.

&#8203; 

&#9679; For the three months ended March 31, 2021, return on average tangible equity increased to 21.16% compared to 8.35% for the same period in 2020. This increase was the result of an increase in net income, excluding amortization of intangibles, of $127.4 million, or 478% being greater than the increase in average tangible equity of $1.7 billion, or 129.9%, during the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same quarter in 2020. The increase in net income and increase in average tangible equity were both due to the merger with CSFL which occurred in the second quarter of 2020. The main reason for the more significant increase in net income was due to the provision for credit losses where we had a release of $58.4 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to a provision of $36.5 million in the first quarter of 2020. &#9679; For the three months ended March 31, 2021, return on average assets was 1.56%, an increase from 0.60% for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase was due to the increase in net income of $122.8 million, or 509.5%, during the first quarter of 2021 being greater than the increase of 138.2% in average assets. The net income (merger expenses) and increase in average assets were both due to the merger with CSFL that occurred in early June 2020. The main reason for the more significant increase in net income was due to the provision for credit losses where we had a release of $58.4 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to a provision of $36.5 million in the first quarter of 2020. &#9679; Equity to assets ratio was 11.88% for the three months ended March 31, 2021, a decrease from 13.95% for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease from the comparable period in 2020 was due to the increase in total assets of 138.7% being greater than the increase in equity of 103.3%. Both the increase in assets and equity were due to the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020. &#9679; Dividend payout ratio was 22.72% for the three months ended March 31, 2021, and decrease from 65.70% for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease from the comparable period in 2020 reflects the increase of 509.5% in net income being greater than the 110.7% increase in cash dividends paid per common share. The dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing total dividends paid during the quarter by the total net income reported for the same period. &#8203;

Net Interest Income and Margin 

&#8203; 

Non-TE net interest income increased $134.0 million or 104.7% to $262.0 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $128.0 million in the same period in 2020. Interest earning assets averaged $34.2 billion during the three months period ended March 31, 2021 compared to $14.0 billion for the same period in 2020, an increase of $20.2 billion or 143.8%. Interest bearing liabilities averaged $22.4 billion during the three months period ended March 31, 2021 compared to $10.2 billion for the same period in 2020, an increase of $12.2 billion or 120.2%. Some key highlights are outlined below: 

&#8203; 

1. Higher interest income by $130.7 million with increased interest income from acquired loans, non-acquired loans and investment securities by $99.0 million, $26.3 million and $4.2 million, respectively, due to increases in average balances, which were $9.8 billion, $3.3 billion and by $2.7 billion, respectively. The average balance of acquired loans increased primarily due to balances assumed from the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020. The average balance of our non-acquired loan portfolio increased primarily through organic growth including PPP loans which averaged $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2021. The average balance of investment securities increased through both the $1.2 billion in investment securities acquired in the merger with CSFL along with the Company&#8217;s decision to increase the investment portfolio due to the excess liquidity held through growth in deposits since the first quarter of 2020. 2. Lower interest expense of $3.3 million due to the lower rate environment in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 as the average cost of funds declined 48 basis points. This decline due to lower cost was partially offset by increase in the average balances for interest-bearing liabilities of $12.2 million which was driven by an increase in interest-bearing deposits of $12.2 billion in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. The increase in average interest-bearing deposits was mainly due to the $10.3 billion in interest-bearing deposits acquired in the merger with CSFL in June 2020. 3. Non-TE yield on interest-earning assets for the first quarter of 2021 decreased 93 basis points to 3.30% from the comparable period in 2020. The decline in yield on interest-earning assets was due to the falling interest rate environment resulting from the drops in the federal funds rate made by the Federal Reserve in March 2020 as well as a change in asset mix as the lower yielding federal funds sold, reverse repos and other interest-bearing deposits increased $4.2 billion in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. 4. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the first quarter of 2021 decreased 48 basis points from the same period in 2020. This decrease occurred in all deposit categories of funding and was due to the falling interest rate environment in the first quarter of 2020. Our overall cost of funds, including noninterest-bearing deposits, was 0.21% for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to 0.59% for the three months ended March 31, 2020. 5. The Non-TE net interest margin decreased by 57 basis points and the TE net interest margin decreased by 56 basis points in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same quarter of 2020 due to the decline in the yield on interest earning assets of 93 basis points, which was only partially offset by the lower cost of interest-bearing liabilities of 48 basis points. &#8203;

(1) Investment securities (taxable) include trading securities. Investment Securities 

&#8203; 

Interest earned on investment securities was higher in the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. This is a result of the Bank carrying a higher average balance in investment securities in 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. The average balance of investment securities for the three months ended March 31, 2021 increased $2.7 billion from the comparable period in 2020. With the excess liquidity from the growth in deposits during 2020 and the first three months of 2021 , the Bank used a portion of the excess funds to strategically increase the size of its investment securities. The increase in the average balance was also due to the acquisition of CSFL&#8217;s investment portfolio of $1.2 billion in June 2020. The yield on the investment securities declined 113 basis points during the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 due to the falling interest rate environment resulting from the drop in the federal funds rate made by the Federal Reserve in March 2020 and the impact this reduction has on the rate earned on security purchases.

Loans 

&#8203; 

Interest earned on loans increased $125.3 million to $258.0 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same quarter of 2020. Interest earned related to loans included loan accretion income recognized in the first quarter of 

&#160; 

2021 totaling $10.4 million compared to loan accretion income of $10.9 million in the first quarter of 2020, a decrease of $515,000. Some key highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 are outlined below:

&#8203; 

&#9679; Our non-TE yield on total loans decreased 39 basis points in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 while average total loans increased $13.1 billion or 114.1%, in the first quarter of 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020. The increase in average total loans was the result of 483.9% growth in the average acquired loan portfolio and 35.0% growth in the average non-acquired loan portfolio. The growth in the acquired loan portfolio was due to the addition of $13.0 billion in loans from the merger with CSFL. The growth in the non-acquired loan portfolio was due to normal organic growth and PPP loans. &#9679; The yield on the acquired loan portfolio decreased from 7.14% in the first quarter of 2020 to 4.64% in the same period in 2021. For the a cquired loans, average balance increased by $9.8 billion and interest income increased by $99.0 million due to the loans acquired in the merger with CSFL, while the yield decreased by 250 basis points due to overall lower rate environment and the lower yielding PPP loans assumed from the merger with CSFL. &#9679; The yield on the non-acquired loan portfolio decreased from 4.14% in the first quarter of 2020 to 3.93% in the same period in 2021. Non-acquired loan yield declined by 21 basis points due to the low yielding PPP loans originated during the first quarter of 2021 and low interest rate environment. The most recent rate change by the Federal Reserve was the federal funds target rate drop by 150 basis points to a range of 0.00% to 0.25% in March 2020 in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. This effectively decreased the Prime Rate, the rate used in pricing a majority of our new originated loans. &#160; &#8203; 

Interest-Bearing Liabilities 

&#8203; 

The quarter-to-date average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased $12.2 billion in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 . Overall cost of funds, including demand deposits, decreased by 38 basis points to 0.21% in the first quarter of 2021, compared to the same period in 2020. Some key highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 include: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Increase in interest-bearing deposits of $12.2 billion and an increase in federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements and corporate and subordinated debt of $798.0 million. These increases were slightly offset by a decrease in other borrowings of $771.5 million. &#9679; Increase in average interest-bearing deposits is due to the acquisition of $10.3 billion in interest-bearing deposits from the CSFL merger during the second quarter of 2020. The increase in average federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements and the increase in average corporate and subordinated debt and other borrowings was also due to borrowings acquired in the merger with CSFL. The Company assumed $401.5 million in federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements and $271.5 million in subordinated debt and trust preferred debt from the merger in the second quarter of 2020. The decline in average other borrowings, consisting mostly of FHLB advances, was due to the Company making the strategic decision to payoff these borrowings in the fourth quarter of 2020. &#9679; The decline in interest expense of $3.3 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 was driven by lower cost on overall interest bearing liabilities, especially on interest bearing deposits. The cost on interest-bearing deposits was 0.22% for the first quarter of 2021 compared to 0.65% for the same period in 2020. The decline in cost related to deposits was due to the falling interest rate environment resulting from the drops in the federal funds rate made by the Federal Reserve in March 2020. These changes resulted in a 48 basis point decrease in the average rate on all interest-bearing liabilities from 0.78% to 0.30% for the three months ended March 31, 2021. &#8203; 

We continue to monitor and adjust rates paid on deposit products as part of our strategy to manage our net interest margin. Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits, CDs, other time deposits, federal funds purchased, and other borrowings. Interest-bearing transaction accounts include NOW, HSA, IOLTA, and Market Rate checking accounts. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

Noninterest-Bearing Deposits 

&#8203; 

Noninterest-bearing deposits are transaction accounts that provide our Bank with &#8220;interest-free&#8221; sources of funds. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $6.8 billion, or 207.0%, to $10.0 billion in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $3.3 billion during the same period in 2020. This increase in both period end and average assets was mainly due to the noninterest-bearing deposits of $5.3 billion assumed from the merger with CSFL in June 2020. 

&#8203; 

Noninterest Income 

&#8203; 

Noninterest income provides us with additional revenues that are significant sources of income. For the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, noninterest income comprised 26.9%, and 25.6%, respectively, of total net interest income and noninterest income.

&#8203; 

Noninterest income increased by $52.2 million, or 118.2%, during the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 . This quarterly change in total noninterest income primarily resulted from the following: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Service charges on deposit accounts and debit, prepaid, ATM and merchant card related income were higher in the first quarter of 2021 by $3.8 million and $3.4 million, respectively, than the same quarter in 2020 , due primarily to the increase in customers and activity through the merger with CSFL during the second quarter of 2020. The increase in service charges on deposit accounts was mainly driven by an increase in service charge maintenance fees on checking accounts and an increase in net NSF income. The increase in debit, prepaid, ATM and merchant card related income was mainly driven by higher debit card and merchant card income. &#9679; Mortgage banking income increased by $17.5 million, or 83.5%, which was comprised of $17.5 million, or 194.2%, increase from mortgage income in the secondary market, partially offset by a $5.3 million, or 94.5%, decrease from mortgage servicing related income, net of the hedge. The increase in mortgage income in the secondary market was directly attributable to the increase in volume resulting from the low interest rate environment brought on by the pandemic and monetary policy of the US Government during 2020 along with the increase in volume due to the merger with CSFL. The increase in mortgage income from the secondary market in 2021 comprised of a $22.1 million increase in the gain on sale of mortgage loans to $26.7 million in the first quarter of 2021, which is net of the increase in commission expense related to mortgage production of $6.5 million to $8.2 million in the first quarter of 2021. This increase was offset by a $4.6 million decline in the change in fair value of the pipeline, loans held for sale and MBS forward trades. The decrease in mortgage servicing related income, net of the hedge in 2021 was due to a $6.4 million decrease in the change in fair value of the MSR including decay partially offset by a $1.1 million increase from servicing fee income. &#9679; The merger with CSFL resulted in a significant increase in correspondent banking and capital markets income, of which approximately $7.5 million was attributable to the Duncan-Williams merger completed on February 1, 2021. The income for 2021 increased by $28.3 million. The income from this business includes commissions earned on fixed income security sales, fees from hedging services, loan brokerage fees and consulting fees for services related to these activities. &#9679; Other income increased by $2.6 million mainly due to the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020. This increase was mainly due to increases in SBA loan servicing fees and gains on sale of SBA loans of $2.5 million. &#8203;

&#8203; 

Noninterest expense increased by $121.5 million, or 113.3%, in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. The quarterly increase in total noninterest expense primarily resulted from the following:

&#8203; 

&#9679; Salaries and employee benefits expense increased by $79.4 million, or 130.2%, in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. This increase was mainly attributable to an increase in all categories of salaries and benefits due to the increase in employees through the merger with CSFL in June 2020. Full time equivalent employees increased 101.7% to 5,210 at March 31, 2021 through the merger with CSFL from 2,583 at March 31, 2020. In addition, we recorded a total of $11.3 million in commission expense during the current quarter, compared to $89,000 during the first quarter of 2020. &#9679; An increase in merger-related and branch consolidation related expense of $5.9 million compared to the first quarter of 2020 . The costs in the first quarter of 2021 and 2020 were both primarily related to the merger with CSFL. The costs in the first quarter of 2021 also consisted of branch consolidation costs along with costs related to the DWI acquisition. &#9679; Occupancy and information services expense increased $11.0 million or 89.9% and $9.5 million or 101.9%, respectively. This increase was related to the additional cost associated with facilities, employees and systems added through our merger with CSFL. Our number of branches increased by 129, or 81.3% from 155 at March 31, 2020 to 281 at March 31, 2021. &#9679; Amortization of intangibles increased $6.2 million, or 204.8%. This increase was due to the merger with CSFL which resulted in the Company recording a core deposit intangible asset of $125.9 million and a correspondent banking customer intangible asset of $10.0 million in the second quarter of 2020. &#9679; The increases in the other line items is mainly related to the increase in costs associated with the addition of CSFL operations with the merger in the second quarter of 2020. &#8203; 

Income Tax Expense 

&#8203; 

Our effective tax rate was 21.83% for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to 15.00% for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase in the effective tax rate for the quarter was driven by increased pre-tax book income in the current quarter compared to the same period of 2020. The increase in pre-tax book income was a result of the combined incomes of South State and CenterState subsequent to the merger that closed June 7, 2020. Pre-tax book income was also higher compared to the first quarter of 2020 due to a release in the allowance for credit losses of $59.6 million in the current quarter. An additional allowance for credit losses of $36.5 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in pre-tax book income for the quarter was partially offset by an increase in federal estimates associated with tax credits and tax-exempt interest income compared to the first quarter of 2020.

Analysis of Financial Condition 

Summary 

Our total assets increased approximately $1.9 billion, or 5%, from December 31, 2020 to March 31, 2021, to approximately $39.7 billion. Within total assets, cash and cash equivalents increased $1.4 billion, or 29.6%, investment securities increased $820.6 million, or 18.4%, and loans decreased $173,000, or 0.7%, during the period. Within total liabilities, deposit growth was $1.7 billion, or 5.7%, and fed funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchased growth was $98.9 million, or 12.7%. Total shareholder&#8217;s equity increased $71.9 million, or 1.5%. Our loan to deposit ratio was 75% and 80% at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

&#8203; 

Investment Securities 

&#8203; 

We use investment securities, our second largest category of earning assets, to generate interest income through the deployment of excess funds, provide liquidity, fund loan demand or deposit liquidation, and pledge as collateral for public funds deposits, repurchase agreements and as collateral for derivative exposure. At March 31, 2021, investment securities totaled $5.3 billion, compared to $4.4 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $820.6 million, or 18.5%. We continue to increase our investment securities strategically primarily with excess funds due to continued deposit growth and slow loan demand. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, we purchased $1.1 billion of securities, $276.7 million classified as held to maturity and $850.6 million classified as available for sale. These purchases were partially offset by maturities, paydowns, and calls of investment securities totaling $234.6 million. Net amortization of premiums were $9.5 million in the first three months of 2021. The decrease in fair value in the available for sale investment portfolio in the first three months of 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 was mainly due to an increase in short and long term interest rates during the three months ended March 31, 2021. 

&#8203; 

The following is the combined amortized cost and fair value of investment securities available for sale and held for maturity, aggregated by credit quality indicator:

* Agency mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;MBS&#8221;), agency collateralized mortgage-obligations (CMO) and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;CMBS&#8221;) are guaranteed by the issuing government-sponsored enterprise (&#8220;GSE&#8221;) as to the timely payments of principal and interest. Except for Government National Mortgage Association securities, which have the full faith and credit backing of the United States Government, the GSE alone is responsible for making payments on this guaranty. While the rating agencies have not rated any of the MBS, CMO and CMBS issued, senior debt securities issued by GSEs are rated consistently as &#8220;Triple-A.&#8221; Most market participants consider agency MBS, CMOs and CMBSs as carrying an implied Aaa rating (S&#38;P rating of AA+) because of the guarantees of timely payments and selection criteria of mortgages backing the securities. We do not own any private label mortgage-backed securities. The balances presented under the ratings above reflect the amortized cost of the investment securities. 

&#8203; 

&#160; 

At March 31, 2021 , we had 217 investment securities (including both available for sale and held to maturity) in an unrealized loss position, which totaled $79.2 million. At December 31, 2020, we had 86 investment securities (including both available for sale and held to maturity) in an unrealized loss position, which totaled $5.3 million. The total number of investment securities with an unrealized loss position increased by 131 securities, while the total dollar amount of the unrealized loss increased by $73.9 million. The increase in both the number of investment securities in a loss position and the total unrealized loss from December 31, 2020 is due to an increase in short and long term interest rates during the first three months of 2021. 

&#8203; 

All investment securities in an unrealized loss position as of March 31, 2021 continue to perform as scheduled. We have evaluated the cash flows and determined that all contractual cash flows should be received; therefore impairment is temporary because we have the ability to hold these securities within the portfolio until the maturity or until the value recovers, and we believe that it is not likely that we will be required to sell these securities prior to recovery. We continue to monitor all of our securities with a high degree of scrutiny. There can be no assurance that we will not conclude in future periods that conditions existing at that time indicate some or all of its securities may be sold or would require a charge to earnings as a provision for credit losses in such periods. Any charges as a provision for credit losses related to investment securities could impact cash flow, tangible capital or liquidity. See Note 2 &#8211; Summary of Significant Account Policies and Note 5 &#8211; Investment securities for further discussion on the application of ASU 2016-13 on the investment securities portfolio. 

&#8203; 

As securities held for investment are purchased, they are designated as held to maturity or available for sale based upon our intent, which incorporates liquidity needs, interest rate expectations, asset/liability management strategies, and capital requirements. Although securities classified as available for sale may be sold from time to time to meet liquidity or other needs, it is not our normal practice to trade this segment of the investment securities portfolio. While Management generally holds these assets on a long-term basis or until maturity, any short-term investments or securities available for sale could be converted at an earlier point, depending partly on changes in interest rates and alternative investment opportunities.

&#8203; 

Other Investments 

&#8203; 

Other investment securities include primarily our investments in FHLB and FRB stock with no readily determinable market value. Accordingly, when evaluating these securities for impairment, Management considers the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than recognizing temporary declines in value. As of March 31, 2021, we determined that there was no impairment on our other investment securities. As of March 31, 2021, other investment securities represented approximately $161.5 million, or 0.41% of total assets and primarily consists of FHLB and FRB stock which totals $146.0 million, or 0.37% of total assets. There were no gains or losses on the sales of these securities for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

&#8203; 

Trading Securities 

&#8203; 

Through its Correspondent Banking Department and its wholly-owned broker dealer Duncan-Williams Inc., the Company will occasionally purchase trading securities and subsequently sell them to their customers to take advantage of market opportunities, when presented, for short-term revenue gains. Securities purchased for this portfolio are primarily municipals, treasuries and mortgage-backed agency securities and are held for short periods of time. This portfolio is carried at fair value and realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in trading securities revenue, a component of Correspondent Banking and Capital Market Income in our Consolidated Statements of Net Income. At March 31, 2021, we had $83.9 million of trading securities. 

&#8203; 

Loans Held for Sale 

&#8203; 

The balance of mortgage loans held for sale increased $62.5 million from December 31, 2020 to $353.0 million at March 31, 2021. This increase was due to pending loan sales, which generally settle within 15 to 45 days.

Total loans, net of deferred loan costs and fees (excluding mortgage loans held for sale), decreased by $172.7 million, or 0.7%, to $24.5 billion at March 31, 2021. Our non-acquired loan portfolio increased by $1.1 billion, or 35.9% annualized, driven by growth in all categories except other loans. Commercial and industrial loans and commercial non-owner occupied loans led the way with $516.1 million and $212.2 million in quarterly loan growth, respectively, or 75.9% and 37.6% annualized growth, respectively. The acquired loan portfolio decreased by $1.3 billion, or 41.3% annualized, from paydowns and payoffs in both the PCD and NonPCD loan categories. Acquired loans as a percentage of total loans decreased to 45.4% and non-acquired loans as a percentage of the overall portfolio increased to 54.6% at March 31, 2021. 

&#8203; 

Allowance for Credit Losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;) 

&#8203; 

The ACL reflects Management&#8217;s estimate of losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments. The Company established the incremental increase in the ACL at adoption through equity and subsequent adjustments through a provision for credit losses charged to earnings. The Company records loans charged off against the ACL and subsequent recoveries, if any, increase the ACL when they are recognized. 

&#8203; 

Management uses systematic methodologies to determine its ACL for loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loan portfolio. Management considers the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. The Company&#8217;s estimate of its ACL involves a high degree of judgment; therefore, Management&#8217;s process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses. The Company&#8217;s ACL recorded in the balance sheet reflects Management&#8217;s best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. The Company recognizes in net income the 

&#160; 

amount needed to adjust the ACL for Management&#8217;s current estimate of expected credit losses. The Company&#8217;s ACL is calculated using collectively evaluated and individually evaluated loans. 

&#8203; 

The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Loans with similar risk characteristics are grouped into homogenous segments, or pools, for analysis. The Discounted Cash Flow (&#8220;DCF&#8221;) method is utilized for each loan in a pool, and the results are aggregated at the pool level. A periodic tendency to default and absolute loss given default are applied to a projective model of the loan&#8217;s cash flow while considering prepayment and principal curtailment effects. The analysis produces expected cash flows for each instrument in the pool by pairing loan-level term information (e.g., maturity date, payment amount, interest rate, etc.) with top-down pool assumptions (e.g., default rates and prepayment speeds). The Company has identified the following portfolio segments: Owner-Occupied Commercial Real Estate, Non Owner-Occupied Commercial Real Estate, Multifamily, Municipal, Commercial and Industrial, Commercial Construction and Land Development, Residential Construction, Residential Senior Mortgage, Residential Junior Mortgage, Revolving Mortgage, and Consumer and Other. 

&#8203; 

In determining the proper level of the ACL, Management has determined that the loss experience of the Bank provides the best basis for its assessment of expected credit losses. It therefore utilized its own historical credit loss experience by each loan segment over an economic cycle, while excluding loss experience from certain acquired institutions (i.e., failed banks). For most of the segment models for collectively evaluated loans, the Company incorporated two or more macroeconomic drivers using a statistical regression modeling methodology. 

&#8203; 

Management considers forward-looking information in estimating expected credit losses. The Company subscribes to a third-party service which provides a quarterly macroeconomic baseline outlook and alternative scenarios for the United States economy. The baseline, along with the evaluation of alternative scenarios, is used by Management to determine the best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. Management has evaluated the appropriateness of the reasonable and supportable forecast scenarios and has made adjustments as needed. For the contractual term that extends beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts to the long term mean of historical factors within four quarters using a straight-line approach. The Company generally utilizes a four-quarter forecast and a four-quarter reversion period. 

&#8203; 

As stated above, Management evaluates the appropriateness of the reasonable and supportable forecast scenarios and takes into consideration the scenarios in relation to actual economic and other data (such as COVID-19 epidemiological data and federal stimulus), as well as the volatility and magnitude of changes within those scenarios quarter over quarter. The current environment has brought increased volatility in economic forecasts. During the fourth quarter, Management used a blended forecast scenario (two-thirds baseline and one-third more severe scenario) to determine the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2020. Rapidly changing macroeconomic variables challenges the ability of the forecasts to assimilate and reflect most recent data, and uncertainties persist around the future path of those variables, given the speed and magnitude of the monthly and quarterly shifts. While the recent forecasts were significantly revised upward, given the uncertain path of economic recovery and efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19, it is possible that future forecasts are overly optimistic, and therefore forecast volatility should be considered. As such, Management adjusted the blended forecast scenario to an equal weight between baseline and the more adverse scenario during the current quarter to determine the allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2021 resulting in a release of approximately $58 million. If the economic forecast weighting had not been adjusted, this would have resulted in an additional release of approximately $35 million, which Management did not deem appropriate given the uncertainty around COVID-19 and the speed of economic recovery. 

&#8203; 

Included in its systematic methodology to determine its ACL, Management considers the need to qualitatively adjust expected credit losses for information not already captured in the loss estimation process. These qualitative adjustments either increase or decrease the quantitative model estimation (i.e., formulaic model results). Each period the Company considers qualitative factors that are relevant within the qualitative framework that includes the following: 1) Lending Policy; 2) Economic conditions not captured in models; 3) Volume and Mix of Loan Portfolio; 4) Past Due Trends; 5) Concentration Risk; 6) External Factors; and 7) Model Limitations. 

&#8203; 

When a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with its segment, the asset is assessed to determine whether it should be included in another pool or should be individually evaluated. During the third quarter of 2020, we consolidated the ACL models and due to the size of the combined company elected to increase the threshold for individually-evaluated loans to all non-accrual loans with a net book balance in excess of $1.0 million. We will monitor 

&#160; 

the credit environment and make adjustments to this threshold in the future if warranted. Based on the threshold above, consumer financial assets will generally remain in pools unless they meet the dollar threshold. The expected credit losses on individually-evaluated loans will be estimated based on discounted cash flow analysis unless the loan meets the criteria for use of the fair value of collateral, either by virtue of an expected foreclosure or through meeting the definition of collateral-dependent. Financial assets that have been individually evaluated can be returned to a pool for purposes of estimating the expected credit loss insofar as their credit profile improves and that the repayment terms were not considered to be unique to the asset. 

&#8203; 

Management measures expected credit losses over the contractual term of a loan. When determining the contractual term, the Company considers expected prepayments but is precluded from considering expected extensions, renewals, or modifications, unless the Company reasonably expects it will execute a troubled debt restructuring (&#8220;TDR&#8221;) with a borrower. In the event of a reasonably-expected TDR, the Company factors the reasonably-expected TDR into the current expected credit losses estimate. For consumer loans, the point at which a TDR is reasonably expected is when the Company approves the borrower&#8217;s application for a modification (i.e., the borrower qualifies for the TDR) or when the Credit Administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans. For commercial loans, the point at which a TDR is reasonably expected is when the Company approves the loan for modification or when the Credit Administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans. The Company uses a discounted cash flow methodology for a TDR to calculate the effect of the concession provided to the borrower within the ACL. 

&#8203; 

A restructuring that results in only a delay in payments that is insignificant is not considered an economic concession. In accordance with the CARES Act, the Company implemented loan modification programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to provide borrowers with flexibility with respect to repayment terms. The Company&#8217;s payment relief assistance includes forbearance, deferrals, extension and re-aging programs, along with certain other modification strategies. The Company elected the accounting policy in the CARES Act to not apply TDR accounting to loans modified for borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic if the concession met the criteria as defined under the CARES Act. 

&#8203; 

For purchased credit-deteriorated, otherwise referred to herein as PCD, assets are defined as acquired individual financial assets (or acquired groups of financial assets with similar risk characteristics) that, as of the date of acquisition, have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, as determined by the Company&#8217;s assessment. The Company records PCD loans by adding the expected credit losses (i.e., allowance for credit losses) to the purchase price of the financial assets rather than recording through the provision for credit losses in the income statement. The expected credit loss, as of the acquisition day, of a PCD loan is added to the allowance for credit losses. The non-credit discount or premium is the difference between the unpaid principal balance and the amortized cost basis as of the acquisition date. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the change in the ACL on PCD loans is recognized through the provision for credit losses. The non-credit discount or premium is accreted or amortized, respectively, into interest income over the remaining life of the PCD loan on a level-yield basis. In accordance with the transition requirements within the standard, the Company&#8217;s acquired credit-impaired loans (i.e., ACI or Purchased Credit Impaired) were treated as PCD loans. 

The Company follows its nonaccrual policy by reversing contractual interest income in the income statement when the Company places a loan on nonaccrual status. Therefore, Management excludes the accrued interest receivable balance from the amortized cost basis in measuring expected credit losses on the portfolio and does not record an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable. As of March 31, 2021, the accrued interest receivable for loans recorded in Other Assets was $89.5 million. 

&#8203; 

The Company has a variety of assets that have a component that qualifies as an off-balance sheet exposure. These primarily include undrawn portions of revolving lines of credit and standby letters of credit. The expected losses associated with these exposures within the unfunded portion of the expected credit loss will be recorded as a liability on the balance sheet with an offsetting income statement expense. Management has determined that a majority of the Company&#8217;s off-balance-sheet credit exposures are not unconditionally cancellable. As part of the new combined ACL methodology implemented during the current year, Management completed a funding study based on historical data to estimate the percentage of unfunded loan commitments that will ultimately be funded to calculate the reserve for unfunded commitments. Management applied this funding rate, along with the loss factor rate determined for each pooled loan segment, to unfunded loan commitments, excluding unconditionally cancellable exposures and letters of credit, to arrive at the reserve for unfunded loan commitments. Prior to the third quarter, the Company applied a utilization rate instead of a funding rate to the South State legacy portfolio to determine the reserve for unfunded 

&#160; 

commitments. As of March 31, 2021, the liability recorded for expected credit losses on unfunded commitments was $35.8 million. The current adjustment to the ACL for unfunded commitments is recognized through the provision for credit losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 

With the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, the Company changed its method for calculating it&#8217;s allowance for loans from an incurred loss method to a life of loan method. See Note 2 &#8211; Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7 &#8211; Allowance for Credit Losses for further details. As of March 31, 2021, the balance of the ACL was $406.5 million or 1.66% of total loans. The ACL decreased $50.8 million from the balance of $457.3 million recorded at December 31, 2020. This decrease during the first quarter of 2021 included a $50.9 million release or decline in the provision for credit losses partially offset by $21,000 in net recoveries. In the first quarter of 2021, with the improvement in the economy and the increased availability of the COVID-19 vaccine, the Company began to release some of this allowance for credit losses based on improvements in forecasts. For the prior comparative period, the ACL increased $33.4 million to $144.8 million from the balance of $111.4 million recorded at adoption of the CECL standard as of January 1, 2020. This increase included a $34.7 million provision of credit losses during the first quarter of 2020 and net charge offs during the first quarter of 2020 of $1.3 million. The significant provision in the first quarter 2020 was due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic being modeled in the forecasted loss period and macroeconomic assumptions in the first quarter of 2020. 

&#8203; 

At March 31, 2021, the Company had a reserve on unfunded commitments of $35.8 million which was recorded as a liability on the Balance Sheet, compared to $43.4 million at December 31, 2020. During three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company had a release of allowance or negative provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments of $7.6 million. With the improvement in the economy and the increased availability of the COVID-19 vaccine, the Company began to release some of this allowance for credit losses based on improvements in forecasts. This amount was recorded in the (recovery) provision for credit losses on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. For the prior comparative period, the Company had a reserve on unfunded commitments of $8.6 million recorded at March 31, 2020. With the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, the Company increased its reserve on unfunded commitments by $6.5 million. During the first quarter of 2020, the provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments was $1.8 million. The Company did not have an allowance for credit losses or record a provision for credit losses on investment securities or other financials asset during the first three months of 2021 or 2020. 

&#8203; 

At March 31, 2021, the allowance for credit losses was $406.5 million, or 1.66%, of period-end loans. The ACL provides 4.02 times coverage of nonperforming loans at March 31, 2021. Net recoveries to the total average loans during three months ended March 31, 2021 were 0.00%. We continued to show solid and stable asset quality numbers and ratios as of March 31, 2021. The following table provides the allocation, by segment, for expected credit losses. Because PPP loans are government guaranteed and management implemented additional reviews and procedures to help mitigate potential losses, Management does not expect to recognize credit losses on this loan portfolio and as a result, did not record an ACL for PPP loans within the C&#38;I loan segment presented in the table below. 

The following table provides the allocation, by segment, for expected credit losses.

(1) Includes nonaccrual loans that are purchase credit deteriorated (PCD loans). (2) Excludes certain real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure and property not intended for bank use. (3) Consists of non-real estate foreclosed assets, such as repossessed vehicles. (4) Loan data excludes mortgage loans held for sale. (5) For purposes of this calculation, total assets include all assets (both acquired and non-acquired). (6) Excludes non-acquired bank premises held for sale of $1.9 million, $2.2 million, $2.3 million, $2.0 million and $2.7 million as of March 31, 2021, December 31, 2020, December 31, 2020, March 31, 2020, March 31, 2020, respectively, that is now separately disclosed on the balance sheet. 

&#160; 

(7) Excludes acquired bank premises held for sale of $29.3 million, $33.8 million, $22.2 million, $23.5 million and $2.7 million as of March 31, 2021, December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020, December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively, that is now separately disclosed on the balance sheet. &#8203; 

Total nonperforming assets were $113.0 million, or 0.46% of total loans and repossessed assets, at March 31, 2021, a decrease of $6.1 million, or 5.1%, from December 31, 2020. Total nonperforming loans were $101.1 million, or 0.41%, of total loans, at March 31, 2021, a decrease of $5.8 million, or 5.4%, from December 31, 2020. Non-acquired nonperforming loans declined by $8.1 million from December 31, 2020. The decline in non-acquired nonperforming loans was driven primarily by a decline in accruing loans past due 90 days or more of $8.7 million, a decrease in restructured nonaccrual loans of $325,000, offset by an increase in primarily commercial nonaccrual loans of $929,000. The accruing loans past due 90 days or more at December 31, 2020 were a group of similar loans that were deemed to be low risk and almost all of these loans were brought current in January 2021. Acquired nonperforming loans increased $2.4 million from December 31, 2020. The increase in the acquired nonperforming loan balances was due to an increase in nonaccrual loans of $4.3 million, offset by a decline in restructured nonaccrual loans of $2.0 million. 

At March 31, 2021, OREO totaled $11.5 million, which included $0.5 million in non-acquired OREO and $11.0 million in acquired OREO. Total OREO decreased $443,000 from December 31, 2020. At March 31, 2021, non-acquired OREO consisted of 4 properties with an average value of $122,000. This compared to 7 properties with an average value of $79,000 at December 31, 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, we added 2 new properties into non-acquired OREO with an aggregate value of $299,000 and we sold 5 properties with an aggregate value of $362,000. On the properties sold we recorded a net gain of $19,000. At March 31, 2021, acquired OREO consisted of 37 properties with an average value of $297,000. This compared to 35 properties with an average value of $325,000 at December 31, 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, we added 12 new properties into acquired OREO with an aggregate value of $1.3 million and sold 10 properties with an aggregate value of $1.3 million during the current quarter. On the properties sold, we recorded a net gain of $356,000. 

&#8203; 

Nonperforming assets have been reduced by former bank property held for sale. Prior to the merger with CSFL, the Company included this information in nonperforming assets but is now reported as a separate item on the balance sheet. All periods have been reclassified to reflect this change . 

&#8203; 

&#8203; 

Potential Problem Loans 

&#8203; 

Potential problem loans, which are not included in nonperforming loans, related to non-acquired loans were approximately $3.2 million, or 0.02%, of total non-acquired loans outstanding, at March 31, 2021, compared to $5.9 million, or 0.05%, of total non-acquired loans outstanding, at December 31, 2020. Potential problem loans related to acquired loans totaled $13.0 million, or 0.12%, of total acquired loans outstanding, at March 31, 2021, compared to $13.4 million, or 0.11% of total acquired loans outstanding, at December 31, 2020. All potential problem loans represent those loans where information about possible credit problems of the borrowers has caused Management to have serious concern about the borrower&#8217;s ability to comply with present repayment terms. 

&#8203; 

Interest-Bearing Liabilities 

&#8203; 

Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits, CDs, other time deposits, federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings. Interest-bearing transaction accounts include NOW, HSA, IOLTA, and Market Rate checking accounts. 

&#8203; 

Total deposits increased $1.7 billion or 23.1% annualized to $32.4 billion at March 31, 2021 from $30.7 billion at December 31, 2020. We continue to focus on increasing core deposits (excluding certificates of deposits and other time deposits), which increased $2.0 billion in the first quarter of 2021 as these funds are normally lower cost funds. Federal funds purchased related to the correspondent bank division and repurchase agreements were $878.8 million at March 31, 2021 up $98.9 million from December 31, 2020. Some key highlights are outlined below: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Interest-bearing deposits increased $657.1 million to $21.6 billion at March 31, 2021 from the period end balance at December 31, 2020 of $21.0 billion. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $620.5 million to $21.1 billion from the quarter ended December 31, 2020 to the quarter ended March 31, 2021. The increase from December 31, 2020 was driven by an increase in interest-bearing transactional accounts including money 

&#160; 

markets of $713.2 million, and savings of $212.7 million, partially offset by a decline in certificate of deposits of $268.9 million. &#8203; 

Noninterest-Bearing Deposits 

&#8203; 

Noninterest-bearing deposits are transaction accounts that provide our Bank with &#8220;interest-free&#8221; sources of funds. At March 31, 2021, the period end balance of noninterest-bearing deposits was $10.8 billion, which increased from the December 31, 2020 balance by $1.1 billion. We continue to focus on increasing the noninterest-bearing deposits to try and limit our funding costs. This increase was also partially driven by the federal government stimulus programs in the first quarter 2021 which pushed funds into the economy. 

&#8203; 

Capital Resources 

&#8203; 

Our ongoing capital requirements have been met primarily through retained earnings, less the payment of cash dividends. As of March 31, 2021, shareholders&#8217; equity was $4.7 billion, an increase of $71.9 million, or 1.5%, from December 31, 2020. The change from year-end was mainly attributable to the increase in equity through net income less dividends paid and a decline in the unrealized gain (loss) in investment securities available for sale. The following table shows the changes in shareholders&#8217; equity during 2021.

In June 2019, our Board of Directors announced the authorization for the repurchase of up to an additional 2,000,000 shares of our common stock under our 2019 Repurchase Program. Through December 31, 2020 we had repurchased 1,485,000 of the shares authorized. In January 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the authorization of a new 3,500,000 share Company stock repurchase plan (the &#8220;New Repurchase Program&#8221;), which replaced in its entirety the revised 2019 Repurchase Program. Our Board of Directors approved the new plan after considering, among other things, our liquidity needs and capital resources as well as the estimated current value of our net assets. The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of the purchases are based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of cash balances, general business conditions, regulatory requirements, the market price of our common stock, and the availability of alternative investment opportunities. As of March 31, 2021, we have not repurchased any shares of the 3,500,000 shares authorized for repurchase under the New Repurchase Program. 

&#8203; 

We are subject to regulations with respect to certain risk-based capital ratios. These risk-based capital ratios measure the relationship of capital to a combination of balance sheet and off-balance sheet risks. The values of both balance sheet and off-balance sheet items are adjusted based on the rules to reflect categorical credit risk. In addition to the risk-based capital ratios, the regulatory agencies have also established a leverage ratio for assessing capital adequacy. The leverage ratio is equal to Tier 1 capital divided by total consolidated on-balance sheet assets (minus amounts deducted from Tier 1 capital). The leverage ratio does not involve assigning risk weights to assets. 

&#8203; 

Specifically, we are required to maintain the following minimum capital ratios:

&#8203; 

&#9679; a CET1, risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%; 

&#9679; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%; 

&#9679; a total risk-based capital ratio of 8%; and

&#9679; a leverage ratio of 4%.

Under the current capital rules, Tier 1 capital includes two components: CET1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. The highest form of capital, CET1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, otherwise referred to as AOCI, and limited amounts of minority 

&#160; 

interests that are in the form of common stock. Additional Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, Tier 1 minority interests and grandfathered trust preferred securities (as discussed below). Tier 2 capital generally includes the allowance for loan losses up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, qualifying preferred stock, subordinated debt and qualifying tier 2 minority interests, less any deductions in Tier 2 instruments of an unconsolidated financial institution. Cumulative perpetual preferred stock is included only in Tier 2 capital, except that the capital rules permit bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in total consolidated assets to continue to include trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued before May 19, 2010 in Tier 1 Capital (but not in CET1 capital), subject to certain restrictions. With the merger with CSFL during the second quarter of 2020, the Company&#8217;s $115.0 million in trust preferred securities no longer qualifies for Tier 1 capital and is now only included in Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital calculations. AOCI is presumptively included in CET1 capital and often would operate to reduce this category of capital. When the current capital rules were first implemented, the Bank exercised its one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of AOCI, allowing us to retain our pre-existing treatment for AOCI. 

In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a banking organization must maintain a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity, but the buffer applies to all three risk-based measurements (CET1, Tier 1 capital and total capital), resulting in the following effective minimum capital plus capital conservation buffer ratios: (i) a CET1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%.

The Bank is also subject to the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, which identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized) and is based on specified thresholds for each of the three risk-based regulatory capital ratios (CET1, Tier 1 capital and total capital) and for the leverage ratio.

&#8203; 

The federal banking agencies revised their regulatory capital rules to (i) address the implementation of CECL&#894; (ii) provide an optional three-year phase-in period for the day 1 adverse regulatory capital effects that banking organizations are expected to experience upon adopting CECL&#894; and (iii) require the use of CECL in stress tests beginning with the 2020 capital planning and stress testing cycle for certain banking organizations that are subject to stress testing. CECL became effective for us on January 1, 2020 and the Company applied the provisions of the standard using the modified retrospective method as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. Related to the implementation of ASU 2016-13, we recorded additional allowance for credit losses for loans of $54.4 million, deferred tax assets of $12.6 million, an additional reserve for unfunded commitments of $6.4 million and an adjustment to retained earnings of $44.8 million. Instead of recognizing the effects on regulatory capital from ASU 2016-13 at adoption, the Company initially elected the option for recognizing the adoption date effects on the Company&#8217;s regulatory capital calculations over a three-year phase-in. 

&#8203; 

In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule for additional transitional relief to regulatory capital related to the impact of the adoption of CECL. The final rule provides banking organizations that adopt CECL in the 2020 calendar year with the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by the aforementioned three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of benefit during the initial two-year delay for a total five-year transition. The estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital (modified CECL transitional amount) is calculated as the sum of the day-one impact on retained earnings upon adoption of CECL (CECL transitional amount) and the calculated change in the ACL relative to the day-one ACL upon adoption of CECL multiplied by a scaling factor of 25%. The scaling factor is used to approximate the difference in the ACL under CECL relative to the incurred loss methodology. The modified CECL transitional amount will be calculated each quarter for the first two years of the five-year transition. The amount of the modified CECL transition amount will be fixed as of December 31, 2021, and that amount will be subject to the three-year phase out. The Company chose the five-year transition method and is deferring the recognition of the effects from day 1 and the CECL difference for the first two years of application.

All of the Company&#8217;s and Bank&#8217;s regulatory capital ratios increased compared to December 31, 2020. For the Tier 1 leverage ratio, the percentage increase in Tier 1 risk-based capital was greater than the percentage increase in the average assets for regulatory capital purposes for the Tier 1 leverage ratio at both the holding company and bank. The increase in Tier 1 risk-based capital was driven by net income during the quarter. For the common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and the total risk-based capital ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital both increased during the first quarter of 2021 while total risk-based assets declined during the quarter at both the holding company and bank. The increase in capital for these ratios was driven by net income during the quarter while the decline in risk-based assets was mainly driven by a decline in our current exposure within derivatives related to back to back swaps due to the increase in interest rates. Our capital ratios are currently well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; regulatory classification. 

&#8203; 

On April 28, 2021, the Company announced it received approval from its Board of Directors to redeem $25.0 million of Subordinated Note and $38.5 million of Trust Preferred Securities as outlined in the table below. The Company also received regulatory approval from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta to redeem the Subordinated Note and Trust Preferred Securities. The redemption of the Subordinated Note and Trust Preferred Securities will result in a reduction of Tier 2 capital of $63.5 million during the second quarter 2021. 

&#8203; 

Liquidity 

&#8203; 

Liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our financial obligations, which arise primarily from the withdrawal of deposits, extension of credit and payment of operating expenses. Our Asset/Liability Management Committee (&#8220;ALCO&#8221;) is charged with monitoring liquidity management policies, which are designed to ensure acceptable composition of asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management. We have employed our funds in a manner to provide liquidity from both assets and liabilities sufficient to meet our cash needs. 

&#8203; 

Asset liquidity is maintained by the maturity structure of loans, investment securities and other short-term investments. Management has policies and procedures governing the length of time to maturity on loans and investments. Normally, changes in the earning asset mix are of a longer-term nature and are not utilized for day-to-day corporate liquidity needs. 

&#8203; 

Our liabilities provide liquidity on a day-to-day basis. Daily liquidity needs are met from deposit levels or from our use of federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term borrowings. We engage in routine activities to retain deposits intended to enhance our liquidity position. These routine activities include various measures, such as the following: 

&#8203; 

&#9679; Emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers, where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with our Bank; &#9679; Pricing deposits, including certificates of deposit, at rate levels that will attract and/or retain balances of deposits that will enhance our Bank&#8217;s asset/liability management and net interest margin requirements; and 

&#160; 

&#9679; Continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or enhance our Bank&#8217;s appeal as a primary provider of financial services. &#8203; 

Our non-acquired loan portfolio increased by approximately $1.1 billion, or approximately 35.9% annualized, compared to the balance at December 31, 2020. Of the increase from December 31, 2020, $343.7 million was related to the net increase in PPP loans during the three months ended March 31, 2021. Excluding PPP loans, the non-acquired loan portfolio increased by $744.0 million, or 24.6% annualized from December 31, 2020. The acquired loan portfolio decreased by $1.3 billion from the balance at December 31, 2020 through principal paydowns, charge-offs, foreclosures and renewals of acquired loans. This included a reduction in acquired PPP loans of $331.3 million. 

Our investment securities portfolio increased $820.6 million compared to the balance at December 31, 2020. The increase in investment securities from December 31, 2020 was a result of purchases of $1.1 billion. This increase was partially offset by maturities, calls, sales and paydowns of investment securities totaling $234.5 million as well as declines in the market value of the available for sale investment securities portfolio of $63.8 million. Net amortization of premiums were $9.4 million in the first three months of 2021. The increase in investment securities was due to the Company making the strategic decision to increase the size of the portfolio with the excess funds from deposit growth. Total cash and cash equivalents were $6.0 billion at March 31, 2021 as compared to $4.6 billion at December 31, 2020 as deposits grew $1.7 billion during the first quarter of 2021. 

&#8203; 

At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we had $475.0 million and $600.0 million of traditional, out&#8211;of-market brokered deposits. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we had $700.1 million and $611.1 million, respectively, of reciprocal brokered deposits. Total deposits were $32.4 billion at March 31, 2021, an increase of $1.7 billion from $30.7 billion at December 31, 2020. Our deposit growth since December 31, 2020 included an increase in demand deposit accounts of $1.1 billion, an increase in savings and money market accounts of $512.4 million and an increase in interest-bearing transaction accounts of $413.5 million partially offset by a decline in certificates of deposit of $268.9 million. Total borrowings at March 31,2021 were $390.3 and consisted of trust preferred and subordinated debt. Of this amount, $11.0 million of the subordinated debt matured in April 2021 and paid off. Total short-term borrowings at March 31, 2021 were $878.6 million, consisting of $479.3 million in federal funds purchased and $399.3 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase. To the extent that we employ other types of non-deposit funding sources, typically to accommodate retail and correspondent customers, we continue to take in shorter maturities of such funds. Our current approach may provide an opportunity to sustain a low funding rate or possibly lower our cost of funds but could also increase our cost of funds if interest rates rise. 

&#8203; 

Our ongoing philosophy is to remain in a liquid position, taking into account our current composition of earning assets, asset quality, capital position, and operating results. Our liquid earning assets include federal funds sold, balances at the Federal Reserve Bank, reverse repurchase agreements, and/or other short-term investments. Cyclical and other economic trends and conditions can disrupt our Bank&#8217;s desired liquidity position at any time. We expect that these conditions would generally be of a short-term nature. Under such circumstances, our Bank&#8217;s federal funds sold position and any balances at the Federal Reserve Bank serve as the primary sources of immediate liquidity. At March 31, 2021, our Bank had total federal funds credit lines of $325.0 million with no balance outstanding. If additional liquidity were needed, the Bank would turn to short-term borrowings as an alternative immediate funding source and would consider other appropriate actions such as promotions to increase core deposits or the sale of a portion of our investment portfolio. At March 31, 2021, our Bank had $1.2 billion of credit available at the Federal Reserve Bank&#8217;s Discount Window and had no balance outstanding. In addition, we could draw on additional alternative immediate funding sources from lines of credit extended to us from our correspondent banks and/or the FHLB. At March 31, 2021, our Bank had a total FHLB credit facility of $2.9 billion with total outstanding FHLB letters of credit consuming $12.2 million leaving $2.9 billion in availability on the FHLB credit facility. The holding company has a $100.0 million unsecured line of credit with no outstanding advances at March 31, 2021. We believe that our liquidity position continues to be adequate and readily available. 

&#8203; 

Our contingency funding plans incorporate several potential stages based on liquidity levels. Also, we review on at least an annual basis our liquidity position and our contingency funding plans with our principal banking regulator. We maintain various wholesale sources of funding. If our deposit retention efforts were to be unsuccessful, we would utilize these alternative sources of funding. Under such circumstances, depending on the external source of funds, our interest cost would vary based on the range of interest rates we are charged. This could increase our cost of funds, impacting net interest margins and net interest spreads. 

&#160; 

Deposit and Loan Concentrations 

&#8203; 

We have no material concentration of deposits from any single customer or group of customers. We have no significant portion of our loans concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries. Furthermore, we attempt to avoid making loans that, in an aggregate amount, exceed 10% of total loans to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities. As of March 31, 2021, there were no aggregated loan concentrations of this type. We do not believe there are any material seasonal factors that would have a material adverse effect on us. We do not have any foreign loans or deposits. 

&#8203; 

Concentration of Credit Risk 

&#8203; 

We consider concentrations of credit to exist when, pursuant to regulatory guidelines, the amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by general economic conditions represents 25% of total Tier 1 capital plus regulatory adjusted allowance for loan losses of the Company, or $853.7 million at March 31, 2021. Based on this criteria, we had six such credit concentrations at March 31, 2021, including loans on hotels and motels of $974.4 million, loans to lessors of nonresidential buildings (except mini-warehouses) of $4.0 billion, loans secured by owner occupied office buildings of $904.1 million, loans secured by owner occupied nonresidential buildings (excluding office buildings) of $2.1 billion, loans to lessors of residential buildings (investment properties and multi-family) of $1.3 billion and loans secured by 1 st mortgage 1-4 family owner occupied residential property (including home equity lines) of $4.0 billion. The risk for these loans and for all loans is managed collectively through the use of credit underwriting practices developed and updated over time. The loss estimate for these loans is determined using our standard ACL methodology. 

With some financial institutions adopting CECL in the first quarter of 2020, banking regulators established new guidelines for calculating credit concentrations. Banking regulators set the guidelines for construction, land development and other land loans to total less than 100% of total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL (CDL concentration ratio) and for total commercial real estate loans (construction, land development and other land loans along with other non-owner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans) to total less than 300% of total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL (CRE concentration ratio). Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the Bank&#8217;s total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Bank&#8217;s CDL concentration ratio was 52.6% and 54.1%, respectively, and its CRE concentration ratio was 223.7% and 229.5%, respectively. As of March 31, 2021, the Bank was below the established regulatory guidelines. When a bank&#8217;s ratios are in excess of one or both of these loan concentration ratios guidelines, banking regulators generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank Management. Therefore, we monitor these two ratios as part of our concentration management processes.

R econciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP 

&#8203; 

The return on average tangible equity is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the effect of the average balance of intangible assets and adds back the after-tax amortization of intangibles to GAAP basis net income. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional information that is useful to investors in evaluating our performance and capital and may facilitate comparisons with other institutions in the banking industry as well as period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as promulgated under GAAP, and investors should consider South State&#8217;s performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of South State. Non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, are not audited, and may not be comparable to other similarly titled financial measures used by other companies. Investors should not consider non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of South State&#8217;s results or financial condition as reported under GAAP.
