 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following is a discussion of our financial condition at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 and our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. The purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from our consolidated financial statements. The following discussion and analysis should be read along with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein and the risk factors discussed elsewhere in this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (Form 10-K) and the other reports we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission since we filed that Form 10-K. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "Pinnacle Financial," "we," "our," or similar terms refer to Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc. and, where appropriate, its subsidiaries. 

Overview 

General. Our diluted net income per common share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $1.69 and $5.99, respectively, compared to $1.91 and $5.42, respectively, for the same periods in 2022. At September 30, 2023, loans increased to $31.9 billion as compared to $29.0 billion at December 31, 2022, and total deposits increased to $38.3 billion at September 30, 2023 from $35.0 billion at December 31, 2022. 

Results of Operations. Our net interest income increased to $317.2 million and $944.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $305.8 million and $809.8 million, respectively, for the same periods in the prior year, representing an increase of $11.5 million, or 3.7%, and $135.1 million, or 16.7%, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 when compared to the comparable periods in 2022, this increase was largely the result of organic loan growth and yield expansion in our earning asset portfolio. Partially offsetting the increase in net interest income were continued increases in cost of funds compared to the prior year's comparable periods and increased levels of on-balance sheet liquidity incurred in the first half of 2023 due to macroeconomic uncertainty. The net interest margin (the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 3.06% and 3.22%, respectively, compared to 3.47% and 3.18%, respectively, for the same periods in 2022 and reflects the rising short-term interest rate environment and the impact of increased liquidity, as well as the competitive rate environments for loans and deposits in our markets. 

Our provision for credit losses was $26.8 million and $77.3 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $27.5 million and $43.1 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2022. The change in provision expense for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same periods in 2022 is primarily the result of net charge-offs totaling $18.1 million and $35.2 million, respectively, compared to $11.0 million and $14.8 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2022. Also contributing to provision expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 is growth in the loan portfolio as well as the continued uncertainty in the economic environment which impacts the projected macroeconomic factors used in our CECL modeling. 

Noninterest income decreased by $14.0 million, or 13.4%, and increased by $20.4 million, or 6.1%, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the increase is largely due to the $85.7 million gain on the sale of fixed assets we recognized as a result of the sale-leaseback transaction that was completed in the second quarter of 2023. Wealth management revenues were $22.8 million and $69.3 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $19.4 million and $61.9 million, respectively, in the same periods in the prior year and also contributed to increased levels of noninterest income. These increases were offset in part by a decline in income from our equity method investment in BHG of $16.4 million, or 39.6%, and $53.5 million, or 43.0%, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 from the same periods in the prior year. Also offsetting the increases were $9.7 million and $19.7 million in net losses on the sale of investment securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to $217,000 and $156,000 in net gains on the sale of investment securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. 

Noninterest expense increased by $14.0 million, or 7.0%, and $58.6 million, or 10.1%, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Impacting noninterest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same prior year periods was an increase of $434,000 and $20.1 million, respectively, in salaries and employee benefits. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was primarily the result of an increase in our associate base to 3,329.5 full-time equivalent associates at September 30, 2023 versus 3,184.5 at September 30, 2022, as well as annual merit increases effective in January 2023. Offsetting a portion of the increase in salaries and benefits expense was a decline in cash and equity incentives which were $12.2 million and $23.5 million, respectively, lower in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 than in the same prior year periods. Noninterest expense categories, other than salaries and employee benefits, were $82.9 million and $238.1 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared 

to $69.3 million and $199.6 million, respectively, during three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, an increase of 19.5% and 19.3%, respectively. These increases are largely due to equipment and occupancy costs of $36.9 million and $101.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $27.9 million and $80.3 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Equipment and occupancy costs were negatively impacted by higher levels of lease expenses as a result of the execution of the sale-leaseback transaction during the second quarter of 2023 along with the overall growth in the infrastructure of the firm, additional locations added and new technology implemented in the last twelve months. 

Our efficiency ratio (the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income) was 52.3% and 49.0%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to 48.5% and 50.5%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. The efficiency ratio measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue. Our efficiency ratio deteriorated slightly during the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 as a result of a decrease in noninterest income and an increase in noninterest expense. The improvement in our efficiency ratio during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 when compared to the same period in 2022 was largely the result of higher levels of net interest income and noninterest income (including as a result of the sale-leaseback transaction) during the 2023 period offset in part by increased levels of noninterest expense in 2023. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded income tax expense of $35.4 million and $118.0 million, respectively, compared to $35.2 million and $99.7 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 21.1% and 20.2%, respectively, compared to 19.1% for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Our tax rate in each period was impacted by, among other things, the vesting and exercise of equity-based awards previously granted under our equity-based compensation program. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized tax expense of $16,000 and excess tax benefits of $241,000, respectively, in connection with the vesting and exercise of such equity-based awards. For the three months ended September 30, 2022, no excess tax benefits or expenses were recognized. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recognized excess tax benefits of $2.9 million. 

Financial Condition. Loans increased $2.9 billion, or 10.0%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 when compared to December 31, 2022. The increase is primarily the result of loans made to borrowers that principally operate or are located in our core markets, including the markets in which we recently expanded, increases in the number of relationship advisors we employ and continued focus on attracting new customers to our company. Loan growth was also positively impacted during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 by the continued growth of certain specialty lending groups, including franchise lending and equipment lease financing as well as our strategic market expansions. We have made the intentional decision to continue the tightening of our underwriting, particularly in construction and CRE investment property, during the remainder of 2023 and expect our loan growth rates over such period to reflect this tightening. Total deposits were $38.3 billion at September 30, 2023 compared to $35.0 billion at December 31, 2022, an increase of $3.3 billion, or 9.5%. Interest-bearing core deposit growth during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, increased approximately $3.8 billion, or 17.7%, from December 31, 2022, as a result of our intentional focus on gathering and retaining these core deposits. 

At September 30, 2023, our allowance for credit losses was $346.2 million compared to $300.7 million at December 31, 2022. The increase in the allowance for credit losses is largely the result of net chargeoffs, growth in the loan portfolio and the continued uncertainty in the economic environment which impacts the projected macroeconomic factors used in our CECL modeling. 

Capital and Liquidity. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our capital ratios, including our bank's capital ratios, exceeded regulatory minimum capital requirements and those necessary to be considered well-capitalized under applicable federal regulations. See Note 11. Regulatory Matters in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Form 10-Q) for additional information regarding our capital ratios. From time to time we may be required to support the capital needs of our bank (Pinnacle Bank). At September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately $179.1 million of cash that could be used to support our bank. We believe we have various capital raising techniques available to us to provide for the capital needs of our company and bank, such as issuing subordinated debt or entering into a revolving credit facility with a financial institution. We also periodically evaluate capital markets conditions to identify opportunities to access those markets if necessary or prudent to support our capital levels. 

On January 17, 2023, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $125.0 million of our common stock which commenced upon the expiration of the previously authorized share repurchase program that expired on March 31, 2023. The new authorization is to remain in effect through March 31, 2024. We did not repurchase any shares under either share repurchase program during 2023 or 2022.

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income. Net interest income represents the amount by which interest earned on various interest-earning assets exceeds interest paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities and is the most significant component of our revenues. Net interest income totaled $317.2 million and $944.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $305.8 million and $809.8 million, respectively, for the same periods in the prior year, representing an increase of $11.5 million and 

$135.0 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, when compared to the comparable periods in 2022, this increase was largely the result of organic loan growth and yield expansion in our earning asset portfolio. Partially offsetting the increases in interest income were continued increases in our cost of funds in 2023 as compared to 2022 and the effects of increased on-balance sheet liquidity in 2023. 

The following tables set forth the amount of our average balances, interest income or interest expense for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the average interest rate for interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, net interest spread and net interest margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 (dollars in thousands):

The tax-exempt benefit has been reduced by the projected impact of tax-exempt income that will be disallowed pursuant to IRS Regulations as of and for the then current period presented. 

(3) Yields realized on interest-bearing assets less the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest spread calculation excludes the impact of demand deposits. Had the impact of demand deposits been included, the net interest spread for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 would have been 3.11% compared to a net interest spread of 3.16% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. 

(4) Net interest margin is the result of annualized net interest income calculated on a tax-equivalent basis divided by average interest-earning assets for the period. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, our net interest margin was 3.06% and 3.22%, respectively, compared to 3.47% and 3.18%, respectively, for the same periods in 2022. Our net interest margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflects the rising short-term interest rate environment as well as the competitive rate environments for loans and deposits in our markets and the impact of the increased on-balance sheet liquidity we incurred in the first half of 2023, and substantially maintained through the third quarter, of 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, our earning asset yield increased by 175 and 211 basis points, respectively, from the same periods in the prior year. Conversely, our total funding rates, led by increases in interest-bearing deposits rates, increased by 226 and 216 basis points, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in the prior year. Thus far in 2023, the Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates by 125 basis points. During the first half of 2023, we intentionally increased our on-balance sheet liquidity as a response to the then current macroeconomic environment and the failures of multiple high-profile financial institutions. If we maintain higher levels of on-balance sheet liquidity as we anticipate through the end of 2023, our net interest margin would likely be negatively impacted even if the additional liquidity has minimal effect on net interest income as we sought to match the rate we are paying on this additional liquidity with the yield we are earning on the investments of those proceeds. We seek to fund increased loan volumes by growing our core deposits, but, subject to internal policy limits on the amount of non-core funding we may maintain, will utilize non-core funding to fund shortfalls, if any. To the extent that our dependence on non-core funding sources increases our net interest margin would likely be negatively impacted as we may not be able to reduce the rates we pay on these deposits as quickly as we can on core deposits should rates begin to decline. 

We continue to deploy various asset liability management strategies to manage our risk to interest rate fluctuations. Our &#8216;most likely&#8217; forecast for short-term rates through 2024 is mostly consistent with the federal funds futures market&#8217;s expectations for rate movements. However, there is much uncertainty in the interest rate futures markets due to the persistent elevated levels of inflation present in the economy, the pace of the rate tightening cycle being led by the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee and what risks these present for a recession to occur in the near and medium term. 

Provision for Credit Losses. The provision for credit losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for credit losses that, in management's evaluation, is adequate to provide coverage for all expected credit losses. Our provision for credit losses was $26.8 million and $77.3 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $27.5 million and $43.1 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2022. The provision for credit losses is impacted by growth in our loan portfolio, recent historical and projected future economic conditions, our internal assessment of the credit quality of the loan portfolio and net charge-offs. The change in provision expense for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same periods in 2022 is primarily the result of net charge-offs totaling $18.1 million and $35.2 million, respectively, compared to $11.0 million and $14.8 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2022. Also contributing to provision expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 is growth in the loan portfolio as well as the continued uncertainty in the economic environment which impacts the projected macroeconomic factors used in our CECL modeling. 

Noninterest Income. &#160; Our noninterest income is composed of several components, some of which vary significantly between quarterly and annual periods. Service charges on deposit accounts and other noninterest income generally reflect customer growth trends, while fees from our wealth management departments, gains on mortgage loans sold, gains and losses on the sale of securities and gains and losses on the sale of fixed assets or losses related to our efforts to mitigate risks associated with interest rate volatility will often reflect financial market conditions or our asset/liability management efforts and fluctuate from period to period. 

The following is a summary of our noninterest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands): 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 - 2022 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 - 2022 &#160; 2023 2022 Increase (Decrease) 2023 2022 Increase (Decrease) Noninterest income: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Service charges on deposit accounts $ 12,665 $ 10,906 16.1% $ 36,563 $ 33,552 9.0% Investment services 13,253 10,780 22.9% 39,022 34,676 12.5% Insurance sales commissions 2,882 2,928 (1.6)% 10,598 9,518 11.3% Gains on mortgage loans sold, net 2,012 1,117 80.1% 5,632 7,333 (23.2)% Investment gains (losses) on sales of securities, net (9,727) 217 &#62;(100%) (19,688) 156 &#62;(100%) Trust fees 6,640 5,706 16.4% 19,696 17,744 11.0% Income from equity method investment 24,967 41,341 (39.6)% 70,970 124,461 (43.0)% Gain on sale of fixed assets 87 227 (61.7)% 85,946 425 &#62;100% 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 - 2022 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 - 2022 &#160; 2023 2022 Increase (Decrease) 2023 2022 Increase (Decrease) Other noninterest income: Interchange and other consumer fees 18,156 17,642 2.9% 52,222 51,488 1.4% Bank-owned life insurance 5,822 5,658 2.9% 17,132 15,418 11.1% Loan swap fees 1,461 1,187 23.1% 5,443 4,629 17.6% SBA loan sales 725 1,576 (54.0)% 2,897 6,234 (53.5)% Income from other equity investments 5,837 725 &#62;100% 9,511 9,104 4.5% Other noninterest income 6,017 4,795 25.5% 18,221 19,065 (4.4)% Total other noninterest income 38,018 31,583 20.4% 105,426 105,938 (0.5)% Total noninterest income $ 90,797 $ 104,805 (13.4)% $ 354,165 $ 333,803 6.1% 

The increase in service charges on deposit accounts during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 is the result of increased transaction volumes in commercial checking accounts which we believe is the result of the increased economic activity in our markets in each of the periods presented, offset in part by the impact of our decision in the second half of 2022 to eliminate or reduce certain of the fees we charge on overdrawn accounts or when accounts lack sufficient funds to cover presented items among other changes to these practices. 

Income from our wealth management groups (investments, insurance and trust) is also included in noninterest income and has fluctuated during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due in large part to market volatility. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, commissions and fees from investment services at our financial advisory unit, Pinnacle Asset Management, a division of Pinnacle Bank, and fees from our wealth advisory group, PNFP Capital Markets, Inc., increased by approximately $2.5 million and $4.3 million, respectively, when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, Pinnacle Asset Management was receiving commissions and fees in connection with approximately $9.0 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively, in brokerage assets. Revenues from the sale of insurance products by our insurance subsidiaries for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 decreased by $46,000 and increased by $1.1 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. Included in insurance revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $1.7 million of contingent income that was recorded in the period but based on 2022 sales production and claims experience compared to $1.4 million recorded in the same period in the prior year that was based on 2021 sales production. Additionally, at September 30, 2023 our trust department was receiving fees on approximately $5.0 billion of managed assets compared to $4.2 billion at September 30, 2022. We believe the improvement in the results of our wealth management businesses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 when compared to the comparable periods in 2022 is primarily attributable to an increased number of wealth management advisors and corresponding client acquisition. 

Gains on mortgage loans sold, net, consists of fees from the origination and sale of mortgage loans. These mortgage fees are for loans primarily originated in our current markets that are subsequently sold to third-party investors. Substantially all of these loan sales transfer servicing rights to the buyer. Generally, mortgage origination fees increase in lower interest rate environments and more robust housing markets and decrease in rising or higher interest rate environments and more challenging housing markets. Mortgage origination fees will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as the rate environment changes. Gains on mortgage loans sold, net, were $2.0 million and $5.6 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $1.1 million and $7.3 million, respectively, for the same periods in the prior year. The year-over-year decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is the direct result of the increases in the rate environment negatively impacting both refinancing and new purchase originations. We hedge a portion of our mortgage pipeline as part of a mandatory delivery program whereby the hedge protects against changes in the fair value of the pipeline. The hedge is not designated as a hedge for U.S. GAAP purposes and, as such, changes in its fair value are recorded directly through the income statement. The change in the fair value of the outstanding mortgage pipeline at the end of any reporting period will directly impact the amount of gain recorded for mortgage loans held for sale during that reporting period. At September 30, 2023, the mortgage pipeline included $81.6 million in loans expected to close in 2023 compared to $74.7 million in loans at September 30, 2022 expected to close in 2022. 

Gains on the sale of fixed assets were $87,000 and $85.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $227,000 and $425,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in gains on the sale of fixed assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily the result of the sale-leaseback transaction which was completed in the second quarter of 2023 and included a combined 49 properties for which Pinnacle Bank will separately lease each of those properties for an initial term of 14.5 years, with two five (5) year renewal options that may be exercise 

to extend the term of any of the leases. The pre-tax, net gain recorded associated with the sale of these 49 properties was $85.7 million, after deducting transaction-related expenses. 

Investment gains and losses on sales, net, represent the net gains and losses on sales of investment securities in our available-for-sale securities portfolio during the periods noted. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we sold $129.6 million and $303.1 million, respectively, of securities for net losses of $9.7 million and $19.7 million compared to sales of $26.6 million and $29.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, of securities for net gains of $217,000 and $156,000, respectively. For any securities classified as available-for-sale that are in an unrealized loss position at the balance sheet date, we assess whether or not we intend to sell the security, or more likely than not will be required to sell the security, before recovery of its amortized cost basis which would require a write-down to fair value through net income. Because we currently do not intend to sell those available-for-sale securities that have an unrealized loss at September 30, 2023, and it is not more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, we have determined that no write-down is necessary. 

The proceeds of the sale-leaseback transaction and above-noted securities sales have been retained in Pinnacle Bank's cash accounts at the Federal Reserve, where we currently anticipate they will remain at least through the end of 2023. 

Income from equity-method investment. Income from equity-method investment is comprised solely of income from our 49% equity-method investment in BHG. Prior to September 30, 2022, we held a portion of this investment at Pinnacle Financial and a portion at Pinnacle Bank. Effective September 30, 2022, Pinnacle Financial contributed 100% of the equity interests of BHG owned by it to Pinnacle Bank. BHG is engaged in the origination of commercial and consumer loans largely to healthcare providers and other skilled professionals throughout the United States. The loans originated by BHG are either financed by secured borrowings or sold to independent financial institutions and investors. 

Income from this equity-method investment was $25.0 million and $71.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $41.3 million and $124.5 million, respectively, for the same periods last year. As more fully described below, the decrease in income from BHG during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same periods in the prior year is largely the result of increases in (i) the liability for estimated future inherent losses for the outstanding core portfolio of loans sold to banks through the auction platform that may be subject to future substitution due to payment default or prepayment and (ii) the allowance for loan losses for loans BHG has retained on its balance sheet due to the uncertain economic environment. Historically, BHG has sold the majority of the loans it originates to a network of bank purchasers through a combination of online auctions, direct sales and its direct purchase option. In recent years, BHG began an effort to retain more loans on its balance sheet. BHG&#8217;s decision to sell loans through its auction platform (or, recently, directly to institutional investors) or retain loans on its balance sheet will be impacted by a variety of factors, including interest rates as well as demand levels from the community bank network of buyers and institutional buyers to whom BHG markets these loans. In a rising rate environment, BHG may choose to sell more loans if the cost of financing loans on its balance sheet is not as attractive as a sale, either directly, such as during the second and third quarters of 2023 when BHG sold loans totaling approximately $550 million and $400 million, respectively, to asset managers, or through its auction platform. Since 2020, BHG has completed seven securitizations totaling $2.4 billion, with the latest securitization of $265 million having been completed in the first quarter of 2023. BHG also entered into funding facilities in the fourth quarter of 2022 and first quarter of 2023 including a facility with a U.S. asset manager with outstanding balances of $560 million and $454 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and an annualized interest rate at September 30, 2023 of approximately 7.90%. These facilities, which are secured by loans on BHG's balance sheet, represent incremental funding sources to BHG. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2023, BHG recorded several expenses related to the write down of a building that BHG anticipates selling as well as certain software assets and other items that were related to business lines that BHG has elected to exit. These charges amounted to approximately $10.0 million during the third quarter of 2023. 

Income from equity-method investment is recorded net of amortization expense associated with customer lists and other intangible assets associated with Pinnacle Bank's investment in BHG of $88,000 and $262,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $128,000 and $384,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. At September 30, 2023, there wer e $6.1 million of th ese intangible assets that are expected to be amortized in lesser amounts over the next 12 years. Also included in income from equity-method investment is accretion income associated with the fair valuation of certain of BHG's liabilities of $43,000 and $183,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $164,000 and $595,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. At September 30, 2023, there were $300,000 of these liabilities that are expected to accrete into income in lesser amounts over the next three years. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, Pinnacle Bank received dividends of $5.6 million and $33.2 million, respectively, from BHG compared to $18.6 million and $59.4 million, respectively, received by Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank in the aggregate during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Dividends from BHG during such periods reduced the carrying amount of our investment in BHG, while earnings from BHG during such periods increased the carrying amount of our investment in BHG. Profits from intercompany transactions are eliminated. Our proportionate share of earnings from BHG is included in our consolidated tax return. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, Pinnacle Bank purchased no loans from 

BHG compared to loan purchases of $49.6 million and $125.6 million, respectively, from BHG during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were $283.6 million and $350.6 million, respectively, of BHG joint venture program loans held by Pinnacle Bank. These loans were purchased at par from BHG by Pinnacle Bank and whereby BHG and Pinnacle Bank share proportionately in the credit risk of the acquired loans based on the rate on the loan and the rate of the purchase. The yield on this portfolio to Pinnacle Bank is anticipated to be between 4.50% and 6.00% per annum. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, BHG reported $311.3 million and $924.6 million, respectively, in revenues, net of substitution and prepayment losses of $52.4 million and $194.7 million, respectively, compared to revenues of $293.4 million and $830.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, net of substitution and prepayment losses of $49.3 million and $148.2 million, respectively. Earnings from BHG are likely to fluctuate from period-to-period. Approximately $147.9 million and $451.0 million, respectively, or 47.5% and 48.8%, respectively, of BHG's revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to gains on the sale of commercial and consumer loans compared to $167.6 million and $505.6 million, respectively, or 57.1% and 60.9%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. These loans have typically been sold by BHG with no recourse to a network of community banks and other financial institutions at a premium to the par value of the loan, although the purchaser may access a BHG cash reserve account of up to 3% of the loan balance to support loan payments. BHG retains no servicing or other responsibilities related to the core product loan once sold. As a result, this gain on sale premium represents BHG's compensation for absorbing the costs to originate the loan as well as marketing expenses associated with maintaining its business model. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, there were $6.4 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively, of these loans previously sold by BHG that were being actively serviced by the purchasing banks. BHG, at its sole option, may also provide purchasers of these loans the ability to substitute the acquired loan with another more recently-issued BHG loan should the previously-acquired loan become at least 90-days past due as to its monthly payments. As a result, BHG maintained a liability as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 of $350.3 million and $270.3 million, respectively, that represents an estimate of the future inherent losses for the outstanding core portfolio that may be subject to future substitution due to payment default or prepayment. This liability represents 5.5% and 5.3%, respectively, of core product loans previously sold by BHG that remain outstanding as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in this liability as a percentage of core product loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the comparable period ended September 30, 2022 was principally the result of an increase in the amount of loans sold by BHG to financial institutions and increases in BHG management's estimate of future substitution losses due to economic uncertainty. 

In addition to these loans that BHG sells into its auction market or directly to institutional investors, at September 30, 2023, BHG reported loans that remained on BHG's balance sheet totaling $3.6 billion compared to $3.3 billion as of September 30, 2022. A portion of these loans do not qualify for sale accounting and accordingly an offsetting secured borrowing liability has been recorded. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, BHG had $2.8 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, of secured borrowings associated with loans held for investment. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, BHG reported allowance for loan losses totaling $213.5 million and $101.3 million, respectively, with respect to the loans on its balance sheet. The increase in allowance for loan losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was principally the result of growth in the balance sheet loan portfolio and the uncertain economic environment. We anticipate that BHG will increase the level of allowance for loan losses for the remainder of 2023 given the current macroeconomic environment and BHG's adoption of CECL. Prior to October 1, 2023, BHG recorded its allowance for loan losses under the incurred loss method, but adopted CECL effective October 1, 2023. Interest income and fees associated with these on-balance sheet loans amounted to $142.2 million and $428.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $116.3 million and $297.6 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. 

Included in our other noninterest income are interchange and other consumer fees, gains from bank-owned life insurance, swap fees earned for the facilitation of derivative transactions for our clients, SBA loan sales, gains or losses on other equity investments and other noninterest income items. Interchange revenues increased 2.9% and 1.4%, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same periods in 2022 as a result of increases in debit and credit card usage during these periods. Loan swap fees increased $274,000 and $814,000, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same periods in 2022. The increase in swap fees is due primarily to recent hires and an emphasis on rate swaps due to the current interest rate environment. Other noninterest income included changes in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance which was $5.8 million and $17.1 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $5.7 million and $15.4 million, respectively, in the same periods in the prior year. The assets that support these policies are administered by the life insurance carriers and the income we recognize (i.e., increases or decreases in the cash surrender value of the policies) on these policies is dependent upon the crediting rates applied by the insurance carriers, which are subject to change at the discretion of the carriers, subject to any applicable floors. Earnings on these policies generally are not taxable. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we purchased an additional $100 million of bank-owned life insurance. No additional purchases have been made thus far in 2023. SBA loan sales are included in other noninterest income and decreased by $851,000 and $3.3 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 when compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to the changing market conditions during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared 

to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 as the increase in interest rates has caused qualification for the program to be more difficult and therefore the program has become less attractive to clients and prospects. Additionally, the carrying values of other equity investments are adjusted either upwards or downwards from the transaction price to reflect expected exit values as evidenced by financing and sale transactions with third parties, or when determination of a valuation adjustment is confirmed through financial reports provided by the portfolio managers of the investment. Income related to these investments increased $5.1 million and $407,000, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 when compared to the same periods in the prior year. The year-over-year increase for the three month period is primarily the result of the increased valuation of a solar equity investment during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The other components of other noninterest income increased $1.2 million and decreased $844,000, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decrease during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is largely the result of recording a $5.5 million gain during the three months ended March 31, 2022 on remeasurement of our previously held equity investment in JB&#38;B, resulting from our bank subsidiary's acquisition on March 1, 2022 of the 80% equity interests of JB&#38;B it did not previously own offset by a $2.3 million decrease in losses on CRA investment and $1.1 million increases in both gains on life insurance claims and gains on the sale of other assets. 

Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense consists of salaries and employee benefits, equipment and occupancy expenses, other real estate expenses and other operating expenses. The following is a summary of our noninterest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands): 

&#160; Three Months Ended September 30, 2023-2022 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023-2022 &#160; 2023 2022 Increase (Decrease) 2023 2022 Increase (Decrease) Noninterest expense: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Salaries and employee benefits: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Salaries and commissions $ 91,421 $ 80,964 12.9% $ 269,144 $ 233,086 15.5% Cash and equity incentives 18,520 30,747 (39.8%) 64,944 88,449 (26.6%) Employee benefits and other 20,403 18,199 12.1% 64,407 56,838 13.3% Total salaries and employee benefits 130,344 129,910 0.3% 398,495 378,373 5.3% Equipment and occupancy 36,900 27,886 32.3% 100,959 80,343 25.7% Other real estate expense, net 33 (90) &#62;100% 190 101 88.1% Marketing and other business development 5,479 4,958 10.5% 17,085 13,494 26.6% Postage and supplies 2,621 2,795 (6.2%) 8,303 7,486 10.9% Amortization of intangibles 1,765 1,951 (9.5%) 5,339 5,873 (9.1%) Other noninterest expense: Deposit related expense 14,138 6,689 &#62;100% 36,158 21,062 71.7% Lending related expense 12,508 13,224 (5.4%) 37,165 39,063 (4.9%) Wealth management related expense 734 590 24.4% 2,239 1,843 21.5% Other noninterest expense 8,711 11,340 (23.2%) 30,668 30,314 1.2% Total other noninterest expense 36,091 31,843 13.3% 106,230 92,282 15.1% Total noninterest expense $ 213,233 $ 199,253 7.0% $ 636,601 $ 577,952 10.1% 

Total salaries and employee benefits expenses increased $434,000 and $20.1 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. The change in salaries and employee benefits was largely the result of an increase in our associate base in 2023 versus 2022 as well as annual merit increases effective in January 2023, partially offset by a reduction in cash and equity incentive costs. Our associate base increased to 3,329.5 full-time equivalent associates at September 30, 2023 from 3,184.5 at September 30, 2022. We expect total salary and benefit expenses for the year-ended 2023 to increase when compared to the comparable period in 2022 as we continue our focus on hiring experienced bankers in all of our markets during the fourth quarter, though cash and equity incentive costs are likely to decrease when compared to the comparative period in 2022 as a result of our expected performance. 

We believe that cash and equity incentives are a valuable tool in motivating an associate base that is focused on providing our clients effective financial advice and increasing shareholder value. As a result, and unlike many other financial institutions, all of our bank's non-commissioned associates participate in our annual cash incentive plan with a minimum targeted bonus equal to 10% of each associate's annual salary, and all of our bank's associates participate in our equity compensation plans. Under the 2023 annual cash incentive plan, the targeted level of incentive payments requires achievement of a certain soundness threshold and a targeted level of 

annual earnings per common share and annual revenues (subject to certain adjustments). To the extent that the soundness threshold is met and earnings per common share and revenues are above or below the targeted amount, the aggregate incentive payments are increased or decreased. Historically, we have paid between 0% and 125% of our targeted incentives. For 2023, our annual incentive plan provides for maximum payouts of up to 125% of target. 

Cash incentive expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled $8.4 million and $35.4 million, respectively, compared to $20.1 million and $57.6 million, respectively, during the same prior year periods due to our assumption at the end of the third quarter of 2023 that we would likely achieve a below target payout percentage in 2023 which would be lower than what we paid out under our 2022 plan. 

Also included in cash and equity incentives for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were approximately $4.2 million and $12.5 million, respectively, of compensation expenses related to equity-based restricted share awards compared to $3.6 million and $10.8 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 as well as approximately $5.9 million and $17.1 million, respectively, of compensation expenses related to equity-based restricted share units with either time-based or performance-based vesting criteria compared to $7.1 million and $20.1 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. We have not issued stock options since 2008. Under our equity incentive plans, we provide a broad-based equity incentive program for all of our bank's associates, a significant percentage of which is performance-based for our senior executive officers. The decrease in equity-based incentive expense in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 when compared to the comparable periods in 2022 is also the result of managements' assumption at the end of the third quarter of 2023 that we would likely achieve a lower percentage payout on the restricted stock units with performance-based vesting criteria in 2023 than was achieved in 2022. We believe that equity incentives provide a vehicle for all associates to become meaningful shareholders of Pinnacle Financial over an extended period of time and create a shareholder-centric culture throughout our organization. 

Employee benefits and other expenses include costs associated with our 401k plan, health insurance, payroll taxes and contract labor. These expenses increased by $2.2 million and $7.6 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same prior year periods. These increases reflect the increase in our associate base in the respective periods, and in the case of our health insurance costs, increases in the premiums we paid for this coverage in 2023 compared to 2022 premium levels. 

Equipment and occupancy expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were $36.9 million and $101.0 million, respectively, compared to $27.9 million and $80.3 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increases are in part the result of the eight new offices that have opened since the end of the second quarter of 2022 as well as the initial impact of increased rent expense associated with the properties involved in the sale-leaseback transaction we completed during the second quarter 2023. 

Additionally, we expect to incur costs in future periods as we enhance our established locations across the franchise and further develop our technology infrastructure. During 2021, we announced our intention to move our corporate headquarters to an office tower under construction in Nashville, where we will be a founding partner and sponsor of the project. This move is currently planned for 2025. We expect our equipment and occupancy costs will increase as we plan for this move. 

Marketing and business development expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $5.5 million and $17.1 million, respectively, compared to $5.0 million and $13.5 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. The primary source of the increase for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same periods in 2022 is the result of increased and intentional associate engagement events during 2023. We expect these costs to rise modestly during the remainder of 2023 taking into account anticipated increases associated with the associates we have hired in the last twelve months. 

Intangible amortization expense was $1.8 million and $5.3 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $2.0 million and $5.9 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2022. The following table outlines our amortizing intangible assets, their initial valuation and amortizable lives at September 30, 2023: 

&#160; Year acquired Initial Valuation &#160;(in millions) Amortizable Life (in years) Remaining Value (in millions) Core Deposit Intangible: &#160; &#160; &#160; Avenue 2016 $ 8.8 9 $ 0.3 BNC 2017 48.1 10 13.3 Book of Business Intangible: &#160; &#160; &#160; Miller Loughry Beach Insurance 2008 $ 1.3 20 $ 0.1 CapitalMark 2015 0.3 16 0.1 BNC Insurance 2017 0.4 20 0.2

These assets are being amortized on an accelerated basis which reflects the anticipated life of the underlying assets. Annual amortization expense of these intangibles is estimated to decrease from $6.5 million to $1.2 million per year over the next five years with lesser amounts for the remaining amortization period. 

Other noninterest expenses, which consists primarily of deposit, lending, wealth management and administrative expenses increased by $4.2 million and $13.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Lending related expense decreased by $716,000 and $1.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 when compared to the same periods in the prior year. This decrease is primarily the result of decreased expense associated with our commercial credit card programs for which transaction volumes also decreased in the period. Deposit related expense increased by $7.4 million and $15.1 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 when compared to the same periods in 2022 due primarily to increases in FDIC insurance assessments as well as operational costs associated with increased deposit volumes during the period. Additionally, we are anticipating an FDIC deposit insurance assessment to rebuild the deposit insurance fund following the failures of multiple high-profile financial institutions in early 2023 will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023. Wealth management related expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 grew $144,000 and $396,000, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2022. Other noninterest expenses decreased $2.6 million and increased $354,000, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same periods in 2022 due in part to reductions in consultant and legal fees offset by increased contributions and other miscellaneous expense items. 

Our efficiency ratio (the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income) was 52.3% and 49.0%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to 48.5% and 50.5%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Our efficiency ratio deteriorated slightly during the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 as a result of a decrease in noninterest income and an increase in noninterest expense. The improvement in our efficiency ratio during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 when compared to the same period in 2022 was largely the result of higher levels of net interest income and noninterest income (including as a result of the sale-leaseback transaction) during the 2023 period offset in part by increased levels of noninterest expense in 2023. 

Income Taxes. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded income tax expense of $35.4 million and $118.0 million, respectively, compared to $35.2 million and $99.7 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 21.1% and 20.2%, respectively, compared to 19.1% for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Our effective tax rate differs from the combined federal and state income tax statutory rate in effect of 25.00% at September 30, 2023 and 26.14% at September 30, 2022 primarily due to our investments in bank-qualified municipal securities, tax benefits from our real estate investment trust subsidiary, participation in Tennessee's Community Investment Tax Credit (CITC) program, tax benefits associated with share-based compensation, bank-owned life insurance and our captive insurance subsidiary, offset in part by the limitation on deductibility of meals and entertainment expense, non-deductible FDIC insurance premiums and non-deductible executive compensation. Our tax rate in each period was also impacted by the vesting and exercise of equity-based awards previously granted under our equity-based compensation program. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized tax expense of $16,000 and excess tax benefits of $241,000, respectively, related to the vesting and exercise of equity-based awards. For the three months ended September 30, 2022, no excess tax benefits or expenses were recognized. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recognized excess tax benefits of $2.9 million. 

Financial Condition 

Our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2023 reflects an increase in total loans outstanding to $31.9 billion compared to $29.0 billion at December 31, 2022. Total deposits increased by $3.3 billion to $38.3 billion between December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023. Total assets were $47.5 billion at September 30, 2023 compared to $42.0 billion at December 31, 2022. 

Loans. The composition of loans at September 30, 2023 and at December 31, 2022 and the percentage (%) of each classification to total loans are summarized as follows (in thousands): &#160; September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 &#160; Amount Percent Amount Percent Commercial real estate: Owner occupied $ 3,944,616 12.4 % $ 3,587,257 12.3 % Non-owner occupied 7,447,610 23.3 % 6,542,619 22.5 % Consumer real estate &#8211; mortgage 4,768,780 14.9 % 4,435,046 15.3 % Construction and land development 3,942,143 12.3 % 3,679,498 12.7 % Commercial and industrial 11,307,611 35.4 % 10,241,362 35.3 % Consumer and other 532,524 1.7 % 555,823 1.9 % Total loans $ 31,943,284 100.0 % $ 29,041,605 100.0 % 

At September 30, 2023, our loan portfolio composition had changed slightly from the composition at December 31, 2022 with commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending generally continuing to make up the largest segments of our portfolio. At September 30, 2023, approximately 34.6% of the outstanding principal balance of our commercial real estate loans was secured by owner occupied commercial real estate properties compared to 35.4% at December 31, 2022. Owner occupied commercial real estate is similar in many ways to our commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses on the basis of the cash flows of the business rather than on the valuation of the real estate. Additionally, the construction and land development loan segment continues to be a meaningful portion of our portfolio and reflects the development and growth of the local communities in which we operate and is diversified between commercial, residential and land. 

Lending Concentrations. We periodically analyze our loan portfolio to determine if a concentration of credit risk exists to any one or more industries. We use broadly accepted industry classification systems in order to classify borrowers into various industry classifications. We have a credit exposure (loans outstanding plus unfunded commitments) exceeding 25% of Pinnacle Bank's total risk-based capital to borrowers in the following industries at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (in thousands): 

&#160; September 30, 2023 &#160; &#160; Outstanding Principal Balances Unfunded Commitments Total exposure Total Exposure at December 31, 2022 Lessors of nonresidential buildings $ 4,672,499 $ 1,545,847 $ 6,218,346 $ 7,058,045 Lessors of residential buildings 1,793,549 1,296,827 3,090,376 3,725,186 New Housing For-Sale Builders 547,566 918,711 1,466,277 1,763,089 Music Publishers 744,947 477,077 1,222,024 1,127,636 

Banking regulations have established guidelines for the construction ratio of less than 100% of total risk-based capital and for the non-owner occupied ratio of less than 300% of total risk-based capital. Should a bank&#8217;s ratios be in excess of these guidelines, banking regulations generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management. Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by Pinnacle Bank&#8217;s total risk-based capital. At September 30, 2023, Pinnacle Bank&#8217;s construction and land development loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital were 83.1% compared to 85.9% at December 31, 2022. Construction and land development, non-owner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital were 256.4% and 249.6% as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. At September 30, 2023, Pinnacle Bank was within the 100% and 300% guidelines and has established what it believes to be appropriate controls to monitor and regulate its lending in these areas as it aims to keep the level of these loans to below the 100% and 300% thresholds. 

The following table presents the maturity distribution of our loan portfolio by loan segment at September 30, 2023 according to contractual maturities of (1) one year or less, (2) after one but within five years, (3) after five but within fifteen years and (4) after fifteen years. The table also presents the portion of loans by loan segment that have fixed interest rates or variable interest rates that fluctuate over the life of the loans in accordance with changes in an interest rate index (dollars in thousands):

The above information does not consider the impact of scheduled principal payments. Loans totaling $1.4 billion at their contractual floor rate at September 30, 2023 are presented as fixed interest rate loans in the table above. 

Loans in Past Due Status. The following table is a summary of our loans that were past due at least 30 days but less than 89 days and 90 days or more past due as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (in thousands): 

&#160; September 30, December 31, Loans past due 30 to 89 days: 2023 2022 Commercial real estate: Owner occupied $ 3,420 $ 2,727 Non-owner occupied 214 407 Consumer real estate &#8211; mortgage 20,287 13,718 Construction and land development 381 323 Commercial and industrial 19,410 29,170 Consumer and other 5,496 5,744 Total loans past due 30 to 89 days $ 49,208 $ 52,089 Loans past due 90 days or more: &#160; Commercial real estate: Owner occupied $ 4,947 $ 1,139 Non-owner occupied 153 1,681 Consumer real estate &#8211; mortgage 9,767 9,094 Construction and land development &#8212; 130 Commercial and industrial 18,012 9,428 Consumer and other 1,361 746 Total loans past due 90 days or more $ 34,240 $ 22,218 Ratios: &#160; Loans past due 30 to 89 days as a percentage of total loans 0.15 % 0.18 % Loans past due 90 days or more as a percentage of total loans 0.11 % 0.08 % Total loans in past due status as a percentage of total loans 0.26 % 0.26 % 

Potential Problem Loans. Potential problem loans, which are not included in nonperforming assets, amounted to approximately $134.5 million, or 0.4% of total loans at September 30, 2023, compared to $53.8 million, or 0.2% of total loans at December 31, 2022. The majority of the increase was attributable to risk rating downgrades in the non-owner occupied commercial real estate and 

commercial and industrial portfolios. Potential problem loans represent those loans with a well-defined weakness and where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have doubts about the borrower's ability to comply with present repayment terms. This definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by Pinnacle Bank's primary regulators, for loans classified as substandard, or worse, but not considered nonperforming loans. None of the potential problem loans were past due at least 30 days but less than 90 days as of September 30, 2023. 

Nonperforming Assets and Modified Loans. At September 30, 2023, we had $46.0 million in nonperforming assets compared to $46.1 million at December 31, 2022. Included in nonperforming assets were $43.0 million in nonaccrual loans and $3.0 million in OREO and other nonperforming assets at September 30, 2023 and $38.1 million in nonaccrual loans and $8.0 million in OREO and other nonperforming assets at December 31, 2022. At September 30, 2023, there were $33.4 million of modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, all of which were accruing as of the modification date and remain on accrual status. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans (ACL). On January 1, 2020, we adopted FASB ASU 2016-13, which introduced the current expected credit losses (CECL) methodology and required us to estimate all expected credit losses over the remaining life of our loan portfolio. Accordingly, the ACL represents an amount that, in management's evaluation, is adequate to provide coverage for all expected future credit losses on outstanding loans. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our ACL was approximately $346.2 million and $300.7 million, respectively, which our management believed to be adequate at each of the respective dates. Our ACL as a percentage of total loans was 1.08% at September 30, 2023 compared to 1.04% at December 31, 2022. During the second quarter of 2023, we implemented updated CECL models in an effort to ensure that risk in our portfolio at an individual loan level continues to be adequately captured given the uncertain state of the economy. The implementation of the new model had no material effect on the overall allowance for credit losses in the quarter of implementation. 

Our CECL models rely largely on recent historical and projected future macroeconomic conditions to estimate future credit losses. Macroeconomic factors used in the model include the unadjusted and seasonally adjusted national unemployment rate, GDP, commercial property price index, consumer credit, commercial real estate price index, household debt ratio, household financial obligations ratio, and certain home price indices. Projections of these macroeconomic factors, obtained from an independent third party, are utilized to predict quarterly rates of default. 

CECL methodology requires the allowance for credit losses to be measured on a collective basis for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics, and for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with the collectively evaluated pools, evaluations are performed on an individual basis. 

Losses are predicted over a period of time determined to be reasonable and supportable, and at the end of the reasonable and supportable period losses are reverted to long term historical averages. At September 30, 2023, a reasonable and supportable period of eighteen months, as compared to twenty-four months at December 31, 2022, was utilized for all loan segments followed by a twelve month straight line reversion period to long term averages. The change in the reasonable and supportable period is supported by the continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and, as such, an uncertainty in projected forecasted macroeconomic variables utilized in our CECL models. 

The following table sets forth, based on management's estimate, the allocation of the allowance for credit losses on loans to categories of loans and loan balances by category and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans and allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans within each loan category as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (in thousands):

Pinnacle Financial's management assesses the adequacy of the ACL on a quarterly basis. This assessment includes procedures to estimate the ACL and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance. The level of the ACL is based upon management's evaluation of historical default and loss experience, current and projected economic conditions, asset quality trends, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers' ability to repay the loan (including the timing of future payments), the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors, including regulatory recommendations. The ACL is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries of amounts previously charged-off. 

Based upon our evaluation of the loan portfolio, we believe the ACL to be adequate to absorb our estimate of expected future credit losses on loans outstanding at September 30, 2023. While our policies and procedures used to estimate the ACL as well as the resultant provision for credit losses charged to operations are considered adequate by management, they are necessarily approximate and imprecise. There are factors beyond our control, such as conditions in the local and national economy, local real estate markets or a particular industry or borrower which may negatively impact, materially, our asset quality and the adequacy of our ACL and, thus, the resulting provision for credit losses. 

Investments. Our investment securities portfolio, consisting primarily of U.S. Treasury securities, Federal agency bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and state and municipal securities, amounted to $6.9 billion and $6.6 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Our investment portfolio serves many purposes including serving as a stable source of income, as collateral for public funds deposits and as a potential liquidity source. A summary of our investment portfolio at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 follows: 

&#160; September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Weighted average life 12.01 years 11.62 years Effective duration* 4.41% 4.39% Tax equivalent yield 3.81% 3.19% 

(*) The metric is presented net of fair value hedges tied to certain investment portfolio holdings. The effective duration of the investment portfolio without the fair value hedges as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was 7.68% and 6.07%, respectively. 

Restricted Cash. Our restricted cash balances totaled approximately $17.4 million at September 30, 2023 compared to $31.4 million at December 31, 2022. This restricted cash is maintained at other financial institutions as collateral primarily for our derivative portfolio. The decrease in restricted cash is attributable primarily to a decrease in collateral requirements on certain derivative instruments for which the fair value has increased. See Note 9. Derivative Instruments in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 

Securities Purchased with Agreement to Resell. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had $500.0 million and $513.3 million, respectively, in securities purchased with agreement to resell. This balance is the result of repurchase agreement transactions with financial institution counterparties. We initially secured these investments to allow us to deploy some of our excess liquidity position into instruments that improved the return on funds in the then current historically low interest rate environment. The current repurchase agreements are set to mature in 2026. 

Deposits and Other Borrowings. We had approximately $38.3 billion of deposits at September 30, 2023 compared to $35.0 billion at December 31, 2022. Our deposits consist of noninterest and interest-bearing demand accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and time deposits. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we estimate that we had approximately $11.1 billion and $15.7 billion, respectively, in uninsured deposits, which are the portion of deposit accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limit. Included in our uninsured deposits at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we estimate that we had approximately $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, in deposits which are collateralized. We routinely enter into agreements with certain customers to sell certain securities under agreements to repurchase the security the following day. These agreements (which are typically associated with comprehensive treasury management programs for our clients and provide them with short-term returns for their excess funds) amounted to $196.0 million at September 30, 2023 and $194.9 million at December 31, 2022. Additionally, at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Pinnacle Bank had borrowed $2.1 billion and $464.4 million, respectively, in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (FHLB). The increase in FHLB advances during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was the result of our decision in the first half of 2023 to increase our levels of on-balance sheet liquidity in response to the current economic environment and its impact on the banking sector following the failures of multiple high-profile banking institutions. At September 30, 2023, Pinnacle Bank had approximately $3.0 billion in additional availability with the FHLB; however, incremental borrowings are subject to applicable collateral requirements and are made in a formal request by Pinnacle Bank and the subsequent approval by the FHLB. 

Generally, we have classified our funding base as either core funding or noncore funding as shown in the table below. The following table represents the balances of our deposits and other funding, the average rate paid for each type and the percentage of each type to the total at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (in thousands): 

September 30, 2023 Average Rate Paid Percent December 31, 2022 Average Rate Paid Percent Core funding: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Noninterest-bearing deposit accounts $ 8,324,325 0.00% 20.3% $ 9,812,744 0.00% 27.2% Interest-bearing demand accounts 4,958,270 3.27% 12.1% 5,699,981 0.80% 15.8% Savings and money market accounts 10,028,089 3.23% 24.4% 10,743,225 0.74% 29.8% Time deposit accounts less than $250,000 1,974,921 3.77% 4.8% 1,458,206 0.85% 4.0% Reciprocating deposits (1)

(1) The reciprocating categories consists of time and money market deposits we receive from a bank network (the IntraFi network) in connection with deposits of our customers in excess of our FDIC coverage limit that we place with the IntraFi network. Regulatory guidance defines reciprocating deposits in a portfolio of a bank of our size over and above $5.0 billion as non-core funding. However, we have witnessed no distinction in the behavior of the deposits in our portfolio over and above $5.0 billion versus the deposits up to $5.0 billion. Therefore, we have included the entire portfolio of reciprocating deposits in the table above as core funding. 

As noted in the table above, our core funding as a percentage of total funding declined moving from 86.8% at December 31, 2022 to 81.9% at September 30, 2023 but remained above internal policies. We created and implemented several deposit gathering initiatives in 2022 in anticipation of the more challenging deposit gathering environment. We remain optimistic that we will be able to grow our levels of core funding as needed to fund our balance sheet in a sound manner, though during the first nine months of 2023, in response to the current macroeconomic environment, we elected to increase our levels of on-balance sheet liquidity. This increase was funded by a combination of increased core deposits, increased FHLB advances and increases in brokered deposits. When wholesale funding is necessary to complement the company's core deposit base, management determines which source is best suited to address both liquidity risk management and interest rate risk management objectives. Our Asset Liability Management Policy imposes limitations on overall wholesale funding reliance and on brokered deposit exposure specifically. Both our overall reliance on wholesale funding and exposure to brokered deposits and brokered time deposits were within those policy limitations as of September 30, 2023. 

The amount of time deposits as of September 30, 2023 amounted to $4.8 billion. The following table shows our time deposits in denominations of less than $250,000 and in denominations of $250,000 and greater by category based on time remaining until maturity and the weighted average rate for each category as of September 30, 2023 (in thousands):

Subordinated debt and other borrowings. Pinnacle Bank receives advances from the FHLB pursuant to the terms of various borrowing agreements which assist it in the funding of its home mortgage and commercial real estate loan portfolios. Under the borrowing agreements with the FHLB, Pinnacle Bank has pledged certain qualifying residential mortgage loans and, pursuant to a blanket lien, all qualifying commercial mortgage loans as collateral. At September 30, 2023, Pinnacle Bank had received advances from the FHLB totaling $2.1 billion up from $464.4 million at December 31, 2022. At September 30, 2023, the scheduled maturities of FHLB advances and interest rates are as follows (in thousands):

We have established, or through acquisition acquired, twelve statutory business trusts which were established to issue 30-year trust preferred securities and certain other subordinated debt agreements. From time to time we, or our bank subsidiary, have issued subordinated notes to enhance our capital positions. These trust-preferred securities and subordinated notes qualify as Tier 2 capital subject to annual phase outs beginning five years from maturity. These instruments are outlined below (in thousands):

Capital Resources. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our shareholders' equity amounted to $5.8 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our capital ratios, including our bank's capital ratios, exceeded regulatory minimum capital requirements and those necessary to be considered well-capitalized under applicable federal regulations. See Note 11. Regulatory Matters in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our capital ratios. From time to time we may be required to support the capital needs of our bank (Pinnacle Bank). At September 30, 2023, we had approximately $179.1 million of cash at the parent company that could be used to support our bank. We believe we have various capital raising techniques available to us to provide for the capital needs of our company and bank, such as issuing subordinated debt or entering into a revolving credit facility with a financial institution. We also periodically evaluate capital markets conditions to identify opportunities to access those markets if necessary or prudent to support our capital levels. 

Share Repurchase Program. On January 17, 2023, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $125.0 million of our common stock which commenced upon the expiration of the share repurchase program that expired on March 31, 2023. The new authorization is to remain in effect through March 31, 2024. We did not repurchase any shares under either share repurchase program during 2023 or 2022, respectively. 

Dividends. Pursuant to Tennessee banking law, our bank may not, without the prior consent of the Commissioner of the TDFI, pay any dividends to us in a calendar year in excess of the total of our bank's retained net profits for that year plus the retained net profits for the preceding two years, which was $1.3 billion at September 30, 2023. Additionally, approval by regulatory authorities is required if the effect of dividends declared would cause the regulatory capital of Pinnacle Bank to fall below specified minimum levels. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the bank paid dividends of $79.5 million to us which is within the limits allowed by banking regulations. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we paid $17.2 million and $51.6 million, respectively, in dividends to our common shareholders and $3.8 million and $11.4 million, respectively, in dividends on our Series B Preferred Stock. On October 17, 2023, our board of directors declared a $0.22 per share quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders which should approximate $17.2 million in aggregate dividend payments that are expected to be paid on November 24, 2023 to common shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 3, 2023. Additionally, on that same day, our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of approximately $3.8 million, or $16.88 per share (or $0.422 per depositary share), on the Series B Preferred Stock payable on December 1, 2023 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 16, 2023. The amount and timing of all future dividend payments, if any, is subject to board discretion and will depend on our earnings, capital position, financial condition and other factors, including, if necessary, our receipt of dividends from Pinnacle Bank, regulatory capital requirements, as they become 

known to us and receipt of any regulatory approvals that may become required as a result of our and our bank subsidiary's financial results. 

Market and Liquidity Risk Management 

Our objective is to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. Our Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) is charged with the responsibility of monitoring these policies, which are designed to ensure acceptable composition of asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management. 

Interest Rate Sensitivity . In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates. ALCO measures and evaluates the interest rate risk so that we can meet customer demands for various types of loans and deposits. ALCO determines the most appropriate amounts of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items. Measurements which we use to help us manage interest rate sensitivity include an earnings simulation model and an economic value of equity (EVE) model. 

Our interest rate sensitivity modeling incorporates a number of assumptions for both earnings simulation and EVE, including loan and deposit re-pricing characteristics, the rate of loan prepayments, etc. ALCO periodically reviews these assumptions for accuracy based on historical data and future expectations. Our ALCO policy requires that the base scenario assumes rates remain flat and is the scenario to which all others are compared in order to measure the change in net interest income and EVE. Policy limits are applied to the results of certain modeling scenarios. While the primary policy scenarios focus is on a twelve month time frame for the earnings simulations model, longer time horizons are also modeled. All policy scenarios assume a static volume forecast where the balance sheet is held constant, although other scenarios are modeled. 

There were several noteworthy factors when comparing the results of both the earnings simulation and the economic value of equity modeling results as of September 30, 2023 to the modeling results as of September 30, 2022: 

&#8226; The Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy with 225 basis points of Fed Funds rate increases since September 30, 2022. 

&#8226; Our deposit mix shifted as evidenced by a drop in our non-interest bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits dropping from 31.4% to 21.7%. 

&#8226; We entered into $850 million of receive-fixed interest rate swaps on our wholesale funding portfolio. 

Earnings simulation model. We believe interest rate risk is best measured by our earnings simulation modeling. Earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are combined with forecasts of interest rates for the next 12 months and are combined with other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations over that same 12-month period. To limit interest rate risk, we have policy guidelines for our earnings at risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in both gradual and instantaneous changes to interest rates. For instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates from management's baseline interest rate forecast over the next twelve months, assuming a static balance sheet, the following estimated changes are calculated: 

Estimated % Change in Net Interest Income Over 12 Months 

Sept. 30, 2023* Sept. 30, 2022* 

Instantaneous Rate Change 

300 bps increase 

5.9% 3.3% 

200 bps increase 

4.4% 1.7% 

100 bps increase 

2.4% 0.6% 

100 bps decrease 

(2.4)% (2.9)% 

200 bps decrease 

(3.8)% (6.8)% 

300 bps decrease 

(5.5)% (14.8)% 

*: Negative interest rates are not contemplated in these scenarios. The Treasury curve and all short-term rate indices, such as Fed Funds, SOFR, etc., are assumed to be zero bound. 

While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Further, the earnings simulation model does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, hedging activities we might take and changing product spreads that could mitigate any potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates. 

The behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios set out in the table above is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The projected impact on net interest income in the table above assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternative rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher-yielding deposits or market-based funding as we experienced in the first half of 2023 would reduce the assumed benefit of those deposits. The projected impact on net interest income in the table above also assumes a "through-the-cycle" non-maturity deposit beta which may not be an accurate predictor of actual deposit rate changes realized in scenarios of smaller and/or non-parallel interest rate movements. 

At September 30, 2023, our earnings simulation model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for all interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved Asset Liability Policy. 

Economic value of equity model. While earnings simulation modeling attempts to determine the impact of a changing rate environment to our net interest income, our EVE model measures estimated changes to the economic values of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, which establishes a base case EVE. We then shock rates as prescribed by our Asset Liability Policy and measure the sensitivity in EVE values for each of those shocked rate scenarios versus the base case. The Asset Liability Policy sets limits for those sensitivities. At September 30, 2023, our EVE modeling calculated the following estimated changes in EVE due to instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates: 

Sept. 30, 2023* 

Sept. 30, 2022* 

Instantaneous Rate Change 

300 bps increase 

(17.3)% (20.1)% 

200 bps increase 

(12.0)% (13.9)% 

100 bps increase 

(6.3)% (7.1)% 

100 bps decrease 

6.8% 4.9% 

200 bps decrease 

11.4% 2.1% 

300 bps decrease 

4.5% (1.6)% 

*: Negative interest rates are not contemplated in these scenarios. The Treasury curve and all short-term rate indices, such as Fed Funds, SOFR, etc., are assumed to be zero bound. Funds, LIBOR, etc., are assumed to be zed. 

While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, EVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, hedging activities we might take and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. 

At September 30, 2023, our EVE model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for all interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved Asset Liability Policy. 

Most likely earnings simulation models. We also analyze a most-likely earnings simulation scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on a forward yield curve adopted by management using expected balance sheet volumes forecasted by management. Separate growth assumptions are developed for loans, investments, deposits, etc. Other interest rate scenarios analyzed by management may include delayed rate shocks, yield curve steepening or flattening, or other variations in rate movements to further analyze or stress our balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios. Each scenario is evaluated by management. These processes assist management to better anticipate our financial results and, as a result, management may determine the need to invest in other operating strategies and tactics which might enhance results or better position the firm's balance sheet to reduce interest rate risk going forward. 

Each of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how our net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors) 

which limit changes in interest rates. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates. ALCO reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. 

Management's asset liability management model governance, implementation and validation processes and controls are subject to routine and ongoing review by our model risk management and internal audit groups as well as subject to routine regulatory examinations to ensure our asset liability management processes are in compliance with the most current regulatory guidelines and industry and regulatory practices. Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party asset liability modeling software to help ensure implementation of management's assumptions into the model are processed as intended in a robust manner. That said, there are numerous assumptions regarding financial instrument behavior that are integrated into the model. The assumptions are formulated by combining observations gleaned from our historical studies of financial instruments and our best estimations of how these instruments may behave in the future given changes in economic conditions, technology, etc. These assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, given the large number of assumptions built into our asset liability modeling software, it is difficult, at best, to compare our results to other firms. 

Some of the more critical assumptions built into the asset liability model are our behavioral assumptions for non-maturity deposits, including beta, decay and volatility assumptions. To support these assumptions, we have developed a proprietary non-maturity deposit model that formulates these assumptions. The assumptions are based on quantitative techniques with respect to historical time series of data of these non-maturity deposit instruments. The decay and beta assumptions are backtested on a monthly basis as part of our ongoing monitoring governance of this model. Should back testing reveal differences outside of tolerances between predicted versus actual behaviors, the model is modified but only after ALCO&#8217;s approval. Additionally, the volatility assessment of deposits is also a critical assumption. We have additional quantitative techniques applied in our non-maturity deposit model to each individual account monthly that determines the anticipated volatility of each deposit account. For all accounts that are deemed to exceed our volatility tolerances, these accounts are classified as non-stable, we assign a duration of 0% to them. This effectively disallows us from leveraging these as sources of funding for incremental fixed rate asset investment. While the likelihood of all of these deposits repricing simultaneously is extremely remote, this approach forces our EVE sensitivities to skew more liability sensitive. This reduces the likelihood that we would make excessive investments in assets whose value deteriorates beyond our tolerances as interest rates increase. 

ALCO may determine that Pinnacle Financial should over time become more or less asset or liability sensitive depending on the underlying balance sheet circumstances and our conclusions as to anticipated interest rate fluctuations in future periods. At present, ALCO has determined that its "most likely" rate scenario assumes no further increases in short-term interest rates from the Federal Reserve in 2023 after the latest 25 basis point increase on July 26, 2023. Our "most likely" rate forecast is based primarily on information we acquire from a service which includes a consensus forecast of numerous interest rate benchmarks. We may implement additional actions designed to achieve our desired sensitivity position which could change from time to time. 

We have in the past used, and may in the future continue to use, derivative financial instruments as one tool to manage our interest rate sensitivity, including in our mortgage lending program, while continuing to meet the credit and deposit needs of our customers. For further details on the derivatives we currently use, see Note 9. Derivative Instruments in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 

We may also enter into interest rate swaps to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs. These swaps qualify as derivatives, even though they are not designated as hedging instruments. 

Liquidity Risk Management . The purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure that there are sufficient cash flows to satisfy loan demand, deposit withdrawals, and our other needs. Traditional sources of liquidity for a bank include asset maturities and growth in core deposits. A bank may achieve its desired liquidity objectives from the management of its assets and liabilities and by internally generated funding through its operations. Funds invested in marketable instruments that can be readily sold and the continuous maturing of other earning assets are sources of liquidity from an asset perspective. The liability base provides sources of liquidity through attraction of increased deposits and borrowing funds from various other institutions. 

To assist in determining the adequacy of our liquidity, we perform a variety of liquidity stress tests including idiosyncratic, systemic and combined scenarios for both moderate and severe events. Liquidity is defined as the ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities. Liquidity management involves maintaining our ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of our customers, both depositors and borrowers. We seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid asset balance to ensure our ability to meet our obligations. The amount of the appropriate minimum liquid asset 

balance is determined through severe liquidity stress testing as measured by our liquidity coverage ratio calculation. At September 30, 2023, we were in compliance with our liquidity coverage ratio. 

Changes in interest rates also affect our liquidity position. We currently price deposits in response to market rates, and our management intends to continue this policy. If deposits are not priced in response to market rates, a loss of deposits could occur which would negatively affect our liquidity position. 

Scheduled loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds, but loan payoffs and deposit flows fluctuate significantly, being influenced by interest rates, general economic conditions and competition. Additionally, debt security investments are subject to prepayment and call provisions that could accelerate their payoff prior to stated maturity. Our financial advisors attempt to price our deposit products to meet our asset/liability objectives consistent with local market conditions. Our ALCO is responsible for monitoring our ongoing liquidity needs. Our regulators also monitor our liquidity and capital resources on a periodic basis. 

As noted previously, Pinnacle Bank is a member of the FHLB and, pursuant to a borrowing agreement with the FHLB, has pledged certain assets pursuant to a blanket lien. As such, Pinnacle Bank may use the FHLB as a source of liquidity depending on the firm's ALCO strategies. Additionally, we may pledge additional qualifying assets or reduce the amount of pledged assets with the FHLB to increase or decrease our borrowing capacity at the FHLB. At September 30, 2023, we believe we had an estimated $3.0 billion in additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB; however, incremental borrowings are made via a formal request by Pinnacle Bank and the subsequent approval by the FHLB. 

Pinnacle Bank also has accommodations with upstream correspondent banks for unsecured short-term advances which aggregate $155.0 million. These accommodations have various covenants related to their term and availability, and in most cases must be repaid within less than one month. There were no outstanding borrowings under these agreements at September 30, 2023, or during the three months then ended, although we test the availability of these accommodations periodically. Pinnacle Bank also had approximately $6.3 billion in available Federal Reserve discount window and the Federal Reserve's new Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) lines of credit at September 30, 2023. The BTFP is a new facility established in response to liquidity concerns within the banking industry following the failures of multiple high-profile financial institutions in the first half of 2023. The BTFP was designed to provide available additional funding to eligible depository institutions in order to help assure that banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors. Under the program, eligible depository institutions can obtain loans of up to one year in length by pledging U.S. Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, and other qualifying assets as collateral. These assets will be valued at par. 

At September 30, 2023, excluding reciprocating time and money market deposits issued through the IntraFiNetwork, we had approximately $3.1 billion in brokered deposits and $11.1 billion in uninsured deposits. Historically, we have issued brokered certificates through several different brokerage houses based on competitive bid. During the first nine months of 2023, and in response to the uncertainty resulting from the macroeconomic environment and the failure of multiple high-profile financial institutions, we intentionally increased our levels of on-balance sheet liquidity. This increase was funded by a combination of increased core deposits, increased borrowings from the FHLB, holding the proceeds from the recent sale-leaseback transaction and the sale of investment securities and increases in brokered time deposits. We intend to continue to prepay and/or let mature wholesale funding as core deposit levels allow. 

Banking regulators have defined additional liquidity guidelines, through the issuance of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Modified LCR. These regulatory guidelines became effective January 2015 with phase in over subsequent years and require these large institutions to follow prescriptive guidance in determining an absolute level of a high quality liquid asset (HQLA) buffer that must be maintained on their balance sheets in order to withstand a potential liquidity crisis event. Although Pinnacle Financial follows the principles outlined in the Interagency Policy Statement on Liquidity Risk Management, issued March 2010, to determine its HQLA buffer, Pinnacle Financial is not currently subject to these regulations. However, these formulas could eventually be imposed on smaller banks, such as Pinnacle Bank, and require an increase in the absolute level of liquidity on our balance sheet, which could result in lower net interest margins for us in future periods. 

At September 30, 2023, we had no individually significant commitments for capital expenditures. But, we believe the number of our locations, including non-branch locations, will increase over an extended period of time across our footprint, including the markets to which we have recently expanded, and that certain of our locations will be in need of required renovations. In future periods, these expansions and renovation projects may lead to additional equipment and occupancy expenses as well as related increases in salaries and benefits expense. Additionally, we expect we will continue to incur costs associated with planned technology improvements to enhance the infrastructure of our firm. 

Our short-term borrowings (borrowings which mature within the next fiscal year) consist primarily of securities sold under agreements to repurchase (these agreements are typically associated with comprehensive treasury management programs for our clients and provide them with short-term returns on their excess funds). 

We have certain contractual obligations as of September 30, 2023, which by their terms have a contractual maturity and termination dates subsequent to September 30, 2023. Each of these commitments is noted throughout Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis . Our management believes that we have adequate liquidity to meet all known contractual obligations and unfunded commitments, including loan commitments and reasonable borrower, depositor, and creditor requirements over the next twelve months and that we will have adequate liquidity to meet our obligations over a longer-term as well. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. At September 30, 2023, we had outstanding standby letters of credit of $326.8 million and unfunded loan commitments outstanding of $15.6 billion. Because these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and many will expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment level does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. If needed to fund these outstanding commitments, Pinnacle Bank has the ability to liquidate securities available-for-sale, or on a short-term basis to borrow and purchase federal funds from other financial institutions. 

We follow the same credit policies and underwriting practices when making these commitments as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. Each customer's creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis and the amount of collateral obtained, if any, is based on management's credit evaluation of the customer. However, should the commitments be drawn upon and should our customers default on their resulting obligation to us, our maximum exposure to credit loss, without consideration of collateral, is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. At September 30, 2023, we had accrued reserves of $21.5 million related to expected credit losses associated with off-balance sheet commitments.
